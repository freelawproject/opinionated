The surgery was performed by Anthony Tufaro, M.D., at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. As a result of that surgery, his lower lip purportedly \u201cdropped,\u201d and he now experiences numbness in his chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Appellant claims that Dr. Tufaro never disclosed the material risks of the surgery to him, and, based on that claim, he brought suit against appellee, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Inc. (\u201cJohns Hopkins\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Two consecutive trials ensued. After the first ended in a judgment in favor of appellant, a new trial was granted when appellant rejected a remittitur proposed by the circuit court. After the second trial ended in a hung jury, the circuit court granted Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), prompting this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Appellant presents four questions for our review. Reordered to facilitate analysis, they are:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">I. Did the circuit court err in failing to allow appellant to designate a treating physician as an expert in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>second trial after his expert in the first trial was excluded on qualification grounds?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">II. Did the circuit court err in granting a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in appellant\u2019s informed consent case in light of the trial evidence presented by appellant?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">III. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in denying appellant a new trial which was based on appellant\u2019s inability to present to the jury expert testimony on essential elements of his informed consent case?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">IV. Did the circuit court err in failing to afford appellant the opportunity to read into the record the trial testimony of Barry M. Zide, M.D. on the basis of his unavailability pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-804?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting appellant from designating a new expert witness in the second trial but that it did err in granting Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion for a JNOV. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to that court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">In 1993, appellant, then twenty-six years old, underwent a chin augmentation surgery, performed by Steven Denenberg, M.D., during which a chin implant was inserted into his lower jaw. Two years later, liposuction was performed on his neck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The next year, appellant consulted with Paul Manson, M.D., a plastic surgeon at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, seeking, according to Dr. Manson, \u201cimprovement in neck redundancy and improvement in the appearance of his chin.\u201d Although Dr. Manson concluded that appellant was \u201cnot a candidate for any revisional procedure on either the chin or the neck,\u201d he referred appellant to Anthony Tufaro, M.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>When appellant met with Dr. Tufaro, Tufaro outlined four possible procedures: sliding genioplasty, platysma plication, removal of appellant\u2019s chin implant, and insertion of cheek implants. He recommended a sliding genioplasty coupled with the removal of appellant\u2019s chin implant and the placement of cheek implants. A \u201csliding genioplasty\u201d involves cutting the patient\u2019s mandible in half horizontally with a reciprocating saw and separating the halves. The lower section is then moved down or forward or a combination of both to achieve the desired change in jaw appearance. Hydroxylapatite is used to fill any gaps between the two halves of the patient\u2019s mandible, and the halves are then screwed together. During that visit and those that followed, appellant was accompanied by his friend, Frances Bloom.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">When appellant and Ms. Bloom next met with Dr. Tufaro to discuss undergoing the sliding genioplasty, appellant brought with him a list of approximately thirty questions about the procedure. After discussing the questions with Dr. Tufaro, he was given a consent form by the doctor. Appellant read the consent form, discussed its contents with Dr. Tufaro, and then signed it. That form warned of the major risks of the operation, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">MAJOR RISKS OF THE OPERATION OR OTHER PROCEDURE AND ANESTHESIA (including such items as failure to obtain the desired result, discomfort, injury, additional therapy and death):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>Bleeding. Infection. Loss of implant. Change in sensation (Numbness).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">(Italics indicates handwritten).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On May 28, 1997, Dr. Tufaro performed the sliding genioplasty; at that time, he removed appellant\u2019s chin implant and inserted cheek implants. Approximately a week later, appellant returned to Dr. Tufaro\u2019s office to have his bandages removed. According to appellant, after the bandages were removed, he discovered that he was not able to close his mouth, that he drooled, and that his lower lip had dropped. Dr. Tufaro asserted that he just needed to \u201cheal\u201d and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>would be \u201cfine.\u201d When, on June 17, 1997, appellant complained that his lower lip had dropped further, Dr. Tufaro told him to massage the area and assured him once again that he would be \u201cfine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Appellant nonetheless telephoned Dr. Manson and told him that his lip had dropped and that he was having trouble with a cheek implant. On July 9, 1997, appellant saw Dr. Manson and, according to the doctor\u2019s report, \u201cexpressed] disappointment in the appearance of his chin and the appearance of his lip.\u201d Because appellant was still healing from the surgery, Dr. Manson advised appellant to wait several months to see if matters would improve. On September 15, 1997, appellant returned to Dr. Manson complaining that his right cheek implant was bothering him and that his lip was not as prominent as it had been before the surgery. That day, Dr. Manson surgically removed appellant\u2019s right cheek implant.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In late December 1997, appellant saw Dr. Manson again. Although Dr. Manson found that his lip was \u201cbetter than it was previously,\u201d appellant complained that he wanted his chin moved further forward. In his notes of that consultation, Dr. Manson wrote, \u201cI am not sure if any further intervention is indicated and [appellant] was so advised. I personally would have difficulty doing it and feel that he probably should wait before having anything done.\u201d On December 29, 1997, Dr. Manson performed surgery on appellant to improve his lower lip position and appearance. He reattached appellant\u2019s mentalis muscle and performed a \u201cV-Y advancement of mucosa.\u201d He also inserted a small chin implant to improve appellant\u2019s appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">On January 14, 1998, appellant again saw Dr. Manson, complaining about the position of his chin. At that time, Dr. Manson recorded in his notes that he found appellant\u2019s lip position \u201csatisfactory.\u201d Fourteen days later, appellant returned, complaining that the right side of his lower lip was drooping; Dr. Manson wrote in his notes, however, that appellant\u2019s lip was \u201cof almost normal posture\u201d and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>recommended that several more months elapse before he underwent further treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">After several more consultations with Dr. Manson to discuss his chin and lower lip, appellant sought treatment from Louis Belinfante, D.D.S. On May 26, 1998, Dr. Belinfante surgically removed the Hydroxylapatite that had been inserted during appellant\u2019s sliding genioplasty procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On July 22, 2003, between the first and second trial, appellant saw Bruce Epker, D.D.S., who, according to his notes, found that appellant had a \u201cfair[ly] classic case of mentalis muscle inferior positioning with lip incompetence.\u201d On October 7, 2003, a year before the second trial, appellant underwent surgery performed by Dr. Epker to correct the ptosis<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of his lower lip.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">On August 27, 2001, appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Johns Hopkins, alleging that he had not been told of all of the material risks of the sliding genioplasty and that, if he had been, he would not have gone through with the surgery. Johns Hopkins filed an answer denying liability and pleading the affirmative defenses of assumption of risk, contributory negligence, statute of limitations, and charitable immunity. On September 14, 2001, appellant amended his complaint by changing the relief requested from two million dollars to an amount \u201cin excess of the required jurisdictional amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">On September 18, 2001, the circuit court entered a pre-trial scheduling order requiring that appellant designate any expert witnesses by December 19, 2001; that Johns Hopkins designate any expert witnesses by March 20, 2002; and that appellant designate any rebuttal expert witnesses by April 20, 2002. On December 20, 2001, appellant designated Daniel Wilkerson, M.D., as an expert witness. According to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>designation, which was filed with the court, Dr. Wilkerson was going to testify that Johns Hopkins breached its duty of care \u201cto adequately inform [appellant] of the risks associated with removal of the alloplastie chin implant\u201d performed by Dr. Tufaro. Appellant did not designate any other expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Trial commenced on May 5, 2003, in the circuit court before the Honorable Allen Sehwait.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that trial, the court refused to qualify Dr. Wilkerson as an expert witness, thus leaving appellant without an expert witness to testify as to the risks of a sliding genioplasty. Fortunately for appellant, he was able to extract that information from Johns Hopkins\u2019s expert, Dr. Barry Zide, during his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The first trial ended in a verdict for appellant and an award of $50,000 in economic damages and $500,000 in non-economic damages. Two days after the verdict, Johns Hopkins filed \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for a New Trial and/or Remittitur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">After argument on Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion, Judge Sehwait stated, \u201cI find this verdict excessive. I find it grossly excessive. It shocks my conscious [sic]. I find it inordinate.\u201d The judge explained that he had erred in allowing appellant and Ms. Bloom to testify as to appellant\u2019s dissatisfaction with the treatment by Dr. Manson; in permitting certain operative reports and consent forms to be introduced into evidence; in allowing appellant to wear his \u201cchin bra\u201d during the trial; and in permitting lay testimony regarding appellant\u2019s future pain, suffering, and loss of teeth. To rectify the matter, Judge Sehwait offered to reduce the judgment to $12,500 for economic damages and to $100,000 for non-economic damages or, if appellant did not accept the remittitur, to grant Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">On June 18, 2003, after appellant rejected the remittitur, the circuit court ordered a new trial. The second trial was scheduled to begin on October 29, 2003. On July 11, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>appellant filed a \u201cRequest for Continuance and Issuance of a New Scheduling Order,\u201d in which he requested that the date of the trial be postponed because of a scheduling conflict and that a new scheduling order be issued so that the parties could \u201credesignate their experts for trial.\u201d Appellant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">The evidence and testimony by [Johns Hopkins\u2019s] experts at the first trial confirmed that [appellant] is in need of at least one additional surgery. Plaintiff is now under the care of two additional physicians who were not called as fact or expert witnesses at the first trial. [Appellant] anticipates that he will undergo at least one additional surgery to his lip and chin in response to the injuries he suffered from the alleged act and omissions of [Johns Hopkins] and its agents. [Appellant] is scheduled to see Bruce Ep[k]er, M.D., of Austin, Texas, for a surgical consultation and Louis Belinfante, D.D.S., of Atlanta, Georgia, for follow-up care, both of whom are expected to serve as fact and expert witnesses at retrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Johns Hopkins protested the identification of any new experts because \u201c[e]xpert identification and discovery [had] already been completed\u201d and requested that any additional discovery by the parties be limited to appellant\u2019s \u201congoing treatment and related medical information.\u201d On August 25, 2003, the circuit court granted appellant\u2019s request for a postponement of the trial, rescheduling the trial to January 12, 2004. Although the court re-opened discovery, it \u201climited [it] to issues of treatment rendered to [appellant] since May 28, 2003,\u201d allowing the parties to designate new expert witnesses to testify but only as to the treatment appellant received after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Ten days later, appellant filed \u201cPlaintiffs Motion to Reconsider and/or to Modify the Court\u2019s Order Dated August 25, 2003,\u201d in which he complained that the order \u201cunfairly restrict[ed][him] from offering \u2018expert\u2019 testimony on the issues of standard of care, proximate cause, and damages related to the initial surgery of May 28, 1997 giving rise to the subject litigation and any of [his] subsequent treatments or evaluations before May 28, 2003.\u201d He further stated that his counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>had been \u201cunable to locate [his] previously designated expert, Daniel C. Wilkerson, M.D., after numerous attempts to find him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">With his motion, appellant submitted \u201cPlaintiffs Designation of Expert Witnesses,\u201d in which he designated Dr. Wilkerson, Dr. Louis Belinfante, and Dr. Bruce Epker<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as experts who would each testify that Johns Hopkins had \u201cbreached its duty [to him] to adequately inform him of certain material risks associated with the subject sliding genioplasty surgery with concomitant remove of the alloplastic chin implant as performed by Anthony Tufuro [sic], M.D.\u201d In opposition to that motion, Johns Hopkins argued that appellant was seeking \u201cto take advantage of the retrial of this case and [appellant\u2019s] purported intention to undergo additional surgery to designate new expert witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On December 18, 2003, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider and ordered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">that the trial testimony of the experts named by the parties since May 28, 2003, specifically Louis Belinfante, D.D.S., Bruce Epker, D.D.S., Ferdinand Ofodile, M.D. and Lise C. Van Susteren, M.D., shall be limited in scope to (a) any care and treatment of [appellant] since May 28, 2003 and (b) [appellant\u2019s] mental and physical condition since May 28, 2003, and into the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The court also scheduled a new trial date for November 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">On October 1, 2004, appellant filed \u201cPlaintiffs Supplemental Designation of Expert Witness,\u201d naming Leonard Hertzberg, M.D., as an expert who would testify that appellant \u201csuffers from injuries directly related to and as a consequence of the surgeries performed upon [him] by Drs. Manson and Tuforo [sic] at John[s] Hopkins Hospital, and that [his] physical injuries are neither exaggerated nor contrived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">On October 8, 2004, Dr. Belinfante\u2019s telephonic deposition was taken by counsel for Johns Hopkins. After Johns Hop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>kins\u2019s counsel had concluded his examination of Dr. Belinfante, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">MR. BELSKY (Counsel for Appellant): Doctor, is it true that you received from me a two-volume set of medical records marked, \u201cmedical records of Mark Mahler versus Johns Hopkins Hospital\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">.MR. SHAW (Counsel for Johns Hopkins): Let me interrupt for a second. Are you saying you\u2019re not going to comply with that Order? Is that what you\u2019re telling me, Mr. Belsky?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">MR. BELSKY: Yes, I am. What I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m going to put on the record that Dr. Belinfante has reviewed Mr. Mahler\u2019s complete medical chart; that he is prepared to offer testimony relative to his opinions as to the issues of informed consent; he is prepared to offer opinions as to Mr. Mahler\u2019s medical history going back to the date that he first saw Dr. Tufaro; he is prepared to offer testimony as to each procedure that any doctor did upon him; he is prepared to offer testimony as to the procedure that he performed on Mr. Mahler prior to the date of \u2014 that you\u2019ve referenced; that this deposition is being held and you have been placed on notice by me on numerous occasions that I intend to offer Dr. Belinfante as both a treating physician and as an expert; and that I intend to elicit from Dr. Belinfante at trial all that I believe that I am entitled to in light of the fact that there is a new Trial Order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">MR. SHAW: Well, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">MR. BELSKY: I\u2019m not finished. I\u2019ve also advised you that I do not agree with the Court\u2019s ruling, I do not agree with your characterization that for the purposes of discovery, that the Court has limited the right of an attorney to inquire into the doctor\u2019s opinions in that regard and that this doctor is prepared to offer opinions relative to his treatment, relative to his opinions on all issues that are present in this trial and we will seek review with a new trial judge or the same trial judge of that decision. And you have an opportunity to ask the doctor any questions that you wish. You are on notice that I intend to offer the doctor for this purpose so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that if you seek to claim prejudice, that you have been given the opportunity today to ask those questions relative to all of the doctor\u2019s opinions and have chosen to limit your questions to what you believe the Court has restricted you to. And I ... I disagree with your interpretation ----</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">MR. SHAW: All right. My response is that I chose not to and I choose not to violate the Court Order ....</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">... And unless you have anything further, I\u2019m prepared to terminate this deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">You\u2019re going to ask questions?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">MR. BELSKY: Yeah. I\u2019m violating the Court Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">MR. SHAW: Okay. Well, I\u2019m not going to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">MR. BELSKY: I\u2019m violating your interpretation of the Court Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Following that exchange, counsel for Johns Hopkins hung up, whereupon counsel for appellant questioned Dr. Belinfante about the risks of a sliding genioplasty. After the deposition, Johns Hopkins filed \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and to Restrict Scope of Plaintiffs De Bene Esse Deposition of Louis S. Belinfante, D.D.S.\u201d In that motion, Johns Hopkins asked that appellant be sanctioned for violating the court\u2019s August 25th and December 18th orders restricting discovery. Noting that a de bene esse videotape deposition of Dr. Belinfante was scheduled to take place, it further requested that appellant be precluded from questioning him \u201con issues and opinions exceeding the scope of the Court\u2019s two previous discovery Orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Granting that motion, the court ordered that the scope of the de bene esse deposition of Dr. Belinfante be limited to that allowed by the December 18, 2003, order, which restricted trial testimony of newly designated experts to the treatment appellant received after the first trial and to his mental and physical condition after that proceeding had ended. Although the court ordered appellant to pay a \u201cmonetary sanction\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Johns Hopkins for the \u201ctime and effort associated with the preparation\u201d of that motion, it reserved on the amount of that sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On November 3, 2004, five days before the second trial was to begin, appellant filed a motion asking the circuit court to reconsider the restrictions it had placed on the designation of expert witnesses and that Dr. Belinfante\u2019s de bene esse deposition be reopened. To that motion, appellant attached Dr. Belinfante\u2019s affidavit in which the doctor stated that he would testify that appellant suffered from \u201cwound dehiscence, asymmetry, lip incompetence, lip deformity, chin deformity, injury to dental structures, neurosensory disturbance of the lip, chin, gengiva, and teeth;\u201d that those were all material risks of, and caused by, appellant\u2019s sliding genioplasty; that the treatments that appellant received after the surgery by Dr. Tufaro were all necessitated by that surgery; that the costs of those treatments were reasonable; and that appellant did not give his informed consent to the sliding genioplasty surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On November 8, 2004, the second trial began with the Honorable Joseph P. McCurdy presiding. At the beginning of that trial, after hearing argument on appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider the discovery issue, Judge McCurdy denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">At trial, appellant testified that, at his second meeting with Dr. Tufaro, he asked if the surgery \u201ccould affect function\u201d and that Dr. Tufaro told him \u201cno,\u201d explaining that function was controlled by \u201cthe side muscles and they would not be involved.\u201d Although they discussed whether he could be in the sun, possible allergies, and if he might die during the surgery, Dr. Tufaro never mentioned, appellant asserted, that he could suffer a permanent loss of sensation. When appellant asked Dr. Tufaro what the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d was, Dr. Tufaro responded, \u201cyou might have a little bit of reduced sensation in your lower lip for about two or three months\u201d but that it would not be permanent. Appellant further claimed that Dr. Tufaro told him that there was a possibility of infection, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>that it was \u201cunlikely.\u201d They then discussed, according to appellant, how soon he could resume his art and weight training and if he would have any problem lifting his luggage immediately following surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Appellant next testified about the consent form he signed, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">MAJOR RISKS OF THE OPERATION OR OTHER PROCEDURE AND ANESTHESIA (including such items as failure to obtain the desired result, discomfort, injury, additional therapy and death):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>Bleeding. Infection. Loss of implant. Change in sensation (Numbness).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">(Italics indicates handwritten).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Although Dr. Tufaro told him that it was \u201cjust some red tape\u201d that he needed to sign, the doctor did go over the form with appellant, explaining what each of the risks listed meant. He said that the \u201cfailure to achieve desired result\u201d risk meant that he might not be happy with how it looked because \u201csome people might want a ton of chin. Some people might want just a little bit of chin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">As for the \u201cdiscomfort\u201d risk, Dr. Tufaro told him, \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to be in pain the first couple of days after this surgery,\u201d but that the pain would subside. As for risk of \u201cinjury,\u201d Dr. Tufaro cautioned him that he would be black and blue and swollen immediately after the surgery. The \u201cadditional therapy\u201d referred to in the consent form Dr. Tufaro explained would be the platysmal plication, which he would not need because he was having the sliding genioplasty performed. As for \u201cbleeding,\u201d Dr. Tufaro said that this meant that he could turn black and blue right after the surgery. Although \u201cinfection\u201d was possible, Dr. Tufaro assured him it was \u201cunlikely.\u201d And, as for the risk of \u201cchange in sensation (numbness)\u201d Dr. Tufaro warned only that he could have \u201creduced sensation in [his] lower lip ... for two or three months.\u201d But Dr. Tufaro never discussed, appellant claimed, wound dehiscence, the possibility of losing function in his lip, the possibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>of his metalis muscle separating from his gum, or the possibility that he could suffer permanent numbness.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On cross examination, appellant admitted that he read and understood the part of the form that stated, \u201cI am aware that the practice of medicine and surgery is not an exact science and I acknowledge that no guarantee has been made as to the results that may be obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Frances Bloom testified next. She accompanied appellant on his visits to Dr. Tufaro. She stated that Dr. Tufaro told appellant that \u201cthere would be no loss of function ... that there would be no permanent nerve damage, [and] that there could be some numbness from three to six months.\u201d She could not remember, however, whether Dr. Tufaro discussed with appellant asymmetry, bleeding, or injury to teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">She further stated that appellant looked at the consent form for five to ten minutes before signing it and that the consultation lasted thirty to forty minutes. She also testified that, on the morning of the surgery, Dr. Tufaro saw appellant, before surgery, and told him that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be so nervous\u201d because he would \u201clove\u201d the result and that \u201cthere would be no chance of losing function\u201d or dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Appellant next called Dr. Tufaro to testify. Unable to recall exactly what he discussed with appellant, he did testify to what he generally tells patients who are about to undergo a sliding genioplasty; that is, that they could expect numbness in their chin, lips, teeth, and gums following the surgery. He further advises them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">[T]here will be one hundred percent incidence of numbness and tingling of your lower lip in the early postoperative period----That should go away over the next few months. Some people are left with a small area of numbness, particularly underneath the chin, where there\u2019s overlap from the two sides. Some patients have a permanent area of permanent numbness ... on the chin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">He also tells them that they will experience pain and discomfort after the surgery and that they may require \u201ctouch-up surgery\u201d and that, if their implants become infected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>they will have to be taken out. He further warns them, as to post-operative functions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">In the early postoperative period, your function will seem different to you. Your lip will feel thick. It will feel swollen. Your lip will feel numb in the early postoperative period. So, to you, you might feel like your lip is not functioning normally. It will feel like you went to the dentist and you had an injection and your lip was numb. When you go to the dentist and you walk out, you think your lip isn\u2019t working, but you\u2019re the only one that thinks that____ In the early postoperative period, this operation will affect your sensation and your function because the lip will be swollen and sore and stiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">After stating that he counsels patients, especially patients who have had previous operations in the same area, \u201cYou may not be happy with the outcome,\u201d he disputed appellant\u2019s testimony that he never told him that there could be permanent problems. The doctor insisted that he tells patients, \u201cYou can have some permanent problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Dr. Tufaro conceded, however, that he does not tell patients that there is a risk of \u201cpermanent functional disability\u201d and that is because, he explained, it \u201cis not a common sequelae and not one of the material risks.\u201d \u201c[Ujnsightly ptosis of the ehin, with or without concomitant lip incompetence,\u201d he opined, is a \u201cvery uncommon finding.\u201d It is not a \u201cmaterial complication,\u201d he asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Although Dr. Tufaro agreed that asymmetry, lip ptosis, dimpling of the soft tissues around the chin, a change in position of the lower lip, and damage to the mentalis muscle are known risks of sliding genioplasty surgery, he did not mention those potential problems because he did not believe they were \u201cmaterial risks.\u201d He explained that he uses \u201clayman\u2019s terms\u201d rather than the \u201canatomic terms\u201d in explaining the risks of the procedure to patients because patients can better understand those terms. For instance, he does not tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>patients that they could suffer an injury to the mental nerve<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but, instead, advises them that they could have numbness, which means the same thing; and, rather than use the term \u201cptosis,\u201d he tells patients, \u201cYour lip is going to be rubbery and full.\u201d But he admitted that he did not tell appellant that he could have a \u201cpermanent hanging lip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Appellant next called Dr. Manson as an expert witness in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. Dr. Manson testified that a doctor must inform a patient of the material risks that are known to him even if the doctor has not experienced them during his practice. The risks of a sliding genioplasty include, he stated, death, ptosis of the chin, lip incompetence, dimpling, temporary and permanent numbness, and injury. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">You can have damage to any of the muscles that are transected. You could end up with a lip that\u2019s lower in position. You could end up with your lip not working as well as it should and the primary mechanism for that is sensory input; in other words, lack of enough sensory input to feel where your lower lip is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Though asymmetry was a risk of the surgery, most doctors, he stated, do not inform patients of the risk because everyone has asymmetry in their face. When asked, \u201cDo you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical\u2019 probability whether the informed consent form listing the potential complications of injury, of numbness, of failure to achieve desired result, of the need for additional therapy or surgery, of bleeding and infection and death, whether those met with accepted standards of care within the medical community to be given prior to the procedure that [appellant] had on May 28, 1997?,\u201d Dr. Manson responded, \u201cIf you take those as geographic areas of responsibility, they do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In a videotape that was played for the jury, Dr. Belinfante testified that the surgery performed by Dr. Epker on October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>7, 2003, was not elective, but was necessary because of appellant\u2019s drooping lip. Appellant\u2019s lip, he opined, remained in an \u201cabnormal\u201d position even after the surgery by Dr. Epker, but he declined to recommend any more surgery to correct the condition because it would not be \u201cadvantageous\u201d to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Appellant attempted to introduce Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony from the first trial. He proffered that Dr. Zide testified \u201cthat the material risks of the genioplasty are wound dehiscence, nerve injury, soft tissue changes, ptosis, [and] chin deformity ... and ... that he believed that [appellant], indeed, needed one additional mentalis muscle suspension surgery that he [Dr. Zide] had offered to perform and [that] he had also stated the cost for his performing that surgery as of the date of the last trial.\u201d But Johns Hopkins objected, pointing out that appellant had not designated Dr. Zide as an expert in the case and that Dr. Zide was not unavailable under Maryland Rule 2-419(a)(3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Ruling that Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony was not admissible, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">[W]ith respect to Dr. Zide, he wasn\u2019t designated as an expert witness within the discovery period, number one. The fact that he wasn\u2019t does create prejudice to the defense because the defense was not able, although he anticipated it because of what happened in the previous trial, he was not able to \u2014 and this trial has lasted over a week already. So, had this been directed in the beginning, it may have made a difference. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">And the other thing that I must comment upon is based on the proffer of plaintiff, I think it\u2019s only cumulative anyway. So I\u2019m going to rule that Dr. Zide\u2019s previously-recorded testimony is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Johns Hopkins only called one witness to the stand, Dr. Jeffrey Posnick. Johns Hopkins presented Dr. Posnick with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>hypothetical disclosure that a doctor might give to a patient for a sliding genioplasty:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Your chin and your lips aren\u2019t going to feel normal. They may not feel like they\u2019re moving normally right afterward and for a period of time because they may feel tight and rubbery and numb, and the numbness most of the time goes away, but may last permanently. Your lips aren\u2019t going to move the same. You may have some impact on the feeling of your lip, the sensation of your lip, and how you perceive the lip position and actually the lip position itself. You may get food caught for a period of time in your sulcus, which is down below between ... your lower teeth and your gu[m]. You may have bleeding. You may have infection. You may have a scar. You may have a loss of implant. You may have pain or discomfort. You may have injuries to other structures in your mouth. You may have numbness of your teeth and gums, in addition to numbness of your lips. You may have discoloration of your teeth. You may feel a step in both sides of your jaw and, most importantly, I may not be able to achieve the desired result. You may need additional surgery and that no surgery is perfect and there\u2019s no guarantees made.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Dr. Posnick was asked whether that disclosure \u201ccomplied] with accepted standards of care.\u201d He responded that it was \u201cmore than acceptable.\u201d He further stated that \u201cpatient dissatisfaction\u201d covers ptosis of the chin and lip incompetence, but that motor and sensory nerve changes and infection \u201cneed to be mentioned separately.\u201d Wound healing was another risk that Dr. Posnick testified should be disclosed, but Dr. Tufaro covered that risk, he said, when he discussed bleeding, infection, and injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">On November 22, 2004, after eight hours of deliberation, the jury was unable to reach a verdict, prompting the circuit court to declare a mistrial. Nine days later, Johns Hopkins filed a motion for JNOV. After a hearing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the circuit court granted Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion, stating in a written memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>It is undisputed that the [appellant] met with Dr. [Tufaro] on three occasions before undergoing surgery. [Appellant] was told of many of the risks in compliance with the <em>Sard </em>decision on materiality, and he was satisfied with Dr. [Tufaro\u2019s] explanations, because he signed the consent form and proceeded with the surgery. Dr. Posnick testified that a physician needs to supplement an informed consent with conversations with the patient. It is clear that a reasonable person in the [appellant\u2019s] position would have consented to the surgery based on the informed consent document and meetings with the physician. It may be possible that words like wound dehiscence, motor nerves and ptosis were not used by Dr. [Tufaro], but there is no doubt that [appellant] knew of the risks based on the discussions and written consent form and still agreed to the procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">[Appellant] argued at the JNOV hearing that Dr. Posnick testified at trial that permanent loss of sensation can occur in a small percentage of patients receiving a sliding genioplasty. And, that the risk of loss is a material risk that should be included in the informed consent and discussed with a patient to the extent that they are satisfied. The informed consent has Dr. [Tufaro\u2019s] handwritten additions listed under the category Major Risks of the Operation. One of these additions is \u201cchange in sensation (numbness).\u201d This notation shows that Dr. [Tufaro] and [appellant] discussed a change in sensation as a major risk that may result after the surgery. The common understanding] of a \u201cchange in sensation\u201d is that it feels different and nothing in the Major Risks of the Operation section of the informed consent discusses temporary changes in sensation. Therefore, a reasonable person could not argue that the informed consent was insufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">Dr. Posnick also testified that the risk of damage to sensory nerves should be one of the risks explained to the patient. The <em>Sard </em>decision states that a physician need not deliver a \u201clengthy polysyllabic discourse on all possible complications. A mini-course on medical science is not required[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 879 A.2d 1014 (quoting <em>Cobbs v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Grant, </em>8 Cal.3d 229, 104 Cal.Rptr. 505, 502 P.2d 1, 11(1972)). Dr. [Tufaro\u2019s] conversations with [appellant] did cover the issue of \u201cchange in sensation\u201d and therefore were more than adequate to meet the <em>Sard </em>standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">The <em>Sard </em>court also held that \u201cthe scope of the physician\u2019s duty to inform is to be measured by the materiality of the information to the decision of the patient. A material risk is one which a physician knows or ought to know would be significant to a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position in deciding whether or not to submit to a particular medical treatment or procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 379 A.2d 1014. Dr. [Tufaro] knew that [appellant] had serious concerns about the procedure. They met on three occasions and Dr. [Tufaro] addressed the thirty or so questions [appellant] had. Dr. [Tufaro] stated in his testimony that the amount of time he spent discussing the procedure with [appellant] surpassed that of about 95% of the patients he normally meets with. After three Meetings with Dr. [Tufaro], [appellant] signed the informed consent for the surgical procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The circuit court then concluded, \u201cAll the evidence in this case, including evidence related to the number of visits between doctor and patient, the in-depth discussions, and handwritten notations on the informed consent, when viewed most favorably for [appellant], does not legally support denying [Johns Hopkins\u2019s] motion for JNOY.\u201d Subsequently, appellant filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and a motion for a new trial, both of which the circuit court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s request to re-open discovery and to designate Dr. Belinfante as an expert witness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>designated only one expert witness before the first trial, Dr. Wilkerson. Because the court declined to permit Dr. Wilkerson to testify as an expert during the first trial and would not permit appellant to designate Dr. Belinfante as an expert witness for the second trial, appellant was left without his own expert witness as to the risks of a sliding genioplasty for the second trial. Moreover, his decision to reject the remittitur, he claims, was based \u201cin large part\u201d on his belief that he would be able to present the testimony of a new expert, Dr. Belinfante, at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u201cIn administering the discovery rules, trial judges are vested with a reasonable, sound discretion in applying them, which discretion will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of its abuse.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 405, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). In fact, in exercising that discretion, \u201c[t]he court may at any time order that discovery be completed by a specified date or time, which shall be a reasonable time after the action is at issue.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-401(b); see <em>also </em>Maryland Rule 2-504(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Nor does the retrial of a case affect the broad discretionary power of the court to expand, limit, or curtail discovery. When a court grants a new trial, it does not grant anything more than that. It is the trial that is to start anew, not discovery, unless the court directs otherwise. If the court declines to grant an ensuing discovery request, that decision will not be reversed unless it amounts to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Although another judge might have decided the issue of whether to permit appellant to designate Dr. Belinfante as an expert witness differently than this judge did, we cannot say that this judge\u2019s decision not to permit appellant to designate Dr. Belinfante constituted an abuse of discretion. In any event, since we are remanding this case for a new trial, we anticipate that this issue will be raised again and considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>anew.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In the meantime, we shall not disturb the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to this issue, for the following reasons: First, the circuit court granted a new trial at the request of Johns Hopkins based on errors that it believed it had made during the first trial. None of those errors required that discovery be re-opened to events preceding the first trial and that appellant be permitted to designate a new expert witness for the second trial. The errors included: allowing appellant and Frances Bloom to testify as to appellant\u2019s dissatisfaction with Dr. Manson\u2019s treatment; permitting operative reports not relevant to the issue of informed consent to be introduced into evidence; allowing appellant to wear his chin bra throughout the trial; allowing the jury to consider damages for future pain and suffering without supporting medical testimony on that issue; allowing appellant to testify that he had been told that he could lose his teeth; and allowing Dr. Posnick\u2019s informed consent form to be used to cross examine Dr. Manson and then entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Second, appellant had plenty of time to designate his expert witnesses for the first trial. After the circuit court entered its scheduling order, he had three months to designate his expert witnesses. During that time, appellant chose to designate only one expert witness, Dr. Wilkerson. Over a year passed from the last date appellant had to designate an expert witness, April 20, 2002, until the first trial took place, but, during that time, he did not request an extension of time for designating expert witnesses. Nor did he petition the circuit court, after that time period had elapsed, for leave to designate other expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Third, according to the designation he filed with the circuit court, Dr. Wilkerson was to be \u201can expert medical witness in the area of general surgery\u201d who would testify that Johns Hopkins \u201cbreached [its] duty owed to [appellant] to adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>inform him of the risks associated with removal of the alloplastic chin implant.\u201d By designating a general surgeon who had never performed a sliding genioplasty, the procedure at issue, appellant took the chance that the court would find that Dr. Wilkerson was not an expert as to this procedure. And, by designating him as his only expert witness, appellant assumed the risk of having no expert witness if the circuit court did not qualify Dr. Wilkerson as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">And, finally, in December 2001, when appellant designated Dr. Wilkerson as his expert witness, he could have also designated Dr. Belinfante. Dr. Belinfante was a natural choice to testify, since he had performed surgery on appellant three and one-half years earlier. For unexplained reasons, appellant chose not to do so. The decision to forego not only Dr. Belifante\u2019s testimony at trial but to forego even the possibility of calling him as a witness, by declining to designate him as a witness, was appellant\u2019s alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Appellant claims that the circuit court erred in granting Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion for JNOV because there was competent evidence supporting his claim that he did not give informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u201c[A] motion ... n.o.v. tests the legal sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d <em>Impala Platinum Ltd. v. Impala Sales (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 326, 389 A.2d 887 (1978), and \u201cis reviewed under the same standard as a judgment granted on motion during trial.\u201d <em>Huppman v. Tighe, </em>100 Md.App. 655, 663, 642 A.2d 309 (1994). \u201cA party is not entitled to judgment unless evidence on the issue and all inferences fairly deducible therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made, are such as to permit only one conclusion with regard to the issue.\u201d <em>Smith v. Miller, </em>71 Md.App. 273, 278, 525 A.2d 245 (1987). \u201cTo this end, we must assume the truth of all credible evidence and all inferences of fact reasonably deductible from the evidence supporting the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Fire Ins. Co. v. Tufts, </em>118 Md.App. 180, 190-91, 702 A.2d 422 (1997). \u201c[I]f there is any competent evidence, however slight, leading to support the plaintiffs right to recover, the case should be submitted to the jury and the motion for directed verdict or the motion for judgment n.o.v. denied.\u201d <em>Montgomery Ward and Co., Inc., v. McFarland, </em>21 Md.App. 501, 513, 319 A.2d 824 (1974). Because such evidence was before the circuit court, it erred in granting Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977), the Court of Appeals discussed at length the nature of an action for medical malpractice based on a lack of informed consent. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">[T]he doctrine of informed consent imposes on a physician, before he subjects his patient to medical treatment, the duty to explain the procedure to the patient and to warn him of any material risks or dangers inherent in or collateral to the therapy, so as to enable the patient to make an intelligent and informed choice about whether or not to undergo such treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 439, 379 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The Court rejected a standard for disclosure based on the norms of the profession, adopting, instead, a standard that is based on what a patient would find material to his or her decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cThe scope of the physician\u2019s communications to the patient, then, must be measured by the patient\u2019s need, and that need is whatever is material to the decision. Thus, the test for determining whether a potential peril must be divulged is its materiality to the patient\u2019s decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 443-44, 379 A.2d 1014 (quoting <em>Cobbs v. Grant, </em>8 Cal.3d 229, 104 Cal.Rptr. 505, 502 P.2d 1 (1972)). And the Court defined a \u201cmaterial risk\u201d as \u201cone which a physician knows or ought to know [is] significant to a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position in deciding whether or not to submit to a particular medical treatment or procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 379 A.2d 1014. But, the Court warned, a \u201cphysician need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>deliver a lengthy polysyllabic discourse on all possible complications. A mini-course in medical science is not required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"> Expert medical testimony is not required to establish either the scope or the breach of the physician\u2019s duty to disclose all material risks. <em>Id. </em>at 447, 379 A.2d 1014. But \u201c[s]uch expert testimony [is] required to establish the nature of the risks inherent in a particular treatment, the probabilities of therapeutic success, the frequency of the occurrence of particular risks, the nature of available alternatives to treatment and whether or not disclosure would be detrimental to a patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 379 A.2d 1014. Once the risks and nondisclosure of those risks have been shown, the jury must determine whether the risks in question were material and, if so, \u201cwhether a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position would have withheld consent to the surgery or therapy had all material risks been disclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 379 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Both Dr. Tufaro and Dr. Manson testified as to what the risks of a sliding genioplasty surgery were. While Dr. Tufaro stated that asymmetry, lip ptosis, dimpling of the soft tissues around the chin, a change in position of the lower lip, and damage to the mentalis muscle were risks of this type of surgical procedure, Dr. Manson opined ptosis of the chin, lip incompetence, dimpling, asymmetry, and numbness, both temporary and permanent were also risks. Illustratively, Dr. Manson added, \u201cYou could end up with a lip that\u2019s lower in position. You could end up with your lip not working as well as it should.... \u201d Given that testimony, a reasonable juror could have found that permanent nerve injury and a lower lip position were material risks of the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">And there was evidence that Dr. Tufaro failed to disclose those risks to appellant. Appellant testified that Dr. Tufaro did not tell him that he could have permanent numbness. In fact, he insists that when he asked if the surgery could \u201caffect function,\u201d Dr. Tufaro told him \u201cno.\u201d Further, he testified that when he asked what the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d was, Dr. Tufaro told him that he \u201cmight have a little bit of reduced sensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>in [his] lower lip for about two or three months\u201d but that it would not be permanent. Frances Bloom, a friend of appellant who was with him during his consultations with Dr. Tufaro, gave similar testimony. She stated that Dr. Tufaro told appellant that there would be no loss of function and that any numbness would be temporary. Furthermore, Dr. Tufaro admitted that he had not informed appellant of a risk that he might have a \u201cpermanent hanging lip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Although appellant signed the informed consent form, his testimony of what Dr. Tufaro told him when the two of them discussed the risks on that form created a question as to whether it adequately advised appellant of the material risks of a sliding genioplasty. That form stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">MAJOR RISKS OF THE OPERATION OR OTHER PROCEDURE AND ANESTHESIA (including such items as failure to obtain the desired result, discomfort, injury, additional therapy and death):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Bleeding. Infection. Loss of implant. Change in sensation (Numbness).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">(Italics indicates handwritten).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Appellant further testified that Dr. Tufaro advised him that \u201cfailure to achieve desired results\u201d meant that he might not be happy with the amount of change in his chin, but that another person might find it acceptable; that \u201cdiscomfort\u201d meant that he was \u201cprobably going to be in pain the first couple of days after this surgery,\u201d but that it would subside; that \u201cinjury\u201d meant he would be black and blue and swollen immediately after the surgery; that \u201cadditional therapy\u201d would be the platysmal plication which he would not need because he was having the sliding genioplasty performed; that \u201cbleeding\u201d meant that he could turn black and blue right after the surgery; that \u201cinfection\u201d was possible but unlikely; and that \u201cchange in sensation (numbness)\u201d meant that he could have \u201creduced sensation in [his] lower lip ... for two or three months.\u201d Thus, the risks listed on the form did not include permanent numbness or a change in the position of his lip and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>according to appellant, in explaining the risks noted on the form, Dr. Tufaro did not mention either of those two risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">If the jury believed the testimony of Drs. Tufaro and Manson that the risks of the procedure included permanent numbness, loss of function, and a change in lip position and the testimony of appellant and Bloom that these risks were not disclosed, it could have reasonably found that these risks were material and a reasonable person in the appellant\u2019s position would not have gone through with the surgery, had he been informed of those risks. Therefore, the circuit court erred in granting Johns Hopkins\u2019s motion for JNOV.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the circuit court erred in not granting him a new trial is based on the same arguments he made in connection with his claim that the court erred in not granting his request to designate a new expert witness. Because appellant was not permitted to present a new expert witness at the second trial, he claims that the \u201cjury was in essence misled into a false sense that Appellant\u2019s expert support for his own case was weak if not nonexistent.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">A trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Merritt v. State, </em>367 Md. 17, 28, 785 A.2d 756 (2001). Only \u201cwhen an alleged error is committed during the trial, when the losing party or that party\u2019s counsel, without fault, does not discover the alleged error during the trial, and when the issue is then raised by a motion for a new trial, [have we] reviewed the denial of the new trial motion under a standard of whether the denial was erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 785 A.2d 756. That is not the case here, so the circuit court\u2019s denial must be reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">We have already discussed why the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request to reopen discovery. Because the court did not abuse its discretion then, its denial of a new trial, based on its failure to reopen discovery, could not have constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in prohibiting him from introducing into evidence the testimony Dr. Zide gave at the first trial. He claims that Dr. Zide should have been found to be unavailable and his testimony read into the record under Rule 5-804(b). That rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhT\">Hearsay Exceptions. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVci\">(1) <em>Former Testimony. </em>Testimony given as a witness in any action or proceeding or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of any action or proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">But the circuit court did not exclude Dr. Zide\u2019s prior testimony based on that rule. The court excluded it because appellant had not designated Dr. Zide as one of his experts for the second trial and because the court found that Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony would have been \u201ccumulative.\u201d In any event, appellant maintains that the discovery order for the second trial precluded him from naming Dr. Zide because \u201chis treatment and testimony preceded May 28, 2008.\u201d Aside from noting this fact, appellant provides no reason for why he should have been allowed to offer Dr. Zide\u2019s prior testimony into evidence and how the circuit court\u2019s refusal to allow his testimony was an abuse of discretion. As we have already discussed, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by limiting appellant\u2019s ability to designate new experts for the second trial. Given that holding, appellant presents no reason as to why the court could not exclude Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony in accordance with that limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Nor does appellant present any argument as to why the circuit court abused its discretion in finding that Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony would be cumulative. Despite the requirement in Rule 8 \u2014 504(a)(5) that a party provide \u201cargument in support of the party\u2019s position\u201d in his or her brief, appellant only makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the bald assertion that Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony \u201cwas not cumulative and was more probative than any other witness testimony for the Appellant on the material risks of the surgery.\u201d An examination of the record discloses that there was substantial evidence presented at trial by both sides on the issues that Dr. Zide was to address testimonially.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">For example, appellant proffered that Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony was that \u201cthe material risks of the genioplasty [were] wound dehiscence, nerve injury, soft tissue changes, ptosis, [and] chin deformity.\u201d But such testimony had already been elicited from Doctors Tufaro and Manson. Dr. Tufaro testified that the risks included lip ptosis, dimpling of the soft tissues around the chin, and a change in position of the lower lip. And Dr. Manson testified that the risks included ptosis of the chin, dimpling, damage to sensory nerves, and a lowering of the position of the lip.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellant also proffered at trial that Dr. Zide would testify that appellant needed an additional surgery and the cost of that surgery. After the first trial, appellant underwent additional surgery performed by Dr. Epker. That surgery was essentially the same as the surgery that Dr. Zide was to testify about. Because Dr. Belinfante did in fact testify at the second trial regarding that surgery, Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony would have been, as the circuit court ruled, cumulative. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr. Zide\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.
