At the time of the accident, the front-seat passenger in the van was Howard Dillsworth; the backseat passenger was Mr. Resh\u2019s wife, Josephine Resh, who is also the daughter of Mr. Dillsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">The accident happened when the van driven by Mr. Resh struck a skidloader (also referred to in the testimony as a \u201cBobcat\u201d) operated by Carlton Bowser. Mr. Resh was only slightly injured in the accident, but his wife, Mr. Dillsworth, and Mr. Bowser all suffered more serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Approximately four months after the accident, Mr. Dills-worth died. Thereafter, Josephine Resh was appointed as the personal representative of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">On February 14, 2002, Mrs. Resh, individually, filed a negligence suit against Mr. Bowser in the Circuit Court for Garrett County. She alleged that the November 11, 1999, accident was the exclusive fault of Mr. Bowser. Included in the complaint was a count alleging loss of consortium, which was brought by Mr. and Mrs. Resh jointly. Additionally, Mrs. Resh, as personal representative of her father\u2019s estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>brought a survivorship action and, in her individual capacity, a wrongful death claim against Mr. Bowser.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Bowser filed an answer to the complaint, along with a counterclaim. He named as counter-defendants Mr. and Mrs. Resh, individually, and Mrs. Resh, in her capacity as personal representative of the estate of Mr. Dillsworth. In the counter claim, Mr. Bowser asserted that Mr. Resh\u2019s negligence caused the accident, and his negligence was imputable to both Mr. Dillsworth and Mrs. Resh, because at the time of the accident Mr. Resh was acting as the agent for both. Counter-claimant also contended that Josephine Resh was liable for her husband\u2019s negligence due to the fact that she was the owner of the van. In addition to seeking damages for his personal injury, Mr. Bowser asked for contribution and/or indemnity for all claims made by the plaintiffs in the original action.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Mr. Bowser later settled with the Reshes\u2019 insurer his claim for personal injury arising out of the accident. In connection with that settlement, Mr. Bowser signed, on September 29, 2003, a release. Subsequently, a stipulation of dismissal was filed as to Mr. Bowser\u2019s bodily injury claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">On January 14, 2005, Mr. Bowser filed an amended counterclaim for indemnity and/or contribution. In addition to the allegations set forth in the original counterclaim, Mr. Bowser alleged in the amended counterclaim that Mrs. Resh negligently entrusted the operation of her vehicle to her husband and that her negligence in doing so, combined with the negligence of Mr. Resh, caused or contributed to the accident. He also alleged that Mrs. Resh was the agent and/or \u201cemployee\u201d of Mr. Dillsworth at the time of the accident and that her own negligence in entrusting the Dodge van to her husband was imputable to Mr. Dillsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">On May 27, 2005, which was almost a year and one-half after the release was signed, Mr. and Mrs. Resh filed what they called a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Carlton Bowser\u2019s Counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Claim for Indemnification and/or Contribution.\u201d Despite the title of the motion, it was, in legal effect, a motion for summary judgment as to all claims made in the counterclaim because it relied upon a document not attached to Mr. Bowser\u2019s counterclaim, i.e., the release signed on September 29, 2003. The release was relied upon by the Reshes, despite the fact that neither of them had specifically pleaded that defense as they were required to do pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-323(g)(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">On June 20, 2005, the trial judge granted the Reshes\u2019 motion to dismiss the counterclaim for indemnification and/or contribution. Three days after the counterclaim was dismissed, on June 23, 2005, a jury trial commenced. The parties stipulated at trial that the jury would be required only to answer questions concerning liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The jurors were asked to answer six questions on a special verdict sheet. The questions propounded, and the jurors\u2019 answers to those questions, were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">1. Do you find that Carlton E. Bowser, Jr., was negligent and that his negligence was a proximate cause of the accident on November 11,1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">/ Yes No</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">2. Do you find that Francis Resh was negligent and that his negligence was a cause of the accident on November 11, 1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">/ Yes No</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">3. Do you find that Francis Resh was the agent of Josephine I. Resh?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">_Yes / No</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">4. Do you find that Francis Resh was the agent or employee of Elmer Dillsworth?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">_Yes y No</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">5. Do you find Josephine I. Resh was the agent of Elmer Dillsworth?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-16\">Yes y No</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>6. Do you find that Josephine I. Resh was the sole owner and an occupant of the Resh vehicle such that she had the <em>right </em>to control the operation of her vehicle even though she was not actually driving it?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Yes / No</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">Mr. Bowser filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or a new trial, which was denied. He then filed this appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which he raises seven questions, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">1. Did the trial court err when it denied Bowser\u2019s motion for partial judgment concerning the issues of agency and imputed negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">2. Did the lower court err when it denied Bowser\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment concerning the issues of agency and imputed negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">3. Did the trial judge err when he refused to instruct the jury concerning the issue of negligent entrustment?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">4. Did the trial court err when it refused to instruct the jury concerning the defense of assumption of risk?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">5. Did the lower court err when it dismissed Bowser\u2019s counterclaim for indemnification and/or contribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-15\">6. Did the trial court err when it referred to injuries while instructing the jury and thereby invit[e] the jury to consider injuries contrary to the court\u2019s prior <em>in limine </em>ruling that the jury was not to consider injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b643-16\">7. Did the trial court err when it denied Bowser\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or for new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>I. <em>FACTS DEVELOPED AT TRIAL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">A. <em>The Happening of the Accident</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The subject accident occurred on Underwood Road near Mr. Bowser\u2019s residence in Garrett County. At the time of the accident, Mr. Resh was driving with his low-beam headlights on, and it was either dark (Mr. Bowser\u2019s testimony) or \u201cgetting dark\u201d (Mr. Resh\u2019s testimony). Underwood Road is a two-lane highway, and the Reshes\u2019 vehicle was proceeding southbound in the right lane of that road.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Mr. Resh, who was sixty years old at the time of the accident, was very familiar with Underwood Road, having driven it regularly for many years. About 300 feet north of the scene of the accident, the 1994 van driven by Mr. Resh passed Mr. Bowser\u2019s farmhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Meanwhile, on the evening of the accident, Mr. Bowser, aged sixty-nine, had used his skidloader to carry a load of firewood to his house. After dumping the firewood, Mr. Bowser drove to the end of his driveway, looked north on Underwood Road, saw no oncoming vehicles, and proceeded to turn right onto the roadway. He then proceeded southbound on Underwood Road at a speed of no greater than six miles per hour. He intended to travel southbound for about 300 feet, then to turn right and park the skidloader in his barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Mr. Bowser ordinarily did not drive the skidloader on public roads at night, and the vehicle was not licensed to be operated on public roadways. There were no taillights or reflectors on the skidloader, nor was the vehicle equipped with the required \u201cSlow Moving Vehicle\u201d emblem on the rear. The vehicle was, however, equipped with two white halogen lights on the front and one on the rear. The three lights were activated at all times here relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">A short distance past Mr. Bowser\u2019s house, Mr. Resh saw the skidloader in the roadway, hit his brakes, and swerved, but the van, nevertheless, collided with the much slower moving vehicle. Immediately before impact, but after Mr. Resh had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>seen the skidloader, Mrs. Resh hollered from the backseat, \u201cWatch out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">B. <em>Testimony Regarding Ownership of the 1994 Van</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">At the time of the accident, the Reshes had been married for approximately thirty-seven years. The 1994 van was titled in Mrs. Resh\u2019s name alone. In regard to the ownership of the vehicle, Mrs. Resh\u2019s testimony was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Q [ATTORNEY FOR THE RESHES]: The van that was being \u2014 that was owned by you and your husband, leading up to November 11, 1999, do you know whose name that van was titled in?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">A: Yes, my name, Josephine Resh.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Q: Okay. Do you know why that van was placed in your name?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">A: Well, yes, because I went and got it, and it was my, you know, our vehicle, but I went and got it in my name.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Q: Okay. Was there any particular reason why your husband\u2019s name wasn\u2019t placed on that vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">A: No. Because everything is 50/50. We just \u2014 it\u2019s his and it\u2019s mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Q: Okay. So how did you consider that van in terms of ownership, from your perspective?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">A: Well, it was in my name, but I never thought about that; didn\u2019t amount to \u2014 the name didn\u2019t amount to nothing, because we share everything, always did that, 50/50. It\u2019s not mine; it\u2019s not his.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">Q: Did you ever attempt to control or attempt to assert control in regard to the usage of that van?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">A: No, I never, never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">(Defense counsel did not cross-examine Mrs. Resh on this or any other subject.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">Mr. Resh testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">Q [ATTORNEY FOR THE RESHES]: Let me ask you a few questions about the vehicle that you were driving. What kind of vehicle was it?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>A: It was a \u201994 Dodge Van, multi-van.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Q: Whose vehicle was that?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">A: Well, when we buy a car we \u2014 everything\u2019s 50/50. So, I don\u2019t know if I had her name on it or if she had my name on it for sure, but the insurance company \u2014 both of our names is on the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Q: Well, I\u2019m not asking about that. I\u2019m asking about, um, if it would be shown, through evidence, that the vehicle was titled in your wife\u2019s name?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">A: It could have. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Q: Okay. Would \u2014 at the time of the accident, did you know that to be the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">A: No, I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Q: Okay. And how was that vehicle used in terms of, you know, how it may have been shared between you and your wife?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">A: When she wanted it, she drove it, and when I wanted it, I drove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Q: When you wanted it, would you have to ask her for permission to use it?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">A: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">Q: When you were driving together, who would drive?</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">A: I drove most of the time, and sometimes she would drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-16\">C. <em>Evidence Concerning Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-17\">On November 11, 1999, Mr. Resh, accompanied by his wife, drove Mr. Dillsworth to a hospital in Cumberland, where Mr. Dillsworth underwent out-patient surgery for colon cancer. The threesome then left the hospital and headed toward Accident, Maryland, where the Reshes lived. On the way home, they stopped at a fast food restaurant in LaVale, Maryland, to get some food. Mr. Resh then drove to his home so that he could pick up some insulin that he needed for his diabetes and also so that he could pick up a blanket and pillow for his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>After about a fifteen-minute layover, the Reshes and Mr. Dillsworth then got back in the van with the intent of driving to Mr. Dillsworth\u2019s home and staying overnight. The Reshes planned to leave from Mr. Dillsworth\u2019s home the next morning and to take Mr. Dillsworth to his doctor\u2019s office for a post-surgery consultation. While driving to Mr. Dillsworth\u2019s home, Mr. Resh stopped at a drugstore so that his wife could purchase some medication that Mr. Dillsworth needed. Their trip then resumed, but a short time later the Resh vehicle was involved in the accident with Mr. Bowser.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">D. <em>Mr. Resh\u2019s Health and Driving History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Prior to the accident, Mr. Resh had suffered from diabetes for about thirty years. He was insulin dependent and was required to take insulin once every morning and once every evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Prior to the accident, Mr. Resh had experienced bleeding behind the eyes (diabetic retinopathy), and he had undergone several surgeries to deal with that problem. His regular ophthalmologist, at all times here pertinent, was Dr. Steven Powell. Dr. Powell\u2019s medical records, which were admitted into evidence, showed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\u2022 March 27, 1995: Dr. Powell noted that Mr. Resh was a diabetic, that at times his sugar levels exceeded 500, that he experienced burning and watering of his eyes and, during a period of two to three years, had difficulty holding his eyes open.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">\u2022 May 24,1995: Mr. Resh previously had cataracts removed but wondered why he still could not see better. Dr. Powell explained that the problem was caused by diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">\u2022 February 2, 1996: Mr. Resh complained that objects seemed smaller and brighter.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">\u2022 August 27, 1996: Mr. Resh complained that his vision was getting blurry and that images looked smaller.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">\u2022 May 9, 1997: Mr. Resh complained that his vision gets foggy.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u2022 August 22, 1997: Mr. Resh complained that his vision was getting dimmer.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">\u2022 December 12, 1997: In Dr. Powell\u2019s notes, under the heading \u201cDiagnostic or Treatment Plan/Options,\u201d the words \u201cavoid night driving\u201d appear. Also, an examining physician at Sacred Heart Hospital felt that the blood vessels in Mr. Resh\u2019s eyes were bleeding and that they needed to be checked right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u2022 February 13, 1998: A note says: \u201cC/O [complains of] VA [visual acuity] not very good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u2022 September 25,1998: Mr. Resh\u2019s visual acuity continued to fluctuate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u2022 August 24, 1999: Mr. Resh continued to complain of watering and burning in his eyes. His visual acuity continued to fluctuate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">\u2022 September 28, 1999: Mr. Resh complained to Dr. Powell that he could not make things out at a distance during a period of two or three years and that this had gotten worse lately. His vision was tested and was recorded as 20/60 in one eye and 20/80 in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">At the time of Mr. Resh\u2019s admission to Garrett County Memorial Hospital shortly after being struck with an air bag in the subject accident, a physical assessment indicated that he complained of blurred vision. While at the hospital, he was given his second dose of insulin for that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Mr. Resh testified that most of the information in his chart was given to Dr. Powell\u2019s secretary. He recalled that when he did complain to Dr. Powell about blurriness he was referring to blurry vision when he looked at \u201creal fine measurements on a rule[r].\u201d He acknowledged that in August of 1997 he told Dr. Powell that \u201chis vision was getting dimmer,\u201d but then Dr. Powell changed the prescription for his glasses and his vision improved. Mr. Resh further testified that his vision would fluctuate with his blood sugar. When his blood sugar \u201cwas up,\u201d he \u201ccould see,\u201d but when it went too low, his vision would become blurry. He also admitted telling Dr. Powell that he could not see things at a distance and that the problem was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>worse lately; he said, however, that he was referring to his inability to \u201cread a rule[r].\u201d He testified that he could clearly see things at a distance, such as birds on a power line, which he could see at a distance of three \u2014 or four-hundred feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">In regard to the evening of the accident, Mr. Resh testified that he was experiencing no vision problems. He said that, immediately after the air bag was deployed upon impact of the van with the skidloader, he was gasping for air and might have been knocked unconscious. He also said that being struck by the air bag might have caused his blurry vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Mr. Resh had been, at the time of the accident, a licensed driver in Maryland for over thirty-five years. He had no restrictions on his license and denied he had never been advised by Dr. Powell to avoid driving at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Mrs. Resh acknowledged that she accompanied her husband during his visits to Dr. Powell\u2019s office. She also went into the examining room with her husband and was present during all discussions between Dr. Powell and her husband. She testified that Dr. Powell had never told her husband to avoid night driving. Mrs. Resh also testified that her husband frequently drove at night and that, prior to the subject accident, he had never been involved in any other vehicular accidents. Moreover, his Maryland license had never been suspended or revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Dr. Thomas R. Friberg, a board certified ophthalmologist, testified on behalf of Mr. Bowser. He reviewed deposition testimony of Mr. Resh, along with Mr. Resh\u2019s medical records. He testified, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Mr. Resh suffered from diabetic retinopathy, which affects visual acuity, the ability to observe objects at a distance, the ability to perceive light, as well as the ability to see at night. In his opinion, but for the existence of Mr. Resh\u2019s visual impairment, he would have been able to see the Bowser vehicle in sufficient time to avoid the accident. According to Dr. Friberg\u2019s testimony, Mr. Resh\u2019s vision, at the time of accident, with glasses, was 20/60 in one eye and 20/80 in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"AiE\">\n<em>First Issue Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Mr. Bowser contends that the trial court erred when, after all the evidence had been presented, it denied his motion for partial judgment on the issues of agency and imputed negligence. In this regard, he claims: (1) Mr. Resh\u2019s negligence should, as a matter of law, have been imputed to Mrs. Resh;</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">(2) Mr. Resh, as a matter of law, was the agent of Mrs. Resh;</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">(3) Mr. Resh, as a matter of law, was the agent of Mr. Dillsworth; and (4) Mrs. Resh was also the agent of Mr. Dillsworth and therefore her imputed negligence should be attributed to Mr. Dillsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">A. <em>Imputed Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In <em>Mackey v. Dorsey, </em>104 Md.App. 250, 262-63, 655 A.2d 1333 (1995), Judge Alpert, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArQG\">Appellants ... rely on the theory, not entirely different from their agency theory, that Cooper\u2019s negligence may be imputed to Dorsey. In a leading case on imputed negligence, <em>Smith v. Branscome, </em>251 Md. 582, 595, 248 A.2d 455 ... (1968), the Court of Appeals summarized this theory as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">[U]nder Maryland tort law, an owner because of his presumed control over his car when present though not physically handling the wheel, may be held liable in the event of a collision, to the same extent as if he were manually controlling or operating the vehicle. In such a case the negligence of the driver is said to be imputed to the owner. However, an agency relationship is not necessary to be shown, for the failure of the owner, who is present, to exercise his presumed control makes him liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">(quoting <em>Gray v. Citizens Casualty Co., </em>286 F.2d 625, 627 (4th Cir.1960)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">The driver\u2019s negligence is imputed to the owner on the basis that \u201cthe owner-passenger retains his right to control the movements of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Co. v. Stroh, </em>314 Md. 176, 181, 550 A.2d 373 ... (1988). In <em>Powers v. State, </em>178 Md. 23, 28, 11 A.2d 909 ... (1940), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">It is well established that the owner of an automobile, who is riding in it while driven by another, is not relieved of responsibility because he is not personally at the wheel, when he tacitly assents to the manner in which it is driven.... If the car is negligently operated, it is presumed that the owner consented to the negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMU\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stroh, </em>314 Md. 176, 550 A.2d 373 (1988), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">[W]here an automobile owner-passenger grants permission to another to drive his car, and the permissive operator drives negligently, the owner has presumptively consented to the negligence, which becomes imputed to him. The imputation is made based upon the theory that the owner-passenger retains his right to control the movements of the vehicle. Conversely, rebuttal of the presumption of right to control precludes imputation of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 181, 550 A.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In <em>Stroh, </em>the Court held that the negligence of the husband, as the driver and co-owner of the vehicle involved in the accident, could not be imputed to his wife, a co-owner/passenger, so as to bar the wife from recovering for injuries caused in a collision between the vehicle driven by her husband, and another driven by a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 182-85, 550 A.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"AF1\">The <em>Stroh </em>Court explained its rationale as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">In <em>Pavlos v. Albuquerque, </em>82 N.M. 759, 487 P.2d 187, 193 (1971), the New Mexico Court of Appeals drew a pertinent distinction between the sole-owner and co-owner situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT0\">Where a non-owner is driving, and the owner is present in the car, a presumption exists that the driver is the agent of the owner. [Citation]. This presumption is based on the theory that the owner, present in the car, has the right to control the driver. [Citation], <em>No such theory is applicable where one co-owner is driving and the other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>co-owner is a passenger. It is inapplicable because the co-owners are equal in status and ownership; the co-ownership refutes agency. </em>[Citation]. Since, as between co-owners, presence is an insufficient basis for a presumption of agency, we do not reach the reality of a \u201cright to control\u201d a car speeding down the highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Finally, in <em>Kalechman v. Drew Auto. Rental, Inc., </em>33 N.Y.2d 397, 353 N.Y.S.2d 414, 416, 308 N.E.2d 886, 888 (1973), the New York Court of Appeals, before abandoning altogether the doctrine of imputed negligence, described the rule as follows: \u201cThe driver\u2019s negligence will be imputed to the passenger to defeat his action whenever the passenger has the exclusive authority to control the operation of the vehicle----\u201d Significantly, the New York Court limited the doctrine to only those instances where the passenger has <em>exclusive </em>authority over the vehicle\u2019s operation. <em>In a co-owner situation, such as existed between Richard and Ellen Stroh, the passenger, at most, enjoys a non-exclusive, mutual authority to control the vehicle\u2019s operation, and consequently, application of the doctrine of imputed negligence is simply inapt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Moreover, imputation of negligence to Ellen Stroh would not further the primary policy aim undergirding the doctrine of imputed negligence, namely, that of locating a \u201cdeep pocket\u201d to provide recovery to an innocent victim of another\u2019s negligence. Instead, imputing Richard Stroh\u2019s negligence to his wife, as Nationwide beseeches us to do, the victim of the negligence of a third-party tortfeasor, would be unjustly barred from recovery. As the court stated in <em>LaMonte v. DeDiego, </em>274 So.2d 254 (Fla.App.1973): \u201cit is important to distinguish cases in which the <em>liability </em>of an owner or co-owner is in issue from those in which that owner seeks <em>recovery </em>from a negligent party.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 183-85, 550 A.2d 373 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">The question then becomes was there evidence from which a rational jury could find that the 1994 van driven by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Mr. Resh was co-owned by Mr. and Mrs. Resh. If that question is answered in the affirmative, Mr. Bowser\u2019s motion for judgment as to imputed negligence should have been denied based on <em>Stroh </em>because there can be no imputed negligence between co-owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">It is true, of course, that the undisputed evidence was that the 1994 van was titled in Mrs. Resh\u2019s name alone. But this fact is not determinative as to ownership. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Am. Auto. Ins., </em>220 Md. 497, 154 A.2d 826 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">This Court, and a majority of those of other jurisdictions, have rejected [the contention made by Liberty Mutual] by holding that title registration merely raises a presumption of ownership, which, not being conclusive, is rebuttable by evidence to the contrary if such is produced. It is, therefore, clearly a question for the trier of the facts to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 500,154 A.2d 826 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was testimony, if believed, that despite the registration of the vehicle, Mr. and Mrs. Resh were, in fact, joint owners. <em>See </em>testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Resh, reviewed in Part IB, <em>supra. </em>Therefore, the trial judge did not err in denying Mr. Bowser\u2019s motion for partial judgment as to the issue of imputed negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>B. <em>Agency</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The ease of <em>Faith v.

Timothy Keefer was involved in an accident when driving a motor vehicle eo-owned by Rebecca and Henry Faith. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 736 A.2d 422. Keefer drove the motor vehicle off the roadway and struck a utility pole, killing his passenger, Rebecca Faith (\u201cMrs. Faith\u201d). <em>Id. </em>In <em>Faith, </em>Judge Hollander, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">Appellants [including Mrs. Faith\u2019s husband] contend that, even if the Answers [to Interrogatories] were properly considered, the lower court erred in granting summary judgment based on principles of agency, because the evidence was not sufficient to establish, as a matter of law, a principal-agent relationship between Rebecca and Keefer. Appellants essentially claim that the trial court erred because it based its decision on appellee\u2019s self-serving, uncorroborated assertion in the Answers that, when he and the decedent \u201cwere leaving Shoenagles [she] took the keys to her vehicle, threw them on the ground and told [appellee], \u2018You drive, you\u2019re driving home.\u2019 \u201d Appellants maintain that there was no evidence from which the court could infer that Rebecca retained direction, supervision, and control over Keefer to establish an agency relationship as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">Relying on <em>Slutter v. Homer, </em>244 Md. 131, 139, 223 A.2d 141 ... (1966), appellee [Keefer] posits that an agency relationship existed, as a matter of law, which defeated appellants\u2019 claims. In determining whether an agency theory applies, Keefer urges us to consider \u201cthe relationship of the parties and the nature of the expedition during which the accident occurred.\u201d <em>Appellee points to the undisputed facts that Rebecca owned the vehicle and he was driving them to the boarding house </em>[where Rebecca and appellee lived].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\u201cAgency is the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>consent by the other so to act.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958). In <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 735 A.2d 1039 ...

It was far from clear whether Mrs. Resh had a right to control her husband\u2019s actions on the night of the accident or whether Mr. Resh had a duty to act primarily for Mrs. Resh\u2019s benefit. Under such circumstances, \u201cwhether an agency relationship was actually created\u201d between Mr. and Mrs. Resh was a \u201cfactual matter ... [that] must be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>Faith, supra, </em>127 Md.App. at 740, 736 A.2d 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">In the case at hand, Mr. Bowser argues that, based on the undisputed facts presented at trial, the jury could not have appropriately found that the presumption of agency had been rebutted. According to appellant, Mr. Resh was operating Mrs. Resh\u2019s vehicle in the course of transporting Mrs. Resh and her father \u201cto the hospital for pre-arranged medical care.\u201d This last statement is untrue. At the time of the accident, Mr. Resh was driving the van to his father-in-law\u2019s house where he and his wife and Mr. Dillsworth planned to stay the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Appellant continues: \u201cJosephine I. Resh was benefited by Francis E. Resh\u2019s operation of the Resh vehicle as it freed [Mrs. Resh] to attend to her father\u2019s needs during the trip.\u201d At trial, there was no testimony that the reason Mr. Resh drove was to allow Mrs. Resh to give medical care to her father. In fact, there was no testimony that Mrs. Resh did render medical care to her father during the trip in question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>i.e., the trip from the Resh\u2019s home in Accident, Maryland, to the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Appellant also claims that Mrs. Resh\u2019s \u201cdeposition testimony made it clear that she was in charge of the trip and that [Mr. Resh] could only have been acting for her benefit and for the benefit of [Mr. Dillsworth].\u201d The deposition testimony that was read into evidence at trial simply does not support the foregoing assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Appellant also contends that his motion for partial judgment should have been granted as to his claim that Mr. Resh was acting, at the time of the accident, as the agent of Mr. Dillsworth \u201cwithin the scope of his agency.\u201d According to appellant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">[a]ll aspects of the trip from Garrett County to Sacred Heart Hospital, from Sacred Heart Hospital to the [place where they stopped to eat], from [the place where they stopped to eat] to the Dill[s]worth home, from the Dill[s]worth home to the [drugstore where medicine was purchased], and from [the drugstore] back to the Dill[s]worth home were undertaken for the benefit of [Mr. Dillsworth] ... as well as for the benefit of [Mrs. Resh].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">There was no evidence that the trip was taken for the benefit of Mrs. Resh. The trip did benefit Mr. Dillsworth, but that fact, standing alone, does not necessarily show that an agency relationship existed between Mr. Dillsworth and the driver of the vehicle because the evidence was, at a minimum, unclear as to whether Mr. Resh ever consented to a principal-agency relationship with his father-in-law. <em>See Green v. H &amp; R Block, </em>355 Md. 488, 506, 735 A.2d 1039 (1999) (for an agency relationship to exist, it must be shown that both the principal and agent consented to the establishment of such a relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Here, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, Mr. Dillsworth did not have a right to control his son-in-law, nor did he ever even attempt to exercise such a right, and Mr. Dillsworth never assented to establishment of such a relationship. The same can be said as to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>contention that, as a matter of law, Mrs. Resh was the agent of her father, Mr. Dillsworth. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellees, the evidence supported a finding that Mrs. Resh and her husband, at the time of the accident, were simply helping out a sick relative, and none of the plaintiffs consented to the establishment of a principal-agent relationship. Therefore, the trial judge did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for partial judgment as to any of the agency or imputed negligence theories put forth by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Appellant contends that the motions court erred when, prior to trial, it denied his motion for partial summary judgment on the issues of agency and imputed negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">In <em>Metropolitan Mortgage Fund, Inc. v. Basiliko, </em>288 Md. 25, 29, 415 A.2d 582 (1980), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">[W]e now hold that a denial (as distinguished from a grant) of a summary judgment motion, as well as foregoing the ruling on such a motion either temporarily until later in the proceedings or for resolution by trial of the general issue, involves not only pure legal questions but also an exercise of discretion as to whether the decision should be postponed until it can be supported by a complete factual record; and we further hold that on appeal, absent clear abuse ..., the manner in which this discretion is exercised will not be disturbed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">More recently in <em>Mathis v. Hargrove, </em>166 Md.App. 286, 304, 888 A.2d 377 (2005), Judge Davis, speaking for this Court, said that \u201cordinarily no party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The only exception to this rule is if the motion for summary judgment is based on a pure issue of law such as the expiration of the statute of limitation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">When the court, prior to trial, denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it was not presented with a pure question of law. Therefore, based on the legal principles set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>Metropolitan Mortgage </em>and <em>Mathis, </em>the circuit court did not commit reversible error when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">IV. <em>ISSUE 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Despite the fact that the uncontradicted testimony in this case showed that Mr. Resh was a licensed driver at the time of the accident and had no restrictions on his driver\u2019s license, Mr. Bowser contends that a jury question was presented as to whether Mrs. Resh negligently entrusted the 1994 Dodge van to Mr. Resh. According to appellant, the evidence introduced at trial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">was sufficient to support a jury verdict that [Mrs. Resh] knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that her husband\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle was significantly compromised and that she nevertheless permitted him to operate the vehicle which was titled in her name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Appellant\u2019s argument that Mrs. Resh knew that Mr. Resh\u2019s abilities were \u201csignificantly compromised\u201d is based on the evidence summarized above concerning Mr. Resh\u2019s eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Negligent entrustment is simply another way of imposing vicarious liability. To prove that the van was negligently entrusted to Mr. Resh, appellant was required to prove that the entrustor (Mrs. Resh) knew, or reasonably should have known, prior to the accident, that Mr. Resh could not see well enough to drive safely at night. The uncontradicted testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Resh was that Mr. Resh drove frequently at night, that there was no restriction on his Maryland driver\u2019s license, that no doctor ever told either Mr. or Mrs. Resh that Mr. Resh should avoid nighttime driving, and that prior to the subject accident Mr. Resh had never had a motor vehicle accident of any kind. Nothing in Mr. Resh\u2019s medical records introduced at trial rebutted any portion of that testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under such circumstances, we agree with the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>judge that appellant had failed to produce sufficient evidence to generate a jury issue as to negligent entrustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">V. <em>ISSUE 4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Mr. Bowser argues that the trial judge erred in failing to submit to the jury the issue of whether Mrs. Resh assumed the risk of injury because she knew, or should have known, prior to the accident that because of Mr. Resh\u2019s vision problems he was unable to operate the vehicle safely at night. For the same reasons as we held that the trial judge did not err when he declined to allow the jury to consider the issue of negligent entrustment, we hold that the court did not err in failing to allow the jury to consider the defense of assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">VI. <em>ISSUE 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Mr. Bowser contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing his claim for indemnification and/or contribution that he filed against Mr. Resh, Mrs. Resh in her capacity as personal representative of the estate of Mr. Dillsworth, and Mrs. Resh individually. Because of the answers the jurors gave on their special verdict sheet, Mr. Bowser did not have a right to contribution against either Mrs. Resh individually or in her capacity as personal representative of Mr. Dillsworth\u2019s estate. Therefore, whether or not the court was in error in dismissing those last-mentioned claims is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">The jury did find, however, that Mr. Resh was negligent and that his negligence was a cause of the subject accident. Therefore, whether the trial judge erred in dismissing the counterclaim for indemnity and/or contribution against Mr. Resh must be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The release signed by Mr. Bowser, when all nonessential verbage is excluded, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>in consideration of the payment of $6,650.00 ... Bowser ... [has] released and discharged ... Francis E. Resh ... of and from any and all past, present and future ... causes of action, claims, demands, damages ... including claims for contribution and/or indemnity of whatever nature, ... resulting or to result from ... [the subject accident].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Mr. Resh\u2019s answer to the original counterclaim filed on June 19, 2002, did not plead release as a defense and for good reason: the release was executed about one hundred days <em>after </em>his original answer was filed. But subsequent to the release\u2019s being signed, Mr. Resh\u2019s counsel did not amend the answer he had filed previously. Moreover, when Mr. Bowser, on January 14, 2005, filed an amended counterclaim in which he once again asked for indemnification and/or contribution from Mr. Resh, the latter filed no answer to the amended counterclaim. Therefore, Mr. Resh\u2019s answer to the original counterclaim stood as his answer to the amended counterclaim. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-341(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Mr. Resh filed a motion to dismiss that was based on the wording of the release. Counsel for Mr. Bowser filed a motion to strike the motion to dismiss on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defense was barred because Mr. Resh had never pleaded release as a defense as he was required to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Maryland Rule 2-323(g) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">Affirmative defenses. Whether proceeding under section (c) or section (d) of this Rule, a party shall set forth by separate defenses: (1) accord and satisfaction, (2) merger of a claim by arbitration into an award; (3) assumption of risk, (4) collateral estoppel as a defense to a claim, (5) contributory negligence, (6) duress, (7) estoppel, (8) fraud, (9) illegality, (10) laches, (11) payment, (12) <em>release, </em>(13) res judicata, (14) statute of frauds, (15) statute of limitations, (16) ultra vires, (17) usury, (18) waiver, (19) privilege, and (20) total or partial charitable immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">In addition, a party may include by separate defense any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense on legal or equitable grounds. WZhen a party has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation, if justice so requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In a written opinion filed three days before trial was to commence, the trial judge denied Mr. Bowser\u2019s motion to strike and granted Mr. Resh\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim. In doing so, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">In his Motion to Strike, Defendant asserts that by Rule, Plaintiffs had 15 days to respond to the amended counterclaim. Md. Rule 2-341. The rule further states that if no new answer is filed, then the answer previously filed shall be treated as the answer to the amendment. Rule 2-322 governs the filing of a motion to dismiss and requires that mandatory defenses be raised prior to filing answer, if an answer is required. <em>Under the same rule, permissive defenses may be raised in any other appropriate manner after the answer is filed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">Since Plaintiffs did not file an answer to the amended counterclaim, their answer to the original counterclaim is their response to the amendment. <em>The motion to dismiss is an appropriate manner to raise the defense of the release and stipulation of dismissal, particularly since there is no prejudice to Defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">As can be seen, the reason the motions judge rejected Mr. Bowser\u2019s waiver argument was because the court believed that release was one of the permissive defenses that \u201cmay be raised in any other appropriate manner after the' answer is filed.\u201d The motions judge misread Maryland Rule 2-322. Section (b) of Rule 2-322 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">Permissive. The following defenses may be made by motion to dismiss filed before the answer, if an answer is required: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (3) failure to join a party under Rule 2-211, (4) discharge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>bankruptcy, and (5) governmental immunity. If not so made, these defenses and objections may be made in the answer, or in any other appropriate manner after answer is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Release is not one of the permissive defenses that may be made in \u201cany other appropriate manner after [an] answer is filed.\u201d Rule 2-322(b) has no application to an affirmative defense such as release, which is governed by Maryland Rule 2-323(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In this Court and in the circuit court, Mr. Bowser relied on <em>Gooch v. Maryland Mech. Sys., Inc., </em>81 Md.App. 376, 567 A.2d 954 (1990), to support his contention that the defense of release was waived by the failure of Mr. Resh\u2019s counsel to plead it as a defense to the counterclaim. John B. Gooch sued Maryland Mechanical and others for libel. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 567 A.2d 954. In the trial court, summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 567 A.2d 954. On appeal, one of the issues raised was whether the defendants/appellees possessed a conditional privilege to write the letter that formed the basis for the libel suit. In <em>Gooch, </em>we held that it was unnecessary to answer that question because the defendants/appellees \u201cwaived the issue by failing to plead specially this affirmative defense in their answer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The <em>Gooch </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">Privilege is an affirmative defense that is required to be set forth separately in the answer. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-323(g)(20) (1989). Appellees did not set forth any affirmative defenses in their answer. In fact, the first time conditional privilege was mentioned by the appellees was in their response to Request for Admissions Under Rule 2-424 dated September 26, 1988. <em>The defense was subsequently relied upon in their motion for summary judgment. </em>The appellees never attempted to amend their pleadings, pursuant to Rule 2-341, to include the affirmative defense of conditional privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">The appellees argue that they <em>could </em>have amended their answer under the liberal rules allowing amendment and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>further, that no sanction is provided for failing to include an affirmative defense in the answer. The fact that the appellees could have amended their complaint to include the defense is of no moment. <em>The requirement that affirmative defenses be set forth separately is not a mere nicety; it is designed to give notice to the plaintiff of the defenses asserted to his complaint. This rule prevents unfair surprise and enables a plaintiff to concentrate the focus of his discovery. </em>The fifteen days between the time a motion for summary judgment is filed and the time a response is required is simply insufficient to allow proper preparation for a defense not relied upon in the previous three years. For these reasons, this defense could not properly have been relied upon by the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">The fact that no \u201cexpress sanction\u201d is mentioned in the rules for such a failure to plead does not allow for a different result. In <em>Ocean Plaza Joint Venture v. Crouse Constr. Co., </em>62 Md.App. 435, 490 A.2d 252 ... (1985), <em>cert. granted, </em>304 Md. 163, 497 A.2d 1163 ..., the appellee, an excavation subcontractor, filed a claim for a mechanics lien against property owned by the appellant. At trial, the appellant introduced two documents \u2014 a \u201cGeneral Release of Liens\u201d and a \u201cWaiver of Liens\u201d \u2014 to which the appellees did not object. In its opinion and decree, the trial court established the lien in favor of the appellees, expressly refusing to consider any waiver of the lien. Noting that the appellant failed to assert the affirmative defense of waiver of lien in its answer, this court held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">The trial court correctly excluded the forms of evidence of appellee\u2019s waiver of its lien. <em>The forms could not be admitted for this purpose, because appellant\u2019s failure to plead specially the issue eliminated it from the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 451, 490 A.2d 252____Only those defenses that are expressly set forth in Rule 2-324 (formerly Rule 323b) as being assertable at any time are non-waivable defenses. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 490 A.2d 252.... Thus, we hold that the failure of a defendant to include an affirmative defense in its original answer or a properly amended answer bars the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>from relying on the defense to obtain judgment in its favor. <em>See also </em>Niemeyer &amp; Richards, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>ch. 300 at p. 154 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 384-86, 567 A.2d 954 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Despite the fact that <em>Gooch </em>was relied upon by Bowser in his opening brief, Mr. Resh\u2019s brief does not attempt to distinguish <em>Gooch. </em>In fact, Mr. Resh\u2019s brief does not in any way attempt to address the correctness, <em>vel non, </em>of the motions judge\u2019s ruling that the defense of release had not been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">It is impossible to make any meaningful distinction between <em>Gooch </em>and this case. <em>Gooch </em>dealt with a motion for summary judgment filed on September 9, 1988, which was approximately three years after the original suit was filed; the summary judgment motion was granted on December 21, 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 567 A.2d 954. We held in <em>Gooch </em>that fifteen days between the time a response to a motion for summary judgment was filed and the date a response was due was \u201cinsufficient to allow proper preparation for a defense not relied upon in the previous three years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 567 A.2d 954. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Mr. Resh\u2019s motion to dismiss, which should have been treated as a motion for summary judgment, was not filed until about twenty months after the release was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The case of <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ben Lewis Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>121 Md.App. 467, 710 A.2d 338 (1998), is also apposite. That appeal arose out of a suit by Liberty Mutual for breach of contract against its customer, Ben Lewis Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. (hereafter \u201cLewis\u201d). Lewis filed an answer to Liberty Mutual\u2019s complaint but did not assert the defense of negligent misrepresentation in its answer. <em>Id. </em>at 471, 710 A.2d 338. Liberty Mutual filed a motion for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 710 A.2d 338. Lewis, in its response to the summary judgment motion, claimed that it was not liable to Liberty Mutual because of a negligent misrepresentation that had been made by one of Liberty Mutual\u2019s agents prior to the contract of insurance being executed. The motion for summary judgment was denied, and the trial court allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>jury to decide, <em>inter alia, </em>whether Liberty Mutual had made any relevant negligent misrepresentations. The jury found that Lewis had proven negligent misrepresentation by a preponderance of the evidence. Nevertheless, the jury awarded Liberty Mutual $63,725 on its breach-of-contract count. <em>Id. </em>A post-trial motion was filed by Lewis; the court granted the motion and struck the judgment in favor of Liberty Mutual because the jury had found that Liberty Mutual had made a negligent misrepresentation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On appeal, Liberty Mutual contended that the trial court had erred in striking the judgment in its favor because Lewis should not have been allowed to rely upon a defense (negligent misrepresentation) that was not specifically pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Judge Richard T. Rombo, specially assigned, and speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">In this case, Lewis\u2019s Answer was a recitation of every defense listed in Rule 2-323 that might be applicable to a contract action. By pleading everything, the defendant informed the plaintiff of nothing. We shall here hold that Rule 2-323(a) means exactly what it says: \u201cEvery defense of law or fact to a claim for relief ... shall be asserted in an answer.... \u201d This interpretation will serve to carry out the general philosophy of the Court of Appeals with regard to pleadings. That is, appropriate notice must be given to the opposing party so as to comply with the requirements of due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 710 A.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">In the <em>Lewis </em>case, Lewis argued, in the alternative, that it had complied with the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-323 because it raised the defense of negligent misrepresentation when it filed its response to Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 710 A.2d 338. Lewis relied on <em>Abramson v. Reiss, </em>334 Md. 193, 638 A.2d 743 (1994), in which the defendant did not file an answer to the plaintiffs complaint but instead filed a motion for summary judgment relying on the defense of charitable immunity, which is one of the twenty special defenses listed in Maryland Rule 3-323(g). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>The <em>Abramson </em>Court said, <em>in dicta, </em>that \u201cthe defense of charitable immunity may be raised by a Motion for Summary Judgment. It also may be presented as an answer.\u201d 334 Md. at 195 n. 2, 638 A.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In the <em>Liberty Mutual </em>case, we rejected Lewis\u2019s reliance upon the <em>Abramson </em>case and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">Lewis\u2019s reliance is misplaced. First, <em>Abramson </em>was in a different procedural posture. In that case, the affirmative defense was advanced in a motion for summary judgment in response to a complaint, while Lewis\u2019s defense was raised as an answer to a motion for summary judgment when the case was already at issue. Second, the quoted statement from <em>Abramson </em>is clearly <em>dicta. </em>The precise question was not before the court in <em>Abramson. </em>Moreover, there is contrary <em>dicta </em>from the Court of Appeals in <em>Gilbert v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>304 Md. 658, 500 A.2d 1039 ... (1985). In that case Gilbert, a temporary employee of WSSC, sued the WSSC for negligence. The WSSC responded by moving to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs sole remedy was before the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission. The trial court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment and granted it; the Court of Appeals ruled that there was an issue of fact as to whether Gilbert was an employee of WSSC and vacated the lower court\u2019s order. In its opinion, however, the Court wrote: \u201cThe question of workmen\u2019s compensation as an exclusive remedy should have been raised as an affirmative defense.\u201d 304 Md. at 661, 500 A.2d 1039....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">The Federal cases are instructive. The Federal courts hold that an affirmative defense may not be raised for the first time in a summary judgment motion. <em>In re Jackson Lockdown/MCO, </em>568 F.Supp. 869, 886 (D.Mich.1983); <em>Local 149, Boot and Shoe Workers Union, AFL/CIO v. Faith Shoe Company, </em>201 F.Supp. 234, 238 (D.Pa.1962). The Federal courts permit affirmative defenses to be raised for the first time on summary judgment when the motion is filed in response to the plaintiffs Complaint. <em>Livingston School District Nos. 4 &amp; 1 v. Keenan, </em>82 F.3d 912, 917 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Cir.1996); <em>Williams v. Murdoch, </em>320 F.2d 745, 749 (3rd Cir.1964 [C.A.D.C.1963]); <em>Katz v. Connecticut, </em>307 F.Supp. 480, 483 (D.Conn.1969), aff'd. <em>per curiam, </em>433 F.2d 878 (1970). Thus the Federal rule, which seems to be clearly-established, is that an affirmative defense may be raised for the first time by summary judgment motion when that motion is the defendant\u2019s initial response to the plaintiffs complaint. <em>U.S. v. Burzynski Cancer Research Institute, </em>819 F.2d 1301, 1307 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Funding Systems Leasing Corp. v. Pugh, </em>530 F.2d 91, 96 (5th Cir.1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">On the facts presented by this case, we hold that asserting a defense for the first time in response to a motion for summary judgment, when the case is at issue, does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 2-323....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\"><em>Liberty Mutual, </em>121 Md.App. at 480-81, 710 A.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Because of Lewis\u2019s failure to specifically plead negligent misrepresentation, we reversed and reinstated the judgment that previously had been entered in favor of Liberty Mutual. <em>Id. </em>at 481, 710 A.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">In the case at hand, the motion to dismiss filed by the Reshes should have been treated as a motion for summary judgment because the movants relied upon the release, which was a \u201cmatter outside the pleadings.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-322(c). Due to the fact that Mr. Resh never filed an answer, or an amended answer, setting forth release as a defense, the trial court should not have allowed him to rely upon that defense as a ground for the grant of the motion for summary judgment. <em>See Gilbert v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>304 Md. 658, 661, 500 A.2d 1039 (1985); <em>Liberty Mut. v. Ben Lewis, </em>121 Md.App. at 480-81, 710 A.2d 338; <em>Gooch v. Maryland Mech., </em>81 Md.App. at 386-88, 567 A.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">The trial judge, in his instructions to the jury as to the issue of contributory negligence, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">The ... plaintiffs cannot recover if their negligence is the cause of injury.... The Defendant has the burden of prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence was a cause of the Plaintiffs\u2019 injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Also, in instructing the jury in regard to alleged violations by Mr. Bowser of various sections of the Transportation Article, the trial judge said in his instructions, \u201cThe violation of a statute, which is the cause of Plaintiffs\u2019 injury or damage, is evidence of negligence.\u201d In this appeal, Mr. Bowser argues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">The lower court erred when it instructed the jury that a finding of contributory negligence would operate to bar Resh\u2019s recovery, thereby inviting reference to injuries contrary to its <em>in limine </em>ruling, and when it referred to injuries while instructing the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">According to Mr. Bowser, these instructions \u201cinvited Resh to deviate from the <em>in limine </em>ruling by arguing to the jury, as they did, that attributing [Mr. Resh\u2019s] negligence to Josephine I. Resh and Elmer H. Dillsworth, whether on the basis of imputed negligence or agency, would prevent their recovery.\u201d Mr. Bowser\u2019s argument continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">[The Reshes\u2019 counsel\u2019s argument] constituted an indirect, but clear reference to the existence of underlying injuries and damages and only could have prejudiced the jury in favor of Resh on the issues of imputed negligence and agency, thereby unfairly minimizing the prospect that the jury would attribute [Mr. Resh\u2019s] negligence to anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Appellant goes on to argue that proof of this last point was \u201cevidenced by the fact that the jury found that [Mr. Resh] was negligent and that his negligence was a cause of the [a]ccident, but in spite of overwhelming evidence of imputed negligence and agency, found against Bowser on all of these issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Mr. Bowser\u2019s attorney objected to the judge\u2019s use of the word \u201cinjuries\u201d in his instruction. In doing so, counsel characterized the court\u2019s use of the word as \u201cinadvertent.\u201d But, appellant\u2019s counsel thereafter made no objections to any portion of the closing argument made by appellees\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>We fail to see how Mr. Bowser was in any way prejudiced by the trial judge\u2019s inadvertent use of the word \u201cinjuries.\u201d This is important because in order for an appellant in a civil case to succeed on appeal, the appellant must show not only error but prejudicial error. <em>See Bradley v. Hazard Tech. Co., Inc., </em>340 Md. 202, 206, 665 A.2d 1050 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The jury was instructed during the trial that the only issue it had to determine was liability, and the special verdict sheet, filled out by the jury foreman, did not even mention contributory negligence. The only question relevant to \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d was Question No. 2, where the jury was asked: \u201cDo you find that Francis Resh was negligent and that his negligence was a cause of the accident on November 11, 1999?\u201d The jury answered yes to that question, which barred the Reshes from making a recovery for loss of consortium. Appellant did not object to the wording of the verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Because appellant has failed to show prejudice, we hold that the trial judge did not commit reversible error by inadvertently referring to injuries in his jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Appellant\u2019s last contention is that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or for new trial. According to appellant, the trial court \u201cshould have granted Bowser\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict for all of the same reasons the lower court should have granted Bowser\u2019s motion for judgment at the close of the Plaintiffs evidence and at the close of all the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict can only be granted on the grounds advanced in support of a motion for judgment made at the close of all the evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-532(a). All the reasons Mr. Bowser\u2019s counsel gave at the close of the evidence for the grant of judgment have been discussed, <em>supra, </em>in Part II where we discussed the first issue presented. Our holding that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s partial motion for judgment on the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of agency and imputed negligence are dispositive of appellant\u2019s claim that the trial judge should have granted the post trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Appellant also asserts that the motion for new trial should have been granted \u201cfor the reasons stated herein.\u201d The reasons set forth by appellant have all been discussed <em>supra. </em>We hold that no reason set forth in appellant\u2019s brief required that a new trial be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">JUDGMENT GRANTING THE MOTION TO DISMISS MR. BOWSER\u2019S COUNTERCLAIM FOR CONTRIBUTION AGAINST FRANCIS RESH REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">ALL OTHER JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID EIGHTY PERCENT BY CARLTON BOWSER AND TWENTY PERCENT BY FRANCIS RESH.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\">. An amended complaint was filed in June 2002, but there were no changes in that complaint that are material to any issue raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-17\">. After the appeal was filed, the parties stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-18\">STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-19\">The parties, by counsel, hereby confirm and memorialize their agreement, previously referred to in the record, and acknowledged by the June 3, 2005 order of the Honorable James S. Sherbin, that this case was to be and was tried, on issues pertaining to liability only, the parties previously having resolved all issues of damages by agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-20\">Accordingly, the parties also stipulate and agree that the appeal noted by Defendant Bowser in these proceedings is an appeal from a final judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">. Even if the appellees had failed to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that the vehicle was jointly owned, the trial judge would still not have erred by denying Mr. Bowser's motion for partial judgment as to the issue of imputed negligence. The doctrine of imputed negligence is based on the presumption that the owner has a right to control the operator of a vehicle. <em>Nationwide v. Stroh, </em>314 Md. at 181, 550 A.2d 373. That presumption is a rebuttable one. <em>Williams v. Wheeler, </em>252 Md. 75, 85, 249 A.2d 104 (1969). Moreover, \u201cthe weight of the presumption is minimal, and while normally, it will be a jury question whether the owner has rebutted the presumption, in a proper case, the presumption may be rebutted as a matter of law.\" <em>Stroh, </em>314 Md. at 181, 550 A.2d 373. Here, at a minimum, a jury issue was presented as to whether the presumption that Mrs. Resh had the right to control her husband had been rebutted. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Reshes, the jury could have found that Mrs. Resh had relinquished her right to control the driver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b659-10\">.
