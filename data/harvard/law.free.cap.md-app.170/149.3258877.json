He filed a pretrial motion in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking to have the physical evidence suppressed on the ground that the police, albeit with an impeccable search and seizure warrant, entered the premises to be searched without knocking on the door, in ostensible violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The motion to exclude the evidence on that ground was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">A State Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The State has appealed, pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-302(c), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">(c) <em>Criminal case. </em>\u2014 In a criminal case, the State may appeal as provided in this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">(3)(i) In ... cases under \u00a7\u00a7 5-602 through 5-609 and \u00a7\u00a7 5-612 though 5-614 of the Criminal Law Article, <em>the State may appeal from a decision of a trial court that excludes evidence offered by the State </em>or requires the return of property <em>alleged to have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, </em>the Constitution of Maryland, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">(iii) Before taking the appeal, the State shall certify to the court that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and that the evidence excluded or the property required to be returned is substantial proof of a material fact in the proceeding. <em>The appeal shall be heard and the decision rendered within 120 days of the time that the record on appeal is filed in the appellate court. Otherwise, the decision of the trial court shall be final.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">(iv) If the State appeals on the basis of this paragraph, and if on final appeal the decision of the trial court is affirmed, the charges against the defendant shall be dismissed in the case from which the appeal was taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A04\">(Emphasis supplied). Accordingly, our decision in this case, should we opt to reverse, must be filed no later than September 14, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In terms of the standard of appellate review of an exclusionary ruling, any boiler-plate recitation about 1) deferring to the fact-finding of the trial judge and 2) taking that version of the facts most favorable to the prevailing party is utterly pointless in this case. We shall not be reviewing any fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We shall review only the hearing judge\u2019s ultimate conclusory ruling that the absence of a knock amounted, <em>ipso facto, </em>to an unreasonable and, therefore, unconstitutional entry of the place to be searched. Our review in such a case consists of making, <em>de novo, </em>our own independent constitutional appraisal. <em>State v. Carroll, </em>383 Md. 438, 445-46, 859 A.2d 1138 (2004); <em>Dashiell v. State, </em>374 Md. 85, 93-94, 821 A.2d 372 (2003); <em>Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 432, 769 A.2d 879 (2001); <em>Cartnail v. State, </em>359 Md. 272, 282, 753 A.2d 519 (2000); <em>Riddick v.

State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Philosophical Teasers That Appear to Be Moot</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">This case had promise of leading us to a hidden treasure trove of intriguing nuances about the phenomenon (or phenomena) of knocking and announcing, had not that inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>been unceremoniously short-circuited by <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">A vintage conundrum has always been that of whether there is any sound when a great tree falls in a forest but no animal ear is within range of the percussive impact. The answer depends, of course, upon one\u2019s conceptualization of sound. The same spirit of intellectual inquiry leads us to wonder whether it makes any difference if a policeman enters a home without knocking if there is no one within to hear a knock in any event. That answer will depend upon the purpose of the knock. Is it to give notice to an occupant of an impending police entry or is it only a mechanical drill movement in a required manual of arms?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Another intriguing question, also rudely aborted by <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>is that of how to knock (or should one knock) on an open door. And how does one knock if there is no door at all?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> How does one knock on the flap of a tent? Should one knock on a classical Japanese paper house if the result would be a fist through the wall? Should the police carry a knocking board with them as standard equipment? Will we ever be reduced to measuring a knock\u2019s decibel level or to evaluating its acoustical carrying power? Was it for this that the embattled farmers stood at Concord Bridge? We were well on the way to drowning in contentious urging such silliness and triviality when <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>administered a merciful <em>coup de grace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Intertwined with these questions, of course, is the tantalizing semantic teaser of whether \u201cknock and announce\u201d is a single indivisible phenomenon or a double-barreled requirement in the unforgiving conjunctive. If the announcement of police presence is loud and clear, is a subsequent (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>an antecedent) knock a relentlessly additional Fourth Amendment prerequisite, or is it merely an exclamation point? If the giving of notice is the animating purpose, does not the announcement alone do the trick? Is a police entry after a proclamation, with a bullhorn, \u201cPut your hands in the air; we\u2019re coming in,\u201d unreasonable without an attendant knock?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, is not the pairing of the words \u201cknock and announce\u201d nothing more than a linguistic convention akin to \u201cgoods and chattels\u201d or \u201cgive and bequeath\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A Quiet and Uneventful Entry</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Based on overwhelming probable cause that the hous\u00e9 at 4754 Melbourne Avenue in the Yale Heights area of Baltimore City was being used as a distribution center for contraband heroin, the police obtained a judicially issued search and seizure warrant for that address. At approximately 4:25 p.m. on June 22, 2004, a team of ten officers proceeded to that location to execute the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">When the police arrived, the only person present at the house was the appellee\u2019s ultimate co-defendant, Walter Hooks. Hooks was standing on the front steps and the front door was open.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police announced to Hooks that they had a warrant to search the house. Hooks was detained, and the police entered the house through the open front door. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>entering, the police announced, \u201cPolice. Search Warrant.\u201d They did not, however, knock on the door. There was, it turned out, no one inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">In terms of giving advance notice to an empty house, appellee\u2019s counsel, at the suppression hearing, was adamant that the prescribed drill be followed to the letter whether there is any audience for it or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">There was nothing that has been articulated from the witness stand that is in evidence for the Court to conclude that there was some <em>basis to believe that there was no one inside. But it doesn\u2019t matter. He did not knock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The caselaw, however, focuses not on the drillbook mechanics of giving notice but on the resulting benefit of actually receiving notice. One of the cases cited by <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 935, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995), was the English decision in <em>Pugh v. Griffith, </em>7 Ad &amp; E 827, 112 Eng. Rep. 681, 686 (King\u2019s Bench 1838), which held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB1\">[T]he necessity of a demand ... is obviated, because there was nobody on whom a demand could be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In <em>Goodman v. State, </em>178 Md. 1, 8, 11 A.2d 635 (1940), the Court of Appeals similarly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\"><em>A demand is necessary </em>prior to the breaking in of the doors <em>only where some person is found in charge of the building </em>to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\"><em>Frankel v. State, </em>178 Md. 553, 561, 16 A.2d 93, (1940), similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">An officer ... may break open the doors if denied admittance, but <em>a demand is necessary </em>prior to breaking doors <em>where the premises are in charge of some one.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">Approximately ten to fifteen minutes after the house had been secured, Hooks\u2019s mother arrived home at her two-story rowhouse, accompanied by Hooks\u2019s sister. The mother told the police that she lived there with her daughter. She added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>that she was trying to get rid of Hooks because he \u201ckept getting in trouble.\u201d Hooks himself, moreover, as he took the stand at the suppression hearing, gave his address as 2313 West Mosher Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Hooks gave a written statement to the police, admitting that the drugs found in the house were in his possession. He further testified at the suppression hearing, acknowledging that the police, before entering the house, displayed their badges to him, announced that they had a search warrant for the house, and then handcuffed him before entering the house. His cross-examination explored the circumstances of the police entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Q. So it would be fair to say, Mr. Hooks that when seven or eight Police cars rolled up and you saw Police Officers there, and <em>they announced that they were doing a Search and Seizure Warrant on your house, </em>that <em>you knew they were doing a Search and Seizure Warrant on your house. Is that a fair statement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">A. <em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Q. And it would be fair to say as well that the door was partially open?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">A. Partially cracked.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Q. Partially cracked, partially opened. Would it also be fair to say that <em>the Officers did not use a battering ram or any kind of device to open that door? Is that correct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">A. <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">Q. Would it be fair to say that the Officers were fairly loud in announcing that they were the Police?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">A. That\u2019s incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">Q. They weren\u2019t loud in announcing that they were the Police?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">A. No, ma\u2019am, just the one Officer exited the vehicle, as I said and pointed a gun at me, put the shield and made that acknowledgment and that was all.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">Q. <em>But you knew they were Police and you knew they were executing a Search Warrant at your house? </em>Sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>A. <em>Yes, ma\u2019am.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Knocking For the Sake of Knocking</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">No matter how placid the surface may appear, there is always someone to roil the waters. The appellee, who was not present at 4754 Melbourne Avenue at the time of the search, moved to suppress the drugs found in the house because the police, albeit fully announcing both their presence and their purpose to the only person present on the premises, failed to follow up that announcement with the formality of a ritualistic knock. However otherwise permissible the entry may have seemed, the appellee argues, the policeman forgot to say, \u201cMother, may I?\u201d or did not wait for a \u201cSimon says,\u201d and all of the physical evidence, therefore, is out of the game. In the phrase \u201cknock and announce,\u201d so runs the appellee\u2019s argument, the emphasis is on the AND.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The insistent theme urged by the appellee, at the suppression hearing and at oral argument before us, was the dual requirement that the police must BOTH announce AND knock. Appellee\u2019s counsel acknowledged that there had been an adequate announcement of the police presence and purpose but demanded the exclamation point of a knock as well.</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">Here the dispute is not about whether thee was an announcement, but <em>whether there was </em>in fact <em>a knock as required by law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Counsel represented to the hearing judge that <em>\u201cSabbath [v. United States </em>] points out that you need both.\u201d The reference is to the <em>pre-Wilson v. Arkansas </em>case of <em>Sabbath v. United States, </em>891 U.S. 585, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828 (1968). We have been over the <em>Sabbath </em>case with a line-by-line examination, and it says no such thing. It nowhere refers to knocking as a requirement at all, let alone as an independent requirement. Indeed, our examination of the <em>Sabbath </em>opinion with a word-by-word microscope reveals that the word \u201cboth\u201d does not appear anywhere in the opinion. The very doctrine being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>examined is not referred to as a \u201cknock and announce\u201d doctrine, moreover, but only as \u201cthe rule of announcement.\u201d 391 U.S. at 591, 88 S.Ct. 1755. The case was decided under 18 U.S.C., \u00a7 3109, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">The officer may break open any outer or inner door ... of a house ... if, <em>after notice of his authority and purpose, </em>he is refused admittance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">At the outset, the <em>Sabbath </em>opinion clearly stated the issue before the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\"><em>The issue in this case is whether petitioner\u2019s arrest was invalid because </em>federal <em>officers </em>opened the closed but unlocked door of petitioner\u2019s apartment and <em>entered </em>in order to arrest him <em>without first announcing their identity and purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">391 U.S. at 586, 88 S.Ct. 1755 (emphasis supplied). There is no way that anyone could conceivably extract from that opinion counsel\u2019s unequivocal statement, <em>\u201cSabbath </em>points out that you need both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">But for the fact this argument prevailed, we would dismiss it as meritless on its face. At the suppression hearing in this case, held three and one-half months before <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>dramatically altered the landscape, the indispensability of the knock itself, notwithstanding an open door and notwithstanding a face-to-face announcement of self-evident police presence, was deemed to be of dispositive and fatal significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Defense counsel concluded his argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\"><em>You must have both. </em>If you accept that there was an announcement, <em>and I don\u2019t think that Mr. Kakis\u2019s Client disputes that, that there was an announcement, </em>that they were there to execute a Warrant. <em>[Sabbath </em>] tells us, <em>Davis </em>tells us,<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> 3901 tells us <footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> that <em>there must be both. </em>And <em>here </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>there was not both. The Police had, </em>at best, <em>an announcement and no knocking </em>as required by the law, whether the door is partially open or not, whether the door is cracked or not. <em>They must knock and announce. They didn\u2019t do both.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The State responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">Your Honor, <em>the purpose of knock and announce is to alert people. People were alerted. The Defendant was outside. He was made aware that the Police were there. </em>... In this particular instance, the Officers assessed the situation and opened the door that was partially opened when they arrived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The absence of the knock, however, was deemed to be constitutionally lethal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">THE COURT: <em>What evidence have I heard that would justify not knocking?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: I think you can infer from the circumstances, Your Honor, that the Officers believed they could enter at that point, because Mr. Hooks was outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">THE COURT: <em>What does that have to do with not knocking?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Well, Your Honor, the door was open. They entered through a partially open door. Whether it\u2019s open this much or open this much. You\u2019re still entering through-</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">THE COURT: <em>Don\u2019t the cases say that you cannot go through a partially open door without knocking?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: They may, but under the circumstances here, Your Honor, with someone outside who could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>alert individuals inside. The Officers made a split second decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">THE COURT: <em>What exception to the knock and announce rule is that?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: None that I\u2019m aware of.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">THE COURT: <em>The Motion to Suppress the evidence seized in the house in question is granted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"AN5\">Knocking is But a Modality of Announcing; It Is Not An Independent Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">That motion to exclude evidence was necessarily based on an alleged violation of the Fourth Amendment. The fountainhead of Fourth Amendment law with respect to the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement is <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. 927, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995). That case held, for the first time, that the \u201ccommon-law knock-and-announce principle forms a part of the reasonableness inquiry under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 514 U.S. at 929, 115 S.Ct. 1914.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">This case\u2019s semantic problem is that, although the act of knocking has never had any independent significance in the caselaw, the word \u201cknock\u201d nonetheless enjoys disproportionate resonance as part of a facile and easily applied label. The common law doctrine that <em>Wilson v. Arkansas </em>constitutionalized is conveniently identified as the \u201cknock and announce\u201d doctrine. The exception to the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement is pithily encapsulated by the phrase \u201cno-knock,\u201d either in the form of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant or a warrantless \u201cno-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>knock\u201d entry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both the words \u201cknock\u201d and \u201cno-knock\u201d fall trippingly from the tongue \u2014 and from judicial opinions as well. When the cases get beyond the label and down to actual substance, however, reference to actual knocking virtually disappears.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">A. Supreme Court Cases Dealing With the Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Although the Supreme Court, like everyone else, regularly relies on these convenient labels, the actuality of knocking itself is of no meaningful consequence. In <em>Wilson v. Arkansas </em>there was no announcement of police presence of any sort, and it is the announcement of police presence at a doorway that has the significance. The announcement could take many forms and knocking might be one of them. <em>Wilson v. Arkansas </em>began its analysis:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\"><em>[T]he reasonableness of a search </em>of a dwelling <em>may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers announced their presence </em>and authority prior to entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">514 U.S. at 931,115 S.Ct. 1914 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion, 514 U.S. at 931-32, 115 S.Ct. 1914, distilled the common law doctrine first and foremost from <em>Semayne\u2019s Case, </em>5 Co Rep 91a, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195-96 (King\u2019s Bench 1603), as it quoted with approval:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">\u201cBut <em>before [the sheriff] breaks </em>it, <em>he ought to signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors </em>..., for <em>the law </em>without a default in the owner <em>abhors the destruction or breaking of any house </em>(which is for the habitation and safety of man) <em>by which great damage </em>and inconvenience <em>might ensue to the party, </em>when no default is in him; <em>for perhaps he did not know of the process, of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>which, if he had notice, it is to be presumed that he would obey </em>it____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. at 932, 115 S.Ct. 1914, also relied upon <em>Case of Richard Curtis, </em>Fost 135, 137, 168 Eng. Rep. 67, 68 (Crown 1757), as that case held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\"><em>\u201c[N]o precise form of words is required </em>in a case of this kind. <em>It is sufficient that the party hath notice, </em>that the officer cometh not as a mere trespasser, but claiming to act under a proper authority ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The Supreme Court cited <em>Lee v.

Arkansas, </em>514 U.S. at 932, 115 S.Ct. 1914, also looked to the academic authorities as it quoted from 1 Sir Matthew Hale, <em>Pleas of the Croum </em>582:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">[T]he \u201cconstant practice\u201d at common law was that <em>\u201cthe officer may break open the door, </em>if he be sure the offender is there, <em>if after acquainting them of the business, </em>and demanding the prisoner, <em>he refuses to open the door.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">The Supreme Court referred to 2 William Hawkins, <em>Pleas of the Crown, </em>ch. 14, \u00a7 1, p. 138 (6th ed 1787):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-15\"><em>\u201c[T]he law doth never allow\u201d an officer to break open the door </em>of a dwelling \u201cbut in cases of necessity,\u201d that is, <em>unless he \u201cfirst signify to those in the house the cause of his coming, </em>and request them to give him admittance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">Justice Thomas\u2019s opinion included all of this precedent as part of \u201cthe common-law principle of announcement,\u201d 514 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>at 934, 115 S.Ct. 1914, and then constitutionalized it, contrasting \u201cannounced\u201d and \u201cunannounced\u201d entries into a home.</p>\n<p id=\"AZy\">Given the longstanding common-law endorsement of <em>the practice of announcement, </em>we have little doubt that the Framers of the Fourth Amendment thought that the method of an officer\u2019s entry into a dwelling was among the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search or seizure....

Arkansas </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abg\">For now, we leave to the lower courts the task of determining <em>the circumstances under which an unannounced entry is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. </em>We simply hold that <em>although a search or seizure of a dwelling might be constitutionally defective if police officers enter without prior announcement, law enforcement interests may also establish the reasonableness of an unannounced entry.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">514 U.S. at 936, 115 S.Ct. 1914 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Between <em>Wilson v. Arkansas </em>in 1995 and <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>in 2006, the Supreme Court dealt with the so-called \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement on three other occasions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997), explored the quality of exigency that may justify a \u201cno knock\u201d entry to execute a search warrant. It required a showing of case-by-case exigency rather than a categorical exigency based upon the type of crime involved. Ironically (and proving our point), the case was analyzed as a \u201cno knock\u201d case notwithstanding the fact that there had been an actual and effective knock on a motel room door by an undercover police officer. What was missing was not the knock but rather an <em>honest announcement of police presence. </em>After the loud and audible knock had been responded to, the officer falsely claimed to be a maintenance man. \u201cNo knock\u201d was obviously just the convenient linguistic label for what was, in fact, a \u201cno announcement\u201d entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>523 U.S. 65, 118 S.Ct. 992, 140 L.Ed.2d 191 (1998), dealt only with the questions of whether an exigency-based \u201cno knock\u201d entry requires a higher level of justification in cases in which property damage is inflicted. In referring to the <em>pre-Wilson </em>federal statute that required prior notice before making a forced entry, however, the Supreme Court pointed out that \u201c \u00a7 2109 [of 18 U.S.C.] codifies the exceptions to <em>the common-law announcement requirement.\u201d </em>523 U.S. at 73, 118 S.Ct. 992 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>United States v. Banks, </em>540 U.S. 31, 124 S.Ct. 521, 157 L.Ed.2d 343 (2003), was a case in which, before entering an apartment to execute a search warrant, the police loudly knocked on the door and announced their presence. The only question was whether a subsequent delay of between 15 and 20 seconds before battering down the door was enough to satisfy the knock and announce requirement. It was. In referring to the knock and announce principle, the <em>Banks </em>Court stressed the verb \u201cannounce\u201d and did not use the verb \u201cknock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">[T]he standard generally requires the police <em>to announce their intent to search before entering </em>closed premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">540 U.S. at 36, 124 S.Ct. 521 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>itself makes only passing reference to the requirements of the common-law principle, and that refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ence is only to <em>the announcement of police presence </em>and not to knocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The common-law principle that <em>law enforcement officers must announce their presence and provide residents an opportunity to open the door </em>is an ancient one.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">126 S.Ct. at 2161, 165 L.Ed.2d at 63 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Our point is that the caselaw does not support the appellee\u2019s hapless effort to make a fetish out of a mere word that has never been the basis for an actual decision and is simply a part of a familiar and convenient label. The use of a handy shorthand expression does not trigger <em>sta,re decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">B. A Federal Statute and the Common Law Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Before the Supreme Court raised the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement to constitutional status in 1995, it had twice earlier dealt with the common law doctrine that it later constitutionalized. Although in <em>Miller v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1958), the Court was dealing with a warrantless entry of an apartment to execute a warrantless arrest, it began its analysis by noting that \u201cthe validity of the entry to execute the arrest without warrant must be tested by criteria identical with those embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109, which deals with entry to execute a search warrant.\u201d 357 U.S. at 306, 78 S.Ct. 1190. Section 3109, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\"><em>\u201cThe officer may break </em>open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, <em>if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">In describing the common law doctrine embodied in \u00a7 3109, the Court focused on the officer\u2019s obligation \u201cto state his authority and purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Whatever the circumstances under which breaking a door to arrest for felony might be lawful, however, <em>the breaking </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>was unlawful where the officer failed first to state his authority and purpose </em>for demanding admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">357 U.S. at 308, 78 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The requirement is one of giving notice by an express announcement. The word \u201cknock\u201d does not even enter into the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>The rule seems to require notice in the form of an express announcement by the officers of their purpose </em>for demanding admission. <em>The burden of making an express announcement is certainly slight. A few more words by the officers would have satisfied the requirement </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">357 U.S. at 309-10, 78 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">If notice has already been effected, moreover, the officer need not engage in \u201ca useless gesture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">It may be that, without an express announcement of purpose, the facts known to officers would justify them in being virtually <em>certain that the petitioner already knows their purpose </em>so that <em>an announcement would be a useless gesture.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">357 U.S. at 310, 78 S.Ct. 1190 (emphasis supplied). What matters is the actuality of notice, not the officer\u2019s performance of a prescribed drill.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\"><em>Sabbath v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 585, 88 S.Ct. 1755, 20 L.Ed.2d 828 (1968), also dealt with \u00a7 3109 and with the common law doctrine that it embodied. The references throughout the opinion were to \u201cthe rule of announcement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">[Ajnother facet of <em>the rule of announcement </em>was, generally, to safeguard officers, who might be mistaken, upon <em>an unannounced intrusion </em>into a home, for someone with no right to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">391 U.S. at 589, 88 S.Ct. 1755 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">The evil at which \u00a7 3109 and the common-law doctrine were clearly aimed was that of an \u201cunannounced intrusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\"><em>An unannounced intrusion into a dwelling </em>\u2014 what \u00a7 3109 basically proscribes \u2014 is no less <em>an unannounced intrusion </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>whether officers break down a door, force open a chain lock on a partially open door, open a locked door by use of a passkey, or, as here, open a closed but unlocked door.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">390 U.S. at 590, 88 S.Ct. 1209 (emphasis supplied). And see Blakey, \u201cThe Rule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry,\u201d 112 U. Pa. L.Rev. 499 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">C. Maryland Case Law</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In the years since <em>Wilson v. Arkansas </em>was decided, the Court of Special Appeals has considered the new Fourth Amendment requirement on six occasions. Although all of those cases resorted to the convenient label of either \u201cknock and announce\u201d or \u201cno knock,\u201d not one of them was concerned with, or even discussed, the physical phenomenon of knocking <em>per se: </em>1) <em>Wynn v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 133, 699 A.2d 512 (1997) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998) (The only issue was whether there was sufficient exigency to forgive the failure to make any announcement at all.); 2) <em>Lee v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 79, 774 A.2d 1183 (2001), <em>aff'd, </em>374 Md. 275, 821 A.2d 922 (2003) (no announcement of any sort); 3) <em>State v. Riley, </em>147 Md.App. 113, 807 A.2d 797 (2002) (no announcement of any sort; a no-knock warrant); 4) <em>Davis v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 144, 797 A.2d 84 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>383 Md. 394, 859 A.2d 1112 (2004) (no announcement of any sort; a no-knock warrant); 5) <em>Carroll v. State, </em>149 Md.App. 598, 817 A.2d 927 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>383 Md. 438, 859 A.2d 1138 (2004) (no announcement of any sort); 6) <em>Archie v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 226, 867 A.2d 1120 (2005) (a good knock and announcement followed almost immediately by a forcing of the door).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">In <em>Carroll v. State, </em>149 Md.App. at 608, 817 A.2d 927, Judge Thieme surveyed the history of the common-law doctrine and encapsulated it as a requirement that the police <em>announce </em>their authority <em>and demand </em>admittance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">Although it is tedious to tell again tales already plainly told, <em>police, </em>at common law, <em>were entitled to break into a house </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>arrest <em>after announcing their authority and purpose for demanding admission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In <em>Archie v. State, </em>161 Md.App. at 235-36, 867 A.2d 1120, Chief Judge Murphy similarly summarized the doctrine as one requiring the <em>announcement </em>of police presence and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AoU\">In evaluating reasonableness, <em>courts consider \u201cwhether law enforcement officers announcef ] their presence and authority prior to entering\u201d a dwelling. </em>\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland, and long has been so, that <em>a police officer </em>executing a search warrant <em>\u2018must give proper notice of his purpose and authority </em>and be denied admittance before he can use force to break and enter\u2019 the premises to be searched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Judge Murphy laid out the threefold reason why <em>unannounced </em>entries are presumptively unreasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">The reasons behind this rule are threefold: (1) <em>\u201cto prevent sudden, unannounced invasions of the privacy of citizens,\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">(2) \u201cto prevent the needless destruction of property,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">(3) \u201cto safeguard the officer who might otherwise be killed by a \u2018fearful householder\u2019 unaware of the officer\u2019s identity or purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">161 Md.App. at 236, 867 A.2d 1120 (emphasis supplied). And see Irma Raker, \u201cThe New \u2018No-Knock\u2019 Provision and Its Effect on the Authority of the Police to Break and Enter,\u201d 20 Amer. U.L.Rev. 467, 469 (1970-71):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\"><em>The policy reasons </em>underlying the announcement rule <em>were to prevent sudden, unannounced invasions of the privacy of citizens, </em>to prevent the needless destruction of property, and to safeguard the officer who might otherwise be killed by a \u201cfearful householder\u201d unaware of the officer\u2019s identity or purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">On two occasions prior to the filing of <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>the Court of Special Appeals had had occasion to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>common-law \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement. In <em>Waugh v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 379, 239 A.2d 596 (1968), the police, in the course of executing a search warrant, \u201cbroke open the door and entered the premises without prior announcement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 239 A.2d 596. This Court held that the exigencies justified the unannounced entry. There was no mention of the word \u201cknock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In <em>Kates v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 688, 284 A.2d 651 (1971), the defendant contended that a search warrant had been \u201cinvalidly executed\u201d because \u201cbefore an officer may use force to break and enter, <em>he must first give proper notice of his purpose and authority </em>and be denied admittance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692-93, 284 A.2d 651 (emphasis supplied). Chief Judge Robert Murphy rejected the contention, holding that the threat of destruction of evidence in a raid on a gambling parlor furnished all of the exigency required for an unannounced entry. The analysis, moreover, was exclusively in terms of <em>announcement. </em>There was no mention of the act of knocking <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It is undisputed that <em>the officers entered the premises without prior demand </em>by using a passkey obtained from the manager of the apartment complex. It is well settled that <em>the law proscribes such unannounced searches. This rule is not, </em>however, <em>without </em>qualification or <em>exception. </em>As noted in <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 204 A.2d 516, <em>an announcement and demand are not requisite where the facts made it evident that the officers\u2019 purpose is known </em>or where such announcement and demand would likely frustrate the search, increase the peril of the searching officers, or permit the destruction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 693, 284 A.2d 651 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">On three occasions since <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>the Court of Appeals has dealt with the new constitutional requirement. In <em>State v. Lee, </em>374 Md. 275, 821 A.2d 922 (2003), the police entered the premises without making any announcement of any sort. Chief Judge Bell summarized the general requirement, both constitutionally and in terms of the common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>doctrine, as one premised on the obligation of the police to give <em>notice </em>of their presence and their purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">It is well settled in Maryland, and long has been so, that <em>a police officer </em>executing a search warrant <em>\u201cmust give proper notice of his purpose and authority </em>and be denied admittance before he can use force to break and enter\u201d the premises to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">374 Md. at 283, 821 A.2d 922 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\"><em>Davis v. State, </em>383 Md. 394, 859 A.2d 1112 (2004), dealt only with the issue of whether \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants were authorized under Maryland law. The phenomenon of knocking did not enter into the opinion. In <em>State v. Carroll, </em>383 Md. 438, 859 A.2d 1138 (2004), there was no announcement of any sort, which was held to have been justified by exigent circumstances. Once again, there was no discussion of knocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">On one occasion prior to <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>the Court of Appeals considered the \u201cknock and announce\u201d principle as a common law doctrine. In <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 204 A.2d 516 (1964), the Court of Appeals had before it a situation in which \u201cthe police officers who executed the search warrant broke open the door of the house being searched <em>without first announcing who they were </em>and making demand that entry be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 204 A.2d 516 (emphasis supplied). The Court of Appeals held that the exigencies justified such an unannounced entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The <em>Henson </em>Court\u2019s discussion of the common-law doctrine was not inhibited or confused by any \u201cknock and announce\u201d label, and the ensuing discussion made it clear that the law\u2019s concern was with police <em>notice </em>to the occupants of the place being searched and with the <em>announcement </em>of police presence and purpose as the core modality for giving notice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">The claim that the evidence seized was inadmissible because <em>the police officers </em>executing the search warrant <em>did not advise those within that they had such a warrant and demand admittance, </em>but broke in forcibly <em>without notice, </em>is an extension of the old rule that <em>a peace officer </em>seeking to arrest an individual who is in a house, either by authority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>an arrest warrant or under circumstances making a warrant unnecessary, <em>must give proper notice of his purpose and authority and be denied admittance before he can use force to break and enter. </em>The reasons for these requirements have been said to be that the law abhors unnecessary breaking or destruction of any house, because <em>the dweller </em>in the house <em>would not know the purpose of the person breaking in, unless he were notified, </em>and would have a right to resist seeming aggression on his private property. This rule of long standing has been transferred to the statute books in some twenty-five states, and in the federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ace\">236 Md. at 521-22, 204 A.2d 516 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The Lack of a Knock Was Immaterial</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">When notice to the only occupant of the house to be searched was patently accomplished by the police announcement of both presence and purpose, therefore, the Fourth Amendment was, we would not hesitate to hold, fully satisfied. A purely ceremonial knock would have served no more additional purpose than a ritualistic touching of one\u2019s nose or a clicking of one\u2019s heels or a twirling about three times in a counterclockwise direction. We are not operating in Oz.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">If the appellee is attempting to make some further point that the knock could have given notice to persons other than Hooks who might have been present inside the house, the overarching reality is that there were no such other persons. The knock, had it occurred, would have been heard by no one. The absence of a knock, therefore, deprived no one of notice. Demonstrably, the appellee has shown no scintilla of prejudice to anyone, let alone to himself. Excluding the evidence on the ground that there was a Fourth Amendment violation because of the absence of a knock was erroneous and, were the question properly before us, we would not hesitate to reverse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Deliberate and Careful Dicta</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Our examination of the Fourth Amendment merits of the police entry in this case, unfortunately, must enjoy only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>status of dicta, albeit, to be sure, that of carefully considered and deliberately articulated dicta. Even if only persuasive instead of binding, it should nonetheless be ranked in an upper percentile of persuasiveness. Our appraisal of the Fourth Amendment merits is not a holding only because we are foreclosed from ruling on the Fourth Amendment merits for two separate and independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In the first place, the appellee lacked the standing to raise the Fourth Amendment merits. In the second place, even if we were to assume, purely <em>arguendo, </em>both standing and a Fourth Amendment violation, the harm resulting from such a violation has now been deemed by the Supreme Court to be too relatively modest and inconsequential to justify, on balance, the heavy sanction of excluding unquestionably trustworthy evidence of crime. We will look at each of these foreclosures in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Standing to Object</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The issue of standing is squarely before us. At the outset of the suppression hearing, the State challenged the appellee\u2019s standing to question the police entry into 4754 Melbourne Road. The hearing judge ruled that the appellee possessed the requisite standing to litigate. The State has appealed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The presence or absence of standing, of course, has nothing to do with the ultimate Fourth Amendment merits. It is exclusively a threshold question of applicability, concerned only with the coverage by the Fourth Amendment of the defendant who seeks to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge. Far from reaching the Fourth Amendment merits, standing settles only the entitlement to litigate those merits. The adjudication of a standing challenge is but a gatekeeping function.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The undergirding principle is that courts are established to litigate \u201clive cases and controversies\u201d and not to settle questions of only academic interest. That latter exercise is left to the law schools. Accordingly, one may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>litigate an alleged Fourth Amendment grievance unless one is personally aggrieved. One must show in the first instance the personal enjoyment of the Fourth Amendment protection that was allegedly violated. A defendant may not seek to vindicate vicariously the Fourth Amendment rights of someone else. <em>Simmons v.

In <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 130 n. 1, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), the Supreme Court was emphatic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\"><em>The proponent of a motion to suppress has the burden of establishing that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violated </em>by the challenged search or seizure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979) (\u201c[T]he application of the Fourth Amendment depends on whether the person invoking its protection can claim a \u2018justifiable,\u2019 a \u2018reasonable,\u2019 or a \u2018legitimate expectation of privacy\u2019 that has been invaded by government action.\u201d); <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980) (\u201cPetitioner, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>course, bears the burden of proving not only that the search of Cox\u2019s purse was illegal, but also that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in that purse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">This Court is firmly in line with that allocation of the burden of proof. In <em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 258, 262-63, 858 A.2d 1100 (2004), Judge Deborah Eyler stated unequivocally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\"><em>The burden is on the proponent of a motion to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds to prove what is sometimes called \u201cstanding\u201d </em>\u2014 that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises or the property.... [T]he motion court in this case found that <em>the appellant did not show that he had standing </em>to assert a Fourth Amendment violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>Simpson v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 263, 276, 708 A.2d 1126 (1998) (\u201cThe burden is on the proponent of a motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized as a result of a constitutional violation to establish that he has standing to complain of a constitutional violation.\u201d); <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 173, 195, 624 A.2d 1257 (1993) (\u201cThe burden of showing Fourth Amendment coverage is, of course, upon the appellant.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 381, 631 A.2d 451 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The Court of Appeals has also spoken to the same effect in <em>Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 545, 842 A.2d 773 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\"><em>The one invoking Fourth Amendment protection bears the burden of demonstrating his or her legitimate expectation of privacy </em>in the place searched or items seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvV\">(Emphasis supplied). And see <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. 11, 26, 537 A.2d 612 (1988) (\u201c[T]he proponent of a motion to suppress has the burden of establishing that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the challenged search and seizure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">In this regard, we find interesting two sentences in the appellee\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Appellee points out that <em>there was no evidence presented by the State </em>during the hearing that shows Appellee didn\u2019t have the authority to exclude others from the dwelling or that he didn\u2019t take steps to maintain his privacy. Moreover, <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>State failed to present evidence </em>showing that Appellee strictly used the dwelling to store and package drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"AWP\">(Emphasis supplied). That argument turns the allocation of the burden of proof completely on its head. We, however, will apply it right side up. The burden is on the defendant to show standing; it is not on the State to show non-standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The Varieties of Fourth Amendment Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">For all intents and purposes, the law of Fourth Amendment standing began with <em>Jones v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). Prior to <em>Jones, </em>the only variety of Fourth Amendment standing that had been recognized was the self-evident situation in which a defendant had a possessory or other proprietary interest in the place searched and/or the thing seized. The defendant was required to show some sort of property right. See <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 194, 624 A.2d 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\"><em>Jones, </em>in 1960, significantly liberalized the law of standing by adding two additional varieties: 1) automatic standing, for cases in which the State charged the defendant with a crime with respect to which the very possession of the thing seized was the gravamen of the offense; and 2) derivative standing, for cases in which the defendant was \u201clegitimately on the premises\u201d searched as the guest, licensee, or invitee of the owner or rightful possessor. This latter was called \u201cderivative standing\u201d because it derived through the property owner to the guest. The guest merely enjoyed, to some extent, what the host enjoyed. The right of the guest was never independent of that of the host. If the host, for instance, consented to a police entry, that would override any objection on the part of the guest. The guest\u2019s right was truly derivative. <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. at 194, 624 A.2d 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Automatic standing enjoyed a shelf life of only twenty years. The handwriting of its imminent demise was inscribed on the wall by <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). By granting a defendant the benefit of use immunity for his testimony at a suppression hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Simmons </em>removed the defendant from what had theretofore been called \u201cthe horns of the dilemma.\u201d Automatic standing\u2019s official obituary was pronounced by <em>United States v. Salvucci, </em>448 U.S. 83, 95, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980). Only proprietary standing and \u201cderivative\u201d standing remained, and they were now cloaked in the language of <em>Katz v. United States </em>(see infra).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Rejection of Target Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In the meantime, however, creative defense attorneys persistently argued for yet another variety of standing, one which came to be called target standing. The theory was that the defendant\u2019s status as the target of an investigation should confer standing in him to challenge any search or seizure that was a part of that investigation. The Supreme Court regularly rejected target standing as a launching pad for raising a Fourth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">There appears to be a possibility, however, that the notion of target standing was at least a factor in the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the evidence in this case. The State moved for a ruling that the appellee lacked Fourth Amendment standing. Although the hearing court went on to a discussion of the reasonable expectation of privacy, the ruling began:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">THE COURT: Motion is denied. <em>The Defendant was the object of the investigation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">(Emphasis supplied). That is the language of target standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\"><em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. at 132, 99 S.Ct. 421, directly addressed the subject of target standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Petitioners first urge us to relax or broaden the rule of standing enunciated in <em>Jones v. United States </em>..., so that any criminal defendant at whom a search was \u201cdirected\u201d would have standing to contest the legality of that search and object to the admission at trial of evidence obtained as a result of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">The Supreme Court pointed out that such a theory would permit a defendant to vindicate vicariously the Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ment rights of someone else, something that the Court had never countenanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><em>Adoption of the so-called \u201ctarget\u201d theory </em>advanced by petitioner <em>would </em>in effect <em>permit a defendant to assert </em>that a violation of <em>the Fourth Amendment rights of a third party </em>entitled him to have evidence suppressed at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">439 U.S. at 132-33, 99 S.Ct. 421 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Supreme Court engaged in an extensive analysis, 439 U.S. at 132-38, 99 S.Ct. 421, of why it had always historically rejected, and would continue to reject, target standing. The rejection was emphatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We decline to extend the rule of standing in Fourth Amendment cases in the manner suggested by petitioners. As we stated in <em>Alderman v. United States ... </em>(1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7x\"><em>\u201cFourth Amendment rights </em>are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, <em>may not be vicariously asserted.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">439 U.S. at 133, 99 S.Ct. 421 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\"><em>United States v. Padilla, </em>508 U.S. 77, 82, 113 S.Ct. 1936, 123 L.Ed.2d 635 (1993), reaffirmed that the only varieties of standing are those based on 1) a property interest or 2) a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\"><em>Expectations of privacy and property interests govern the analysis of Fourth Amendment search and seizure claims. </em>Participants in a criminal conspiracy may have such expectations or interests, but the conspiracy itself neither adds to nor detracts from them.... The case is remanded so that <em>the court may consider whether each respondent had either a property interest </em>protected by the Fourth Amendment that was interfered with ... <em>or a reasonable expectation of privacy </em>that was invaded by the search thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The <em>Katz-Rakas </em>Reformulation</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\"><em>Raleas v. Illinois </em>in 1978 is almost certainly the most significant analysis the Supreme Court has ever delivered on Fourth Amendment standing. At the very least, it was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>most significant statement since <em>Jones v. United States </em>in 1960. In addition to 1) making clear that the burden of proof on standing is allocated to the defendant and 2) rejecting the very notion of target standing, the Court completely recast the language with which we talk about standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The <em>Katz-Rakas </em>reformulation of what constitutes Fourth Amendment coverage was, in effect, a necessary refitting after an eighteen-year shake-down cruise. The \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d language had the salutary effect of being far more nuanced than the \u201clegitimately on the premises\u201d formulation of <em>Jones </em>that had preceded it. That formulation could readily be, and almost always was, treated as an \u201call or nothing\u201d phenomenon, an approach ill-suited to the infinite variety of real life. <em>Rakas\u2019s </em>reliance on the totality of the circumstances, by contrast, permitted adjustments, upward and downward, within shifting shades of gray that the \u201cblack or white\u201d dichotomy of <em>Jones </em>had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Even after <em>Rakas, </em>standing remains, of course, a Fourth Amendment threshold issue. If a defendant can show that he personally enjoyed a Fourth Amendment protection, he thereby has the standing to litigate an alleged violation of that protection. Conversely, if a defendant cannot show that he possessed a Fourth Amendment right, he has no standing to litigate the alleged violation of the right. These core verities have never changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">What has changed, since <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), is the language used to describe the existence of a Fourth Amendment right. If, under the totality of the circumstances, one is now deemed to have \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d that means that one thereby has a Fourth Amendment right and, for that precise reason, has the standing to litigate an alleged violation of that right. Conversely, if one does not have \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d that simply means that one does not have a Fourth Amendment right and, for that reason, has no standing to litigate an alleged violation of a non-existent right. A reasonable expectation of privacy equals a Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ment right equals standing to vindicate that right. A equals B equals C.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">This identity between the expectation of privacy issue and the standing issue was perfectly expressed by Judge Battaglia in <em>Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 337, 885 A.2d 785 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av2\">[AJlthough Whiting did possess a subjective expectation of privacy ... <em>his expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable, </em>and as a <em>result, he did not have standing </em>under the Fourth Amendment <em>to challenge the searches.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">As the measuring rod for the existence of a Fourth Amendment right, with the attendant standing to litigate that right, the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d criterion theoretically embraces both 1) proprietary standing and 2) derivative standing, to use the <em>pre-Rakas </em>terms. Although both concepts are now subsumed in the generic <em>Katz-Rakas </em>formulation, an understanding of the distinction between them remains a helpful analytic tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In terms of the objective component of the reasonable expectation of privacy test, one who enjoys an actual possessory or proprietary interest in the place searched or the thing seized invariably has no problem. An expectation of privacy by such a person is almost as a matter of course deemed to be objectively reasonable. Conversely, when a defendant who has claimed standing pursuant to an ostensible property right is shown to have no such property right, that is invariably fatal to the defendant\u2019s claim of standing. <em>Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 842 A.2d 773 (2004) (mortgagor of a home that had been foreclosed upon); <em>Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 885 A.2d 785 (2005) (squatter in a vacant house). Claims of proprietary standing, good or bad, pose little problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">It is only when we come to the more diluted expectations of privacy, expectations by those we once characterized as having only derivative standing, that the objective measuring of reasonableness becomes more problematic. An expectation of privacy may take various forms, and it is with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>variety once known as derivative standing that the <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>reformulation has had its major impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Appellee Had No Proprietary Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">First, to clear away some of the clutter, we can resolve the issue of the appellee\u2019s lack of proprietary standing in a hurry. There was no shred of evidence to establish any proprietary interest of any sort on the part of the appellee in 4754 Melbourne Road. Indeed, the appellee stated to the police that he lived at 2918 Lake Brook Circle. 4754 Melbourne Road was the home of Walter Hooks\u2019s mother, who lived there with her daughter. She apparently tolerated the periodic presence of her son, Walter Hooks, although she \u201cwas trying to get rid of him because he kept getting in trouble.\u201d Hooks himself gave his address as 2313 West Mosher Street. In ruling on the standing issue, the trial court began with the finding, \u201cWe have no evidence of ownership.\u201d We fully agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The Reasonable Expectation of Privacy And Derivative Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Lacking proprietary standing, the appellee, at most, could claim what, <em>pre-Rakas, </em>might have amounted to derivative standing. Walter Hooks presumably spent some time at 4754 Melbourne Road with the grudging permission of his mother. The appellee inferentially spent some daylight hours at that address with the permission of Walter Hooks. Whatever the appellee enjoyed was derived through Walter Hooks. The issue, <em>post-Rakas, </em>is whether the circumstances of his presence there conferred on him an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in those premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">It is clear that to enjoy Fourth Amendment standing, a defendant must have both 1) an actual subjective expectation of privacy and 2) an expectation that is objectively reasonable. It is now hornbook law that the <em>Katz </em>reasonable expectation of privacy test is two-pronged. <em>Minnesota v. Carter, 525 </em>U.S. 83, 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998), set out the dual requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>[I]n order to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, <em>a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation </em>of privacy in the place searched, <em>and that his expectation is reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In <em>Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 545, 842 A.2d 773 (2004), the Court of Appeals similarly laid out the two-pronged test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYm\"><em>The burden consists of two inquiries: </em>(1) whether the individual has <em>a subjective expectation </em>that his or her property or possessions will not be searched, and (2) whether <em>the expectation is objectively reasonable </em>under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">In <em>Ricks v. State, </em>312 Md. at 26-27, 537 A.2d 612, Chief Judge Robert Murphy described the two-pronged nature of the criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The determination whether <em>a legitimate expectation of privacy exists embraces two discrete questions, </em>viz: <em>the first is whether the individual, </em>by his conduct, <em>has exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy </em>(that he seeks to preserve something as private), and <em>the second question is whether the individual\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable </em>(whether the individual\u2019s expectation, viewed objectively, is justifiable under the circumstances). <em>A legitimate \u201cexpectation of privacy by definition means more than a subjective expectation of not being discovered.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">A Subjective Expectation Alone Will Not Suffice</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The decision of the hearing court in this case appears to have been a ruling with respect to the appellee\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy, but not a ruling as to whether that subjective expectation was one that society would objectively consider to be reasonable or legitimate. The ruling was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqd\">What little evidence we have is that he was using this place regularly. There\u2019s no evidence that it was abandoned prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>erty or anything else. He was operating out of this house. <em>I think common sense tells you that one would not be conducting the type of operation that is alleged without expecting </em>\u2014 reasonably <em>expecting to have some privacy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMvL\">(Emphasis supplied). That reference was almost certainly to a subjective expectation on the part of the appellee that his criminal activity would not be discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>itself explained why such a subjective expectation, standing alone, will never be sufficient to establish standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\"><em>[A] \u201clegitimate\u201d expectation of privacy by definition means more than a subjective expectation of not being discovered. A burglar </em>plying his trade in a summer cabin during the off season <em>may have a thoroughly justified subjective expectation of privacy, but it is not one which the law recognizes as \u201clegitimate. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">439 U.S. at 143 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 421 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\"><em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. at 262, 858 A.2d 1100, also referred to the inadequacy of the subjective expectation of not being discovered as a sufficient predicate to establish standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Fourth Amendment coverage only applies, and hence a violation only may be asserted, when the person asserting the violation had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area invaded at the time of the search. <em>A reasonable expectation of privacy is one society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. This requires \u201cmore than a subjective expectation of not being discovered. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">What Makes an Expectation of Privacy Objectively Reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">As we now narrow the focus, we are looking at an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy by one who is the guest of someone else on someone else\u2019s property. This is the secondary status of protection that <em>Jones </em>referred to as \u201cbeing legitimately on the premises\u201d or what many, <em>pre-Rakas, </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ferred to as derivative standing. In the <em>Jones </em>ease itself, this new and liberalized variety of standing was afforded to Jones, who \u201chad been given the use of the apartment by a Mend. He had clothing in the apartment, had slept there \u2018maybe a night,\u2019 and at the time was the sole occupant of the apartment.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. at 89, 119 S.Ct. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In the wake of <em>Jones, </em>however, there was a widespread, almost universal, tendency to extend derivative standing to anyone who, in the words of <em>Jones, </em>was \u201clegitimately on the premises.\u201d The entitlement to litigate an alleged Fourth Amendment violation seemed, applying that phraseology literally, to reach not only the long term guest with a suitcase under the bed in the guest room but also the mailman three feet inside the back door collecting the postage due on a letter. Both, after all, were \u201clegitimately on the premises.\u201d Such a reading of <em>Jones, </em>however, was a case of the pendulum\u2019s having swung too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The correction of course came in 1978. Looking to the totality of the circumstances and insisting on an <em>ad hoc </em>determination on a case-by-case basis, <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>drastically trimmed back that \u201coverbroad\u201d categorical conferral of standing on everyone legitimately present on someone else\u2019s property. <em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. at 89-90, 119 S.Ct. 469, characterized this cut-back:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\"><em>[WJhile the holding of Jones </em>\u2014 that a search of the apartment violated the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights\u2014 <em>is still valid, its statement that \u201canyone legitimately on the premises where a search occurs may challenge its legality, </em>\u201d was <em>expressly repudiated in Rakas v.

Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990), and <em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. 88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">To switch metaphors, <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>is the positive pole. It is the exemplary instance of when being legitimately on the premises of another will be deemed an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. Olson was \u201cstaying\u201d at the apartment of two friends, a mother and daughter, and had, at the time of the police entry, slept there for at least one night. He had a change of clothes with him. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Olson\u2019s status as an overnight guest is alone enough to show </em>that he had <em>an expectation of privacy </em>in the home <em>that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">495 U.S. at 96-97, 110 S.Ct. 1684 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Justice White\u2019s analysis showed how very similar Olson\u2019s situation was to that in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>as, 495 U.S. at 97, 110 S.Ct. 1684, he quoted from that earlier opinion, 362 U.S. at 259, 80 S.Ct. 725.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\"><em>\u201c[Jones] testified that the apartment belonged to a friend, Evans, who had given him the use of it, and a key, </em>with which [Jones] had admitted himself on the day of the arrest.

Olson </em>as the benchmark, <em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 253, 858 A.2d 1100 (2004), is instructive as an instance of falling short of that benchmark. The place the police warrantlessly entered was the basement apartment of one Christy Dean, who at the time of entry was asleep on a makeshift bed. Alston, who moments before had been observed outside by the police as a possible dope dealer, was first seen holding a semi-automatic handgun, then ran into Christy Dean\u2019s basement apartment, and shortly thereafter ran out again without the gun. The police searched the apartment and found the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The State challenged <em>Alston\u2019s </em>standing to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge. The appellant, who had had a permanent address elsewhere for 16 years, claimed that he had an \u201cintimate\u201d relationship with Christy Dean and that he had been going to her basement apartment to see her \u201cfor a couple of months.\u201d He claimed to have \u201cspent the night at her apartment\u201d from \u201ctime to time.\u201d He \u201csometimes\u201d stayed there for the whole night. 159 MdApp. at 260, 858 A.2d 1100. On the other hand, Alston did not keep any of his belongings there and did not have a key. He did not receive mail there nor have a telephone there. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Judge Deborah Eyler\u2019s opinion looked to <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>for guidance. After noting that the burden of proof was squarely on Alston, the opinion described how Alston had failed to carry that burden.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">In this case, by contrast, <em>there was no factual finding that the appellant was an overnight guest of Dean at the time of the search. The appellant did not testify that he </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>was an overnight guest of Dean that night. </em>His testimony was that \u201cfrom time to time\u201d he was an overnight guest of Dean: that is, sometimes he stayed overnight with her; more often he visited her without spending the night; and for periods he did not visit her at all. Certainly, <em>that testimony did not compel a factual finding that the appellant occupied the status of an overnight guest </em>of Dean on October 10, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">159 Md.App. at 264, 858 A.2d 1100 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In contrast to the appellee in this case, who did not testify at all, Alston did at least testify, albeit very inadequately and only in general terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\"><em>The appellant\u2019s testimony did not offer any factual detail about his connection to 5k West Talbot Street on the night in question. </em>He did not testify that he had been inside the apartment visiting Dean at any time on the day or evening in question or that he was planning to go inside the apartment or to stay with Dean that night. As discussed above, <em>it was the appellant\u2019s burden to adduce evidence showing his status vis-d-vis the premises. </em>It is telling that the appellant did <em>not </em>testify that he even visited Dean or was inside her apartment on October 10, 2002, giving only general information about his visiting habits.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">After thoroughly surveying the national caselaw, this Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\"><em>The appellant\u2019s status as an occasional overnight guest of Dean who did not have the present status of an overnight guest </em>and entered Dean\u2019s apartment in the course of fleeing from the police, to deposit evidence, <em>did not give him an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in Dean\u2019s apartment: </em>that is, one that society is willing to recognize. Accordingly, <em>he did not have standing to challenge the admission of the handgun into evidence on Fourth Amend</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>ment grounds, </em>and the court properly denied his suppression motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">159 Md.App. at 268, 858 A.2d 1100 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>Minnesota v. Carter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">If <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>is the positive pole, <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>is the negative pole. Whereas <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>had held that an individual, legitimately in the home of someone else, did enjoy a Fourth Amendment protection, <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>held that the two petitioners there, also legitimately on the premises of someone else, did not enjoy a Fourth Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>was the acid test for <em>Rakas v. Illinois\u2019s </em>announcement that everyone \u201clegitimately on the premises\u201d of someone else does not necessarily enjoy an objectively recognized reasonable expectation of privacy while on those premises. The holding of <em>Rakas </em>that a mere passenger in an automobile, albeit legitimately present, did not possess a Fourth Amendment protection in that automobile was vulnerable to being distinguished on the ground that it only applied to automobiles, with their lesser expectation of privacy. <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>involved a residential apartment and its holding could not be so readily distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The contrast between <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>and <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>lightens the path as we wend our way through subtle shades of gray. The law keeps a weather eye on the protection of the home as the core Fourth Amendment value. In Sir William Pitt\u2019s classic articulation that an \u201cEnglishman\u2019s home is his castle,\u201d the subject of the castle-like protection is the \u201chome.\u201d There is the animating notion of a zone of habitation into which an individual or a family may retreat from the world in order to eat, to sleep, to relax, to socialize with friends in familial seclusion. In assessing, therefore, which expectations of privacy by those legitimately present on someone else\u2019s premises are objectively so reasonable and legitimate as to be worthy of constitutional protection, the law looks to such factors as the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>relationship between guest and host and the nature of the activity being engaged in by the guest while on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Whereas Olson had been the overnight guest of two friends in their apartment, the petitioners in <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>were \u201csitting in one of [the apartment\u2019s] rooms, bagging cocaine.\u201d 525 U.S. at 85, 119 S.Ct. 469. The petitioners \u201chad come to the apartment for the sole purpose of packaging the cocaine\u201d and \u201cwere only in the apartment for approximately 2 1/2 hours.\u201d The lessee of the apartment had allowed the petitioners to use it in exchange for \u201cone-eighth of an ounce of the cocaine.\u201d 525 U.S. at 86, 119 S.Ct. 469. Reversing both the trial court and the intermediate Court of Appeals, the Minnesota Supreme Court, 569 N.W.2d 169, 176 (1997), held that the petitioners enjoyed Fourth Amendment standing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">[Even though] society does not recognize as valuable the task of bagging cocaine, we conclude that society does recognize as valuable the right of property owners or leaseholders to invite persons into the privacy of their homes to conduct a common task, be it legal or illegal activity. We, therefore, hold that [respondents] had standing to bring [their] motion to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of Thielen\u2019s observations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The United States Supreme Court reversed that decision. It stressed the brevity of the petitioners\u2019 stay, the fact that the petitioners were not overnight guests, and the lack of any previous connection between guests and host.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\"><em>Respondents here were obviously not overnight guests, but were </em>essentially <em>present for a business transaction </em>and were only in the home a matter of hours. <em>There is no suggestion that they had a previous relationship with Thompson, </em>or that there was any other purpose to their visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">525 U.S. at 90, 119 S.Ct. 469 (emphasis supplied). Chief Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion observed that there was nothing, such as staying the night, \u201cto suggest a degree of acceptance into the household.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Nor was there anything </em>similar to the overnight guest relationship in <em>Olson to suggest a degree of acceptance into the household. </em>While the apartment was a dwelling place for Thompson, <em>it was for these respondents simply a place to do business.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">That was the very opposite of the situation in <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>wherein Olson had been welcomed into the household circle of his hosts. The petitioners in <em>Carter, </em>by contrast, were simply on the premises for a commercial purpose, a purpose that generates a significantly lesser expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\"><em>Property used for commercial purposes is treated differently </em>for Fourth Amendment purposes <em>from residential property. \u201cAn expectation of privacy in commercial premises, </em>however, <em>is </em>different from, and indeed <em>less than, a similar expectation in an individual\u2019s home. \u201d New York v. Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, 700, 107 S.Ct. 2636, 96 L.Ed.2d 601 (1987). And <em>while it was a \u201chome\u201d in which respondents were present, it was not their home.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The Supreme Court contrasted the situation before it in <em>Carter </em>with that in <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>and held that being \u201clegitimately on the premises\u201d for a purely commercial purpose was not enough to confer on the petitioners the protection of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">If we regard <em>the overnight guest </em>in <em>Minnesota v. Olson </em>as typifying those who <em>may claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment </em>in the home of another, and <em>one merely \u201clegitimately on the premises\u201d </em>as typifying those who <em>may not do so, </em>the present case is obviously somewhere in between. But <em>the purely commercial nature of the transaction engaged in here, </em>the relatively short period of time on the premises, and <em>the lack of any previous connection between respondents and the householder, </em>all lead us to conclude that <em>respondents\u2019 situation is closer to that of one simply permitted on the premises. </em>We therefore hold that <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>search which may have occurred did not violate their Fourth Amendment rights.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">525 U.S. at 91, 119 S.Ct. 469 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Appellee\u2019s Expectation of Privacy Was Not Objectively Reasonable or Legitimate</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">As with <em>Rakas v. Illinois\u2019s </em>example, 439 U.S. at 143 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 421, of a \u201cburglar plying his trade in a summer cabin during the off season,\u201d the appellee here may have had \u201ca thoroughly justified subjective expectation of privacy,\u201d but it was, we hold, \u201cnot one which the law recognizes as legitimate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">All of the evidence bearing on the appellee\u2019s standing came from the application for the search warrant. We look first at the extent of the appellee\u2019s connection with 4754 Melbourne Road. Although the hearing judge found that the appellee \u201cwas using the place regularly,\u201d the evidence provides no support for such a conclusion. The only information as to time and place came from \u201ca reliable informant\u201d during the month of June 2004. The information was that the appellee was distributing drugs in the Yale Heights area of Baltimore City. The distribution sites were described as 1) the 1900 block of Hollins Street, 2) the 300 block of Monroe Street, and 3) the 1900 block of Frederick Avenue. The informant had been present in those areas when the appellee \u201cdropped off large quantities of heroin to street level dealers to sell in the area.\u201d There was no information linking the appellee in any way to 4754 Melbourne Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The first information dealing with packaging rather than distributing only came on June 22, the day of the search and seizure in question. The information was that the appellee \u201cwas at an unknown location in the Yale Heights area of Baltimore City packaging up a large quantity of heroin.\u201d The only further information from the informant was that the appellee \u201cis driving a white Riviera with Maryland temporary plates and white wall tires.\u201d The police drove to the area and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u201cobserved the vehicle fitting that description parked in the rear of 4754 Melbourne Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The appellee\u2019s first known connection with the premises thus began at some time on the late morning or very early afternoon of June 22. At 12:25 p.m., the appellee was observed to leave the house and drive off in the Riviera. He was subsequently spotted near his drug distribution sites on Hollins Street and South Monroe Street, but the police lost contact. At 12:45 p.m. the appellant drove back to the rear of 4754 Melbourne Road and reentered the house. The appellee left the house again at \u201caround 3:00 p.m.\u201d He was stopped by the police while still in the area and \u201cgiven his <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d He \u201cdenied ever being inside of 4754 Melbourne Road\u201d and \u201calso advised that he has nothing to do with anything found inside of 4754 Melbourne Road.\u201d He was not on the premises at the time of the police entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">This was the full extent of the evidence bearing on the appellee\u2019s contact with 4754 Melbourne Road. It was on a single day and during daylight hours. It lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes plus an undetermined period of time on the front end of the surveillance. There was no evidence of any overnight stay. There was no evidence of the appellee\u2019s having clothing or any other personal belongings in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">There was, moreover, no evidence of any relationship between the appellee and anyone in the house. Walter Hooks, the appellee\u2019s co-defendant, took the stand at the suppression hearing, but was asked absolutely nothing, by the appellee\u2019s attorney or anyone else, about any relationship or even passing contact with the appellee. In this case, the appellee may not even argue that he was the guest of the homeowner. There was no suggestion that he even knew the elder Mrs. Hooks or that Mrs. Hooks knew him. In view of the tenuous, albeit tolerated, status of Walter Hooks, the appellee was, at best, the guest of a guest. That is a far cry from the \u201cacceptance into the household\u201d referred to by <em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. at 90, 119 S.Ct. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>As to the nature of the activity engaged in by the appellee while on the premises, the information from the informant was that the appellee was \u201cpackaging up a large quantity of heroin.\u201d That is indistinguishable from the \u201cbagging of cocaine\u201d that was held by <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>to be insufficient to create a legitimate expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\n<em>Simpson v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">This Court actually anticipated <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>by seven months with our decision in <em>Simpson v. State, </em>121 Md.App. 268, 708 A.2d 1126 (1998). In that case, as in this, the defendant was simply one who was \u201clegitimately on the premises\u201d of a house identified by a confidential informant as a \u201cstash house\u201d for drugs. The defendant there, as the appellee here, sought to establish the standing to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">A lawful occupant of the house was Cherese Rogers. The defendant testified at the suppression hearing that \u201che went to Rogers\u2019s house to have sex with her.\u201d He claimed to have been there \u201ctwo or three times previously\u201d for that purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 708 A.2d 1126. After explaining that the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove standing, Judge Alpert\u2019s opinion pointed out that \u201cmere presence of a criminal defendant at the site of a search is insufficient to show that his rights were violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 708 A.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The defendant in <em>Simpson </em>argued that being on the premises to have sexual relations with the lawful occupant should be enough to confer a reasonable expectation of privacy. One might think that two people, possibly naked and on a bed and wishing to shut out the rest of the world, would have such a legitimate expectation. This Court held otherwise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\"><em>Appellant next contends that because he went to Rogers\u2019s room to have sexual relations, and because society believes that sexual relations should be carried out in private, he therefore had a subjective expectation of privacy </em>in Rogers\u2019s bedroom <em>sufficient to confer standing. The State contends that appellant\u2019s connection with the room, </em>even if appellant were to be believed, <em>was insufficient to allow him </em>sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>expectation of privacy to have <em>standing. State. We agree with the</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 280, 708 A.2d 1126 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Very significant in that case was what the defendant had not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In the present case, <em>appellant had been to the premises, at most, a few times before the date of the search. </em>Regardless of whether the trial court believed Rogers or appellant, <em>appellant had been in Rogers\u2019s room only a short time </em>before the police entered <em>and was not expected to stay for a prolonged period. Appellant did not store any personal belongings in the room. He did not have a key </em>to the premises. He had no right to be on the premises without Rogers or Steele present and he had no right to exclude others, including Rogers\u2019s live-in boyfriend, from the room. <em>We do not believe that appellant\u2019s connection to the premises was sufficient to establish a legitimate expectation of privacy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The defendant in <em>Simpson </em>failed to persuade the judge as to existence of any of those factors. The appellee here did not even try. Unlike a defendant at a trial on the merits who can put the State to its burden of proof, it is the defendant who bears that burden on the threshold question of standing. Although standing can theoretically be established without a defendant\u2019s testimony, it is a lot harder to establish than if such testimony were provided. As a reason for not testifying, a defendant may no longer hide behind the risk of self-incrimination, since <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), held that testimony given at a suppression hearing may not be used against a defendant at a trial on the merits of guilt or innocence. The appellee here, with no reason to remain silent, offered proof of nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">This Court in <em>Simpson </em>frowned even on illicit sexual activity as giving rise to an expectation of privacy that society would objectively deem to be legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The evidence, rather, established that <em>if appellant did expect to have sexual relations with Rogers, he was soliciting prostitution. Given the absence of any other indicia of standing </em>in and to the premises, as discussed above, <em>the appellant\u2019s mere subjective expectation of privacy, </em>standing alone, <em>was not one that society is prepared to accept as reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">121 Md.App. at 281, 708 A.2d 1126 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The opinion flatly foreclosed a reasonable expectation of privacy arising from the stashing of drugs in another person\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention on the issue of standing is that he had an expectation of privacy in Rogers\u2019s room because he and his associate had leased it as a place for counting money. <em>We do not believe, </em>however, <em>that stashing drugs in another person\u2019s room gives the person who stashes the drugs an expectation of privacy that society regards as reasonable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 282, 708 A.2d 1126 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The appellee in this case is claiming that he had a reasonable expectation that the police, before entering, would knock on the door of someone else\u2019s house that the appellee, after packaging heroin there, had left one hour and twenty-five minutes before the police arrived. Objectively, society does not look on such an expectation as reasonable. The appellee had no standing to object to the lack of a knock.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The Exclusionary Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">But even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the appellee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in 4754 Melbourne Road; and even if, <em>arguendo, </em>the absence of a ceremonial knock were a Fourth Amendment violation, it would no longer make any difference. <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006), settled that question unequivocally on June 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>dealt with a violation of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule of <em>Wilson v. Arkansas </em>and, thereby, with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>violation of the Fourth Amendment. The police, with a warrant to search for drugs and firearms, went to the Michigan home of Booker T. Hudson. They announced their presence, but then waited only a short time \u2014 perhaps \u201cthree to five seconds\u201d \u2014 before turning the knob of the unlocked door and entering the home. The ensuing search produced large quantities of drugs and a loaded gun. Hudson\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge was to the manner of their entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The trial court granted the suppression motion, but the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed. It held that \u201csuppression is inappropriate when entry is made pursuant to warrant but without proper \u2018knock and announce.\u2019 \u201d The Michigan Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Michigan decision. It initially noted that in <em>United States v. Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 40-41, 124 S.Ct. 521, it had held that a delay of between 15 and 20 seconds between the announcement of presence and the entry of the home was not, in that case, a constitutional violation. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">When the knock-and-announce rule does apply, <em>it is not easy to determine precisely what officers must do. </em>How many seconds\u2019 wait are too few? <em>Our \u201creasonable wait time\u201d standard ... is necessarily vague.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">126 S.Ct. at 2161, 165 L.Ed.2d at 63 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The Court then breathed a sigh of relief, however, that the \u201cknock and announce\u201d merits were not before it. The State of Michigan had conceded that the Fourth Amendment had been violated, and the Supreme Court considered itself bound by that concession. The only issue before the Court was that of the appropriate sanction for a violation of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Happily, these issues [the merits] do not confront us here. From the trial level onward, <em>Michigan has conceded </em>that the entry was <em>a knock-and-announce violation. The issue here is remedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>also reminded us, to rather general surprise, that <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>when it constitutionalized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(or recognized the constitutionality of) the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule in 1995, had never actually decided whether the exclusionary rule of evidence was an appropriate sanction for a \u201cknock and announce\u201d violation. In <em>Wilson v. Arkansas, </em>the State had asked the Supreme Court to rule, as an alternate holding, that \u201cexclusion is not a constitutionally compelled remedy where the unreasonableness of a search stems from the failure of announcement.\u201d The Supreme Court, however, declined to address the issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">Because <em>this remedial issue was not addressed by the court below </em>and is not within the narrow question on which we granted certiorari, <em>we decline to address these arguments.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">514 U.S. at 937 n. 4, 115 S.Ct. 1914 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The question, therefore, was one of first impression in <em>Hudson v. Michigan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\"><em>Wilson </em>specifically declined to decide whether the exclusionary rule is appropriate for violation of the knock-and-announce requirement. That question is squarely before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">126 S.Ct. at 2161, 165 L.Ed.2d at 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>may well turn out to be a landmark decision. For those who would read the wind, there are in the majority opinion ominous forebodings for the future of the exclusionary rule. The case\u2019s immediate concern, however, was only with the applicability of the exclusionary rule to a \u201cknock and announce\u201d violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">A Costly Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">Calling back to the front of the brain the thrust and counterthrust of the great national debate that raged in courts and legislatures and bar associations and law reviews in the decades leading up to the 1961 promulgation of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, Hudson v. Michigan </em>reminds us that the exclusion of evidence is by no means an automatic sanction to be blithely taken for granted. The exclusion of evidence is branded as a sanction that exacts a heavy cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Suppression of evidence, </em>however, <em>has always been our last resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates \u201csubstantial social costs,\u201d United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 907, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large. <em>We have </em>therefore been \u201ccautio[us] against expanding\u201d it, <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 166, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986), and \u201chave <em>repeatedly emphasized that the rule\u2019s \u2018costly toll\u2019 </em>upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives <em>presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application,\u201d Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott, </em>524 U.S. 357, 364-365, 118 S.Ct. 2014, 141 L.Ed.2d 344 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">126 S.Ct. at 2163, 165 L.Ed.2d at 64 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Cost-Benefit Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Because of that heavy cost, the Supreme Court has consistently been very tentative in applying the sanction. It has, in application by application, engaged in a delicate balancing of the respective costs and benefits. It must be remembered, of course, that the only recognized benefit is exclusively that of general deterrence of unreasonable police conduct. <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), established unequivocally that the purpose of the exclusionary rule of <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>is only that of general deterrence. It is not remedial (in the sense of vindicating a right of the defendant) and it is not to serve the imperative of judicial integrity (to keep the judge\u2019s hands clean). See <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976); <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), for confirmation of that narrow purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>spoke of the balancing of \u201cdeterrence benefits\u201d versus \u201csocial costs.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\"><em>We have rejected \u201c[indiscriminate application\u201d of the rule, Leon, supra, </em>at 908, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677, <em>and have held it to be applicable only </em>\u201cwhere its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served,\u201d <em>United States v.

Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); in a federal <em>habeas corpus </em>hearing, <em>Stone v. Powell, supra; </em>in a civil trial, <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976); in a deportation hearing, <em>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 </em>U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984); at a parole revocation hearing, <em>Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 </em>U.S. 357, 118 S.Ct. 2014, 141 L.Ed.2d 344 (1998); in rebuttal to impeach a witness\u2019s testimonial credibility, <em>United States v. Havens, </em>446 U.S. 620, 100 S.Ct. 1912, 64 L.Ed.2d 559 (1980); or pursuant to the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule, <em>United States v. Leon, supra; Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984). The cost-benefit balancing has been a consistently followed test of exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The cost-benefit analysis in <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>similarly yielded the conclusion that, on balance, Hudson was not entitled to a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\"><em>[T]he exclusionary rule has never been applied except \u201cwhere its deterrence benefits outweigh its \u2018substantial social costs. \u2019 \u201d The costs here are considerable. </em>In addition to <em>the grave adverse consequence that exclusion </em>of relevant incriminating evidence <em>always entails </em>(viz., <em>the risk of releasing dangerous criminals into society), </em>imposing that massive remedy for a knoek-and-announce violation would generate a constant flood of alleged failures to observe the rule, and claims that any asserted <em>Richards </em>justification for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a no-knock entry had inadequate support. <em>The cost of entering this lottery would be small, but the jackpot enormous: suppression of all evidence, amounting in many cases to a get-out-of-jail-free card.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">126 S.Ct. at 2165-66, 165 L.Ed.2d at 66-67 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A Shift in Emphasis</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">With implications going beyond this \u201cknock and announce\u201d case, Justice Scalia\u2019s majority opinion went out of its way to explain that language extolling the exclusionary rule had once been very expansive but had, in more recent decades, been drastically curtailed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\"><em>We did not always speak so guardedly. Expansive dicta in Mapp, </em>for example, <em>suggested wide scope for the exclusionary rule. See, e.g., </em>367 U.S., at 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (\u201c[Ajll evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court\u201d). <em>Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, </em>401 U.S. 560, 568-569, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971), was to the same effect. But <em>we have long since rejected that approach. </em>As explained in <em>Arizona v. Evans, 514 </em>U.S. 1, 13, 115 S.Ct. 1185, 131 L.Ed.2d 34 (1995): <em>\u201cIn Whiteley, the Court treated identification of a Fourth Amendment violation as synonymous with application of the exclusionary rule </em>to evidence secured incident to that violation. <em>Subsequent case law has rejected this reflexive application of the exclusionary rule.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1u\">126 S.Ct. at 2163-64, 165 L.Ed.2d at 64 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Indispensability of a Causal Connection</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">The exclusion of evidence, moreover, is not a sanction randomly available for any police misconduct. Before evidence may be excluded, it must be shown that the evidence was, in fact, the product of the Fourth Amendment violation in issue, not simply that it was recovered after the violation. <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>explained that the evidence recovered from the warranted search in that case would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>recovered even if the police had delayed their entry for another 20 or 30 seconds, rather than entering the house prematurely. The evidence was produced as a result of the search warrant, not as a result of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d violation. The evidence would have been recovered even if the police had not jumped the gun and entered a few moments earlier than they should have entered. That it might have been recovered 15 seconds later rather than 15 seconds earlier was utterly immaterial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">[Exclusion may not be premised on the mere fact that a constitutional violation was a \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of obtaining evidence.... In this case, the constitutional violation of an illegal <em>manner </em>of entry was <em>not </em>a but-for cause of obtaining the evidence. <em>Whether that preliminary misstep had occurred or not, the police would have executed the warrant </em>they had obtained, <em>and would have discovered the gun and drugs inside the house.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">126 S.Ct. at 2164, 165 L.Ed.2d at 64-65 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy very articulately set out the necessity for a causal link between the Fourth Amendment violation and the evidence sought to be suppressed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">Under our precedents <em>the causal link between a violation of the knock-and-announce requirement and a later search is too attenuated to allow suppression. </em>Cf. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>523 U.S. 65, 72 n. 3, 118 S.Ct. 992, 140 L.Ed.2d 191 (1998) (application of the exclusionary rule depends on the existence of a \u201csufficient causal relationship\u201d between the unlawful conduct and the discovery of evidence). <em>When, </em>for example, <em>a violation results from want of a 20-second pause but an ensuing, lawful search lasting five hours discloses evidence of criminality, the failure to wait at the door cannot properly be described as having caused the discovery of evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In this case <em>the relevant evidence was discovered not because of a failure to knock-and-announce, but because of a subsequent search pursuant to a lawful warrant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">126 S.Ct. at 2171, 165 L.Ed.2d at 72 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">When the evidence in issue may follow the violation but is not the product of the violation, there is no conceivable justification for paying the high social cost of excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Core Values And Peripheral Values</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">It is not to demean the importance of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule to point out that it serves a relatively peripheral Fourth Amendment value rather than one of its two core values. The \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule concerns not the fundamental question of the breach of privacy itself by governmental entry into a protected haven (\u201cthe poor man\u2019s cottage\u201d or \u201cthe Englishman\u2019s castle\u201d) but only the method or manner of that entry. Was it unannounced? Was it too precipitous? Was it with too much force?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The classic statement of the core values protected by the Fourth Amendment and its warrant requirement was that by Justice Stewart in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 467, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), as he spoke of \u201cthe two distinct constitutional protections\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">First, the magistrate\u2019s scrutiny is intended to eliminate altogether searches <em>not </em>based on probable cause. The premise here is that <em>any intrusion in the way of search or seizure is an evil, so that no intrusion at all is justified without a careful prior determination of necessity. The second, distinct objective is that those </em>searches deemed necessary <em>should be as limited as possible. </em>Here, <em>the specific evil is the \u201cgeneral warrant\u201d </em>abhorred by the colonists, and <em>the problem is not that of intrusion per se, but of a general, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings. </em>The warrant accomplishes this second objective by requiring a \u201cparticular description\u201d of the things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>(Emphasis supplied). See also <em>State v. Brooks, </em>148 Md.App. 374, 404, 812 A.2d 342 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The core dangers being guarded against concern 1) entry or intrusion into the home and 2) scope violations. Entry into the zone of privacy is the first danger to be guarded against. It requires no less than probable cause and frequently requires a warrant. The \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule does not prevent an entry or intrusion. It only delays it by no more than a minute. The second danger is that a search, even one properly begun, might run down hill and degenerate into a fishing expedition or a general rummaging about. The protection against that danger is the function of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity clause. The \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule does not guard against either of those prominent dangers. <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>then described the different interests that the rule does protect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\"><em>One of those interests is the protection of human life and limb, because an unannounced entry may provoke violence </em>in supposed self-defense by the surprised resident. <em>Another interest is the protection of property. The knock-and-announce rule gives individuals \u201cthe opportunity </em>to comply with the law and <em>to avoid the destruction of property </em>occasioned by a forcible entry.\u201d And thirdly, <em>the knock- and-announce rule protects those elements of privacy and dignity that can be destroyed by a sudden entrance. </em>It gives residents the \u201copportunity to prepare themselves for\u201d the entry of the police. <em>\u201cThe brief interlude between announcement and entry </em>with a warrant <em>may be the opportunity that an individual has to pull on clothes or get out of bed.\u201d </em>In other words, it assures the opportunity to collect oneself before answering the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">126 S.Ct. at 2164, 165 L.Ed.2d at 66 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">What the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion found to be significant was the interest in the evidence that was not protected by the \u201cknock and announce\u201d rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\"><em>What the knock-and-announce rule has never protected, </em>however, <em>is one\u2019s interest in preventing the government </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>from seeing or taking evidence described in a warrant. Since the interests that were violated </em>in this case <em>have nothing to do with the seizure of the evidence, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Issue of Viable Alternatives</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">There then follow in the opinion unmistakable subterranean rumblings of possible future import in the discussion of viable alternatives to an exclusionary rule. Through the decades of debate between <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 in 1914 and <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>in 1961, it was universally agreed that in the best of all possible worlds, the criminal would go to jail because the evidence showed him to be guilty and the policeman who violated the Fourth Amendment would also suffer some punishment for that violation. The problem was that a criminal trial did not present the best of all possible worlds.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">It was acknowledged that excluding evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt gave the defendant a benefit to which he was not personally entitled, but the courts could conceive of no other way to punish (and thereby deter from future violations) the erring officer. The caselaw regularly justified an admittedly awkward and unsatisfying sanction because of the absence of \u201cany viable alternative.\u201d Without a viable sanction, <em>Mapp </em>announced, the Amendment would be \u201creduced to a nullity.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">It was the inappropriateness of punishing the policeman by rewarding the criminal that inspired John Henry Wigmore\u2019s classic parody on the exclusionary rule, as it, in effect, announced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201cTitus, you have been found guilty of conducting a lottery; Flavius, you have confessedly violated the Constitution. <em>Titus aught to suffer imprisonment for crime, and Flavius for contempt. </em>But no! We shall let you <em>both </em>go free. <em>We shall not punish Flavius directly, but shall do </em>so <em>by reversing Titus\u2019 conviction. </em>This is our way of teaching people like Flavius to behave, and of teaching people like Titus to behave, and incidentally of securing respect for the Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tution. <em>Our way of upholding the Constitution is not to strike at the man who breaks it, but to let off somebody else who broke something else.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">8 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(3d ed.1940) \u00a7 2184 at 40 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>then prophetically observed that the fact that there may have been no viable alternative to the exclusionary rule when <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>was decided does not mean that no viable alternatives have been developed in the intervening 45 years.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\"><em>We cannot assume that exclusion </em>in this context <em>is necessary deterrence </em>simply <em>because we found that it was necessary deterrence </em>in different contexts and <em>long ago.

We are no longer in 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Justice Scalia pointed to the birth and subsequent development of the \u00a7 1983 federal tort action for a constitutional violation as a <em>post-Mapp </em>development of a viable alternative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahi\"><em>Dollree Mapp could not turn to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for meaningful relief; Monroe v.

If the State fails to raise a timely challenge, on the other hand, it is out of luck and may not raise the challenge on later review. This is because the standing requirement, albeit incidentally beneficial to the State, is not for the benefit of the State. The requirement primarily serves the interest of judicial economy. It is to save busy courts from having to waste time and resources litigating matters that need not be litigated. Once such litigation has taken place because the State was asleep at the switch, however, it is too late for a standing challenge to accomplish the purpose for which it is designed. <em>Steagald v.
