Whether the trial court erred in failing to grant the motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-13\">2. Whether the trial court erred in failing to suppress Appellant\u2019s statements to police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-15\">3. Whether the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-17\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>I. Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">A. Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The following evidence was adduced at the trial in June 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Kenesha Davis married appellant on July 25, 2008, five days before Kevonte\u2019s death on July 30, 2003. The couple lived with Ms. Davis\u2019s two children, Dacquan Davis, then four, and Kevonte, as well as the couple\u2019s seven-month-old son, Kemari Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In July 2003, Ms. Davis worked weekdays at a warehouse from 7 a.m. until 5:30 p.m.; appellant was unemployed. Appellant and Ms. Davis shared a Honda Civic, so each morning they would bring the children to Yvette Edmunds, a day-care provider, and then appellant would take Ms. Davis to work. At the end of the work day, appellant would pick up the children as well as Ms. Davis. However, the children did not go to Ms. Edmunds on July 30, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Ms. Davis testified that, on the morning of July 30, 2003, appellant dropped her off at work with the children. At the time, Kevonte \u201cwas active and normal____\u201d At around 5 p.m., when appellant arrived to pick up Ms. Davis, she noticed that Kevonte\u2019s eyes were closed, he was \u201cfoaming at the mouth,\u201d his hands were cold, and he was \u201cmoaning like he was in pain.\u201d She and appellant took Kevonte to Howard County General Hospital (the \u201cHospital\u201d), where he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Lisa Zovko, a patient care technician in the Pediatric Emergency Room of the Hospital, was on duty when Kevonte arrived. Ms. Zovko saw \u201cblood and foam\u201d were coming from Kevonte\u2019s mouth, and he was \u201cposturing,\u201d a \u201cmovement that can be described as arching and your limbs kind of go stiff and bend backwards,\u201d reflective of \u201ccentral nervous system damage.\u201d Zovko \u201cstarted suctioning the blood out of [Kevonte\u2019s] mouth, because [she] didn\u2019t want [Kevonte\u2019s] airway to be compromised any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Zovko summoned Doctor Jackson Tsai, who then rushed Kevonte to the \u201ccode room.\u201d While chest compressions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>performed, Zovko noticed \u201can abrasion, like a rug burn,\u201d on Kevonte\u2019s chest. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, however. According to Ms. Zovko, both parents were upset by Kevonte\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Dr. Tsai treated Kevonte as \u201ca priority one patient.\u201d While Dr. Tsai was attempting to resuscitate Kevonte, he observed the victim\u2019s chest and noticed \u201csome ecchymosis or bruising ... right below the ribs.\u201d In addition, he saw \u201csome bruising over the right side of [Kevonte\u2019s] face ... around the eyeball,\u201d as well as \u201c[t]he liver spleen area.\u201d He also reported that the child\u2019s \u201cbelly was sort of distended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">According to Dr. Tsai, appellant did not provide a history as to the source of trauma that would explain the child\u2019s injuries. Dr. Tsai noted that the \u201chistory\u201d provided by appellant was that Kevonte was eating \u201cpeanut butter that afternoon\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was no history of trauma. No history of fall. Or a thud that, that was heard by [appellant]. No history of ingestions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Dr. David Monroe, the Director of the Hospital\u2019s pediatric emergency room, recalled that Kevonte was \u201cbleeding from his mouth,\u201d had \u201ca very large bruise on his upper abdomen, lower chest,\u201d and bruising on his face and the upper back. Dr. Monroe spoke with appellant to obtain a medical history for Kevonte. Owens told Dr. Monroe that he thought \u201ceverything was fine until somewhere between four and four thirty.\u201d In Dr. Monroe\u2019s view, appellant\u2019s \u201cstory didn\u2019t match at all what we saw in the room. I mean, something, some serious trauma had happened to this child. The story I was given right then was nothing happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">According to Dr. Monroe, the \u201cmassive injuries\u201d suffered by Kevonte were similar to those of \u201csomeone that fell off a building, several stories.... Or a very serious car accident. Or child abuse.\u201d Dr. Monroe also testified that the low oxygen level in the child\u2019s blood tended to establish that Kevonte had bled to death. Dr. Monroe acknowledged that chest compressions performed on a person with an existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>break to the ribs could \u201caggravate the problem to some extent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Lavanda Pope, Kevonte\u2019s great aunt, responded to the Hospital and thought that appellant seemed \u201cagitated.\u201d When appellant saw Ms. Pope, he said: \u201c \u2018They\u2019re trying to accuse me of killing Kevonte.\u2019 \u201d At the time of that remark, the \u201cdetectives were standing behind\u201d him. Ms. Pope told appellant \u201cthat the officers were doing their job and at this point he needed to let them do his (inaudible) job, because Kenesha is dealing with the fact that her son is dead.\u201d Ms. Pope also saw Kevonte\u2019s body, and noticed \u201ca bruise on his face\u201d as well as a \u201cbig bruise in the middle of his chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Detective Joseph King secured appellant\u2019s residence \u201cuntil a search warrant could be completed.\u201d During the execution of the search warrant, he found that the home\u2019s telephone was in working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Sergeant William Porter was also involved in the search of appellant\u2019s home. During the search, he found soiled toddler pants, a soiled diaper in the bathroom, and a soiled wet washcloth in the sink.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Michael DeVilbis, a maintenance employee at Genco at the time of Kevonte\u2019s death, testified that he saw appellant pick up Ms. Davis on the evening in question. Mr. DeVilbis heard appellant tell Ms. Davis that \u201c \u2018he been [sic] shaking the kids all day and couldn\u2019t get \u2018em up\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Yvette Edmunds, the children\u2019s day-care provider, recalled that appellant called her late on the morning in question, and advised that the children were coming. However, the children never arrived, nor did she hear from appellant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Detective Eric Kruhm responded to the Hospital and viewed Kevonte\u2019s body, which was bruised on the face and chest. Kruhm first encountered Owens with Dacquan in the playroom of the pediatric ward. At that time, Kruhm and Detective Shaffer had a \u201cconversation\u201d with appellant, who responded \u201cfreely\u201d to their questions. Detective Kruhm recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>[E]arly that morning, [appellant] had a job prospect that he went to. And that they sent him home.... He said he called the babysitter and told her that he would be bringing the children that day. He said he got home. They had breakfast. That his child ... had diarrhea that day and that he didn\u2019t have what he needed for the kids for day-care. So he ended up not taking them that day.... That ... the boys, who would be Dacquan and the victim, played that day. They rode bikes. They watched television. He said that around noontime, they had lunch, all of them. And that the boys went back to the living room to watch TV. He went upstairs to give his son a bottle. And he said that Dacquan and the victim had fallen asleep in front of the television. He said that close to five o\u2019clock ... he had to wake the boys up. They were still asleep. He said that the victim was very fussy.... So he let him lay there. And then he came back and he said he wasn\u2019t acting right. And that he was falling back asleep.... So he got the kids in the car. He went to his wife\u2019s job in Columbia and picked her up. And ... he said that the victim was dozing off in the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Detective Kruhm asked appellant how Kevonte sustained his bruising. According to Detective Kruhm, appellant advised that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">it was probably from fighting with his brother Dacquan or that it might have happened at day care. But first he said he wasn\u2019t sure.... He said that he was the only one with the children that day. He had watched them from the time he got back from dropping his wife until the time he went to pick her up. He said that no one visited the home. He said that they didn\u2019t leave the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Detective Kruhm also testified: \u201cAt one point, [appellant] backed his head against the wall and he said, quote, \u2018Fucking up.\u2019 And then at another point in the conversation, between questions he said, \u2018How does this shit happen?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">At approximately 9:45 p.m., Detective Kruhm had a second \u201cconversation\u201d with appellant at the Hospital, which was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>corded by audiotape. The interview was played for the jury and a transcription was admitted in evidence. In the statement, appellant denied responsibility for Kevonte\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Doctor Zabiullah Ali, an Assistant Medical Examiner, performed the autopsy on Kevonte. He was admitted, without objection, as an expert \u201cin the field of forensic pathology.\u201d During the autopsy, Dr. Ali observed bruising to the victim\u2019s right temple, left lip, head, and lower chest/upper abdomen. In addition, Kevonte had four fractured ribs and two injuries to his liver. The doctor opined that the cause of the injury to the ribs and liver was blunt force to the abdomen/chest, which then caused internal bleeding. Kevonte also had \u201cbruising of ... both lungs [and the] thymus.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">According to Dr. Ali, a small child could not have inflicted the injuries sustained by Kevonte. He claimed that \u201cwe usually observe these kinds of injuries in motor vehicle accidents.\u201d Dr. Ali also stated that, because of Kevonte\u2019s rib fractures, he would not have been able to put his shirt on by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Dr. Ali opined \u201cthat the cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma,\u201d inflicted less than four to six hours before death. Dr. Ali also concluded that \u201c[t]he manner of death was homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Appellant was the sole witness for the defense. He recalled that he was with the children from approximately 7:30 a.m. on July 30, 2003, until he drove with the children to pick up his wife at approximately 5:00 p.m. Appellant explained that he fed the children lunch, but Kevonte \u201cjust play[ed] with his.\u201d After lunch, Owens left the children downstairs watching TV, while he took care of the baby upstairs. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And so you\u2019re upstairs with the baby lying on your chest?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">[APPELLANT]: On top of me.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what occurred at that point?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>[APPELLANT]: I heard them, I guess they, they may have got into something or whatever. I just yelled downstairs and told them to cut it out or I was going to cut the TV off.</p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And what do you mean they got into something?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">[APPELLANT]: I believe it was like a little, a little fight or argument or something, it was a truck or something.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And is this unusual? [APPELLANT]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And so after that, what did you hear from downstairs?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">[APPELLANT]: Nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right. And so what did you do upstairs?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">[APPELLANT]: I just laid on the floor ... and ... I just fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And at some point you woke up. Do you remember what woke you up?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">[APPELLANT]: I heard a truck like backfire like the next parking lot over or something.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And you went downstairs because?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">[APPELLANT]: Because I\u2019d fallen asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And? Anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">[APPELLANT]: Just, uh, it just dawned on me to go check on them because I feel [sic] asleep \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And so what happened after that?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Daquan was by the TV. Kevonte, he was back a little ways from Daquan, like over by the sliding door, glass door, balcony door.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And is that where he was the last time you had been downstairs?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">[APPELLANT]: No, it wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: At that point, what were they both doing?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">[APPELLANT]: Daquan was up. Kevonte was asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">According to appellant, after checking on the boys, he went back upstairs, gave the baby a bottle, and prepared to pick up his wife. The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And when you talk about gathering things, what are you gathering? What are you putting together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">[APPELLANT]: Like extra bottle and looking for clothes and stuff like that. Tee shirts or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right. And what was, what were the kids doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">[APPELLANT]: Kevonte was still laying down and Daquan was like, he was like on his knees, I believe, looking at TV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And what did you do then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-14\">[APPELLANT]: And I believe I gave Daquan some shoes. Or something. And I had a shirt for Kevonte with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. What did you do with that shirt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-15\">[APPELLANT]: I woke him up and told him to put his shirt on, because it was almost time to go pick Mommy up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And what happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-16\">[APPELLANT]: He got up and was like proceeding to put his shirt on. I went in the kitchen for something and went back upstairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And did you come back downstairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did Kevonte have his shirt on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">[APPELLANT]: Partially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">[APPELLANT]: He like had his, had his arm in it and like hanging on his shoulder like by his neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: So like one arm through the sleeve?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And what happened with Kevonte after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-12\">[APPELLANT]: <em>He sat up, put his shirt on, </em>laid back down. Like groggy.

Something like, like they might have been fighting or something like that or \u2014 something. [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did you see anything on his chest area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-15\">[APPELLANT]: I didn\u2019t notice anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">B. Post-Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">The jury returned its verdict on June 10, 2004. That evening, Steven Merson, the Howard County Jury Commissioner, received a voice-mail message from Juror 10, Adeyemi Alade, a twenty-eight year old Nigerian national. Alade expressed concern about his jury service because he was not a United States citizen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The court decided to hold a hearing on June 18, 2004, to discuss the matter. At the outset of the hearing, the court said: \u201cAnd we\u2019re here today, really at my request, I guess, since there is no pending motion, to just inquire as to the nature and content of a phone call received by our jury commissioner after the trial was concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Mr. Merson testified about the telephone message he received from Mr. Alade on June 10, 2004. According to Merson, Alade related that he was \u201cworried about his status, or the status of the case, since he was a non-citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">According to Mr. Merson, potential jurors are mailed a juror qualification form several weeks before they are scheduled to report, which they are to fill out and return to the court. He identified Mr. Alade\u2019s juror qualification form. Part B of the form provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">QUALIFIED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u2014 I am qualified to serve as a juror and will report as instructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u2014 I am qualified to serve as a juror and will need an accommodation (i.e., sign language interpreter, etc.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">DISQUALIFIED: I AM NOT QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS A JUROR BECAUSE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u2014 I am no longer a resident of Howard County. My new address is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u2014 I am not a citizen of the United States. I am a citizen of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u2014 I do not have sufficient knowledge of the English language to act as a juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">\u2014 I have been convicted of a criminal offense and received a fine of more than $500 or a sentence of more than (6) six months, and have not been pardoned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">\u2014 I have pending charges against me punishable by a fine of more than $500 or a sentence of more than (6) six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u2014 I have a civil case pending in Howard County, (except for civil actions in which a party is not entitled to a jury trial.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u2014 I have a physical or mental infirmity that would impair my capacity to serve as a juror. (Please attach letter explanation).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Merson explained that Mr. Alade checked the box indicating that he was qualified to serve as a juror. Further, he testified that it is not the practice of his office to review the information supplied on the form at the time jurors appear for service, unless it appears that some information is missing. Merson acknowledged that the film shown to jurors upon arrival for service does not include information regarding qualifications for service as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Mr. Alade testified that Nigeria is his \u201ccountry of origin,\u201d and he is not a United States citizen. As a graduate student in the United States, he is \u201ca permanent resident,\u201d and may remain in this country as long as he is \u201cworking, serving [in] the military, [or] go[ing] to school.\u201d At the time of the hearing, Alade had been in the United States for two years. He holds a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license, which lists his Howard County address.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Alade related that he contacted Mr. Merson after a colleague at school informed him that only United States citizens are allowed to serve on juries. Mr. Alade confirmed that he received in the mail the juror qualification form, and checked the space indicating that he was \u201cqualified\u201d to serve. He explained that he \u201cjust missed\u201d the portion of the form regarding categories for disqualification, but \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t deliberate.\u201d He added: \u201cMaybe I just [flipped] through [the form] and didn\u2019t see that.\u201d To the best of Alade\u2019s recollection, when he reported for jury duty nobody sought to verify his citizenship. Nor was he asked about his citizenship at any time during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">At the end of the hearing the court stated: \u201cOkay. I guess that\u2019s all that is before me today, is just to make the inquiry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and there\u2019s nothing pending, so with that, I guess we\u2019ll conclude for today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">On the same day as the hearing, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for a New Trial,\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-331.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argued that his \u201ctrial was not conducted before a lawful jury,\u201d because the \u201cjury contained a juror who was not qualified for jury service in that he was not a citizen of the United States and [he] was not qualified to vote in the county where the trial took place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In its opposition to the motion, the State asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">1. The Defendant was afforded a trial before a fair and impartial jury as is required by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">2. A non-citizen was inadvertently seated on the Defendant\u2019s petit jury. The participation of a non-citizen on the jury does not render the verdict null and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">3. Citizenship is a Maryland statutory requirement for juror eligibility. Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 8-207; <em>Hunt v. Maryland, </em>345 Md. 122, 691 A.2d 1255 (1997). Neither the United States Constitution nor the Maryland Declaration of Rights requires that a jury be comprised only of citizens. Instead, the Defendant is constitutionally guaranteed a right to a fair and impartial trial jury which he was in fact afforded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">4. The Defendant waived any challenge to the statutory eligibility of the jurors by not challenging the array pursuant to Courts and Judicial Proceedings, Section 8-211. <em>Hunt v. Maryland, </em>345 Md. 122, 143-144, 691 A.2d 1255 (1997). The Defendant further waived any challenge to the statutory disqualification of the non-citizen juror by failing to request a voir dire question regarding the statutory requirement of juror eligibility. <em>Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 144, 691 A.2d 1255. The non-citizen juror did not indicate bias or prejudice by answering any of the voir dire questions posit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ed by the Court as requested by the Defendant and the State. He was, therefore, a fair and impartial juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">5. The jury in this case unanimously reached a fair verdict after deliberating for four (4) hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">6. The evidence fully supported the verdict rendered by the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">7. The interests of justice require that this Court deny the Defendant\u2019s Motion. The Defendant has not cited any authority in his motion justifying the extraordinary relief he seeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On July 16, 2004, the court held a hearing as to appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel maintained that United States citizenship is a requirement for service on a Maryland jury. Further, he argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">The [Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] contains a list of various types of disqualifications, which run from ... not being physically strong, or not being able to hear well, to having a pending misdemeanor charge or a pending civil case that would entitle one to a jury. I would suggest to the Court that ... not all these disqualifications are created equal. And I would suggest to the Court that non-citizenship is a disqualification that takes on different significance than perhaps the other disqualifications that are listed in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Defense counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">At this time in history, when our nation is at war with foreign nationals who would seek the destruction of our institutions and way of life in this country, I think that we have to look particularly at the question of non-citizenship and view it in a way different than perhaps some of these other disqualifications may be viewed.... And I think, Your Honor, that in that situation, the factors that were mentioned in <em>Perkins v. Smith </em>[370 F.Supp. 134 (D.Md.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>426 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 2616, 49 L.Ed.2d 368 (1976),] ... affirmed by the Supreme Court ... talks about ... citizenship as a requirement for jury service and the importance of citizenship as a requirement for jury service, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>they mention that the State can presume its citizens are conversant with the social and political institutions of our society, the customs of the locality, the nuances of local tradition and language, and naturalized citizens have at least demonstrated a basic understanding of our form of government, history and traditions, there is no corresponding basis for assuming that resident aliens have that same shared, national mores that is essential in reaching the determinations which, in the jury system, as <em>Perkins v. Smith </em>says, is the very palladium of a free government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">So my limited request, and the limited rule for which I advocate, is that when the disqualification is non-citizenship and when it comes to light prior to the entry of judgment, during that ten day period when the Court had broad discretion to grant a motion for a new trial, I would say in that limited circumstance, it would be an abuse of the Court\u2019s discretion not to grant the motion for a new trial____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The State countered that neither the United States Constitution nor the Maryland Declaration of Rights requires citizenship of Maryland jurors. Further, it maintained that appellant waived his claim, because he failed to request a voir dire question regarding juror eligibility. Moreover, the State asserted that no prejudice to the accused was shown. It argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">Your Honor, this was a case that was heard before a jury of twelve. It was a jury selected after several hours.... At no time, Your Honor, was there a challenge to the array, suggesting at all that the jury was not eligible or qualified or had been chosen in a manner contrary to the provisions of the Courts Article which governs jury selection and service. Your Honor, the legislature of Maryland has spoken in terms of what it is that is to be acceptable as a juror. If the Court looks to the ... statute that governs qualifications of a juror, you will see, Your Honor, language that is inclusive rather than exclusive. The legislature has very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>limited situations in which they deem a person to be disqualified to serve, one of which the State accedes is in fact citizenship, because you have to ... be able to be registered to vote in the county.... What we find ourselves in, at least in this county and particularly in this case, is that we have now extended from the voter registration rolls to include the motor vehicle rolls for selection of jurors, as is acceptable under the jury plan that was selected for Howard County and acceptable under the Courts Article. The hope being that you would garner more diversity, more jurors that may be eligible for service. Again, more inclusive rather than exclusive____The legislature has spoken in this particular state and has made it a statutory disqualification to have citizenship be a requirement for service on a jury. <em>There is nothing in the United States Constitution itself or the Maryland Declaration of Rights which creates a constitutional right of a jury comprised solely of United States citizens.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">Here in this case, Your Honor, we had multiple questions being asked of the prospective jurors regarding bias.... Here, the defense chose not to ask any other questions regarding statutory disqualifications. The Court in fact went beyond what was asked ... by the attorneys in this case.... The Court asked regarding pending of a civil suit. That was contained neither in the defense voir dire or the State\u2019s voir dire. To determine whether or not there was a disqualifying factor in t\u00ediat particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The State continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">Your Honor, we\u2019re in, we are at war. There is no question. But we\u2019re not at war with Nigeria, which is the citizenship of Mr. Alade. And I suggest to the Court that ... flag-waving here is somewhat inappropriate in this particular case, because there is no suggestion that Mr. Alade is anything but honest, anything but honorable. When he found out that in fact there may be a problem -with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>having served on this jury, he immediately contacted the jury commissioner, Mr. Merson. Left a message that Thursday night following the verdict. He came in to the court, gave testimony that was very clear this was simply a situation in which the line regarding citizenship was overlooked. This was not an intentional misapplication of, or an intentional lie or something untoward for him to be able to sit on this jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">We have before us, Your Honor, a situation where if the Court were to grant this motion for new trial, we\u2019ve had already three days of testimony. We have had twelve jurors sitting in a box. All the courtroom personnel, all the attorneys involved here----The reason that there are strict guidelines set forth in the statute for challenging the qualifications of a juror, is because there is a greater interest in having some finality, Your Honor, in this system. And absent any showing of bias or prejudice, which has not even been close to being shown in this case.... [T]o grant a new trial sets a precedent. And a precedent that I suggest the Court would open Pandora\u2019s box, because it would be used by others to look at juror\u2019s personal lives.... And in the interest of justice, the State suggests this verdict should stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In a well reasoned opinion issued on July 21, 2003, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion. The trial court recognized that, under Md. Rule 4-331, it had the discretionary authority to order a new trial in the interest of justice. The court also recognized that Maryland Code (1973, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 8-207(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) \u201cenumerates nine (9) grounds for disqualification of jurors,\u201d and \u201cone such ground\u201d is \u201c[n]ot being constitutionally qualified to vote in the county where the court convenes.... \u201d But, the court concluded that neither the United States Constitution nor the Maryland Declaration of Rights \u201cmandates that a jury be comprised solely of United States\u2019 [sic] citizens.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Defendant asserts that the disqualifying factor of Mr. Alade\u2019s non-citizenship could not reasonably have been discovered during the <em>voir dire </em>examination of potential jurors. The basis for the Defendant\u2019s proposition is his contention that the court is not required to ask proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions disclosing potential statutory disqualification since it is presumed that the court has already screened and removed disqualified persons prior to the commencement of <em>voir dire. </em>The Defendant additionally contends that the court need not have asked any questions about citizenship in <em>voir dire </em>had the Defendant proposed them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">The fallacy of the Defendant\u2019s argument is that neither the State nor the defense requested a <em>voir dire </em>question directed to the issue of citizenship. Had such a question been requested, the court would in all likelihood have made the inquiry (as it did <em>sua sponte </em>regarding the issue of pending jury trials) and Mr. Alade would have been excused as a disqualified juror. Contrary to the Defendant\u2019s assertions, a reasonable opportunity existed to challenge Mr. Alade\u2019s qualifications to serve as a juror during the <em>voir dire </em>questioning of potential jurors. The Defendant did not avail himself of this opportunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">The Court notes that Mr. Alade responded appropriately to all questions posed to him by the Court and/or counsel during the evidentiary hearing. Based upon this fact, it would appear that Mr. Alade has no difficulty understanding or conversing in the English language. The jurors deliberated for approximately four (4) hours. The jurors did not send out any questions during the course of their deliberations which suggests that the jurors (including Mr. Alade) had no difficulty understanding the evidence or the instructions of law in reaching their unanimous verdicts. In addition, there has been no showing that Mr. Alade\u2019s non-citizen status in any way or manner prejudiced the Defendant\u2019s case, his consideration of the evidence, or the jury\u2019s deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Testimony adduced from Mr. Alade at the evidentiary hearing established that his failure to note that he was not a citizen of the United States was simply an oversight. He testified that he overlooked the line asking this question on the juror qualification questionnaire. The Court finds Mr. Alade\u2019s testimony in this regard to be credible. The Court further finds that Mr. Alade did not provide a dishonest response to the citizenship question. The Court notes that the questionnaire itself is confusing. As reflected on Court\u2019s Exhibit A, a person can \u201ccheck off\u2019 that he or she is qualified to serve as a juror before even seeing the disqualifying factors listed below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">There was no evidence presented in the case <em>sub judice </em>to suggest that the presence of Mr. Alade on the jury in any way denied the Defendant a fair and impartial trial or violated his due process rights. The mere presence and participation of a juror who would have been disqualified by statutory provisions is not a basis for a new trial absent a showing of bias or prejudice. The Defendant has failed to make such a showing. The Court will accordingly deny the Defendant\u2019s Motion for New Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A6N\">A. Juror Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Owens insists that, in order to be qualified for jury service in Maryland, \u201cone must be a United States citizen and a citizen of the State.... \u201d Because \u201cMr. Alade was not registered to vote in Howard County-and, indeed, was a non-citizen,\u201d appellant contends that Alade was \u201cneither constitutionally <em>nor </em>statutorily qualified to sit as a juror in the instant case.\u201d According to appellant, he was \u201ceffectively left [with] a jury of eleven, violating Maryland Rule 4-311 ... and the constitutional requirement of unanimity of twelve jurors in order to convict in a criminal case....\u201d Therefore, he claims that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>In support of his claim that he was entitled to a jury composed of twelve citizens of the United States, Owens relies on the Sixth Amendment of United States Constitution, Articles 5, 21, 23, and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, as well as the common law. He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">[Ujnder the English common law, while not entirely sufficient, it was at least <em>necessary </em>that jurors be drawn from the county in which the \u201cfact (crime) was committed.\u201d ... It goes without saying, then that <em>citizenship </em>was a prerequisite for jury service under the common law of England[ and so it goes without saying that such is the case under the explicit terms of Article 5 of the Constitution of Maryland and its incorporation of then existing English common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">(Citations omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Urging us to reverse his convictions, Owens adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Appellant respectfully suggests that owing to the unprecedented historical and political circumstances in which we find our country and the several United States \u2014 that we are, indeed, at war with [an] enemy which is comprised, at the very least, of an unspecified number and variety of foreign nationals who likely move about freely among us as yet undetected-that this Court should interpret the \u201cimpartial jury\u201d requirement under the federal constitution, Sixth Amendment, the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, to mean that in any trial by jury in a criminal case, all of the jurors be United State\u2019s [sic] <em>citizens.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Although the State agrees that \u201c[t]he right to trial by jury is a fundamental right, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and by the Maryland Declaration of Rights,\u201d it contends that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. It maintains: \u201cContrary to Owens\u2019s contention, and as the trial court correctly held, \u2018[n]either the United States Constitution nor the Maryland Declaration of Rights mandates that a jury be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>comprised solely of United States\u2019 citizens.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">According to the State, the trial court correctly concluded that \u201cthere has been no showing that Mr. Alade\u2019s non-citizen status in any way or manner prejudiced [Owens\u2019s] case, his consideration of the evidence, or the jury\u2019s deliberation.\u201d Thus, it maintains that Mr. Alade\u2019s inclusion on the jury \u201cdid not infringe on Owens\u2019s due process right to a fair and impartial jury\u201d of twelve persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Furthermore, the State agrees with the trial court that \u201cOwens had a reasonable opportunity to challenge Mr. Alade\u2019s qualifications to serve as a juror during the voir dire process,\u201d but did not avail himself of the opportunity. Disputing appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cvoir dire was not adequate,\u201d the State reminds us that \u201cthe trial court found that no questions were requested directed to the issue of citizenship and that \u2018[h]ad such a question been requested, the court would in all likelihood have made the inquiry----\u2019 \u201d Thus, it contends that the trial court properly concluded that \u201cOwens waived his complaint to the presence of the non-citizen juror and, because, Owens failed to make a showing of bias or prejudice, Owens stated no grounds warranting a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We begin our analysis with a review of the right to a trial by jury in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The right of a criminally accused person to trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>as well as Articles 5,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 21,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 24<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.

The right to trial by jury is guaranteed by the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Maryland Rules, as well as the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625-26, 843 A.2d 64 (citing <em>Kawamura v.

Rather, it renders unqualified any person ineligible to vote in the jurisdiction \u201cwhere the court convenes.\u201d Therefore, we must next look to the laws governing voter eligibility. Those laws make clear that only United States citizens are entitled to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Article 1, \u00a7 1 of the Maryland Constitution, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">Every <em>citizen </em>of the United States, of the age of 18 years or upwards, who is a resident of the State as of the time for the closing of registration next preceding the election, <em>shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>be entitled to vote </em>in the ward or election district in which he resides at all elections to be held in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Article 1, \u00a7 2 of the Maryland Constitution states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvX\">\u201c[N]o person shall vote, at any election, Federal or State, hereafter to be held in this State, or at any municipal election in the City of Baltimore, unless his name appears in the list of registered voters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Section \u00a7 3-102 of the Election Law Article of the Md. Code (2002, 2005 Supp.) also provides that, in order to qualify to vote in Maryland, a person must be a United States citizen.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">\u00a7 3-102. Qualifications for voter registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, <em>an individual may become registered to vote if the individual:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">(1) <em>is a citizen of the United States;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">(2) is at least 18 years old or will be 18 years old on or before the day of the next succeeding general or special election;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">(3) is a resident of the county as of the day the individual seeks to register; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">(4) registers pursuant to this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">(Italics and boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">Finally, we look to C.J. \u00a7 8-211.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">\u00a7 8-211.

Clearly, Alade was not qualified to serve as a juror, because he was not a United States citizen at the time of the trial. That conclusion does not end our inquiry, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, his right to a jury composed solely of American citizens derives from statutory law, rather than the federal Constitution or the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Indeed, the right to a jury consisting solely of United States citizens is not so fundamental that it affects \u201cthe substantial rights of the accused.... \u201d <em>Kohl v. Lehlback, </em>160 U.S. 293, 302, 16 S.Ct. 304, 40 L.Ed. 432 (1895). It follows that the right to a jury comprised only of United States citizens is a right that may be waived. In our view, that is precisely what occurred here. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Along with the jury questionnaire, the voir dire process is designed to ferret out grounds for juror disqualifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>cation, and \u201cgive substance to the constitutional guarantee to criminal defendants of a fair and impartial jury trial.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 904 A.2d 534 (2006). <em>See also Curtin v. State, </em>393 Md. 593, 903 A.2d 922 (2006) (\u201cVoir dire is the primary mechanism through which the constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is protected.\u201d); <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 9, 759 A.2d 819 (2000); Md. Rule 4-312. In particular, voir dire \u201cis the process in which prospective jurors are examined through the use of questions ... to determine the existence of any bias or prejudice\u201d or grounds for disqualification. <em>Curtin, </em>slip op. at 7. As the <em>Dingle </em>Court said, 361 Md. at 10, 759 A.2d 819:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">Undergirding the voir dire procedure and, hence, informing the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion regarding the conduct of the voir dire, is a single, primary, and overriding principle or purpose: <em>\u201cto ascertain \u2018the existence of cause for disqualification.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See generally Sweet v. State, </em>371 Md. 1, 10, 806 A.2d 265 (2002); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>369 Md. 202, 206, 798 A.2d 566 (2002); <em>Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 435, 671 A.2d 33 (1996); <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 279, 661 A.2d 1164 (1995); <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 36-39, 633 A.2d 867 (1993); <em>Baker v. State, </em>157 Md.App. 600, 613, 853 A.2d 796 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">However, the voir dire process depends upon complete and truthful responses by the prospective jurors to the voir dire questions. <em>Williams, </em>slip op. at 13. Voir dire may reveal bias through two areas of inquiry: (1) <em>\u201cwhether jurors meet the minimum statutory qualifications for jury service </em>\u201d; (2) whether a juror has a bias with \u201c \u2018respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter reasonably liable to unduly influence him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 9-10, 759 A.2d 819 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 35-36, 633 A.2d 867) (emphasis added). <em>See Thomas, </em>369 Md. at 207, 798 A.2d 566; <em>Boyd, </em>341 Md. at 436-37, 671 A.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>In this case, appellant never asked the court to pose a single voir dire question aimed at verifying that all members of the venire panel were qualified based on the statutory criteria of citizenship. Consequently, Alade slipped through the jury selection process. While appellant may have assumed that the venire panel had been pre-screened based on the jury questionnaire, it is easy to anticipate that mistakes do occur, which is why a questionnaire alone is not the sole tool used to select a jury. Therefore, the use of the form does not eliminate the need to verify qualification of the venire by way of voir dire. Waiver principles apply to the failure to pose voir dire questions aimed at verifying that venire satisfies the statutory qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In <em>Kohl, supra, </em>160 U.S. at 293, 16 S.Ct. 304 (1895), the defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He argued that he was deprived of his constitutional rights because one of the jurors in his case was not a United States citizen. As the Supreme Court recognized, \u201calienage of a juror is cause of challenge, but is not per se sufficient to set aside a verdict, and this whether the complaining party knew of the fact or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 16 S.Ct. 304. The Supreme Court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">The disqualification of alienage is cause of challenge propter defectum/<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark> on account of personal objection and, if voluntarily, or through negligence, or want of knowledge, such objection fails to be insisted on, the conclusion that the judgment is thereby invalidated is wholly inadmissible. <em>The defect is not fundamental as affecting the substantial rights of the accused, and the verdict is not void for want of power to render it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 302,16 S.Ct. 304 (emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">By way of analogy, <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 691 A.2d 1255, <em>cert. denied, </em>521 U.S. 1131, 117 S.Ct. 2536, 138 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>1036 (1997), is also instructive. Although convicted felons are statutorily barred from jury service in Maryland, the <em>Hunt </em>Court established that a criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to a new trial if a convicted felon mistakenly serves on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Hunt was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 691 A.2d 1255. He complained that the circuit court erred when it found that he was not deprived of his right to an impartial jury at his capital sentencing trial even though, <em>inter alia, </em>a juror failed to disclose, both at jury orientation and during voir dire, a pending misdemeanor theft charge that would have statutorily disqualified her from jury service under C.J. \u00a7 8-207(b)(5), and would have been a basis for a challenge for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 140-41, 691 A.2d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In denying Hunt\u2019s appeal, the Court recognized that voir dire is aimed at uncovering jurors who are statutorily disqualified. It said, <em>id. </em>at 141, 691 A.2d 1255 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABJ\">The \u201c \u2018right\u2019 to examine potential jurors, inherent in the constitutional right to a fair trial and impartial jury, translates into a defendant\u2019s right to have certain questions propounded to the jurors ... \u2018concern[ing] a specific cause for disqualification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 436, 671 A.2d 33, 36 (1996) (quoting <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 280, 661 A.2d 1164, 1166 (1995)); <em>see also Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 670, 566 A.2d 111, 116 (1989) (\u201cMaryland Declaration of Rights Article XXI guarantees a defendant the right to examine prospective jurors to determine whether any cause exists for a juror\u2019s disqualification.\u201d). <em>These \u201ccauses\u201d may take two forms: disqualification for bias or disqualification for failure to meet minimum statutory requirements for jury service.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">With regard to challenges based on statutory criteria, the <em>Hunt </em>Court addressed the method for \u201cuncovering information concerning the prospective juror\u2019s age, literacy, or criminal background, for which minimum requirements exist as prerequisites to service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 691 A.2d 1255. Noting that Title 8, Subtitle 2 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Article \u201cnecessarily embodies the Sixth Amendment\u2019s light to an impartial jury,\u201d it pointed out that the \u201crights are statutory in nature\u201d and, \u201c[o]rdinarily, their violation may only be vindicated by invocation of the statutorily-prescribed remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 691 A.2d 1255. Quoting from <em>Boyd v. </em>State, <em>supra, </em>341 Md. at 441, 671 A.2d 33, the <em>Hunt </em>Court said: \u201c \u2018Maryland courts screen juror qualifications on at least three levels: a statutorily-required qualification form, appearance before the jury judge or commissioner at the courthouse, and the trial judge\u2019s observance of each juror during the <em>voir </em>dire.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 691 A.2d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Further, the Court stated: \u201cThe guidelines set forth in C.J. \u00a7 8-207, which delineate the minimum qualifications for service, are the means by which the selection of a representative venire is effected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 691 A.2d 1255. It also admonished that the language of C.J. \u00a7 8-211 \u201cis clear and very specific,\u201d and that the failure to file a motion under C.J. \u00a7 8-211(a) \u201cresults in <em>waiver </em>of the statutory remedies provided in C.J. \u00a7 8-211(d).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 146, 691 A.2d 1255 citing <em>United States v. Boney, </em>977 F.2d 624 (D.C.Cir. 1992) (failure to \u201cchallenge properly the jury for improper selection waives the issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Of import here, the <em>Hunt </em>Court determined that, after completion of voir dire, the defendant \u201clost the statutory remedy and must labor under constitutional or common law principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144-46, 691 A.2d 1255. It reasoned, <em>id. </em>at 146,691 A.2d 1255 (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a fair trial and impartial jury is the touchstone of our justice system.1 J What is required of jurors is that they be without bias or prejudice for or against the defendant and that their minds be free to hear and impartially consider the evidence and render a fair verdict thereon. Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[bjias on the part of prospective jurors will never be presumed, and the challenging party bears the burden of presenting facts ... which would give rise to a showing of actual prejudice.\u2019 \u201d If a criminal defendant undertakes to challenge a juror on grounds of bias, the attack must be affirmatively advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>at the time of trial. It may not be raised for the first time in a collateral attack upon the conviction and/or sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In an effort to distinguish the case <em>sub judice </em>from <em>Hunt, </em>appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">The fact that Mr. Alade disclosed his non-citizenship status within hours of the rendition of the verdict, and the fact the issue was raised in this case pursuant to a ten-day motion, place it in a markedly different procedural posture than were the circumstances of the <em>Hunt </em>case. In short, the concerns implicated in <em>Hunt </em>as it regards efficiency and finality of judgment are simply not present here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We see appellant\u2019s position as a distinction without a difference. That Alade\u2019s status was disclosed within hours after the verdict was rendered does not alter the fact that the trial was already over.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\"><em>Hansel v. Collins, </em>180 Md. 100, 23 A.2d 1 (1941), supports our view that appellant waived his right to complain about Mr. Alade\u2019s jury service. There, the appellant filed a bill of complaint to set aside the judgment on the ground that the jury foreman had been a resident of West Virginia and had registered to vote in that state in 1940. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 103, 23 A.2d 1. The juror worked in Allegany County, however, and his name remained on the voter rolls of that county. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 23 A.2d 1. The Court of Appeals declared, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Appellant could have made proper inquiry and objected before the juror was sworn which he did not do, but waited until over four months after he had lost the case to present this matter to the court, nor has he shown that his rights were prejudiced by the service of this juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\"><em>See also Young v.

These cases provide guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In <em>People ex rel. Ostwald v. Craver, </em>272 A.D. 181, 70 N.Y.S.2d 513 (N.Y.App.Div.1947), the defendant was convicted of a criminal offense and the prosecutor, upon later discovering that one of the jurors was not a United States citizen, moved to set aside the verdict on the ground that the jury was illegally constituted. The motion was granted, and a new trial was ordered. The defendant later filed for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted. On appeal by the state, the court held that, because the conviction was set aside, the defendant could not be re-tried for the same offense. However, the court also observed that the defendant\u2019s conviction was \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>illegal, and should not have been set aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 70 N.Y.S.2d 513. It stated, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\"><em>An objection to the qualification of a juror is available only upon a challenge.

State, </em>256 Ga.App. 594, 569 S.E.2d 264 (2002), the Georgia Court of Appeals upheld the denial of a motion for a new trial filed by a criminal defendant who complained that, in violation of Georgia law, his jury included a person who was not a United States citizen. <em>Id. </em>at 266. Among other things, Moton claimed that the juror failed to respond truthfully on the juror questionnaire to a question about her citizenship, which was not discovered until after Moton\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The court observed that Moton never asked the juror about her citizenship during voir dire, nor did he object to her service as a juror. <em>Id. </em>at 266. Therefore, the court ruled that he was not entitled to a new trial based on the juror\u2019s status as a foreign national. In rejecting Moton\u2019s due process claim, the court stated, <em>id. </em>at 267:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">[E]ven if aliens can be excluded from a jury, it does not necessarily follow that an alien\u2019s participation on a jury deprives a defendant of due process. [The juror in question] testified in Moton\u2019s hearing on motion for a new trial that, although she was from Jamaica, English was her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>primary language, she understood what was happening at the trial, and she applied the law as instructed by the trial court. Thus, Moton cannot show that [the juror\u2019s] participation on his jury deprived him of any of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Notably, with respect to waiver, the court said that \u201ca challenge propter defectum,\u201d i.e., a claim of incompetency based on alienage, infancy, or residency, \u201cmust be discovered and made before trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266. It also stated: \u201c \u2018A juror incompetent propter defectum is made specially competent by the act of the parties in allowing him to serve without challenge, and a verdict will not be set aside for such cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">To be sure, the court recognized that, when a juror fails to answer correctly a question on a juror questionnaire, and a correct response would have disqualified the juror, the defendant may be entitled to a new trial if he shows that the juror failed to answer truthfully. <em>Id. </em>at 267. However, the defendant in <em>Moton </em>could not show that the juror failed to answer truthfully a question about citizenship. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court found that Alade did not deliberately misrepresent his status as a citizen. Rather, it found that his incorrect response was the result of an \u201coversight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Appellant relies on <em>Perkins v. Smith, </em>370 F.Supp. 134 (D.Md.1974), <em>aff'd, </em>426 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 2616, 49 L.Ed.2d 368 (1976), to support his argument that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial. In <em>Perkins, </em>a resident alien of Maryland brought an action challenging his exclusion from jury service based solely on his alien status. In rejecting Perkins\u2019s challenge, the lower court articulated, <em>id. </em>at 138:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">In maintaining the jury system as \u201cthe very palladium of free government\u201d the states logically can anticipate that native-born citizens would be conversant with the social and political institutions of our society, the customs of the locality, the nuances of local tradition and language. Likewise naturalized citizens, who have passed through the citizenship classes sponsored by the Immigration and Natu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ralization Service, have demonstrated a basic understanding of our form of government, history and traditions. There is no corresponding basis for assuming that resident aliens, who owe allegiance not to any state or to the federal government, but are subjects of a foreign power, have so assimilated our societal and political mores that an equal reliance could be placed on their performing as well as citizens the duties of jurors in our judicial system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">The nature of the operation of juries makes it apparent that persons unfit for jury service can work a great deal of harm, through inability or malice, to efficiency and fairness. Jury deliberations are perhaps the most secret form of decision-making in the nation; the means of persuasion used by jurors on each other are never revealed. A single juror who failed to understand the import of the evidence being presented or who lacked any concern for the fairness of the outcome could severely obstruct or distort the course of justice. A single persuasive and unprincipled juror could even direct the course of justice into channels deliberately chosen for their deleterious effect on this country. We conclude, therefore, that the state has a compelling interest in the restriction of jury service to those who will be loyal to, interested in, and familiar with, the customs of this country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">Resident aliens by definition have not yet been admitted to citizenship. Until they become citizens, they remain in most cases legally bound to the country of their origin. Nothing is to prevent their return to that country, or a move to yet a third nation. It is true that many, if not most, aliens do intend to become citizens, and that their loyalty could probably be counted upon. However, it is the process of filing for citizenship that establishes that loyalty; any attempt at prior screening would undercut the efficiency and significance of existing procedures. Therefore, although the presumption that all aliens owe no allegiance to the United States is not valid in every case, no alternative to taking citizenship for testing allegiance can be devised, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>that we conclude that the classification is compelled by circumstances, and that it is justifiable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">To be sure, <em>Perkins </em>made clear that courts <em>may </em>exclude non-citizens from their juries. But, the court did not say that non-citizens <em>must </em>be excluded, or that a defendant is necessarily entitled to a new trial whenever a non-citizen happens to serve on a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The cases cited above persuade us that appellant waived his right to complain about Mr. Alade\u2019s lack of citizenship. Although appellant had an opportunity to challenge Mr. Alade\u2019s qualifications to serve as a juror during voir dire, he did not avail himself of this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Even if there were no waiver, we are of the view that Mr. Alade\u2019s status as a foreign national does not automatically compel a reversal. By way of analogy, we look to other jurisdictions that have addressed the effect of the presence of felons on juries, in violation of applicable statutes. Like Maryland, these courts have concluded that this circumstance does not automatically justify a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In <em>Boney, supra, </em>977 F.2d 624, the defendants discovered after trial, but before sentencing, that the jury foreman was a convicted felon. <em>Id. </em>at 628. Nevertheless, the trial court denied their motion for a new trial, without a hearing. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendants argued that, because the juror was statutorily ineligible to serve, his presence on the jury constituted reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 633. Rejecting that contention, the court said'.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury ... does not require an <em>absolute bar </em>on felon-jurors. The Supreme Court has stressed repeatedly that the touchstone of the guarantee of an impartial jury is protection against juror bias. A per se rule would be appropriate, therefore, only if one could reasonably conclude that felons are always biased against one party or another. But felon status, alone, does not necessarily imply bias. In fact, as the dissent suggests, Congress\u2019 purpose in restricting felons\u2019 jury service may stem from considerations other than a concern for biased jurors.... <em>We think, therefore, that the Sixth Amend</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>ment guarantee of an impartial trial does not mandate a per se invalidation of every conviction reached by a jury that included a felon.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Id. </em>(boldface added) (footnote and citations omitted). Therefore, the court remanded the case for a hearing at which the appellants would have an opportunity to prove that the juror\u2019s failure to disclose his status as a felon revealed actual bias. <em>Id. </em>at 634-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In <em>United States v. Humphreys, </em>982 F.2d 254 (8th Cir.1992), the Eighth Circuit held that a new trial was not required because a felon sat on a jury that convicted the defendant of income tax evasion. The juror revealed his prior conviction during voir dire but mistakenly indicated that his civil rights had been restored. The defendant moved for a new trial based on the juror\u2019s participation in the verdict. The court held that a defendant presenting such a post-verdict challenge had to demonstrate actual bias or prejudice affecting the juror\u2019s impartiality and the fairness of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We agree with the trial court that Mr. Alade\u2019s service on the jury did not infringe Owens\u2019s due process right to a fair and impartial jury, merely because of his status as a foreign national. The \u201cdue process clause of the fourteenth amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee the right to an impartial jury to the accused in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Couser v. State, </em>282 Md. 125, 138, 383 A.2d 389 (1978). But, in this ease, there was no showing of prejudice or any allegation that Mr. Alade lacked the ability to perform his duties impartially and intelligently because of his status as a Nigerian. To the contrary, the court found that there was \u201cno showing that Mr. Alade\u2019s non-citizen status in any way or manner prejudiced the Defendant\u2019s case, his consideration of the evidence, or the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d Therefore, it was satisfied that appellant\u2019s due process rights were not infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">As the Court reiterated in <em>Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 146, 691 A.2d 1255: \u201c \u2018 \u201c[b]ias on the part of prospective jurors will <em>never </em>be presumed, and the challenging party bears the burden of presenting facts ... which would give rise to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>showing of actual prejudice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 38, 633 A.2d 867) (in turn quoting <em>Borman v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 276, 279, 229 A.2d 440 (1967)). Appellant did not establish bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The recent case of <em>Williams v. State, </em>394 Md. 98, 904 A.2d 534 (2006), does not alter our conclusion. In that case, the defendant was charged with distribution of cocaine and other related offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 904 A.2d 534. The Court considered whether the defendant was entitled to a new trial because a juror failed to disclose, during voir dire, that a member of the juror\u2019s family was employed as a secretary in the prosecutor\u2019s office, and \u201cthe relationship was not discovered until after the trial was completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101, 904 A.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">During voir dire, the venire panel was asked whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJk\">\u201c... any member of the panel, any member of your immediate family or household or anyone else that you\u2019re close to and get significant advice from, been in the past, going to be in the future or are currently employed or doing business with or otherwise closely associated -with any law enforcement agency? That includes the City Police, the County Police, the State Police, or any other kind of police. The [Ajttorney General for the State of Maryland or any other State, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Officer [sic], Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and other State or District Attorney\u2019s office, the United State\u2019s [sic] Attorney [sic] Office for the Federal District of Maryland or any other federal district, Federal law enforcement agencies including but not limited to FBI, DEA, ATF, INS, IRS, Customs, Coast Guard, Military Police, NSA, CIA, Homeland Security or any other type of outfit that either has a security function or has an investigative function? Also, include parole and probation agents, sheriffs departments, correctional officers and other employees of correctional facilities and people who work for private security companies, then be prepared to tell us about that when you come up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 904 A.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">As noted, the juror in question did not disclose a familial relationship with the prosecutor\u2019s office. After trial, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>advised appellant of the familial connection, and appellant filed a motion for new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 904 A.2d 534. At the motion hearing, the prosecutor acknowledged the juror\u2019s familial connection, <em>id. </em>at 104, 904 A.2d 534, but did not know why the juror failed to disclose the relationship during voir dire. Nor was the juror present \u201cto testify as to the reason for the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In denying the new trial motion, the trial court said, <em>id. </em>at 105, 904 A.2d 534:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201cWell that\u2019s pretty remote; a sister of a secretary in the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office. If the Court of Appeals wants to grant a new trial on that basis they\u2019re more than welcome to do it. We struggle in Baltimore with an electorate with less than a high school education, that is not very sophisticated, and doesn\u2019t understand the simplest of questions. If the Court of Appeals wants to create laboratory circumstances and create precision in each trial, which pre-supposes that jurors will come in here that come in and understand simple English questions, or a defendant gets multiple trials at great expense to the taxpayers, let them do so. I\u2019m not going to. Motion for New Trial is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 904 A.2d 534. In so doing, the Court distinguished <em>Williams </em>from our decisions in <em>Burkett v. State, supra, </em>21 Md.App. 438, 319 A.2d 845, and <em>Leach v. State, supra, </em>47 Md.App. 611, 425 A.2d 234. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">In both <em>Burkett </em>and <em>Leach, </em>the trial judge, upon discovery of the jurors\u2019 non-disclosure of a relationship that was the subject of voir dire inquiry, recognizing the potential for prejudice, <em>questioned the jurors, on the record, to determine whether there was, or cause to be concerned about, prejudice. Only after that inquiry and on the basis of the findings it made on the basis of the information it disclosed did, or could, the trial court exercise its discretion with respect to the requested relief. </em>With no comparable inquiry as a predicate in this case, the trial judge, concluding that the relationship not disclosed was \u201cpretty remote,\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>therefore, not sufficient to support a new trial, denied the Williams\u2019 [sic] motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><em>Williams, </em>394 Md. at 112, 904 A.2d 534 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Court continued, <em>id. </em>at 113-15, 904 A.2d 534 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">In both <em>Burkett </em>and <em>Leach, </em>the trial court was able to perform its \u201cfocal point\u201d role. It was able to conduct the further investigation and delving into the juror\u2019s state of mind, albeit after the fact. As a result, <em>the court was able to satisfy itself, and was satisfied, that the non-disclosure was inadvertent, that, in other words, there was no basis to believe that the juror was biased or otherwise not impar</em>tial.4 ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">We hold that, <em>where there is a non-disclosure by a juror of information that a voir dire question seeks and the record does not reveal whether the non-disclosure was intentional or </em>inadvertent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Of import here, Chief Judge Bell, writing for the four-member majority, underscored the importance of an evidentiary hearing, at which the juror is present, as a predicate to the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">We endeavor to be clear on this point. Where the juror is available for further voir dire and is further voir dired, a trial court may exercise the discretion <em>Burkett </em>requires it to exercise. But, the trial court\u2019s sound discretion can only be exercised <em>on the basis of the information that the voir dire reveals and the findings the trial court makes as a result. </em>On the other hand, where the juror is <em>not </em>available or is not voir dired, there simply is neither a basis for the findings of fact, which must form the predicate for the exercise of discretion, nor for the exercise of discretion that <em>Burkett </em>contemplates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">In a footnote, the Court elaborated, <em>id. </em>at 115, 904 A.2d 534, n. 9.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">As should be obvious, that result [of a new trial] is the product of a record that was so deficient as not to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>permitted this Court, or the trial court, for that matter, to make a finding as to why the juror not did disclose her familial relationship. Speculation from an inadequate record simply will not do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Even if we regard Alade\u2019s incorrect answer on the questionnaire as comparable to an incorrect response to a voir dire question or a failure to disclose, the instant matter is easily distinguished from <em>Williams. </em>Unlike in <em>Williams, </em>the court below conducted an evidentiary hearing to explore why Alade stated on the questionnaire that he was qualified to serve. The juror explained that he simply \u201cmissed\u201d the portion of the form regarding categories for disqualification. In its ruling, the trial court expressly found that Alade\u2019s testimony was \u201ccredible.\u201d Further, the court determined that the juror\u2019s \u201cfailure to note that he was not a citizen of the United States was simply an oversight.\u201d And, it found that \u201cMr. Alade did not provide a dishonest response to the citizenship question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In addition, the court was of the view that the \u201cquestionnaire itself is confusing,\u201d which apparently contributed to the juror\u2019s mistake. The court explained: \u201cAs reflected on Court\u2019s Exhibit A, a person can \u2018check off that he or she is qualified to serve as a juror before even seeing the disqualifying factors listed below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Finally, the court ruled that \u201cthe presence of Mr. Alade on the jury\u201d did not deny appellant \u201ca fair and impartial trial\u201d or violate his due process rights. It explained: \u201cThe mere presence and participation of a juror who would have been disqualified by statutory provisions is not a basis for a new trial absent a showing of bias or prejudice. The Defendant has failed to make such a showing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Accordingly, unlike in <em>Williams, </em>the record reveals that Mr. Alade\u2019s mistaken response was fully explored by the trial court at an evidentiary hearing. The court found that the error was unintentional and inadvertent, and did not result in any bias or prejudice to appellant. These core findings entitled the court to exercise its discretion, which it did in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>III. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"AKi\">A. Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Appellant moved to suppress his oral statements to Detectives Eric Kruhm and Vickie Shaffer at the Hospital, claiming that they were made during custodial interrogations and that the detectives failed to advise him of his constitutional rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Detective Kruhm, of the Howard County Police Department, testified that on July 30, 2003, at about 6:30 p.m., he and Detective Shaffer encountered appellant at the playroom of the Hospital\u2019s pediatric ward, with Dacquan. Detective Kruhm \u201cintroduced himself and Detective Schaffer\u201d to appellant and \u201csat down within a few feet of [Owens] and began talking with him.\u201d Detective Kruhm informed appellant that they were at the Hospital because of Kevonte\u2019s death, and asked appellant a series of questions about the day\u2019s events, including \u201cwho had the children that day. How long they had been with each person or if anybody had visited the home?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The detectives spoke with appellant for about ten to fifteen minutes. During their conversation, the detectives did not display their weapons, nor was Owens restrained. Moreover, appellant never indicated that he wanted to end the conversation or leave the playroom. Detective Kruhm added that \u201cwe were actually the ones that ended the interview. We got up. We finished and actually left. Myself and Detective Shaffer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">According to Detective Kruhm, appellant told him that he stayed home with the children often, and had the children with him at home all day on July 30, 2003, while his wife was at work. Appellant explained that, after lunch, Kevonte and Dacquan fell asleep until about 5:00 p.m. and, when he went to awaken them, Kevonte was unusually tired. According to Detective Kruhm, appellant said that by the time they arrived at Ms. Davis\u2019s work to pick her up, Kevonte\u2019s lips had turned blue.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Detective Kruhm described appellant as appearing nervous during the conversation. He noted that Owens twice muttered to himself, once saying, \u201cFucking up,\u201d and once saying, \u201cHow does this shit happen?\u201d When Detective Kruhm confronted appellant with the fact that Kevonte had bruises on his sternum and face, appellant suggested the cause might be attributable to the fact that Kevonte and Dacquan tended to fight with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Detective Kruhm and Detective Shaffer next spoke to appellant at approximately 9:48 p.m. that evening, while in the Hospital\u2019s pediatric ward. Kruhm told appellant \u201cthat [they] wanted to talk to him a little further, and that [they] wanted to tape the interview.\u201d Detective Kruhm explained that he wanted to audiotape the conversation because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take a lot of notes,\u201d and \u201cwanted to pay attention to what [appellant] had to say.\u201d Appellant did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Of significance to the motion, the following exchange ensued at the end of the interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">[APPELLANT]: Is there anything else before I go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: You can leave any time; we\u2019re not holding you in here anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">[APPELLANT]: All right. See you tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Detective Kruhm testified that appellant was neither handcuffed nor restrained during the second interview. The detectives were not in uniform, nor were their weapons displayed. Moreover, Detective Kruhm claimed that they did not threaten appellant, nor did they make any promises to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">During cross-examination, Detective Kruhm acknowledged that appellant was a suspect immediately after the first interview. He also indicated that he might have obtained appellant\u2019s car keys from him before the second interview. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did there come a time that you came into possession with [sic] car keys to the Honda?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-15\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: I believe I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And how and where did that happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: I don\u2019t remember where, but I believe I had [a] conversation with Mr. Owens telling him that I needed the keys to the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Would that be one of the two conversations that you\u2019ve already referenced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArQ\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APO\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. When would it have been in relation to those two conversations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: When the Search Warrant was going to happen on the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: When was that in relation to these two conversations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: I don\u2019t remember. [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Quite possibly after the first and before the second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: That\u2019s possible, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4-\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes. And do you have any recollection of where that conversation you had with Mr. Owens took place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right. Could it have been outside by the parking lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: It could have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And it could have been pri- or to the second conversation you had in room eleven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEy\">[DETECTIVE KRUHM]: I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">Detective Schaffer testified that the interviews with appellant occurred before the execution of the search warrant for the Honda. His testimony was largely consistent with that of Detective Kruhm. He indicated that, prior to the second interview, they approached appellant and told him that they \u201cneeded to speak with him again.\u201d Then, they found an empty room and brought appellant there for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Appellant explained that, after the first interview, he went outside to get \u201csome air,\u201d and because he \u201cneeded to go to the car to get a phone number so [he] could call [his] friend to let him know what was going on so he could come and get [him].\u201d While Owens was outside, next to his car, talking on his cell phone, the detectives approached him for the second time and indicated that they needed to ask him \u201csome more questions and to come with them.\u201d The detectives told him \u201cthey also needed the keys to the house and car.\u201d Accordingly, appellant gave the detectives his keys and followed them into the Hospital. Appellant stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really think [he] had a choice whether to answer the Detectives\u2019 questions, and that he did not feel free to leave during either interview.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Appellant confirmed that he was neither handcuffed nor restrained during either interview. He also confirmed that neither detective stopped him when he said he wanted to leave the room, nor did he indicate that he did not want to proceed with either interview. Appellant acknowledged that the second interview concluded when he stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The court denied the motion to suppress. It stated that it considered a number of factors, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">One, is when and where the interrogation occurred. In this case there were two different occasions when Mr. Owens talked to detectives. They both took place in the hospital. The first conversation took place in a playroom, and the second one was in a patient room, close to where the victim had been kept prior to the victim\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">In both instances, Mr. Owens was already in the hospital. When he went in to the playroom, the detectives were already there, the conversation ensued. The later conversation was at the detectives\u2019 request when they went in to a patient room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">I also need to consider the length of each interrogation. In both instances they were short, as I recall, maybe fifteen to twenty minutes on each occasion. So, they were not lengthy interrogations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The third factor is the number of police officers that were present. In both instances, there were two officers present when conversations with Mr. Owens took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">I also need to consider what the officers and suspect said, or did. These were all, obviously, conversations where the detectives were trying to seek information from Mr. Owens about what occurred on a particular day in question when his stepson was taken to the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">When Mr. Owens testified in these proceedings, ... and I should have mentioned in the beginning, I did take into account all of the testimony and evidence presented, including the assessing of the credibility of the witness, and I did review the cases that counsel asked me to review. But, in determining what was said or done\u2014 ... Mr. Owens testified on cross-examination that he never said that he did not want to talk to the detectives, and he never said that he did not want to answer anymore questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">There is one point in the interview where Mr. Owens indicated that he felt the detectives were trying to coerce him. At that point, the interview ended, and he was free to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">That fact also addresses another factor as to whether or not he was phyksically restrained. At no time during any of the interrogations was Mr. Owens physically restrained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">There was some testimony as far as everybody\u2019s relative location in the two rooms. In no instance do I find that the placement of persons in the room, in any manner, restricted Mr. Owens from being able to leave, had he chosen to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">He was \u2014 I believe he had testified in cross-examination, or maybe it was on direct, um, and the detectives indicted that he was never told that he could not leave. And, in fact, at the time when he thought he was being coerced, he was able to leave, and he [w]as not stopped, in any respect, from trying to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">Another factor is whether there was a show of force. There were no threats made to Ms. Owens, according to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>own testimony. Additionally, the officers had weapons, but they were never drawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">Another factor is how he got to the place of questioning. As I indicated, he was already at the hospital, because his stepson had been admitted to the hospital, so he was not at that location at the police officers\u2019 request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">Final factor to be considered is whether he was detained, or arrested. He was not arrested that evening; in fact, he was arrested two days later. So, from that standpoint, this also gets into any physical constrains. There were no such constraints upon his ability to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">So, considering the totality of the circumstances I find, that based upon the testimony and evidence presented in my review of applicable case law, that this was not a custodial interrogation in either event, so <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required prior to the questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">I also find that a reasonable person in Mr. Owens\u2019 circumstances would have felt free to leave, and that this was not a coercive environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Appellant contends that, under our holding in <em>Bond v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 219, 788 A.2d 705 (2002), \u201cthe trial court erred in denying [his] motion to suppress.\u201d He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">[I]t is clear that the two officers wearing weapons approached Appellant in the unfamiliar atmosphere of a hospital waiting room on the heels of learning of the death of his stepson and commenced to question him about their investigation. Certainly an ordinary person under such circumstances would feel intimidated and unable to end the encounter. Indeed, the officers dictated the contours of the initiation and termination of the interrogation. As it regards the second interrogation, the officers sought out Appellant ... they indicated that they \u201cneed[ed] to speak with him again,\u201d they took his car keys from him; they led him to the private environs of an unoccupied patient room; they sat him with his back to the wall; they closed the door; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>they proceeded to interrogate him with an audio tape-recorder in an accusatory manner by offering repeated expressions of his guilt and rejecting his denials of culpability. And although [the] Detective testified [that] Appellant was not under arrest and that he was \u201cfree to leave,\u201d it is inconceivable that Appellant felt, or was in fact, free to leave when, after he was compelled to ask[ ] permission to leave, he was advised, \u201cWe\u2019re not holding you in here anymore.\u201d ... Appellant was clearly in police custody when the detectives were interrogating him for the second time, he was not advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>before being subjected to the custodial interrogation, and the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress was error. The error requires reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The State counters that \u201cthe record and controlling authority fully support the circuit court\u2019s ruling.\u201d Quoting <em>Argueta v. State, </em>136 Md.App. 273, 279, 764 A.2d 863, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 142, 771 A.2d 1071 (2001), it asserts: \u201c \u2018[P]reliminary to any decision to exclude evidence because it was gathered from the criminal suspect who was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights is a determination of whether that evidence constitutes a statement stemming from custodial interrogation.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotations omitted). It adds: \u201cThe threshold in deciding the applicability of <em>Miranda </em>is whether the person being questioned has been taken into custody or deprived of his freedom in some significant manner.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted). Moreover, it contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">[T]he trial court thoroughly reviewed the facts established at the suppression hearing, including reviewing the audiotape made by Owens. The Court found that the interrogations were not lengthy, that Owens never said that he did not want to talk with the officers, that Owens was free to leave and was not stopped when he did leave, that no threats were made to Owens, and that Owens was not restrained or under arrest and, in fact, was not arrested until two days later. Based upon the evidence before it, the suppression court properly concluded \u201cthat a reasonable person in Mr. Owens\u2019 circumstances would have felt free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>leave, and that this was not a coercive environment,\u201d and held \u201cthat this was not a custodial interrogation in either event, so <em>Miranda, </em>warnings were not required prior to the questioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to a suppression motion is based solely on the record of the suppression hearing. <em>State v.

State, </em>88 Md.App. 197, 209, 594 A.2d 609 (1991), <em>aff'd, 327 </em>Md. 494, 610 A.2d 782 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1054, 113 S.Ct. 981, 122 L.Ed.2d 134 (1993). But, the concept of \u201ccustody\u201d is not necessarily limited to a formal arrest; \u201cthe ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>California v. Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Thompson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>516 U.S. at 112, 116 S.Ct. 457, custody may be found when \u201ca reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201cThe <em>Miranda </em>custody inquiry is an objective test.\u201d <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. at 667, 124 S.Ct. 2140. Therefore, \u201cthe initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d <em>Stansbury v. California, </em>511 U.S. 318, 323, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (per curiam). Accordingly, the trial court must assess \u201call of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation,\u201d <em>Stansbury, </em>511 U.S. at 322, 114 S.Ct. 1526, and consider \u201chow a reasonable person in the position of the individual being questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her \u2018freedom of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 114 S.Ct. 1526. Put another way, \u201ccustody must be determined based on how a reasonable \u25a0, person, in the suspect\u2019s situation would perceive his circumstances.\u201d <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. at 662, 124 S.Ct. 2140; <em>see Berkemer v.

It determined that \u201c \u2018custody occurs if a suspect is led to believe, as a reasonable person, that he is being deprived or restricted of his freedom of action or movement under pressures of official authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">To be sure, \u201c[d]eciding when a person has been significantly deprived of his freedom of action so as to be in custody within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>depends on the factual setting surrounding the interrogation in each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 411 A.2d 415. In this regard, the trial court must consider, <em>inter alia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>whether the suspect was \u201cphysically deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way or is placed in a situation in which he reasonably believes that his freedom of action or movement is restricted by such interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 411 A.2d 415 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The <em>Whitfield </em>Court enumerated several factors relevant to the custody determination. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201c[T]hose facts intrinsic to the interrogation: when and where it occurred, how long it lasted, how many police were present, what the officers and the defendant said and did, the presence of actual physical restraint on the defendant or things equivalent to actual restraint such as drawn weapons or a guard stationed at the door, and whether the defendant was being questioned as a suspect or as a witness. Facts pertaining to events before the interrogation are also relevant, especially how the defendant got to the place of questioning \u2014 whether he came completely on his own, in response to a police request, or escorted by police officers. Finally, what happened after the interrogation \u2014 whether the defendant left freely, was detained or arrested \u2014 may assist the court in determining whether the defendant, as a reasonable person, would have felt free to break off the questioning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 141, 411 A.2d 415 (quoting <em>Hunter v. State, </em>590 P.2d 888, 895 (Alaska 1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">With this framework in mind, we discern no merit to appellant\u2019s challenge to his statements at the Hospital. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\"><em>Allen v. State, supra, </em>158 Md.App. 194, 857 A.2d 101, is informative. There, appellant was charged with murder, as well as robbery with a deadly weapon, robbery, theft, and two counts of carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure. At a suppression hearing, appellant moved to suppress several oral and written statements he made to police officers in a store parking lot and at the sheriffs office. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 857 A.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Two officers testified that they arrived at the parking lot \u201cin response to appellant\u2019s call to the sheriffs office, in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>reported that he had stabbed someone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 857 A.2d 101. On the call, appellant also stated that \u201che had run a car into a ditch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 857 A.2d 101. Once on the scene, the officers noticed that appellant was covered in blood. <em>Id. </em>at 233, 857 A.2d 101. Accordingly, the officers asked appellant if he was injured. After appellant informed the officers that he was not injured, he \u201cvoluntarily \u2018started talking,\u2019 \u201d and gave \u201cdetails of the stabbing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 857 A.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">After the victim\u2019s body was located, appellant was voluntarily taken to a nearby produce stand to discuss the incident. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 857 A.2d 101. At the produce stand, he was informed that \u201che was \u2018not under arrest\u2019; that he was \u2018free to leave\u2019; and that he did not have to discuss the incident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After appellant agreed to discuss the incident, he was taken to the sheriffs office. <em>Id. </em>at 204-05, 857 A.2d 101. \u201cAlthough he was transported in a police vehicle, appellant was not handcuffed during the ride.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 857 A.2d 101. At the sheriffs office, an officer again informed appellant that he \u201cwas not under arrest and was free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, appellant was interviewed about the incident by a police sergeant. But, he was not restrained, nor did the police officer display his weapon. <em>Id. </em>Appellant gave oral and written statements. <em>Id. </em>at 205, 857 A.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In denying appellant\u2019s challenge to his statements at the parking lot, we explained: \u201cThese brief encounters with appellant were of a limited nature and were made in a public place, during the day, without the use of any weapons or physical restraints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 857 A.2d 101. We also denied appellant\u2019s challenge to the statements made at the sheriffs office, noting that appellant \u201cwas not under arrest, was free to leave, and did not have to \u2018discuss the incident\u2019 with the detectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 857 A.2d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\"><em>State v. Rucker, supra, </em>374 Md. 199, 821 A.2d 439, is also instructive. There, the police received an anonymous tip that Mr. Rucker was dealing drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 821 A.2d 439. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>response, they went to a shopping center and parked their marked cruiser behind Mr. Rucker\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 821 A.2d 439. After asking Rucker for his license and vehicle registration, the uniformed officers asked him if he had \u201canything he was not supposed to have.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Rucker admitted that he had cocaine. <em>Id. </em>Rucker moved to suppress his statements and the contraband, complaining that the police should have advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, because they initiated what amounted to a \u201cde facto arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 821 A.2d 439. The circuit court suppressed the statements and we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 821 A.2d 439. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Rucker was not in custody at the time of his statements. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 821 A.2d 439. In reaching its decision, the Court pointed to the following: the questioning occurred in a public place; the questioning lasted only a short period of time; only three officers were present; the officers did not condition the return of the license and registration upon Rucker\u2019s cooperation; and only one non-coercive question was asked before Rucker made the incriminating statements. <em>Id. </em>at 220-21, 821 A.2d 439. <em>See also Conboy v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 353, 369-73, 843 A.2d 216 (2004) (rejecting claim that the investigatory vehicle stop evolved into a custodial detention, and noting that only one trooper was present; defendant was on a busy street during the day; he was not physically restrained; and the trooper never told him that he was not free to leave).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Here, Detectives Kruhm and Shaffer interviewed appellant once in the Hospital playroom and again in an empty patient room. Neither interview was very long. Furthermore, appellant was not restrained in any way and was free to leave at any time during the interviews. We are not prepared to adopt appellant\u2019s argument that an ordinary person, under similar circumstances, would have felt intimidated and unable to end the encounter. Indeed, it was appellant who terminated the second interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In his final contention, appellant argues that \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.\u201d He avers that, \u201c[e]ven when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence in the instant case fails to compel the conclusion that there was any act attributable to Appellant that caused Kevonte\u2019s death, let alone a <em>criminal act, </em>simply because Kevonte was with Appellant during the day in question.\u201d According to appellant, the evidence merely shows that \u201cKevonte was left alone for an extended period in the company of his brother while Appellant napped with the baby, and it is equally possible that Kevonte suffered an accidental injury that ultimately caused his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Appellant suggests that reversal is required because \u201cthere is simply no evidence that the killing resulted from \u2018the deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not.\u2019 <em>[Burch v. State, </em>346 Md. 253, 696 A.2d 443 (1997)].\u201d He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">In any event, the evidence cannot support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, of second degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">Second degree murder embraces a killing accompanied by any one of at least three alternative <em>mentes reas: </em>killing another person (other than by poison or lying in wait) with the intent to kill, but without the deliberation and premeditation required for first degree murder; killing another person with the intent to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result; and what has become known as depraved heart murder \u2014 a killing resulting from \u201cthe deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not.\u201d <em>Robinson v.

State, </em>346 Md. 253, 274, 696 A.2d 443 (1997) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The State counters that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient to support Owens\u2019s conviction.\u201d In support of its contention, the State highlights the testimony of Kenesha Davis, Michael DeVilbis, Lisa Zovko, Dr. Jackson Tsai, Dr. David Monroe, Dr. Zabiullah Ali, and appellant\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">When reviewing a claim based on the sufficiency of evidence, we must determine \u201cwhether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v.

We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and will reverse the judgment only if we conclude that no \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781; <em>see Facon v.

Moreover, it is not the function of the appellate court to determine the credibility of witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>or the weight of the evidence. <em>Archer v.

Rather, it is the jury\u2019s task to resolve any conflicts in the evidence and assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>Archer, </em>383 Md. at 370, 859 A.2d 210; <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We are amply satisfied that the evidence was more than sufficient to establish the offenses of depraved heart murder, child abuse, and first degree assault. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In <em>Burch v. State, </em>346 Md. 253, 274, 696 A.2d 443, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1001, 118 S.Ct. 571, 139 L.Ed.2d 410 (1997), the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201c[mjurder is a single crime in Maryland that is divided, by statute, into two degrees.\u201d It held that second degree murder \u201cembraces a killing accompanied by any of at least three alternative <em>mentes reae.\u201d Id. </em>They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">killing another person (other than by poison or lying in wait) with the intent to kill, but without the deliberation and premeditation required for first degree murder; killing another person with the intent to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result; and what has become known a depraved heart murder \u2014 a killing resulting from \u201cthe deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 274, 696 A.2d 443 (quoting <em>Robinson v. State, </em>307 Md. 738, 744, 517 A.2d 94 (1986) and <em>DeBettencourt v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 522, 530, 428 A.2d 479, <em>cert. denied, </em>290 Md. 713 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Second degree depraved heart murder requires \u201cthe deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>307 Md. at 744, 517 A.2d 94. The act must be committed \u201c \u2018under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 745, 517 A.2d 94 (citation omitted). The crime of second degree depraved heart murder can be committed with or without an intent to injure. <em>Id. </em>at 745, 517 A.2d 94. The <em>Robinson </em>Court reasoned, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">The terms \u201crecklessness\u201d or \u201cindifference,\u201d often used to define - the crime, do not preclude an act of intentional injury. They refer to \u201crecklessness\u201d or \u201cindifference\u201d to the ultimate consequence of the act \u2014 death\u2014not to the act that produces that result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Appellant suggested that the injuries were the result of the children fighting. But, Dr. Ali rejected that theory, explaining that a small child could not have inflicted the injuries sustained by Kevonte. It was the province of the jury to reject appellant\u2019s explanation and credit the State\u2019s version of events. <em>See, e.g., Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 580, 583 A.2d 1037 (1991) (recognizing that \u201cthe credibility of witnesses\u201d is \u201calways [a] matter[ ] for the jury to determine when it is the trier of facts\u201d). And, a witness\u2019s credibility goes to the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency. <em>Ruth v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 358, 365, 757 A.2d 152, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 Md. 435, 761 A.2d 933 (2000) (citation omitted); <em>see also Cain v. State, </em>162 Md.App. 366, 379, 875 A.2d 146 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The State presented expert testimony that established that a tremendous amount of blunt force was inflicted upon the victim, causing rib fractures, bruising of both the lungs and thymus, and tearing of the liver. Moreover, the evidence showed that such injuries could not have been inflicted by the victim\u2019s four-year-old brother. In addition, appellant had sole custody of the victim during the time that the injuries were sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The evidence supporting appellant\u2019s conviction for child abuse was also legally sufficient. Child abuse is defined as \u201cphysical injury sustained by a minor as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of a malicious act under circumstances that indicate that the minor\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or threatened by the treatment or act.\u201d Maryland Code (2002, 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 2-601 of Criminal Law Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>(\u201cC.L.\u201d). Surely, appellant\u2019s use of deadly force qualified as \u201ccruel or inhumane treatment\u201d or a \u201cmalicious act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">C.L. Section 3-202(a)(l) defines the crime of first-degree assault. It provides, in part, that \u201c[a] person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.\u201d \u201cSerious physical injury\u201d is defined as'physical injury that: \u201c(1) creates a substantial risk of death; or (2) causes permanent or protracted serious: (i) disfigurement; (ii) loss of the function of any bodily member or organ; or (iii) impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-201(c). Clearly, there was sufficient evidence to support Owens\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AFFIRMED.
