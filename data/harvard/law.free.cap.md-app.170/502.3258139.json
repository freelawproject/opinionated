Judicial review of an order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was sought in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City by Frederick Green, appellant. Cross motions for summary judgment were filed by appellant, and by his employer, Carr Lowery Glass Company, and its insurer, the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund, appellees (collectively \u201cthe employer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Following a hearing, the circuit court granted the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, thus giving rise to this appeal in which appellant asks:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">1. Is a claimant whose hearing has been damaged as a result of his occupation, and who meets the criteria for benefits under LE \u00a7 9-505, entitled to have hearing aids provided by the employer and insurer, despite the fact that he does not meet the criteria of LE \u00a7 9-650?<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The material facts in this case are not disputed, thus we recount them only to the extent necessary to resolve the legal issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>On August 3, 2004, appellant, employed by Carr Lowery Glass Company as a mold shop worker for more than 30 years, filed a notice of employee\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Appellant asserted a date of disablement of February 25, 2003,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that \u201cyears of exposure to loud glass machine(s) caused loss of hearing.\u201d On October 19, 2004, a hearing evaluation was performed, at appellant\u2019s request, by Brian Kaplan, M.D., a physician affiliated with Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Associates. Dr. Kaplan provided the following evaluation of appellant\u2019s condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">[Appellant] does have a mild to severe high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. <em>His Maryland Compensation Formula for hearing loss is zero percent. </em>However, this pattern of hearing loss is consistent with that caused by significant noise exposure. This noise exposure and hearing loss is likely also the cause of the factors for his bilateral tinnitus. He is a good hearing aid candidate given the degree of loss and discrimination scores. The cost of hearing aids is $5125.00. I have recommended good hearing protection [in] the future when in loud environments and will plan seeing him back on an as needed basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Of importance to appellant\u2019s claim was that although the compensation formula computation compiled by Dr. Kaplan indicated that appellant suffered zero percent hearing loss under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation formula, appellant did suffer some hearing loss within the frequencies of the 2000 and 3000 hertz range.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Following a hearing on appellant\u2019s claim, the Commission passed an order on February 10, 2005, denying compensation. The Commission found \u201con the issues presented that [appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>lant] did not sustain an occupational disease of binaural hearing loss arising out and in the course of employment as alleged to have occurred February 25, 2003____\u201d On February 17, 2005, appellant filed a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The circuit court held a hearing on May 27, 2005, in order to entertain the parties\u2019 opposing motions for summary judgment. Thereafter, the court issued an oral opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">THE COURT: So I think again, inferring the legislative intent as best as I can, it is that a threshold has to be met before there\u2019s a right to medical benefits, and to the extent I can discern any other legislative intent, I look at 9-660 as it currently exists, and for whatever it\u2019s worth, it says \u201ccompensable hernia.\u201d Again, some intent indicated that in order to get medical services, you have to be within the threshold established by the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">So my view is you do have to meet the threshold under 101-25A, now codified in 9-650, in order to be entitled to medical benefits. And certainly, if I were writing the Workers Compensation Statute, it would seem rational to me to provide for medical services for someone suffering hearing loss as a result of his or her employment, regardless of whether it met the threshold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">However, I think the principle that ambiguities in the statute should be construed in favor of the Claimant, which certainly is an unarguable principle, only goes so far. And I think that the legislative intent from what I\u2019ve been able to determine, although when I say, I guess it requires close reading to determine it, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that, I don\u2019t think the principle of construing the statute in favor of the Claimant means that you hold everything in favor of the Complainant even if you think the legislative intent was to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">So I believe that it is required that the Claimant meet the standard of 9-650 before being entitled to medical benefits, and for that reason, it being entirely a question of law, as the parties agree, I\u2019m going to grant the Employer/Tnsur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>er\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, and I\u2019m going to deny the Claimant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The court\u2019s bench opinion was followed on May 31, 2005, by a written order which granted summary judgment in favor of the employer, denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and affirmed the decision of the Commission. Appellant\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Summary judgment may be granted \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md.

Is a claimant whose hearing has been damaged as a result of his occupation, and who meets the criteria for benefits under LE \u00a7 9-505, entitled to have hearing aids provided by the employer and insurer, despite the fact that he does not meet the criteria of LE \u00a7 9-650?</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>Principles of Statutory Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Our task in deciding the issue presented in this appeal is one of statutory construction. The Court of Appeals in <em>Derry v. State, 358 </em>Md. 325, 335-36, 748 A.2d 478 (2000), recounted the following well-honored principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATT\">As this Court repeatedly has made clear, the paramount goal of statutory interpretation is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue. The legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself, through its very own words. As a rule, we view the words of a statute in ordinary terms, in their natural meaning, in the manner in which they are most commonly understood. If the words of a statute clearly and unambiguously delineate the legislative intent, ours is an ephemeral enterprise: we need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads. Even so, we do not view the plain language of a statute in a vacuum. As we have often reiterated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">While the language of the statute is the primary source for determining legislative intention, the plain meaning rule of construction is not absolute; rather, the statute must be construed reasonably with reference to the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body. The Court will look at the larger context, including the legislative purpose, within which statutory language appears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">\u201c[T]his Court will \u2018neither add nor delete words in order to give the statute a meaning not otherwise eommunicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ed by the language used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Bd. of Educ., </em>375 Md. 21, 31, 825 A.2d 365 (2003)(citing <em>Blind Indus. v. Dep\u2019t of Gen. Servs., </em>371 Md. 221, 231, 808 A.2d 782 (2002)). We \u201cread statutes in harmony, so that all provisions can be given reasonable effect.\u201d <em>Yox, supra, </em>380 Md. at 337, 844 A.2d 1151 (citing <em>Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>305 Md. 145, 157, 501 A.2d 1307 (1986)). Further, \u201c[w]e do not interpret statutes in ways that produce absurd results that could never have been intended by the legislature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The Court of Appeals reiterated the following \u201cwell-settled\u201d and specific guidelines when construing provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), Maryland Code, Labor and Employment Article, Title 9 (1999 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">As we have repeatedly emphasized, the Act is remedial in nature and \u2018should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u2019 Thus, in interpreting the Act, we do not apply the canon of construction that a statute in derogation of the common law should be strictly construed. \u00a7 9-102(b). Moreover, all sections of the Act must be read together, in conjunction with one another, to discern the true intent of the legislature. Of course, we seek to avoid an interpretation which would lead to an untenable or illogical outcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">In construing the Act, as in construing all statutes, the paramount objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. In interpreting the Act, we apply the following general principles. First, if the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end. Second, when the meaning of the plain language is ambiguous or unclear, we seek to discern the intent of the legislature from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based. Last, applying a canon of construction specific to the Act, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the intent of the legislature is ambiguous or remains unclear, we resolve any uncertainty in favor of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">This Court, however, may not stifle the plain meaning of the Act, or exceed its purposes, so that the injured worker may prevail. Similarly, the Court may not create ambiguity or uncertainty in the Act\u2019s provisions where none exists so that a provision may be interpreted in favor of the injured claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Breitenbach v.

Despite a theoretically arguable ambiguity ..., we believe the plain language ... unmistakably manifests its legislative intent.\u201d 358 Md. at 336, 748 A.2d 478. Put another way, the language of the contested provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 9-505 and 9-650 in particular, is sufficiently clear that an inquiry into legislative history is unnecessary. <em>Cf. Crawley v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>70 Md.App. 100, 106, 519 A.2d 1348 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Appellant concedes that he does not meet the audiological standards outlined in \u00a7 9-650. But, he argues, \u00a7 9-650, when considered with \u00a7\u00a7 9-505 and 9-660, entitles him to an award of the costs of medical treatment, <em>i.e., </em>hearing aids, rather than monetary benefits, \u201csince those costs are not considered compensation.\u201d Appellant argues that \u00a7 9-505 is, in essence, <em>sui generis, </em>in that it \u201cstates that a claim for occupational hearing loss is a compensable disease if one suffers hearing loss in the requisite frequencies.\u201d And that \u201c[i]t is undisputed that [appellant] has met the criteria for \u2018occupational deafness\u2019 under this section [\u00a7 9-505].\u201d Further, by applying \u00a7 9-660, appellant seeks to distinguish medical services benefits from entitlement to monetary compensation under the more specific technical requirements of \u00a7 9-650.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Appellee responds that appellant does not become eligible for <em>any </em>benefits (medical or otherwise) until a claim is deemed compensable, and that there is no support for appellant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 9-505, standing alone, creates an entitlement to benefits. Appellee maintains that, although \u00a7\u00a7 9-505 and 9-650 are codified in different subsections of the article, the sections of the Act are inseparable for purposes of benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>analysis. Appellee posits that appellant merely seeks to excise and apply one provision of the Act, for his benefit, in contradistinction to the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Although dealing with the question of when a claim for occupational deafness accrues, the observations of the Court of Appeals, in <em>Yox, supra, </em>380 Md. at 328, 844 A.2d 1151, are instructive.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">[A]n occupational deafness disablement occurs when the hearing loss <em>becomes compensable under \u00a7 9-650. </em>A claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on occupational deafness must therefore be filed within two years from the time the hearing loss <em>reaches that level of compensability </em>and the employee has actual knowledge that the loss was caused by his/her employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Describing the former incantation of the Act (the \u201c1967 statute\u201d), Article 101, \u00a7 25A, the Court noted that, under the legislative scheme, \u201c \u2018occupational deafness\u2019 would be compensated \u2018according to the terms and conditions of [25A].\u2019 <em>Section 25A then set forth a technical set of criteria for when occupational deafness would be </em>compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 844 A.2d 1151. Additionally, the <em>Yox </em>Court noted that the 1967 statute was \u201cnow spread between [\u00a7\u00a7 ] 9-505 and 9-649 through 9-652,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 337, 844 A.2d 1151, and that these statutory changes resulted in an additional set of circumstances under the current Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">In 1991, as part of the general code revision process, art. 101 was repealed, and its provisions, constituting the workers\u2019 compensation law, were recodified as title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. The new article split the former provisions between subtitles 5, dealing with the entitlement to compensation, and 6, dealing with benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">Section 9-505 deals specifically with occupational deafness-hearing loss due to occupational disease rather than accidental injury. The current version requires an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>er to provide compensation \u201cin accordance with this title\u201d to a covered employee for loss of hearing due to industrial noise in the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 hertz.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADuG\">In <em>Crawley, supra, </em>70 Md.App. at 107, 519 A.2d 1348, we held that the legislature intended to make occupational hearing loss compensable without regard to \u201cdisablement.\u201d In so holding, we stated that the legislative intent of the 1967 statute was \u201cnot only <em>\u2018to provide technical criteria for measuring occupational loss of hearing </em>but also to make such loss compensable without regard to inability to work or loss of wages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument essentially hinges on his claim that the placement of \u00a7 9-505 within the statutory scheme is meaningless, as it currently exists, in light of the way in which various provisions were separated and reassigned in the recodification process, as we have detailed, <em>supra. </em>We are satisfied, however, that the language of \u00a7 9-505, in conjunction with the language of the Act as a whole, indicates otherwise. <em>See Breitenbach, supra, </em>366 Md. at 472-73, 784 A.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The language of \u00a7 9-505 suggests that it does not exist in a vacuum and that its terms are qualified through the definitions contained in other subsections within the Act. As noted, title 9 codifies the entire Act and \u00a7 9-505 clearly states that, \u201c[e]xeept as otherwise provided, an employer shall provide in accordance with this <em>title </em>...\u201d Section 9-505 is placed within subtitle 5, \u201cEntitlement to and Liability for Compensation,\u201d whereas \u00a7\u00a7 9-649 \u2014 9-652 are placed in subtitle 6, \u201cBenefits.\u201d Within subtitle 6 is the relevant part VII, entitled \u201cOccupational Deafness.\u201d The descriptive word \u201ctitle\u201d as used in \u00a7 9-505 clearly refers to the entire Act, which includes subtitle 6, wherein is set forth the specifics underlying compensability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>occupational deafness. Given this, the language of \u00a7 9-505 leads a reasonable reader to conclude that it was not intended as a stand-alone provision; in fact, a reasonable interpretation leads to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The language of \u00a7 9-505 is much too broad to function independently and serve as the sole basis for compensation, medical expenses, or otherwise. Section 9-505 provides no criteria other than \u201closs of hearing by the covered employee due to industrial noise in the [specified] frequencies ...\u201d Were that to be the whole of the test, nearly every employee of a certain age, at every task, will have suffered a compensable disablement. It is a fact that the human aging process is accompanied by some degree of hearing loss in a substantial percentage of the population. To accept appellant\u2019s reasoning, our holding would entitle nearly every worker in an industrial setting to compensation in the nature of medical expenses, including hearing aids, even in the absence of a \u00a7 9-650 calculation of occupational hearing loss. Under that scenario, the \u00a7 9 \u2014 650(b)(3) provision, providing for deduction for \u201cthe average amount of hearing loss from nonoccupational causes to be found in the population at any given age\u201d would be rendered meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Under appellant\u2019s formulation of \u00a7 9-505, it is equally unclear how hearing loss in the requisite frequencies would be measured. Section 9-650(a) provides specific audiometric instrumentation criteria; \u00a7 9-505 provides no similar requirement. The specificity of \u00a7 9-650(a) would be illogical and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act when measured against the absence of any such requirements in \u00a7 9-505, if the latter provision were meant to stand alone. The statute is, by necessity, complex. Hearing loss, as contrasted with other industrial injuries, can be determined only by the use of sophisticated testing. Hence, the considerable detail of the statute. Other industrial injuries or losses are more easily determined and observed. For example, the loss of a limb or other scheduled member can be readily attributed to an industrial accident. An employee who reports to work \"with all ten fingers and leaves with only nine, presents an easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>adjusted claim in terms of causation. In contrast, few employees, if any, are tested for hearing loss until such loss is suspected. Employers do not, therefore, know when an employee reports to work if that employee suffers from a measurable hearing loss and, even more, whether such loss, if any, is work-related. We conclude, therefore, that entitlement to compensation for occupational deafness must be predicated upon the claimant\u2019s having a degree of hearing loss as established within the specified technical parameters \u00a7 9-650.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Lastly, we consider the purpose of \u00a7 9-505 within the overall operation of the Act. In our quest to give every portion of the Act meaning, we find that \u00a7 9-505 has meaning separate and apart from \u00a7\u00a7 9-649 \u2014 9-652, but not the meaning appellant ascribes. Section 9-505 defines occupational deafness and provides that the condition itself is compensable, though, as we have described, this provision is qualified by \u00a7\u00a7 9-649 \u2014 9-652.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In 1961, in <em>Belschner v. Anchor Post Products, Inc., </em>227 Md. 89, 175 A.2d 419 (1961), the Court of Appeals held that a worker still performing his regular duties without a loss in wages was not disabled and could not recover benefits based on hearing loss. In response to <em>Belschner, </em>the legislature enacted what is now \u00a7 9-505. As this Court noted in <em>Tru-Rol v. Yox, </em>149 Md.App. 707, 715, 818 A.2d 283 (2003), in <em>Crawley, </em>\u201cwe adopted the position taken by Crawley that section 9-505 was enacted in response to Belschner.\u201d Thus, without that legislative enactment, we would be left with only the technical requirements that undergird a compensable hearing loss, but with no pronouncement that occupational deafness is, in fact, a compensable condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Without \u00a7 9-505, the Commission and the courts would also have been less able to assess the scope of compensability as defined by the <em>Crawley </em>Court, which made such losses compensable without regard to a claimant\u2019s inability to work, or lack of a loss in wages. <em>See Crawley, supra, </em>70 Md.App. at 107, 519 A.2d 1348. In essence, \u00a7 9-505 serves as the foundation which permits compensable occupation hearing loss, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that it provides that occupational deafness due to industrial noise in certain frequencies is, in fact, a compensable condition without regard for the disablement threshold applicable to other conditions. Meeting the requirements of \u00a7 9-505 is a necessary, but not sufficient, predicate for establishing what could become a compensable workers\u2019 compensation claim when disablement reaches the levels prescribed in \u00a7 9-650. In sum, \u00a7 9-505 recognizes that occupational deafness is a compensable condition, and that one who suffers occupational deafness is, therefore, entitled to compensation benefits if he or she meets the requirements of the provisions of Part VII of subtitle 6, and particularly, \u00a7 9-650.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Although the courts seek to resolve uncertainty within the Act in favor of the claimant, we do not go so far as to create a process by which an employee may be compensated contrary to the plain meaning of the Act. <em>See Breitenbach, supra, </em>366 Md. at 473, 784 A.2d 569. Further, \u201cthe Act reflects the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment as to the appropriate allocation of resources between employers, employees, and the taxpayers of this State.\u201d <em>Philip Elecs. N. Am., supra, </em>348 Md. at 228, 703 A.2d 150; <em>see also Del Marr v. Montgomery County, </em>169 Md.App. 187, 900 A.2d 243 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The material facts before the circuit court were undisputed, and under those facts the court\u2019s judgment was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-11\">.
