She presents four questions, which we have reordered as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">1. Was the trial court\u2019s decision to disregard aspects of appellee[\u2019]s income for the purposes of calculating child support, including funds distributed to appellee through his corporation, error and an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">2. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in failing to include work-related child care expenses and extraordinary monthly medical expenses when modifying child support in this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Was it [an] abuse of discretion to order child support at an amount insufficient to provide the minor children with the material advantages enjoyed by appellee?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">Did the trial court err in failing to grant appellant\u2019s request for attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">For the following reasons, we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">The parties, who have never been married, have two minor children together \u2014 fifteen year old Noah and twelve year old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Hope. They have engaged in several child support disputes over the years, the last of which resulted in a consent order dated November 14,1995. According to the order, the parties agreed to child support payments by Grow in \u201cthe sum of $925 per month, plus 75% of the cost of the minor children\u2019s day care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On May 7, 2004, Walker moved for a modification of child support, alleging that the children\u2019s expenses had increased, and that Grow\u2019s income had increased. Walker requested that the court \u201crecalculate child support on the basis of an \u2018above Guidelines\u2019 analysis of the joint income of the parties, the minor children\u2019s expenses and other related factors.\u201d Additionally, Walker requested attorney\u2019s fees. The court held a hearing on December 7-8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Grow is the chief operating officer of Aliron International, Inc. (\u201cAliron\u201d), and a shareholder in the company. According to Grow\u2019s 2003 federal income tax return, his adjusted gross income was $272,835. In his financial statement to the court, Grow listed his gross monthly wages at $12,499.06 ($149,988.72 per year). At trial, he was examined and cross-examined extensively on his expenditures, investments, and the perquisites of his employment. Grow testified that he has vacationed abroad in the last five years, pays a housekeeper, has had cosmetic surgery, makes $5,000 monthly payments on \u201ca piece of artwork,\u201d has a gym membership, and drives a Mercedes Benz. He has provided financial assistance to his mother in dealing with her ownership of real property, and was paid a fee for management of his mother\u2019s property. He owns various mutual funds, stocks, and real property in Maryland, Florida, and Costa Rica, including a 30 percent ownership interest in Aliron\u2019s office building. His company provides his health insurance, pays for his cellular phone, and pays his expenses for overseas business trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Gabrielle Kaufman, the accountant for Aliron and Grow, testified that Aliron is a Subchapter S corporation. Grow is the minority shareholder, owning thirty percent, and Cora Alisuag, the president and chief executive officer, is the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ity shareholder, owning the remaining seventy percent. Alisuag has the \u201cultimate authority\u201d as to all business decisions, including \u201ctotal discretion\u201d with regard to distributions. Kaufman described Aliron\u2019s financial structure, and testified to Growls income from the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Walker testified that she is employed as an attorney for the County in the \u201cPro Se Project.\u201d On her financial statement, she listed her gross monthly wages as $4,162. She testified to various expenses associated with her home, and the costs of raising the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The court found Walker\u2019s monthly actual income to be $4,165, and Crow\u2019s to be $12,442, for a combined adjusted actual income of $16,607. That amount exceeds the highest figure in the statutory schedule of basic child support obligations. In such a case, the court has discretion in setting the amount of child support. The court reasoned: \u201cAfter listening to all the testimony and arguments of counsel I view this as, really, a guidelines case.... I think this case, actually, in my view, proves the wisdom of using the guidelines in most circumstances.\u201d Extrapolating from the statutory schedule, the court determined that Grow\u2019s support obligation would be $1,609 per month, and denied Walker\u2019s request for counsel fees. The court issued an order to that effect on December 21, 2004, which was entered on the docket on December 28, 2004. On January 7, 2004, Walker moved to vacate or, alternatively, to alter, amend, or revise the order. On January 25, 2005, she noted this timely appeal. The circuit court denied Walker\u2019s motion on February 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u201cThe parents of a child are his natural guardians and, quite apart from the moral obligations of parenthood, owe the child a legal, statutory obligation of support.\u201d <em>Lacy v. Arvin, </em>140 Md.App. 412, 422, 780 A.2d 1180 (2001). \u201cA parent owes this obligation ... to the child regardless of whether the child was the product of a marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe court may modify a child support award subsequent to the filing of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>motion for modification and upon a showing of a material change of circumstance.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-104(a) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFam.Law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">If the combined adjusted actual income of the parents is $10,000 per month or less, the court must calculate the proper amount of child support using the statutory child support guidelines. Fam. Law \u00a7 12-202; <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>152 Md.App. 609, 614, 833 A.2d 46 (2003). When the combined adjusted actual monthly income is over $10,000, \u201cthe court may use its discretion in setting the amount of child support.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-204(d). <em>See also Johnson, </em>152 Md.App. at 614, 833 A.2d 46. \u201cSeveral factors are relevant in setting child support in an above Guidelines case. They include the parties\u2019 financial circumstances, the \u2018reasonable expenses of the child,\u2019 and the parties\u2019 \u2018station in life, their age and physical condition, and expenses in educating the child[ ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 20, 814 A.2d 65 (quoting <em>Voishan v. Palma, </em>327 Md. 318, 329, 332, 609 A.2d 319 (1992)). \u201cNevertheless, in above Guidelines cases, calling for the exercise of discretion, the rationale of the Guidelines still applies.\u201d <em>Malin v. Mininberg, </em>153 Md.App. 358, 410-11, 837 A.2d 178 (2003) . Here, the court calculated the amount of child support by extending the scheduled support to a combined actual income of $16,607 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201cChild support orders ordinarily are within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Shenk v. Shenk, </em>159 Md.App. 548, 554, 860 A.2d 408 (2004). Likewise, \u201cthe question of whether to modify an award of child support \u2018is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, so long as the discretion was not arbitrarily used or based on incorrect legal principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tucker v. Tucker, </em>156 Md.App. 484, 492, 847 A.2d 486 (2004) (quoting <em>Smith v. Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. 1, 21, 814 A.2d 65 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u201c[W]here the order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and ease law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Child Support </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Enforcement Admin, v. Shehan, </em>148 Md.App. 550, 556, 813 A.2d 334 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\n<em>I. Grow\u2019s Actual Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Walker argues first that the circuit court erred in computing Grow\u2019s actual income by failing to include in the computation \u201cpass-through\u201d corporate income appearing on Grow\u2019s income tax return. She also argues that the court erred in failing to include other income in its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cWhen the chancellor exercises discretion with respect to child support in an above Guidelines case, he or she \u2018must balance the best interests and needs of the child with the parents\u2019 financial ability to meet those needs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 20, 814 A.2d 65 (quoting <em>Unkle v. Unkle, </em>305 Md. 587, 597, 505 A.2d 849 (1986)). \u201c[T]he parties\u2019 financial circumstances\u201d is among the relevant factors the trial court must consider. <em>Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 20, 814 A.2d 65. Indeed, \u201c \u2018the central factual issue is the \u201cactual adjusted income\u201d of each party.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>152 Md.App. at 615, 833 A.2d 46 (quoting <em>Reuter v. Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. 212, 221, 649 A.2d 24 (1994)). Accordingly, even in a case in which the statutory schedule of basic child support obligations does not apply, the trial court must ascertain each parent\u2019s \u201cactual income.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-204(d) (providing for the court\u2019s use of \u201cdiscretion in setting the amount of child support\u201d when the \u201ccombined adjusted actual income exceeds the highest level specified in the schedule\u201d); <em>Johnson, </em>152 Md.App. at 615-22, 833 A.2d 46 (using the statutory definition of \u201cactual income\u201d to determine that a \u201cbonus\u201d received by the obligor should be included in the calculation, which caused the combined income to exceed $10,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u201c \u2018Actual income\u2019 means income from any source.\u201d Fam.

S Corporation Pass-Through Income and Distributions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">According to Grow\u2019s federal income tax return for 2003, his taxable income was $277,175. His 2002 and 2001 returns show taxable incomes of $174,751 and $249,148 respectively. In the financial statement presented to the court, however, Grow indicated that his \u201cgross monthly wages\u201d were $12,360.25, or $148,323 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Gabriele Kaufman, Grow\u2019s and Aliron\u2019s accountant, testified that, because Aliron is a Subchapter S corporation, Grow\u2019s federal income tax returns do not reflect his actual income. Rather, \u201c[the] income of the business is flowed through to the shareholders and reported on the shareholder\u2019s personal tax returns, and the taxes associated with that income [are] paid by the shareholders.\u201d She testified that the income shown on the shareholders\u2019 tax returns \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily at all mean that they receive any of that income.\u201d Kaufman explained that Grow did not \u201ctechnically receive the income that was reported\u201d on his tax returns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">He doesn\u2019t receive that income because first and foremost Mr. Grow is a minority shareholder of Aliron, and he has no, he has no rights to force the corporation to make distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tions. The majority shareholder has full discretion as to when and if distributions will be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">And the second reason, which is another kind of major reason, is that the business needs to retain cash in the company in order for it to fund its ordinary and necessary expenses of the business, its operations, pay its payroll, pay its bills.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Grow entered into evidence a 1040 tax return on which Kaufman had calculated his income without the pass-through income that was retained by Aliron, used to pay the company\u2019s taxes, or distributed for business purposes, in addition to his 2003 schedule K-l, which shows his \u201cShareholder\u2019s Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.\u201d Kaufman testified that, in calculating Crow's income without the corporate pass-through income, she subtracted the amount that appeared on the K-l as \u201cOrdinary income (loss) from trade or business activities\u201d and on line 17 of Crow's 1040, \u201cRental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc.\u201d Kaufman also subtracted the amount that was reported on the K-l as \u201cInvestment income,\u201d \u201cTax-exempt interest income,\u201d \u201cCharitable contributions,\u201d and \u201cSection 179 expense deduction.\u201d She also subtracted the amount listed on the K-l under \u201cProperty distributions (including cash).\u201d According to Kaufman, \u201cmost of [the distributions] relate to quarterly estimated tax payments that have to be made on the profits of this year\u2019s income,\u201d and \u201cit might also be some distributions relating to some business investments that they made for the business.\u201d Kaufman calculated Growls income as $149,359. Asked by counsel whether, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of accuracy,\u201d that figure represents the actual amount of Crow's income, Kaufman responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">At the conclusion of her testimony, the court asked Kaufman to make the calculation on the stand:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">THE COURT: Ordinarily [if] somebody else, whether a private individual or a corporate individual pays your taxes, that\u2019s income to you, isn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>[KAUFMAN]: In a general sense when another party pays for your expenses, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">THE COURT: Well, it could be a gift but I mean in a business situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">[KAUFMAN]: But with an S Corporation, it\u2019s different. THE COURT: Why?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">[KAUFMAN]: Because the whole purpose of being an S Corporation is to avoid double taxation.... And the reason is because S Corporations have special rules with double taxation, and they don\u2019t, it\u2019s a vehicle, it\u2019s an entity choice that allows you not to pay tax twice on the same income. It\u2019s more tax efficient than a regular corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">THE COURT: Could you look at [Grow\u2019s 2003 tax return] please? Looking at that return, which you prepared from information given to you by Mr. Grow, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"Aq36\">[KAUFMAN]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">THE COURT: Tell me, and if you need a calculator, I have one here.... What\u2019s this man\u2019s income for 2003, actual income? What do we look at as his income for 2003 based upon that return? Because at one point as you can see [his] adjusted gross income is 272. And when you came up with his [income] without Aliron it\u2019s 149. And what he told me was it\u2019s 148. So what\u2019s his actual income?</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">THE COURT: [Based on the tax return] he filed with the feds after you prepared it. Just looking at that, what should I regard as this man\u2019s income for 2003?</p>\n<p id=\"Akp\">[KAUFMAN]: It should be, well, I need a calculator.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m pleased to see you need one.</p>\n<p id=\"AjKQ\">[KAUFMAN]: It\u2019s really to be, to be really straight with you, that\u2019s why we use computers. It\u2019s not really possible for me on a calculator to come [to] exactly what his taxable income but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">THE COURT: Well, is it 148 or is [it] 272?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>[KAUFMAN]: If we just go by, I\u2019ll make it easy. We\u2019ll go by adjusted gross income. Let me do it that way. It should come out to about 149,359 that I\u2019ve come up with.</p>\n<p id=\"Akpf\">THE COURT: It should.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">[KAUFMAN]: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">THE COURT: Does it?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">[KAUFMAN]: Yeah. Let me do it again because I messed up on your calculator. I\u2019m a few hundred dollars off but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AalJ\">THE COURT: How much?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">[KAUFMAN]: A few hundred dollars off.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">THE COURT: So it\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">[KAUFMAN]: But that\u2019s because I\u2019m not spending, I feel pressured with the time to not look for what my difference is. Oh, I know, I know what it might be. I see it. It\u2019s going to come out exact. It\u2019s the state refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">THE COURT: So how much is it? What\u2019s your number?</p>\n<p id=\"Aej\">[KAUFMAN]: Okay. Let me just. I just keep adding wrong numbers but it\u2019s, it\u2019s about 150,000,149,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">THE COURT: Now, you\u2019re an accountant\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">[KAUFMAN]: I\u2019m feeling pressure on a calculator here. If you would let me, if you want to wait a few minutes, I\u2019ll do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">THE COURT: I\u2019d like to know since you did the return, I\u2019d like to take that few minutes\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b294-17\">[KAUFMAN]: All right, good.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-18\">THE COURT: \u2014 and have you give me a definitive number and not a range, please.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-19\">[KAUFMAN]: 149,359.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">Asked on cross-examination how she arrived at the figure, Kaufman explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-21\">What I did was I took the adjusted gross income of 272,835 that was on his actual tax return. I subtracted out the 120,896 which was one component of the K-l which was on line 17. I subtracted the interest income related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>business of 1,760. That gave me 150,179. I subtracted out the difference in line 10, which is the state income tax refunds because some of that relates to the business and some of that is his personal tax refund. So I subtracted out that difference of $606. And because his income without Aliron is a little bit, slightly less than $150,000, he gets a small $214 loss from his rental property. So to add that back, that gives me the 149,359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The court ultimately found that Grow\u2019s income was slightly less than the amount testified to by Kaufman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">... I\u2019m looking at [Walker\u2019s] income on a monthly basis of being 4165, and [Grow\u2019s] being 12442[,] which is a little different from what Ms. Kauffman [sic] said. She told me yesterday his income was, for 2003, was 149,359. That\u2019s about 12446 a month. In fact, in his financial statement he says 12499. But after \u2014 not that I don\u2019t believe any other witness, but I, after I sort of pressed her and sort of made her do what I thought an accountant could do, not that she was unwilling, just felt uncomfortable, that the 4165 for the mom, 12442 for him seems accurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">After the court announced its findings, Walker\u2019s counsel argued that the court should have included, among other things, a distribution from Aliron and interest on investments in its calculation of Grow\u2019s actual income. The court responded: \u201cSee, that doesn\u2019t get me anywhere____ That\u2019s business .... I don\u2019t see that as being something I can turn into income.... \u201d The court based its child support award on its determination that Grow\u2019s actual income is $12,442 per month, or $149,304 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>1. The Court\u2019s Reliance on Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">Walker contends that the circuit court erred in accepting the testimony of Kaufman in determining Grow\u2019s income. She argues that Kaufman acknowledged her lack of familiarity with the statutory definition of \u201cactual income,\u201d and that the court relied too heavily on her calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>A court may admit expert testimony, \u201cin the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Md. Rule 5-702. In <em>Gallagher v. Gallagher, </em>118 Md.App. 567, 703 A.2d 850 (1997), a divorce and alimony case, we indicated that admitting the expert testimony of a certified public accountant to assist in determining the husband\u2019s income was appropriate. The expert testified that the husband, who was a professional gambler, received more income than he had reported. Although the husband had failed to preserve the issue for appeal, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMQ\">The numerous, complex, financial transactions in which appellant was involved required that an expert, such as a Certified Public Accountant, be consulted in order to determine the nature and extent of appellant\u2019s income and expenditures. It is clear that [the CPA] testified as to appellant\u2019s income and expenditures and traced certain assets held in various bank accounts. He also took certain statements and income tax records and drew from them conclusions. This is precisely what experts do.... Accordingly, we believe [the CPA] properly testified as an expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 578-79, 703 A.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In this case, the court was presented with a somewhat complex business and personal financial picture. The court found that Kaufman was qualified as a certified public accountant and an expert on tax planning and consulting for closely held corporations. Moreover, although an expert need not testify from personal knowledge, Kaufman did, in fact, prepare the tax returns that were the subject of her testimony. Moreover, Walker did not attempt voir dire prior to Kaufman\u2019s testimony or object to her admission as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Walker cites <em>Ley v. Forman, </em>144 Md.App. 658, 670, 800 A.2d 1 (2002), for this Court\u2019s statement: \u201cThe clear intention of the legislature requires the trial court to consider actual income and expenses based on the evidence. The court must rely on the verifiable incomes of the parties, and failure to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>so results in an inaccurate financial picture.\u201d Kaufman did not testify as to Grow\u2019s \u201cactual income\u201d under Fam. Law \u00a7 12 \u2014 201(b). Indeed, she acknowledged that she was unfamiliar with the statutory definition of \u201cactual income.\u201d Rather, she explained that the income shown on Grow\u2019s tax return is greater than the amount he actually received, and gave her opinion as to what that amount was. In other words, she \u201cassisted] the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Md. Rule 5-702. The court did not err in admitting her as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Even if a witness is qualified as an expert, the fact finder need not accept the expert\u2019s opinion. To the contrary, \u201c \u2018an expert\u2019s opinion is of no greater probative value than the soundness of his [or her] reasons given therefor will warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Surkovich v. Doub, </em>258 Md. 263, 272, 265 A.2d 447 (1970) (quoting <em>Miller v. Abrahams, </em>239 Md. 263, 273, 211 A.2d 309 (1965)). The weight to be given the expert\u2019s testimony is a question for the fact finder. \u201cThe trier of fact may believe or disbelieve, accredit or disregard, any evidence introduced. We may not \u2014 and obviously could not \u2014 decide upon an appeal how much weight must be given, as a minimum to each item of evidence.\u201d <em>Great Coastal Express, Inc. v. Schruefer, </em>34 Md.App. 706, 725, 369 A.2d 118 (1977) (citations omitted). <em>Accord Edsall v. Huffaker, </em>159 Md.App. 337, 342, 859 A.2d 274 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Walker refers to <em>Maranto v. </em>Maranto, 192 Md. 214, 218, 64 A.2d 144 (1949), in which the Court of Appeals said that \u201can expert witness cannot usurp the function of the courts to determine the legal sufficiency of evidence of mental incapacity.\u201d In Maranto, an appeal from a divorce, the husband argued that the wife\u2019s allegations demanded greater corroboration because a psychiatrist had testified that she was \u201ca paranoiac, and it is usual for a paranoiac to exaggerate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 64 A.2d 144. The Court noted that the psychiatrist, after having interviewed the wife, testified to his \u201cgeneral impression,\u201d but could not recount any specific information about her. <em>Id. </em>at 217-18, 64 A.2d 144. Nevertheless, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>testified that she had a propensity to exaggerate and that she had exaggerated on the witness stand. The Court stated that, \u201c[i]f a psychiatrist is to take over the function of courts and juries to pass upon the credibility of witnesses, he must furnish some basis for so doing more substantial than a general impression from forgotten facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 64 A.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Walker also directs us to <em>Montgomery County Dept. of Social Servs. v. Sanders, </em>38 Md.App. 406, 423, 381 A.2d 1154 (1977) (citations omitted), a child custody case in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">Evidence offered by social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists may be necessary in custody cases. The equity court, however, is entitled to weigh that evidence along with contradictory testimony and its own observations. Reliance upon \u201cthe auxiliary services of psychiatrists, psychologists, and trained social workers ... should not be too obsequious or routine or the experts too casual.\u201d Such reliance could lead the courts, in acts of misapplied psychology, to separate unjustly family members.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">\u201cParticularly important is this caution where one or both parties may not have the means to retain their own experts and where publicly compensated experts or experts compensated by only one side have uncurbed leave to express opinions which may be subjective or are not narrowly controlled by the underlying facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in returning the child to his mother\u2019s custody despite the testimony of the Department\u2019s expert that he should remain in foster care because of his age and the amount of time he had been away from his mother. We rejected the Department\u2019s contention that the trial court should have accepted the expert\u2019s opinion and ruled accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">In our view, those cases are not controlling. Kaufman did not opine on the credibility of a witness or the legal significance of the evidence before the court. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>evidence included Grow\u2019s financial statement and his tax returns, it was certainly appropriate for the court to consider Kaufman\u2019s testimony on the issue in verifying Grow\u2019s income. As the trier of fact, the court was free to \u201cbelieve or disbelieve, accredit or disregard\u201d any or all of Kaufman\u2019s testimony, and we will not second-guess the weight it gave her testimony, or any other evidence. <em>Great Coastal Express, </em>34 Md.App. at 725, 369 A.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\n<em>2. Pass-Through Income and Distributions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">According to Walker, \u201cit is obviously unjust to allow a parent to reap the many tax benefits of small business ownership while apparently minimizing his or her personal income and the support obligations that flow from it by leaving income in a privately held business.\u201d Presumably, she is referring to Aliron\u2019s retained earnings, and arguing that some portion of it should have been attributed to Grow as income. More directly, she contends that \u201cAppellee\u2019s most recent tax returns made it clear that he had received a sizeable distribution from his company, that he did so on a regular basis,\u201d and that \u201cthese distributions should properly have been included by the chancellor in calculating Appellee\u2019s income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">A \u201cSubchapter S corporation\u201d or \u201cS corporation\u201d is a company that is able, under federal tax law, to \u201cenjoy the benefits of incorporation but avoid the taxation of both the corporate entity and its shareholders.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. 595, 605, 843 A.2d 50 (2004) (citing 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1361-1379 (2003)). \u201c \u2018[The] corporation and its shareholders [are able] to avoid the double tax normally paid when a corporation distributes its earnings and profits as dividends.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. at 605, 843 A.2d 50 (quoting <em>Byrne v. Comm\u2019r, </em>361 F.2d 939, 942 (7th Cir.1966)). \u201cThus, with few exceptions, the corporation does not pay tax at the corporate level, but its earnings \u2018pass through\u2019 to the shareholders who must report profits or losses on their federal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>state individual income tax returns.\u201d <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>379 Md. at 605, 843 A.2d 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Although the corporation may make actual distributions to its shareholders, the income reported on the shareholders\u2019 tax returns does not necessarily reflect what the individual actually receives. Rather, portions of the income are often retained by the corporation to pay taxes, operating expenses, and employee\u2019s salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u201cActual income,\u201d for the purposes of determining child support, is \u201cincome from any source.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(1). \u201cFor income from self-employment, rent, royalties, proprietorship of a business, or joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation, \u2018actual income\u2019 means gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce income.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(2). \u201c \u2018Ordinary and necessary expenses\u2019 does not include amounts allowable by the Internal Revenue Service for the accelerated component of depreciation expenses or investment tax credits or any other business expenses determined by the court to be inappropriate for determining actual income for purposes of calculating child support.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201 (i). \u201c \u2018Actual income\u2019 includes: (i) salaries; (ii) wages;\u201d and \u201c(v) dividend income.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We have found no Maryland cases, and have been directed to none by counsel, addressing the extent to which pass-through income or distributions from a Subchapter S corporation should be considered the actual income of a parent for child support awards. Several courts in sister states have considered the issue. In interpreting their own child support guidelines, several states have determined that pass-through income should not be included unless the parent is using the corporate form to manipulate his or her income to avoid child support obligations. <em>See, e.g., Tebbe v. Tebbe, </em>815 N.E.2d 180, 184 (Ind.Ct.App.2004) (holding that \u201cundisbursed pass-through income of a minority shareholder in an S-corporation should not be included in child support calculations unless the trial court finds that the corporation is being used to shield in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>come\u201d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>In re Marriage of Brand, 273 </em>Kan. 346, 44 P.3d 321, 327-28 (2002) (holding that the trial court did not err in excluding retained earnings from a parent\u2019s income because the other party had failed to demonstrate that the parent \u201cmanipulated corporate assets, decreased the amount of his salary to increase retained earnings, or acted in any way to shield income\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>It is consistent with somewhat analogous Maryland case law to focus on whether the corporation is being used to shield income. <em>See Quinn v. Quinn, </em>11 Md.App. 638, 648-650, 276 A.2d 425 (1971) (holding that retained earnings by a husband\u2019s corporation were appropriate under the circumstances and should not have been attributed to the husband as income that was available to pay alimony); <em>see also Wallace v. Wallace, </em>46 Md.App. 213, 228, 416 A.2d 1317 (1980) (affirming the trial court\u2019s finding in an alimony case that a business owner\u2019s income was greater than reported, as evidenced by his cash withdrawals from his dental practice).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Courts have held also that distributions that are for the purpose of offsetting an S corporation shareholder\u2019s tax liability should not be considered income to the shareholder because such disbursements do not increase the shareholder\u2019s ability to pay child support. <em>See, e.g. Tebbe, </em>815 N.E.2d at 184 (holding that \u201cpass-through S-corporation income that is merely disbursed to offset pass-through shareholder tax liability, and which does not increase the shareholder\u2019s actual income, should not be included in child support calculations\u201d); <em>Brand, </em>44 P.3d at 328 (holding that the trial court did not err in excluding distributions from parent\u2019s income when \u201cthe amounts distributed ... were for the sole purpose of paying his share of the corporation\u2019s taxes and were not available to pay support\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Therefore, we are persuaded that, in determining a parent\u2019s actual income for child support purposes, a trial court can consider whether subchapter S income shown on a parent\u2019s tax return was actually received by the parent as actual income, or constituted pass-through income not available for child support. Distributions from an S corporation that are used to fund ordinary and necessary business related investments are not required to be included in the computation of the parent\u2019s actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Nevertheless, a court considering such issues must take special care to ensure that the parent is not utilizing the S corporation to manipulate his or her income to avoid child support obligations. An express finding that the parent is not using the corporation to shield income to avoid a child support obligation is appropriate and would certainly aid appellate review in the future. The burden is on the parent seeking to exclude pass-through income from actual income to persuade the court that the pass-through income is not available for child support purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">As to the pass-through income from Aliron that appeared on Grow\u2019s tax return, Kaufman testified that Grow, the minority shareholder, did not actually receive that money because it was retained by the company, or it was distributed to him for purposes of satisfying his personal tax liability on corporate earnings or for business investments, including Aliron\u2019s office building.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In response to appellant\u2019s argument that the distribution from Aliron and the interest on investments should have been included in the calculation of Grow\u2019s actual income, the court said: \u201cSee, that doesn\u2019t get me anywhere---- That\u2019s business.... I don\u2019t see that as being something I can turn into ineome[.]\u201d Obviously, the circuit court considered the pass-through income and distributions to be in the nature of ordinary and necessary business expenses required to produce income, rather than a vehicle to manipulate or shield income to avoid child support obligations. We are not persuaded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>based on the evidence presented, that the court erred or abused its discretion in reaching that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">But, we hasten to add that such a determination would not be necessarily appropriate in all cases involving S corporations. In considering pass-through income, trial courts must ensure that the retained earnings and distributions are truly \u201cordinary and necessary expenses required to produce income\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not income available to the parent. Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(2). Moreover, any amount that is actually received by the shareholder not used for such expenses should be included in the calculation of actual income. The fact that a party is a minority shareholder is certainly a factor to be considered by the court, but minority shareholder status, in and of itself, would not always be the determining factor. The nature of the business, the governing documents, and the business and non-business relationship among the shareholders would also have to be considered in evaluating the issue of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>B. Other Forms of Actual Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMS\">\n<em>1. Dividend Income and Interest Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Walker argues that the circuit court erred in failing to consider Crow\u2019s \u201c \u2018rolled over\u2019 gains on money market funds\u201d as income. At trial, Grow testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">[WALKER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. You didn\u2019t indicate on your income statement any dividends, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">[GROW]: I did not consider dividends as a gross monthly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>[WALKER\u2019S COUNSEL]: All right, I didn\u2019t say it was. I\u2019m saying in other gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">[GROW]: Oh, other gross income?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">[WALKER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">[GROW]: I didn\u2019t consider, well, the dividends I don\u2019t receive. The dividends are just accumulated in a money market fund. So I considered monies I received. I didn\u2019t receive dividends. Dividends are just rolled over in a money market, in a mutual fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">[WALKER\u2019S COUNSEL]: So would it be fair to say that there is income as to investments, as to, we\u2019ll start with investments. There\u2019s income as to investments but since you\u2019re rolling over, you\u2019re not counting it as other gross income, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">[GROW]: If it\u2019s a money market earning, for example, and there is gain that just remains in the mutual fund, and I don\u2019t receive that, I don\u2019t show that on my income statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">[WALKER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Is the mutual fund in your name?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">[GROW]: It\u2019s in my name.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Walker also makes reference to \u201ctaxable interest of $1851, tax-exempt interest of $8429, and dividends of $1707,\u201d which appear on Grow\u2019s 2003 personal income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">\u201c \u2018Actual income\u2019 means income from any source,\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12 \u2014 201(b)(1), including \u201cdividend income\u201d and \u201cinterest income.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(3)(v), (vii). It appears that perhaps all of the dividend income referred to by Walker was included in the circuit court\u2019s income calculation and that some of the tax-exempt interest was considered by the court as pass-through income. Grow acknowledges, however, that $2,165 of tax-exempt interest that should have been included was not. On remand, the court should ensure that all dividend income and interest income required by Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(3)(v) and (vii) is included in the calculation of Grow\u2019s actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\n<em>2. Expense Reimbursements or In-Kind Payments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Walker also argues that \u201c[t]he value of [Grow\u2019s] health insurance and payment of his cell phone bill, both of which are provided by his company,\u201d should have been included in the calculation of Grow\u2019s actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(3)(xvi), actual income includes \u201cexpense reimbursements or in-kind payments received by a parent in the course of employment, self-employment, or operation of a business to the extent the reimbursements or payments reduce the parent\u2019s personal living expenses.\u201d Grow testified at trial that Aliron provides his health insurance and pays for his cellular phone service. He argues that, in regard to the cell phone, \u201cWalker offered no evidence and offered no testimony about an amount\u201d to be added to his actual income and any finding by the circuit court would have been \u201centirely speculative.\u201d Indeed, Walker merely elicited testimony from Grow that Aliron pays for his cell phone service.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Grow, on the other hand, once the existence of the payments came into evidence, presented no argument why these in-kind payments should not be included as part of his actual income. He contends, instead, that the analysis of personal use vis-avis the business use of the provided service would defeat the legislative intent of the guidelines of limiting the role of the trial court in deciding the specific amount of child support to be awarded by limiting the factual findings necessary under pre-guideline cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The amount of actual income that drives the specific amount of the support award under the guidelines is a factual finding that is required in every case. \u201c[E]xpense reimbursements or in-kind payments\u201d received from an employer \u201cthat reduce the parent\u2019s personal living expenses\u201d are required by statute to be included in the actual income calculation. Fam. Law 12-201(b)(3)(xvi). Sometimes that determination is an easy one, but not always. In either situation, it would seem that the analysis involving a cell phone would begin with the cost of the service. If a party contends that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>or some of that amount is to be excluded from his or her actual income, that party has the burden of persuasion in excluding it. Factors to be considered include the cost and scope of the service, the employer\u2019s policies regarding personal use, and whether the service substitutes for a personal cell phone or even replaces land line service.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Grow argues that the cost of quantifying the amount that in-kind cell phone payments would reduce his personal living expenses would not be justified based on the marginal impact on the child support award. He suggests that, if the guidelines were extrapolated in this case, the amount of additional child support would be $2.00 per month. Assuming that is, in fact, the case, we might not remand if that was the only issue to be considered on remand. At the same time, a similar argument might be made in regard to other expense reimbursements and in-kind payments, but, such payments, when they reduce personal living expenses, are statutorily required to be considered as actual income. Moreover, the parties themselves can always consider the cost-benefit ratio in their efforts to include or exclude an item in the actual income calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As to the health insurance payments, Grow concedes that the circuit court did not include the health insurance payments made by Aliron in its actual income calculation, but contends any error was harmless. It was harmless, he contends, because the children are covered on the policy, so it would ultimately be subtracted from his actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In calculating a party\u2019s actual income, health insurance payments made by an employer are to be included \u201cto the extent [the payments] reduce the parent\u2019s personal living expenses.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12 \u2014 201 (b)(b)(3)(xvi). The court then determines \u201cadjusted actual income\u201d by subtracting \u201cthe actual cost of providing health insurance coverage for a child for whom the parents are jointly and severally responsible.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(c)(3). On remand, the court should consider the health insurance provided to Grow by Aliron in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>calculation of his actual income, but subtract \u201cthe actual cost of providing health insurance coverage\u201d for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>3. Commissions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Next, Walker contends that a one-time \u201creal estate management fee\u201d in the amount of $9,000, which Grow received in 2004, should have been included in the calculation of his income.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Family Law \u00a7 12 \u2014 201(b)(3)(iii) states that actual income includes \u201ccommissions.\u201d It is immaterial whether this was a one-time fee, or represents a likely source of future income. In <em>Johnson, </em>we held that a father\u2019s $41,400 bonus must be included in the calculation of actual income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Because it is nearly always impossible to predict the amount of future bonuses, if we were to adopt appellant\u2019s position and hold that bonuses (already paid) should be disregarded when calculating child support when the amount of bonuses in future years cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, we would not be giving effect to the language of FL \u00a7 12 \u2014 201 (c)(3)(iv) [which states that actual income includes \u201cbonuses.\u201d] ... Appellant stresses the fact that he might not receive any bonus in 2003. This is, of course, possible---- If his bonus is significantly less than $41,400 for 2003, he can petition the court for a child support modification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>152 Md.App. at 619-20, 833 A.2d 46. Thus, the amount of the fee Grow received for property management should have been included in the computation of his actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">A <em>Capital Gains</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">Next, Walker points to \u201cnumerous instances of sales of securities, from which [Grow] presumably realized capital gains.\u201d Family Law \u00a7 12-201(b)(4)(ii) states: \u201cBased on the circumstances of the case, the court <em>may </em>consider the following items as actual income: ... capital gains.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, there was not sufficient evidence introduced at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the trial whereby the court could have determined whether Grow received capital gains to be considered income, in the court\u2019s discretion, or the amount of any such gains. Under the circumstances, we cannot say that the court erred or abused its discretion in not considering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>5. Unrealized Gains</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Walker argues that the court should have also considered Grow\u2019s \u201cgrowing list of appreciating assets ... and two instances where he refinanced real property or took proceeds from Appellant\u2019s mortgage.\u201d In <em>Barton v. Hirshberg, </em>137 Md.App. 1, 20, 767 A.2d 874 (2001), we determined that \u201c[t]he definition of actual income in Family Law section 12-201 (c) contains numerous enumerated factors that constitute income, none of which includes unrealized gains or appreciation in asset value.\u201d The circuit court did not err or abuse its discretion in refusing to include appreciation in asset value in its computation of Grow\u2019s actual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>II. Additional Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Walker argues that the costs of child care during the summer months and family therapy should have been included in the calculation of Grow\u2019s child support obligation. Grow responds that the only summer child care that is relevant is the children\u2019s visits to summer camps. With respect to the family therapy, he contends that it is not medically necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Walker testified that the children have attended various summer camps in years past. In the summer of 2004, Noah attended basketball camp for one week and worked at the Montgomery County Department of Recreation for three weeks. The remainder of his summer was \u201cunstructured time.\u201d She expressed a desire to send him to the \u201cCal Ripk[e]n Baseball Camp\u201d the next summer. In the summer of 2004, Hope attended a horseback riding camp for less than a week. For the remainder of her summer she attended a day care center. Walker said she would like Hope to attend the camp again the next summer, but for a longer period of time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>She also stated that Hope would need to attend daycare again the next summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Grow points out that Walker testified that, beginning in the 2004-2005 school year, the children no longer required after school daycare. She also listed no daycare expenses on her financial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We have held that, in actual guidelines cases, \u201cdiscretionary activities such as camp, music lessons, tutoring, and gifted and talented programs\u201d are not added to the child support obligation. <em>Horsley v. Radisi, </em>132 Md.App. 1, 26, 750 A.2d 692 (2000). In an above guidelines case, however, the court may consider such activities in determining the proper amount of child support. Fam. Law \u00a7 12-204(d). See, <em>e.g., Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 21-37, 814 A.2d 65 (holding that, in an above guidelines case, the child support obligation may be increased to ensure that the child enjoys a lifestyle commensurate with the parent\u2019s economic position).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">With respect to child care expenses, such as day care, the court is required to add the cost of such expenses to the child support obligation if the expenses are \u201cincurred on behalf of a child due to employment or job search of either parent.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-204(g)(l). In determining whether child care expenses must be included, the court considers \u201cactual family experience, unless the court determines that the actual family experience is not in the best interest of the child.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12-204(g)(2)6).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">It is unclear from the record whether the court gave proper consideration to discretionary activities by the children or child care expenses, and the relationship, if any, between the two. These issues should be revisited upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Walker also testified at trial that the parties had attended \u201cfamily therapy,\u201d paid for by her, and that she intends to have the family in slightly more expensive therapy in the future. On her financial statement, she listed $141 per month as the cost for \u201cTherapist/Counselor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The guidelines do not expressly require a court to include the cost of family therapy in the child support obligation. The court is required to include \u201c[a]ny extraordinary medical expenses incurred on behalf of a child.\u201d Fam. Law \u00a7 12 \u2014 204(h). In an above guidelines case, it is within the court\u2019s discretion to include the cost of family therapy. Fam. Law \u00a7 12 \u2014 204(d). From our review of the record, it appears that the court did not specifically consider the cost of family therapy. On remand, the court should determine whether the therapy qualifies as an extraordinary medical expense, or whether the cost of therapy should otherwise be included in the child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>III. Child Support in Relation to Father\u2019s Income</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Walker argues that the circuit court erred in failing \u201cto relate the [child support] figure at which it arrived to the needs of the children,\u201d and failing to ensure that the children enjoy a lifestyle commensurate with that of their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u201cWhen the chancellor exercises discretion with respect to child support in an above Guidelines case, he or she \u2018must balance the interests and needs of the child with the parents\u2019 financial ability to meet those needs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 20, 814 A.2d 65 (quoting <em>Unkle, </em>305 Md. at 597, 505 A.2d 849). We are mindful of \u201cthe foundational concept that child support should be in an amount consistent with the parents\u2019 standard of living,\u201d and that this concept \u201ccuts across all economic lines, whether the parents are poor or wealthy.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 20, 814 A.2d 65. \u201c[T]he trial judge should examine the needs of the child in light of the parents\u2019 resources and determine the amount of support necessary to ensure that the child\u2019s standard of living does not suffer because of the parents\u2019 separation.\u201d <em>Voishan, </em>327 Md. at 332, 609 A.2d 319. Indeed, \u201c[a] child is entitled to a standard of living that corresponds to the economic position of the parents.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>149 Md.App. at 23, 814 A.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Walker directs our attention to Grow\u2019s various expenditures, including \u201cfine art,\u201d \u201cinternational vacations,\u201d \u201cmaid service,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u201ca Mercedes automobile,\u201d and \u201ccosmetic surgery.\u201d The trial court recognized her position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">I understand how Ms. Walker has viewed what Mr. Grow has[,] and the fact that he has some money. He has money to buy things---- [B]ut I think that the evidence doesn\u2019t break through to tell me that he has so much more that we should start looking at this other than [as] a guidelines case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">We cannot know what the children\u2019s lifestyle would be if Walker and Grow lived together. Still, the children\u2019s lifestyle should not suffer simply because they live separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We have said that \u201cthe trial court need not use a strict extrapolation method to determine support in an above Guidelines case. Rather, the court may employ any \u2018rational method that promotes the general objectives of the child support Guidelines and considers the particular facts of the case before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Malin, </em>153 Md.App. at 410, 837 A.2d 178 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Anderson, </em>117 Md.App. 474, 478 n. 1, 700 A.2d 844 (1997), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>349 Md. 294, 708 A.2d 296 (1998)). \u201c[I]n above Guidelines cases, calling for the exercise of discretion, the rationale of the Guidelines still applies.\u201d <em>Malin, </em>153 Md.App. at 410-11, 837 A.2d 178. We are not persuaded that a guidelines extrapolation as used by the court to determine child support in this case was necessarily an abuse of discretion. On the other hand, a proper consideration on remand of the aspects of child support discussed above may persuade the court that a simple guidelines extrapolation would not necessarily afford the children the standard of living to which they are entitled, based on the economic position of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\n<em>IV. Counsel Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">Finally, Walker contends that the circuit court erred in failing to consider all of the statutory factors in deciding not to award counsel fees. Grow responds that, although the court did not specifically refer to the statutory factors, it made the necessary considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Pursuant to Fam. Law \u00a7 12-103(a), the trial court \u201cmay award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cthe trial court \u2018is vested with wide discretion\u2019 in deciding whether to award counsel fees and, if so, in what amount.\u201d <em>Malin, </em>153 Md.App. at 435-36, 837 A.2d 178 (quoting <em>Dunlap v. Fiorenza, </em>128 Md.App. 357, 374, 738 A.2d 312 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Section 12-103(b) of Fam. Law provides: \u201cBefore a court may award costs and counsel fees under this section, the court shall consider: (1) the financial status of each party; (2) the needs of each party; and (3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.\u201d Notwithstanding the language of Fam. Law \u00a7 12-103(b) requiring the court to consider the factors \u201c[b]efore\u201d it \u201cmay award costs and counsel fees,\u201d we have determined that the court must also consider the factors before it may <em>deny </em>counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In <em>Kierein v. Kierein, </em>115 Md.App. 448, 693 A.2d 1157 (1997), the wife argued that the trial court had erred in denying her request for counsel fees where the husband\u2019s income was nearly five times that of hers. We stated that \u201cwe recognize the discretion afforded trial courts in awarding counsel fees; we wish, however, to make it clear that \u2018[i]n exercising his or her discretion, the trial judge must consider and balance the required considerations as articulated by the Legislature in \u00a7 12-103.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 693 A.2d 1157 (quoting <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 601, 568 A.2d 1157 (1990)). <em>See also Barton v. Hirshberg, </em>137 Md.App. 1, 33, 767 A.2d 874 (2001). We concluded: \u201cConsidering their disparate incomes, we shall remand the case for the trial court to consider the factors in FL \u00a7 12-103 and articulate its basis for denying counsel fees.\u201d <em>Kierein, </em>115 Md.App. at 459, 693 A.2d 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Even though \u201c \u2018the trial court does not have to recite any \u201cmagical\u201d words,\u2019 \u201d <em>Horsley, </em>132 Md.App. at 31, 750 A.2d 692 (quoting <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>112 Md.App. 197, 212, 684 A.2d 878 (1996)), it must be clear on appeal that the court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the statutory factors. <em>See Harbom v. Harbom, </em>134 Md.App. 430, 464, 760 A.2d 272 (2000). The only way we can determine whether the court considered the statutorily mandated factors is by reviewing the court\u2019s statements on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Although not specifically related to counsel fees, the court made several statements that might be interpreted as considerations of the applicable factors to be considered in awarding counsel fees under Fam. Law. \u00a7 12-103. As to the justification of the proceeding, the court said that it did not \u201cfault\u201d Grow for defending against Walker\u2019s claims, and that it did not \u201cfault\u201d Walker for bringing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Nevertheless, it is not clear that the court properly considered Walker\u2019s claim for counsel fees. Specifically, the record does not indicate that the court gave consideration to the financial disparity between the parties and their respective incomes and needs. On remand the court should consider Walker\u2019s request for counsel fees, giving full and proper consideration to all of the factors mandated by Fam. Law \u00a7 12-103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We shall vacate the court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to the circuit court for a determination of Crow\u2019s support obligation based on \u201cactual income\u201d pursuant to Fam. Law \u00a7 12-201(b), and whether attorney\u2019s fees are warranted based on the factors set forth in Fam.
