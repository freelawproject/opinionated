Vol.), \u00a7 8-909 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d). The Circuit Court for Baltimore County consolidated appellants\u2019 petitions for judicial review, and affirmed the denial of benefits. Appellants present two questions for our review, which we have slightly reworded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">I. Are school bus drivers employed by a county board of education, who have worked for the first of two consecutive academic years or terms and who have a reasonable assurance of performing such work in the forthcoming academic year or term, employed by an \u201ceducational institution,\u201d thereby rendering them ineligible for benefits for unemployment occurring between the successive academic years or terms under L.E. \u00a7 8-909?</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">II. Does L.E. \u00a7 8-909 violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by unlawfully discriminating between those school bus drivers employed by the Maryland public school system and those drivers servicing public schools but employed by private contractors?</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">For the following reasons, we answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question and \u201cno\u201d to the second. Therefore, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Labor and Employment \u00a7 8-909 governs unemployment benefits payable to employees of governmental, charitable, educational, and religious organizations and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\"><em>(a) In general. </em>\u2014 Subject to the provisions of this section, benefits based on service in covered employment under \u00a7\u00a7 8-208(a) and 8 \u2014 212(c) of this title shall be payable in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of other service in covered employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\"><em>(c) Same </em>\u2014 Services <em>performed in other capacities. </em>\u2014 (1) With respect to services performed for an educational institution in any capacity other than instructional, research, or principal administrative, benefits may not be paid on the basis of the services for any week of unemployment that begins during a period between 2 successive academic years or terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\n<em>(2) This subsection applies to any individual who: (i) performs the services described in this subsection in the first of 2 academic years or terms;

At the end of the academic year, Thomas and Sudbrook were each mailed a letter regarding their continued employment with the Board and requesting their route preferences for the next academic term. Appellants both responded to that letter, indicating their desire to return to work the following term and to retain their same respective routes as the prior academic year.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\n<em>A. Jeanine Thomas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Thomas\u2019s last day of work was June 17, 2004, the last day of the regular academic term. On July 25, 2004, she filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits with the Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation (\u201cthe Department\u201d), claiming that she was temporarily laid-off from work for ten weeks or less. Her claim was denied by a Claims Specialist from the Department on August 16, 2004, because, as an employee of an educational institution under L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) and having obtained a reasonable assurance of performing covered employment in the next academic term, she was ineligible for benefits. Thomas appealed to a Hearing Examiner, and a hearing on her claim was held on September 15, 2004. The Hearing Examiner denied Thomas\u2019s claim, finding her ineligible under L.E. \u00a7 8-909(e). When Thomas appealed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision to the Board of Appeals of the Department, the Board of Appeals adopted the Hearing Examiner\u2019s findings and recommendations. Afterwards, Thomas petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\n<em>B. Luann Sudbrook.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Following the conclusion of the 2003-2004 regular academic year, the Board afforded Sudbrook work as a private contractor during the summer of 2004. Her final day of employment was July 30, 2004, and, on August 11, 2004, she filed a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>for unemployment benefits. A Department Claims specialist determined that L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) applied to Sudbrook\u2019s claim and denied her benefits. In a hearing before the Hearing Examiner, Sudbrook argued that L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) unfairly discriminated against her because school bus drivers employed by private contractors were eligible for benefits during the break between academic terms, while those drivers employed by the Board were not. Unpersuaded, the Hearing Examiner denied Sudbrook\u2019s claim on September 19, 2004. When the Board of Appeals adopted the findings and conclusions of the Hearing Examiner, Sudbrook petitioned the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for judicial review. Her case was consolidated with Thomas\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\n<em>C. Proceedings in the Circuit Court.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Following a hearing, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the Board of Appeals. It found that both Thomas and Sudbrook were ineligible for benefits under L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The standard of judicial review of a decision of the Board of Appeals is governed by L.E. \u00a7 8-512(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">(d) <em>Scope of Review. </em>\u2014 In a judicial proceeding under this section, findings of fact of the Board of Appeals are conclusive and the jurisdiction of the court is confined to questions of law if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">(1) the findings of fact are supported by evidence that is competent, material, and substantial in view of the entire record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-11\">(2) there is no fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">\u201cUnder this statute, the reviewing court shall determine only: \u2018(1) the legality of the decision and (2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation v. Hider, </em>349 Md. 71, 77-78, 706 A.2d 1073 (1998) (quoting <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Employment </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701 (1985)). We \u201c \u2018may not reject a decision of the Board supported by substantial evidence unless that decision is wrong as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, </em>122 Md.App. 19, 23, 711 A.2d 243 (1998) (quoting <em>Hider, </em>349 Md. at 78, 706 A.2d 1073). \u201cThe test for determining whether the Board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence is whether reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion from the facts relied upon by the Board.\u201d <em>Hider, </em>349 Md. at 78, 706 A.2d 1073 (citing <em>Baltimore Lutheran, </em>302 Md. at 661-662, 490 A.2d 701).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Appellants concede that they performed services for the Board for at least one academic term immediately prior to the period for which they seek unemployment benefits and that they had obtained a reasonable assurance of performing such services in the second of the two successive academic terms. But, according to appellants, L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) does not render them ineligible for unemployment benefits because they are not employed by an \u201ceducational institution\u201d as defined by L.E. \u00a7 8-101(n). Appellants, who are employed by the Board, argue that \u201ca school board, as opposed to an individual school, is not itself an educational institution. Rather it is an organization through which educational institutions, <em>i.e., </em>individual schools, are regulated.\u201d Therefore, appellants \u201cdid not \u2018render services for an educational institution\u2019 and are not barred from receiving benefits under the plain meaning of [L.E.] \u00a7 8-909(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The Department and the Board argue that the plain language of the statute and the purported purpose of the disqualification provisions clearly indicate that the Board is an \u201ceducational institution.\u201d And, because appellants had a reasonable assurance of continued employment, L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) rendered them ineligible for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The Court of Appeals \u201chas stated many times \u2018that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 81, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001) (quoting <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987 (2000)). When we interpret a statute, our starting point is always the text of the statute. Adamson <em>v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501 (2000). \u201c[I]f the plain meaning of the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, our inquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Breitenbach v. N.B. Handy Co., </em>366 Md. 467, 473, 784 A.2d 569 (2001). The plain meaning rule is \u201celastic, rather than cast in stone[,]\u201d and if \u201cpersuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute, we do not turn a blind eye to it.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251, 753 A.2d 501 (citing <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-14, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\u201c[I]n determining a statute\u2019s meaning, courts may consider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes and legislative history.\u201d <em>Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing v. Brennen, </em>366 Md. 336, 350-51, 783 A.2d 691 (2001). We often look to the legislative history, an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute, and other sources for a more complete understanding of what the General Assembly intended when it enacted particular legislation. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993). \u201cWe may also consider the particular problem or problems the legislature was addressing, and the objective it sought to attain.\u201d <em>Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Employment and Training, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382 (1987). \u201cThis enables us to put the statute in controversy in its proper context and thereby avoid unreasonable or illogical results that defy common sense.\u201d <em>Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 252, 753 A.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">\u201cIn the context of unemployment insurance law, because of its remedial nature, its provisions are liberally construed in favor of eligibility for benefits.\u201d <em>Department of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>Econ. &amp; Employment Dev. v. Taylor, </em>108 Md.App. 250, 268, 671 A.2d 523 (1996) (citing <em>Sinai Hosp., </em>309 Md. at 40, 522 A.2d 382). Accordingly, \u201cprovisions that disqualify claimants from receiving benefits are construed narrowly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Initially, we recognize that, in order to qualify for federal funding for this State\u2019s unemployment insurance program and for private employer\u2019s in Maryland to be eligible for federal tax credits for unemployment contributions, Maryland\u2019s unemployment compensation laws must comply with the standards set forth in the Federal Unemployment Tax Act of 1954 (\u201cFUTA\u201d), <em>codified at </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3311 (1997). Through the 1970 amendments to FUTA, for the first time states were required to pay unemployment compensation to otherwise eligible employees of institutions of higher learning. <em>See generally </em>S.Rep. No. 91-752 (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>91st Cong., 2nd Sess., 1970 U.S.Code.Cong. &amp; Admin.News. 3606. Under the 1970 amendments, however, \u201cfaculty, research, and administrative employees of institutions of higher education were not considered unemployed during the summer vacation if they had a contract to resume work after the summer vacation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3609, 3617-18. The ineligibility provision sought to exclude those employees \u201cwho can plan for temporary unemployment and thus do not truly suffer from economic insecurity.\u201d Maribeth Wilt-Seibert, <em>Unemployment Compensation for Employees of Educational Institutions: How State Courts Have Created Variations on Federally Mandated Statutory Language, </em>29 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 585, 588 (1996) (citing <em>Haynes v. Pennsylvania, </em>65 Pa.Cmwlth. 541, 442 A.2d 1232, 1233 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In 1976, FUTA was again amended to render professional employees of elementary and secondary educational institutions ineligible for unemployment benefits for unemployment occurring between academic terms, where such employees had a reasonable assurance of returning to work in the successive academic term. Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-556 \u00a7 115, 90 Stat. 2667 (1976). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>plained in <em>Chicago Teachers Union v. Johnson, </em>639 F.2d 353 (7th Cir.1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">The period excluded under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304, Part A, s 203(b) was intended to be that period characteristic to the educational profession and within the expectation of the teachers. The legislative history surrounding this section shows that it intended for all professional educational workers to be treated the same during the summer break:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB6\">\u201cIn the absence of this prohibition, a number of states have indicated that they find no provision in their laws by which they can deny emergency assistance to professional educational workers who are only temporarily unemployed during this period. Payment of such emergency assistance to workers who have contracts for the succeeding school term would be contrary to the treatment of their counterparts in institutions of higher education, who are covered under regular unemployment insurance. In Public Law 91-373, Congress mandated that college and university teachers, researchers, and administrators with contracts for both terms be denied benefits with respect to the periods between terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 357 (quoting S.Rep. No. 94-208, 94th Cong. 1st Sess. 5-6, <em>reprinted in </em>(1975) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 377, 382).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In addition, states were <em>permitted </em>to deny \u201cbenefits based on services performed for educational institutions to nonprofessional school employees during periods between academic years or terms if there [wa]s a reasonable assurance that the individual w[ould] be employed by the educational institution in the forthcoming academic year.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. 94-1745 <em>(reprinted in </em>94th Cong., 2nd Sess., 1976 U.S.Code.Cong. &amp; Admin.News 6032, 6035-36). <em>See also </em>Patricia C. Kussmann, <em>Right to Unemployment Compensation or Social Security Benefits of Teacher or Other School Employee, </em>33 A.L.R. 5th 643 \u00a7 2(a) (1995). FUTA was amended in 1977 to permit states to extend the ineligibility provisions applicable to nonprofessional school employees to vacation periods.

No. 95-19, \u00a7 302, 91 Stat. 39, 44 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The ineligibility provision applicable to professional and nonprofessional school employees was also extended to apply to employees of \u201ceducational service agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Senate Report concerning the 1977 amendments stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">Public Law 94-566 required States to cover virtually all State and local government employees under their unemployment compensation programs. Because of the special work patterns of school employees, this legislation required that benefits not be paid during regular vacation periods to teachers who have a reasonable expectation of reemployment at the end of the vacation. Nonprofessional school employees could, at State option, be excluded from benefits during vacation periods on the same basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">As the statute was drawn, however, these exclusions apply only to individuals who are actually employed by educational institutions. In a number of States there are separate State agencies set up to provide specialized services to many schools. For example, such agencies may provide driver education and audiovisual services to all schools in the State and employees of these agencies may travel from school to school providing these services. Since such employees are in every respect the equivalent of school personnel and follow the same work and vacation patterns, it seems appropriate to apply the same benefit exclusions during vacation periods to these employees as are applied to persons who are directly employed by schools.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">The committee bill would extend to such individuals the provisions under which professional employees must be denied benefits during vacation periods (and nonprofessional employees may be denied such benefits) where there is reasonable expectation of reemployment at the end of the vacation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">S. Rep. 95-456, at 6 (1977) <em>(reprinted in </em>95th Cong., 1st Sess., 1977 U.S.Code.Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 3579, 3583-84).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Finally, in 1983, Congress required that states deny benefits to <em>all employees </em>of educational institutions and educational service agencies, including nonprofessional employees and those serving in capacities other than instructional, research, or principally administrative for periods between academic terms or years, or during customary vacation periods, where such employees had a reasonable expectation of continued employment. Social Security Amendments of 1983, Pub.L. No. 98-21, \u00a7 521, 97 Stat. 65, 147-48 (1983).

the General Assembly sought to deny unemployment benefits to school employees during scheduled and anticipated holidays, vacations, and breaks between academic terms when the employee has a reasonable assurance of continued employment. The unemployment insurance law was created to \u201cprevent the spread of involuntary unemployment and to lighten its burden, which often falls with crushing force on the unemployed worker and the family of the unemployed worker.\u201d L.E. \u00a7 8-102(b)(2). In the case of employees such as appellants, who are essentially employed on a ten-month basis, the period of unemployment between academic terms is expected and permits the employee to plan for periods in which he or she will not receive a paycheck. As one court has explained, \u201c[tjhe rationale for this limitation is that school employees can plan for those periods of unemployment and thus are not experiencing the suffering from unanticipated layoffs that the employment-security law was intended to alleviate.\u201d <em>Baker v. Dep\u2019t of Employment and Training Bd. of Review, 637 </em>A.2d 360, 363 (R.I.1994). <em>See also University of Toledo v. Heiny, </em>30 Ohio St.3d 143, 507 N.E.2d 1130, 1133 (1987) (stating that the provisions of that state\u2019s unemployment compensation legislation, which allowed benefits to unemployed nonprofessional employees of educational institutions \u201cwhose employment prospects for the ensuing academic year are doubtful,\u201d \u201cwas not enacted to \u2018subsidize the vacation periods of those who know well in advance that they may be laid off for certain specified periods\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Davis v. Pennsylvania, Unem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>ployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>39 Pa.Cmwlth. 146, 394 A.2d 1320, 1321 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The disqualification provisions of L.E. \u00a7 8-909 relating to employees of \u201ceducational institutions\u201d and \u201ceducational service agencies\u201d are in conformity with FUTA, and presumably were adopted by the General Assembly in order to become eligible for federal funding and tax benefits. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 8-103(a) (\u201cTo the extent necessary to ensure that the United States Secretary of Labor certifies this title under \u00a7 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code and unless this title clearly indicates an intent to the contrary, this title shall be construed in a manner consistent with the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Federal Security Act, the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, and the Federal Trade Act of 1974.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Labor and Employment \u00a7 8-101(n) defines \u201ceducational institution\u201d as \u201can institution that offers participants, students, or trainees an organized course of study or training that is academic, technical, trade-oriented, or preparatory for gainful employment in a recognized occupation,\u201d and includes \u201can institution of higher education.\u201d In contrast, L.E. \u00a7 8-909(e) defines \u201ceducational service agency\u201d as \u201ca governmental entity that is established and operated exclusively to provide educational services to one or more educational institutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Maryland Code (2003), \u00a7 3-103 of the Education Article (\u201cEduc\u201d) establishes a county board of education for each county of this State and for Baltimore City. Under Educ. \u00a7\u00a7 4-101-111, each board of education is responsible for controlling \u201ceducational matters that affect that count[y],\u201d establishing public schools, hiring school personnel, including principals and teachers, setting employees\u2019 salaries, and creating curriculum guides and courses of study. County boards are also responsible for arranging for transportation of students to and from consolidated schools. Educ. \u00a7 4-120. In other words, individual public schools are an extension of the respective board, not separate educational institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Courts in other jurisdictions have similarly concluded that bus drivers employed by local school districts were employed by \u201ceducational institutions,\u201d within the definition of that jurisdiction\u2019s unemployment compensation law, such that they were ineligible for benefits between academic terms when they had a reasonable assurance of continued employment for the next academic year or term. <em>See, e.g., Becotte v. Gwinn Schools, </em>192 Mich.App. 682, 481 N.W.2d 728 (1991); <em>La Mountain v. Westport Central School District, </em>51 N.Y.2d 318, 434 N.Y.S.2d 171, 414 N.E.2d 672 (1980); <em>North Penn School District v. Unemployment Compensation Bd., </em>662 A.2d 1161 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1995). <em>See also Valot v. Southeast Local School District Bd. of Educ., </em>107 F.3d 1220, 1224 (6th Cir.1997) (recognizing that a change in school district procedure, whereby all substitute employees of the school district, including substitute bus drivers, were given a reasonable assurance of continued employment for the following school year rendered \u201cthose employees ineligible for unemployment compensation under [an] Ohio law,\u201d which is in substantial conformity with L.E. \u00a7 8-909).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Clearly, L.E. \u00a7 8-909 was intended by the General Assembly to institute the requirements of FUTA and deny eligibility to all those educational workers employed by educational institutions, including public school boards, who have been employed for at least one year and who had a reasonable assurance of continued employment for the next successive academic term. Therefore, the Board of Appeals did not err in concluding that appellants were ineligible for benefits under l.e. \u00a7 s-gc^c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Appellants next contend that L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Maryland Declaration of Rights because it discriminates between those school bus drivers employed by county boards of education and those employed by private contractors. According to appellants, under <em>Attorney General of Maryland v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 426 A.2d 929 (1981), and the cases cited therein, our analysis of their equal protection claims involves an intermediate scrutiny or \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d review, and that no explanation has been offered by the Board to justify the disparate treatment of privately and publicly employed school bus drivers. Appellants also argue that L.E. \u00a7 8-909(c) is not rationally related to any legitimate government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Initially, we must consider the standard of review applicable to appellants\u2019 equal protection claims. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Waldron, </em>absent a statute that impinges upon a fundamental right or provides for disparate treatment based upon a suspect classification, where strict scrutiny applies, courts generally employ rational basis review. 289 Md. at 706, 426 A.2d 929. A suspect classification includes classifications based on race, ancestry, and national origin. <em>Id. </em>Fundamental rights are those rights or interests secured \u201cexplicitly or implicitly\u201d by the federal constitution, and include the right to vote, the right to interstate travel, the right of equal access to a criminal appeal, and the right to procreate. The receipt of unemployment benefits is not a fundamental right secured by the federal constitution and bus drivers employed by educational institutions are not a suspect classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Appellants also correctly note that courts employ \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d to analyze equal protection where the statute involves \u201csensitive classifications,\u201d such as classifications based on gender and, probably, legitimacy, or where the statute implicates \u201c \u2018important\u2019 personal interests or work[s] a \u2018significant interference with liberty or a denial of a benefit vital to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 711, 426 A.2d 929 (quoting Lawrence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 16-3, 996 (1978)). Under intermediate scrutiny or heightened review, \u201cto be sustained the classification \u2018must serve important government objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 358, 601 A.2d 102 (1992) (quoting <em>Craig v. Boren, </em>429 U.S. 190, 197, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In this case, there is no \u201csensitive classification,\u201d and we are not persuaded that appellants\u2019 claims to unemployment benefits necessitate an invocation of heightened scrutiny. Accordingly, we apply the rational basis standard, under which \u201ca statutory classification is struck down, in the oft-expressed words of the Supreme Court, only if the means chosen by the legislative body are \u2018wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State\u2019s objective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waldron, </em>289 Md. at 707, 426 A.2d 929 (quoting <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961)). <em>See Watkins v. Cantrell, </em>736 F.2d 933, 945 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cWhere a state\u2019s unemployment insurance compensation statute neither involves a discernable fundamental interest nor affects any protected class with particularity, the relatively relaxed \u2018rational basis\u2019 standard should be applied in determining whether the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d) (citing <em>Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. v. Hodory, </em>431 U.S. 471, 97 S.Ct. 1898, 52 L.Ed.2d 513 (1977)). <em>See also, Zambrano v. Reinert, </em>291 F.3d 964 (7th Cir.2002)(applying rational basis review in considering a petitioner\u2019s claim that a Wisconsin statute, which disqualified certain seasonal workers employed in processing fruits and vegetables from unemployment benefits, was violative of the Equal Protection clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As noted above, L.E. \u00a7 8-909 was enacted to exclude those individuals employed by educational institutions and with a reasonable assurance of continued employment from eligibility for unemployment benefits during regularly scheduled periods of unemployment. Congress had concluded that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>those employed by educational institutions know of scheduled breaks in employment they should be prepared for the breaks that regularly occur in their chosen employment and should prepare for them. The statute is rationally related to achieving its objective. The General Assembly presumably enacted L.E. \u00a7 8-909 to comply with the federal mandate, designed to prevent the subsidization of vacation periods for school employees. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 8-130(a) (\u201cTo the extent necessary to ensure that the United States Secretary of Labor certifies this title under \u00a7 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code and unless this title clearly indicates an intent to the contrary, this title shall be construed in a manner consistent with the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the Federal Social Security Act, the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, and the Federal Trade Act of 1974.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have also concluded that state unemployment compensation laws do not violate equal protection because they render nonprofessional employees of educational institutions ineligible for benefits between academic terms where the employee has a reasonable assurance of employment for the next academic term, while granting benefits to employees engaged in the same vocation, but not employed by, or rendering services exclusively for, educational institutions. <em>Herrera v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>197 Colo. 23, 593 P.2d 329 (1979) (applying rational basis to a Denver Public Schools food service worker\u2019s claim that a Colorado statute, which disqualified nonprofessional employees of educational institutions from unemployment benefits between academic terms, deprived her of equal protection and concluding that the function of the 1976 amendments to FUTA \u201cwas not to unreasonably distinguish [nonprofessional] school employees from other seasonally employed workers, but to combine them with another class to whom they are the most similarly situated: professional school employees who can reasonably expect to be rehired at the onset of the next school year\u201d); <em>Larkin v. Appeal Bd. of Empl. Security Comm\u2019n, </em>89 Mich. App. 199, 280 N.W.2d 483 (1979) (applying rational basis to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>equal protection claim brought by school hall monitor and holding that a Michigan statute making nonprofessional school employees ineligible for unemployment benefits was rationally related to legitimate state interest of safeguarding \u201cthe stability of school district unemployment funds\u201d). <em>See also Imel v. Dep\u2019t of Employment, </em>99 Idaho 224, 580 P.2d 70 (1978) (rejecting teacher\u2019s claim that she was denied equal protection under an Idaho statute making teachers ineligible for benefits between academic terms and concluding that Congress \u201cdid not consider teachers as those facing [an] economic crunch\u201d); <em>Riddel v.

Although privately employed bus drivers may not be subject to the exclusion provisions of L.E. \u00a7 8-909, any perceived inequitable treatment of privately employed and publicly employed school bus drivers is a matter for the legislature to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\">. Neither party raised the application of L.E. \u00a7 8-909(e), which renders employees of \"educational service agencies\u201d ineligible for benefits for the period between academic terms or for vacation periods where they have performed \"educational services\u201d \"in an educational institution\u201d for the first of two consecutive academic terms and given a reasonable assurance of continued employment for the next academic term. Because we conclude that the county boards of education satisfy the L.E. \u00a7 8-101(n) definition of \u201ceducation institution,\u201d we need not consider whether they might alternatively satisfy the L.E. \u00a7 8-909(e)(l) definition of \"educational service agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
