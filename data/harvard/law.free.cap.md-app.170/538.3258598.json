Ehrlich, Jr. (\u201cthe Governor\u201d), William Donald Schaefer (\u201cthe Comptroller\u201d), and Nancy K. Kopp (\u201cthe Treasurer\u201d) (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d), challenging the actions of the Board of Public Works (\u201cthe Board\u201d) in approving for State funding a proposed expansion of Maryland Route 32 in Howard County. Appellants now appeal the court\u2019s dismissal of their claims. They present three questions, which we have rewritten and reordered as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">1. Does the \u201cSmart Growth\u201d legislation allow for an exception for a transportation project on the basis of \u201cextraordinary circumstances?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">2. If so, does the transportation project at issue in this case satisfy the criteria for the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">3. Was the Board required to articulate factual findings in approving appellees\u2019 request?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The \u201cSmart Growth\u201d legislation, enacted in 1997,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> mandates that \u201cthe State may not provide funding for a growth-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>project<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> if the project is not located within a priority funding area.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Md.Code (1985, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-7B-04(a) of the State Finance &amp; Procurement Article (\u201cSFP\u201d). SFP \u00a7 5-7B-05(a)(1) provides two exceptions to the general ban on State funding of growth-related projects outside priority funding areas:</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The State may provide funding for a growth-related project not in a priority funding area if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">(i) the Board of Public Works determines that extraordinary circumstances exist in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">(ii) the Board of Public Works approves the project as a transportation project that meets the requirements of paragraph (3) of this subsection.<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>On July 21, 2004, the Board of Public Works considered a request by the Department of Transportation (\u201cthe Department\u201d) for approval of State funding to expand a portion of Maryland Route 32 in Howard County.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Department acknowledged that the project does not qualify for funding as of right, but asserted that it falls within the exception for \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Department informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the Board that the expansion of a 9]/\u00bf mile section of Route 32 from two lanes to four has been planned for decades as a \u201cconnector between Interstate 70 and [Route] 97 .., known as the Patuxent Freeway.\u201d The Department stated that this section of Route 32 is the most heavily traveled two lane highway in the State. The Department argued that the heavy traffic and high accident rate constitute an extreme hardship and that there is no feasible alternative location for the traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The Board also heard statements from the State Highway Administration, legislators, representatives of interest groups, and concerned citizens. The Governor and the Deputy Comptroller voted in favor of the request; the Treasurer voted against it. The Board thereby approved the project for exemption from the \u201cSmart Growth\u201d restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Appellants brought suit on January 18, 2005, and filed an amended complaint on April 8, 2005. They asserted that, because the Comptroller was not present at the hearing, the Board had actually voted 1-1 on the request, and therefore the funding had to be denied. They also contended that the Board was required to issue factual findings. They sought a writ of mandamus requiring the Board to re-hear the request with all members present and issue factual findings, a declaratory judgment that the Board acted without authority, and an injunction against the Board\u2019s approval of the Department\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Appellees moved to dismiss appellants\u2019 amended complaint. They argued that the Comptroller legitimately transferred authority to an \u201cActing Comptroller,\u201d and that, because the \u201cActing Comptroller\u201d voted in favor of the Department\u2019s request, the Board properly approved it by a 2-1 vote. They further argued that a majority vote by the Board was the \u201csole legal requirement\u201d for approval of the request, and that findings of fact were not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>After a hearing on July 1, 2005, the court found that the Comptroller had validly exercised his \u201cright to appoint his Deputy Comptroller to act on his behalf when he was unable to do so.\u201d The court stated that it \u201cfound no additional requirement in the statute for the Board of Public Works to make any [factual] findings prior to voting on an exception.\u201d The court granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, issuing an order to that effect on July 13, 2005. Appellants noted this appeal on July 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The standard of review on an appeal from the grant of a motion to dismiss is \u201c \u201cwhether the trial court was legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Britton v. Meier, </em>148 Md.App. 419, 425, 812 A.2d 1082 (2002) (quoting <em>Fioretti v.

In ascertaining the intent of the legislature, we find it useful to look at the preamble to 1997 Md. Laws, ch. 759, which states specifically that \u201cthis Act does not create a private cause of action.\u201d In our view, looking at the legislation as a whole and the legislature\u2019s statement of the purpose, SFP \u00a7 5-7B-10(a) reflects the legislative intent to preclude private causes of action generally, including declaratory judgment and injunctive relief claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Section 5-7B-10(a) of the State Finance and Procurement Article does not preclude appellants from seeking a writ of mandamus, which a court may issue \u201c \u2018 \u201cto prevent disorder, from a failure of justice, where the law has established no specific remedy, and where in justice and good government there ought to be one.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Kerpelman v.

Carusillo, 52 </em>Md.App. 44, 50, 447 A.2d 90 (1982). <em>See also Freeman v. Local 1802, </em>318 Md. 684, 693, 569 A.2d 1244 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Under SFP \u00a7 5-7B-05(b)(2), in making a request for approval for funding based on the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception, the applicant must: \u201c(i) identify the extraordinary circumstances that require State funds for the project; and (ii) demonstrate that no feasible alternatives exist to making an exception to the requirements of this subtitle.\u201d SFP \u00a7 5-7B-05(a)(2) provides that, before approving a project under the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception, \u201cthe Board shall determine by a majority vote that\u201d the project satisfies the statutory requirements. There is no express requirement that formal findings of fact supporting its determination be made and presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Appellants contend that there is an implied requirement that the Board issue findings of fact, citing as authority, <em>Mehrling v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>371 Md. 40, 62-63, 806 A.2d 662 (2002) (holding that the Insurance Commissioner was required to issue \u201cmeaningful findings of fact and conclusions of law when rendering final decisions\u201d in contested cases under the APA); <em>Bucktail, LLC v. County Council of Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 552-58, 723 A.2d 440 (1999) (holding that \u201cpiecemeal rezoning\u201d involved adjudicative fact-finding, which warranted a meaningful statement of the Council\u2019s findings of fact); and <em>United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO, Local 2610 v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 673-80, 472 A.2d 62 (1984) (holding that the Commissioner of Industry and Labor was required to include findings of fact and conclusions of law along with his order in a contested case under the APA). In those cases, however, the agency involved was engaged in quasi-judicial adjudications. We have said that, \u201c[w]hen a board or agency makes factual determinations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>decides contested issues, or reviews applications, it performs a quasi-judicial function.\u201d <em>Mears v. Town of Oxford, 52 </em>Md. App. 407, 417, 449 A.2d 1165 (1982). Quasi-judicial proceedings involve \u201cthe fundamentals of due process,\u201d such as \u201ca hearing,\u201d <em>Union Investors, Inc. v. Montgomery County, </em>244 Md. 585, 588, 224 A.2d 453 (1966), and \u201c \u2018the right of the parties to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the tribunal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pellegrino v.

For that reason, the exercise of \u201cquasi-judicial functions\u201d necessarily involve \u201crendering findings of fact and making conclusions of law to decide disputes between parties.\u201d <em>Chestnut Real Estate P\u2019ship v. Huber, </em>148 Md.App. 190, 199, 811 A.2d 389 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In approving funding of a growth-related project, the Board is not adjudicating a contested case involving fundamental rights of life, liberty, or property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, it is performing a \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d function, such as promulgation of a regulation or approving a budget. <em>See Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, Inc., </em>337 Md. 441, 453, 654 A.2d 449 (1995); Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-502(j) of the State Government Article (defining \u201cquasi-legislative function\u201d for purposes of the \u201copen meetings\u201d statutory provisions). \u201c[W]here ... the action is quasi[-]legislative in nature, the concepts applicable to an adversary proceeding have no relevance.\u201d <em>Union Investors, </em>244 Md. at 588, 224 A.2d 453. Any requirement to issue findings of fact does not apply to the Board in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Board held a meeting at which it heard statements from, among others, representatives of the Department as to whether the project satisfies the requirements for \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d The Board then voted 2-1 to approve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the project for funding. In our view, the Board\u2019s actions satisfied its plain duty under the statute.

The Board of Public Works consists of the Governor, the Comptroller of the Treasury, and the Treasurer. Md. Constitution art. 12, \u00a7 1. In this case, the Board convened with Governor Robert L.

The Attorney General has opined that approval of a project by the Board under one of the statutory exceptions \"does not obligate the State to subsidize or otherwise to fund a particular project.\u201d 84 Op.

See SFP \u00a7\u00a7 5-7B-04, 5-7B-05.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">[The exception] process is not an appeal of a decision of another State entity, but rather a process for eliminating a statutory prohibition. The General Assembly made clear that the Smart Growth legislation was not intended to create a vehicle for appealing funding decisions. SFP \u00a7 5-7B-10. Nor does the grant of an exception by the Board reverse any action of another State agency. In particular, the exception process does not, in and of itself, obtain State funding for a project. Rather, an exception merely eliminates a statutory prohibition that would otherwise bar State funding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">... The Board\u2019s approval does not fund the project but does allow the project to be funded in accordance with the State\u2019s budgetary procedures, without regard to Smart Growth funding restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">84 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 39, 48.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">Representatives of the Department also stated that one prerequisite to securing federal funding of the proposed project at issue in this case is a determination of whether the project satisfies all state law requirements, including whether it qualifies under the \"Smart Growth\u201d legislation. Thus, the Department's request to the Board served the dual purpose of seeking approval for State funding and qualifying the project for federal funding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">According to the Department, this is the second time the \"Smart Growth\u201d exceptions have been applied. A representative of the Department stated that, in 1999, the Board approved the \"Manchester Bypass\u201d for funding under one of the exceptions, by a 2-1 vote. See <em>also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>84 Op.

Appellants also argued before the circuit court that the Board\u2019s action was invalid because the Comptroller did not participate in the funding approval. They do not pursue that argument on appeal. Accordingly, we will not consider it. <em>See Layman v. Layman, </em>84 Md.App. 183, 191, 578 A.2d 314 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Appellants raise two additional points on appeal. They argue that, because it is a \"transportation project,\u201d the project can be funded only under the exception for transportation projects and is not eligible for \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d consideration. In addition, they contend that, even if the project can be funded under the \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d exception, it does not meet the requirements for that exception. These issues were not explicitly raised before the circuit court. Appellants' amended complaint presented three separate claims: (1) mandamus, (2) declaratory judgment, and (3) injunctive relief. In support of those claims, appellants asserted in the complaint that the Board's action was invalid because the Comptroller did not directly participate in the decision, and the Board had failed to issue findings of fact. The Board's motion to dismiss, appellants\u2019 response, the arguments at the motion hearing, and the court's ruling were limited to those issues. The court ruled as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The Comptroller, in this Court's view, had the right to appoint his Deputy Comptroller to act on his behalf when he was unable to do so. He did so in writing. I found no additional requirement in the statute for the Board of Public Works to make any [factual] findings prior to voting on an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">I therefore find that the motion to dismiss has merit, and grant it. Thank you very much.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The only hint in the record of appellants\u2019 additional appellate arguments is found in the factual averments in Paragraph 20 of the amended complaint related to the failure to make findings of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The Board did not articulate findings of fact sufficient to support a determination that the Expansion, whether as a whole or as to components such as its location, lay-out of exits, and width, meets each of the criteria of any of the four exceptions. The expansion does not meet the criteria of any of the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">On a motion to dismiss, the trial court must assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and any reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts. <em>Hines v. French, </em>157 Md.App. 536, 548, 852 A.2d 1047 (2004). \" 'Dismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 709, 697 A.2d 1371 (1997)). We have observed that, \"[essentially, a complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action even if it relates 'just the facts' necessary to establish its elements.\u201d <em>Tavakoli-Nouri v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 716, 730, 779 A.2d 992 (2001). On the other hand, \u201cthe facts comprising the cause of action must be pleaded with sufficient specificity. Bald assertions and conclusory statements by the pleader will not suffice.\u201d <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 708-709, 697 A.2d 1371. The complaint must be sufficient to provide notice of the plaintiff's claims, establish the facts supporting those claims, and \"define[] the boundaries of the litigation.\u201d <em>Scott v. Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 27-28, 690 A.2d 1000 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-12\">In our view, appellants failed to adequately raise the additional arguments before the circuit court. Generally, we will not consider any issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court,\" and we decline to do so in this case.
