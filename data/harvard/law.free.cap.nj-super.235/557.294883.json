We conclude that such evidence was properly admitted under the circumstances of this case. We also reject defendant\u2019s other arguments relating to the conduct of his trial. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of conviction. However, we vacate defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated manslaughter, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11--4a, and death by auto, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-5. The trial judge merged the conviction for death by auto into the conviction for aggravated manslaughter and sentenced defendant to a 20 year term of imprisonment with 10 years of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">Defendant\u2019s conviction was based on an automobile collision which occurred at the intersection of Route 537 and Paint Island Spring Road in Freehold Township slightly past midnight on November 25,1984. Waiting for two other cars traveling in the opposite direction to pass before he made a left turn, Daleston Cote stopped his car at the intersection. While he was waiting, Cote was struck from behind by another car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>traveling at a high rate of speed. The impact from the collision propelled Cote\u2019s vehicle across the highway and caused a second collision with a car traveling in the opposite direction. Keith MacCormack, a passenger in Cote\u2019s car, was thrown from the car after the second collision and killed. The car which struck Cote\u2019s vehicle left the scene of the accident and no one observed its license plate number. However, the police determined from the debris at the scene that the hit-and-run vehicle was a maroon 1979 Oldsmobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">A year and a half later, a police officer who had been involved in investigating this hit-and-run accident observed a maroon 1979 Oldsmobile with evident front end repairs. Further investigation revealed that defendant owned this car on the day of the accident and sold it four days later. Forensic analysis of the damaged front end confirmed that this was the car involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The police then interviewed defendant, who initially denied, but later admitted, his prior ownership of the car. Defendant denied being involved in an accident on November 25, 1984, but admitted that he was the only person who drove the car during the period of his ownership. Defendant also admitted being at Rova Farms, a Russian social club, on the evening of November 24, 1985. Rova Farms is located approximately six miles from the site of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The evidence that defendant was the driver of the hit-and-run vehicle which caused the accident resulting in Keith MacCormack\u2019s death was overwhelming. Indeed, this point was virtually conceded in defense counsel\u2019s summation. Therefore, the only real issues at trial were whether defendant operated his vehicle recklessly by consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk that injury or death would result, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3), and thus was guilty of death by auto, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-5, or recklessly \u201cunder circumstances manifesting ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>treme Indifference to human life\u201d and thus was guilty of aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the accident was relevant to these issues. Our courts have concluded that a jury may infer that an individual who drives while intoxicated is consciously disregarding the risk of an accident and acting with extreme indifference to human life. <em>State v. LaBrutto, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>187, 204 (1989); <em>State v. Bogus, </em>223 <em>N.J. Super. </em>409, 419 (App.Div.1988), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>567 (1988). However, the prosecutor lacked direct evidence of defendant\u2019s intoxication, because he left the scene of the accident. Therefore, to prove that defendant was intoxicated at the time of the accident, the prosecutor offered testimony by Bernie D\u2019Zurella, the bartender at Rova Farms from 1981 to the end of 1985, that defendant came to Rova Farms just about every weekend until the end of November 1984 and that he always got drunk shortly after arriving. D\u2019Zurella also said that defendant would regularly become loud and obnoxious and that he would be forced to escort him outside the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The trial judge concluded that D'Zurella's testimony that defendant almost always became intoxicated at Rova Farm on weekends was admissible under Evidence Rules 49 and 50 to show a habit. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">[W]e\u2019re talking about [a] habit of going there on weekends, a habit of drinking on weekends while there and a habit of being drunk on weekends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">This is a particular set of circumstances to which the bartender testified to. It\u2019s not a general trait such as would classify it as character type of evidence____ It\u2019s a particular setting that he was put into, that is the Rova Farms establishment. It\u2019s a particular time. This was a weekend____ And certainly the witness was able to say that every time he was drunk____ I\u2019m satisfied it does constitute habit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The trial judge also found that the \u201cprobative value\u201d of the evidence that defendant regularly became intoxicated at Rova Farms on weekends was not \"substantially outweighed by the risk that it will create substantial danger of undue prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7M\">Defendant argues that D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony as to defendant\u2019s regular weekend intoxication at Rova Farms was inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>missible evidence of a character trait. He relies upon the rule which prohibits the prosecutor from introducing evidence of a character trait of the defendant unless the defendant offers evidence of good character. <em>Evid.R. </em>47. However, \u201c[e]vidence of habit or custom whether corroborated or not is admissible to prove conduct on a specified occasion in conformity with the habit or custom.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>49. In addition, \u201c[e]vidence of specific instances of conduct is admissible to prove habit or custom if the evidence is of a sufficient number of such instances to warrant a finding of such habit or custom, <em>Evid.R. </em>50. Therefore, the admissibility of D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony regarding defendant regularly becoming intoxicated at Rova Farms on weekends turns on whether that conduct constitutes a character trait or a habit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Professor McCormick aptly explains the difficulty of distinguishing between character and habit evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">The two are easily confused. People sometimes speak of a habit for care, a habit for promptness, or a habit of forgetfulness. They may say that an individual has a bad habit of stealing or lying. Evidence of these \u201chabits\u201d would be identical to the kind of evidence that is the target of the general rule against character evidence. Character is a generalized description of a person\u2019s disposition, or of the disposition in respect to a general trait, such as honesty, temperance or peacefulness. Habit, in the present context, is more specific. It denotes one\u2019s regular response to a repeated situation. If we speak of a character for care, we think of the person\u2019s tendency to act prudently in all the varying situations of life \u2014 in business, at home, in handling automobiles and in walking across the street. A habit, on the other hand, is the person\u2019s regular practice of responding to a particular kind of situation with a specific type of conduct. Thus, a person may be in the habit of bounding down a certain stairway two or three steps at a time, of patronizing a particular pub after each day\u2019s work, or of driving his automobile without using a seatbelt. The doing of the habitual act may become semi-automatic, as with a driver who invariably signals before changing lanes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">Evidence of habits that come within this definition has greater probative value than does evidence of general traits of character. Furthermore, the potential for prejudice is substantially less. By and large, the detailed patterns of situation-specific behavior that constitute habits are unlikely to provoke such sympathy or antipathy as would distort the process of evaluating the evidence. <em>[.McCormick, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 195 at 574-575 (3d ed. 1984) (footnotes omitted)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\"><em>See also </em>1A <em>Wigmore, Evidence, </em>\u00a7 92 at 1609 (Tillers rev. ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>With respect to the habit of intemperance Professor McCormick comments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Intemperance seems one of the more potentially prejudicial habits. Partly, the problem stems from the fact that the term may denote a general disposition for excessive drinking (a trait) or a practice of drinking a certain number of glasses of whiskey every night at home (a habit). Thus, the probative force of what is loosely called the habit of intemperance to prove drunkenness on a particular occasion depends on the regularity and details of the characteristic behavior. This may help explain in part the conflicting results when evidence of \u201chabitual intemperance\u201d is brought forward. <em>[McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 195 at 575-576 n. 8],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The cases in other jurisdictions, especially in federal courts, are generally supportive of McCormick\u2019s conclusion that the distinction between habit evidence and evidence of character traits turns upon the regularity and situation-specific nature of the conduct. <em>See, e.g., Loughan v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>749 <em>F.2d </em>1519, 1522-1524 (11th Cir.1985) (trial court properly admitted evidence of plaintiff tire mechanic\u2019s habit of bringing a cooler of beer to work and drinking on the job to show that he was intoxicated at time of accident on which products liability claim was based and hence contributorily negligent); <em>Keltner v. Ford Motor Co., </em>748 <em>F.2d </em>1265, 1268-1269 (8th Cir.1984) (trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of plaintiff motorist\u2019s drinking habits in products liability action against van manufacturer); <em>State v. Wadsworth, </em>210 <em>So.</em>2d 4 (Fla.1968) (evidence of defendant\u2019s habit of purchasing vodka three times a week properly admitted as corroborating evidence of his intoxication at the time of alleged motor vehicular manslaughter). The court correctly observed in <em>Reyes v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., </em>589 <em>F.</em>2d 791, 795 (5th Cir.1979), that \u201cthe probative force of habit evidence to prove intoxication on a given occasion depends on the \u2018degree of regularity of the practice and its coincidence with the occasion.\u2019 <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 195 n. 16 (2d ed. 1972).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We are satisfied that this is one of those relatively uncommon cases in which defendant\u2019s intoxication was shown to occur with sufficient regularity in a specific situation to justify its admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>sion as evidence of a habit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> D\u2019Zurella testified that defendant came to Rova Farms nearly every weekend and that he invariably became intoxicated shortly after his arrival there. Since the crime occurred on a weekend and defendant admitted to the investigating officers that he was at Rova Farms that evening, the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendant\u2019s regularly becoming intoxicated at Rova Farms to prove that defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime. <em>See Loughan v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., supra; cf. Burd v. Vercruyssen, </em>142 <em>N.J. Super. </em>344 (App.Div.1976), certif. den. 72 <em>N.J. </em>459 (1976) (conduct which was observed \u201cmany\u201d times sufficient to establish habit).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Moreover, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to exclude this evidence under Evidence Rule 4. The evidence that defendant invariably became intoxicated when he went to Rova Farms and consequently was probably intoxicated when he ran his car into the back of the Cote vehicle had substantial probative value with respect to defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the crime, especially in view of the fact that defendant\u2019s flight from the scene deprived the jury of direct evidence of his condition. Furthermore, the bartender\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s regular \u201cloud and obnoxious\u201d behavior was highly pertinent to the credibility of his assertion that he had a clear recollection of defendant\u2019s habitual pattern of intoxication. <em>See Evid.R. </em>20. Therefore, while the evidence of defendant\u2019s habitual intoxication at Rova Farms undoubtedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>east him in a bad light in the eyes of the jury, this prejudice to defendant did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence. <em>See State v. Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 308, quoting <em>State v. West, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>327, 335 (1959) (\u201c[t]hat evidence is shrouded with unsavory implications is no reason for exclusion when it is a significant part of the proof.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We recognize that D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony that defendant\u2019s acquaintances were a \u201cbunch of bums\u201d and \u201calcoholics\u201d was objectionable. However, this statement was elicited during defendant\u2019s cross-examination of D\u2019Zurella. Furthermore, defense counsel did not make a motion for a mistrial or curative instruction, but rather attempted to use the statement to show D\u2019Zurella\u2019s bias against the defendant. Under these circumstances, we are unable to conclude that this isolated comment requires a reversal and remand for a new trial. <em>See State v. Harper, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 277 (App.Div.1974), certif. den. 65 <em>N.J. </em>574 (1974) (trial errors which are encouraged or acquiesced in by defense counsel are ordinarily not a basis for reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury gave undue emphasis to D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony and permitted the jury to equate a finding that defendant habitually became intoxicated at Rova Farms with a finding of reckless operation of his vehicle. Defendant\u2019s argument is based on the following portion of the court\u2019s instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">Now you\u2019ve heard some testimony from ... Mr. D\u2019Zurella concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct and his drinking on prior occasions. Now, let me tell you how this testimony may be used by you with regard to the defendant\u2019s conduct on November 24th or 25th, the date of the accident here. First of all, as with all testimony, you\u2019re free to believe or not believe the testimony of the witness Mr. D\u2019Zurella here. And if you believe the testimony you\u2019re going to decide what weight you\u2019re going to give to the testimony and the credibility of the witness. If you believe the testimony of Mr. D\u2019Zurella as to the defendant\u2019s prior conduct, you may consider such evidence in determining whether the defendant had a habit of acting in the way that the witness indicated; that is always drinking and always intoxicated at Rova Farms on the weekend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">Now, if and only if you determine that the defendant had such a habit, you may then consider that habit in determining whether the defendant acted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>was in the same condition on the night of November 24, 1984. On the other hand, if you find that that conduct by the defendant, as testified to by Mr. D\u2019Zurella, the witness, does not bespeak a habit of the defendant, then the testimony may not be used by you in determining how he acted and what condition he was in on November 24, 1984. The crucial question is if there was a habit, did he act in accordance with that particular habit on November 24th, 1984.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We believe that it was appropriate \u2014 if not incumbent \u2014 upon the trial judge to instruct the jury regarding the use it could make of D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony. Defendant did not object to the specific language of that instruction at trial and hence it is not grounds for reversal on appeal except upon a showing of plain error. <em>R. </em>1:7-2. The judge appropriately instructed the jury that it was within their province to assess D\u2019Zurella\u2019s credibility, to determine whether his testimony established that defendant had a habit of always becoming intoxicated at Rova Farms on weekends and, if so, whether defendant acted in accordance with that habit on the night of the crime. <em>See Biunno, Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>Comment 1 to <em>Evid.R. </em>50 (1989). The jury was never told that a finding of the existence of a habit required a finding of recklessness on the night in question, nor could it have inferred this from the instructions the judge gave. Therefore, nothing in these instructions unduly emphasized D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony or described it in a manner which was prejudicial to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Defendant contends that the trial judge erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of aggravated manslaughter, because the State presented insufficient evidence to enable a reasonable jury to conclude that his operation of his vehicle manifested an extreme indifference to human life. Defendant also contends that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that MacCormack\u2019s death was caused by the impact of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">A motion for a judgment of acquittal must be denied if \u201cviewing the State\u2019s evidence in its entirety, be that evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>direct or circumstantial, and giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all of the favorable inferences which reasonably could be drawn therefrom, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459 (1967). The same standard governs appellate review of the denial of a motion for acquittal. <em>State v. Moffa, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>258, 263 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">An individual is guilty of aggravated manslaughter if he \u201crecklessly causes death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a. Thus, the Legislature enumerated two elements for aggravated manslaughter: \u201c(1) a reckless causing of death by the actor and (2) circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d <em>State v. Curtis, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 363 (App.Div.1984), certif. den. 99 <em>N.J. </em>212 (1984). A person will be found to have acted \u201crecklessly\u201d if he \u201cconsciously disregard[ed] a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u201d that death \u201cwill result from his conduct.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3). Moreover, \u201c[t]he risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see State v. Curtis, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. Super. </em>at 364. And if it is shown that there was probability, rather than a \u201cmere possibility,\u201d that death would result, reckless conduct will be found to have been committed under \u201ccircumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d <em>State v. Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 638 (1987); <em>State v. Curtis, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 364-365. The relevant \u201ccircumstances\u201d are objective and do not depend on the actor\u2019s state of mind. <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In <em>State v. Bogus, supra, </em>we upheld a conviction for aggravated manslaughter based upon evidence that defendant drank \u201cto the point of being severely intoxicated\u201d and then \u201cdrove his truck on a main thoroughfare at an excessive rate of speed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>proceeded into the intersection in the face of a red light.\u201d 223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 419. We stated that the jury could conclude that \u201cthe decision to drive and the manner in which defendant operated his vehicle indicate a complete disregard for the lives of others.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Similarly, the evidence in this case provided sufficient support for a conviction of aggravated manslaughter. As previously discussed, the jury could have inferred from D\u2019Zurella\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s habit of becoming intoxicated at Rova Farms on weekends that defendant was highly intoxicated at the time of the accident. The jury also could have concluded from Cote\u2019s testimony that his vehicle was struck from behind by defendant\u2019s vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed and that defendant did not have control over his vehicle. The fact that defendant fled the scene of the collision, without stopping to determine whether he could render aid to any of the victims, provided additional support for the conclusion that he acted with extreme indifference to human life. Therefore, as in <em>Bogus, </em>the evidence that defendant made a decision to drive while highly intoxicated and drove in an extremely reckless manner was sufficient to support his conviction for aggravated manslaughter. <em>See also State v. Casele, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 472-473 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Defendant\u2019s alternative argument that his motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted because there was no evidence that MacCormack\u2019s death was caused by the impact of his vehicle is clearly without merit. There was undisputed medical evidence that the victim died as a result of injuries suffered in the automobile accident caused by defendant\u2019s driving. If the careless driving of another driver or the victim\u2019s failure to wear a seat belt also were contributing causes of the accident and resulting fatality, this would not absolve defendant of responsibility. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-3c; <em>cf. State v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 50-54 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Defendant also contends that the trial judge abused his discretion by refusing to allow him to waive a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Prior to the start of trial, defense counsel requested a bench trial. He maintained that the distinction between causing a death by recklessly driving a vehicle required for a conviction of death by auto and recklessly causing death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life required for a conviction of aggravated manslaughter was so \u201carcane\u201d that a trial judge would be better equipped than a jury to fairly decide defendant\u2019s guilt. In addition, he argued that certain aspects of the trial might inflame a jury and prejudice the defendant <em>ie., </em>the fact that a 17-year old boy was killed, defendant\u2019s flight from the scene and defendant\u2019s statement to the police that he had not been involved in the accident. Defense counsel also mentioned the possibility that newspaper reporters might come into the courthouse and photograph the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">In denying defense counsel\u2019s request, the trial judge placed primary reliance on the fact that he expected that the case would require <em>Miranda </em>as well as other hearings involving complex evidentiary rulings. The judge felt that if he excluded evidence as a result of the hearings, it would be difficult for him to remove inadmissible evidence from his mind, if he were the fact finder. Also, the judge was concerned that the appearance of the fairness might be blemished if he made a ruling that certain evidence was inadmissible and then made a finding of fact that seemed contradictory to his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">It is now well established that a criminal defendant has no constitutional right to waive a trial by jury and be tried by a judge alone. <em>Singer v. United States, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>24, 85 <em>S.Ct </em>783, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>630 (1965); <em>State v. Belton, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>103, 110 (1972); <em>State v. Fiorilla, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>81, 86 (App.Div.1988); <em>State v. Davidson, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, S (App.Div.1988), certif. den. 111 <em>N.J. </em>594 (1988). Therefore, the decision whether to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>grant a defendant\u2019s motion to waive a jury trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>State v. Fiorilla, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 92; <em>State v. Davidson, supra, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 9; <em>see R. </em>1:8-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">This court has articulated varying standards to guide a trial judge\u2019s decision on a defendant\u2019s request for a bench trial. On the one hand, we indicated in <em>State v. Davidson, supra, </em>that the trial judge\u2019s discretion \u201cmust be exercised after an evaluation of the totality of circumstances, including recognition of the fact that jury trials are ... \u2018the preferred mode of fact-finding in criminal cases.\u2019 \u201d 225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 9. On the other hand, we stated in <em>State v. Fiorilla, supra, </em>that a defendant\u2019s request to waive a jury trial should not be denied unless the trial judge determines that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">(1) a defendant has not voluntarily, knowingly and competently waived his constitutional right to jury trial with advice of counsel; or that, (2) the waiver is not tendered in good faith, but as a stratagem to procure an otherwise impermissible procedural advantage; or that, (3) consequential, overriding, demonstrable and articulated reasons exist to require a jury trial, which outweigh the reasons and record provided by the defendant in support of waiver. [226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 92],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Even assuming the appropriateness of the <em>Fiorilla </em>standards, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to waive a jury trial. The trial judge specifically found that his anticipated exposure to items of evidence that were ultimately ruled inadmissible could detract from the appearance of a fair trial. Thus, he concluded that the integrity of the fact finding process would be best served by a jury trial. Since the trial judge found that his instructions on the law would be sufficient to enable a jury to competently decide the issues involved and that there was nothing about this case which was more inflammatory than any other criminal case involving a victim\u2019s death, he made one of the determinations required by <em>Fiorilla </em>for denying a defendant\u2019s request for a bench trial, <em>i.e., </em>that \u201cconsequential, overriding, demonstrable and articulated reasons exist to require a jury trial, which outweigh the reasons and record provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the defendant in support of waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Defendant\u2019s additional arguments that the trial judge failed to properly define \u201ccausation\u201d and erred in not granting a new trial are clearly without merit and do not require discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Defendant was exposed to a term of imprisonment of between 10 to 20 years for a first-degree crime, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(1), with a presumptive term of 15 years unless the preponderance of aggravating or mitigating factors weighed in favor of a higher or lower term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A,. </em>2C:44-1f(1). In addition, defendant was subject to a parole ineligibility period not to exceed one-half the term imposed, if the court was clearly convinced that the aggravating factors substantially outweighed the mitigating factors. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. Hence, the 20-year term of imprisonment with a 10-year parole ineligibility period imposed on defendant was the maximum term allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">In determining whether to deviate from the presumptive sentence for a crime, \u201cthe court must decide whether there is a preponderance of aggravating or mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Kruse, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>354, 359 (1987); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(1). How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ever, a period of parole ineligibility may be imposed only if the trial judge is \u201cclearly convinced that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. Under this statutory standard, \u201c[p]eriods of parole ineligibility are the exception and not the rule. They are not to be treated as routine or commonplace.\" <em>State v. Kruse, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 359, quoting <em>State v. Martelli, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 382-383 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Under <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 365-366 (1984), a reviewing court must first determine whether the correct sentencing guidelines have been followed. It must then determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of fact upon which the sentencing court based the application of those guidelines. Finally, it must determine whether the trial court clearly erred by reaching a conclusion that could not have reasonably been made upon a weighing of the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In imposing sentence, the trial judge found the following aggravating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offenses and defendant\u2019s role therein, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(1);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(2) the gravity and seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(2);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">(3) the risk that defendant will commit another offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44 \u2014 la(3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">(4) the extent of defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which he has been convicted, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-la(6); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">(5) the need for deterring defendant and others from violating the law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(9).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-16\">The sole mitigating factor identified by the judge was that defendant had been gainfully employed for 21 years prior to his retirement and that, with the exception of several convictions for petty offenses and six prior convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol, defendant had led a law-abiding life, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1b(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The trial court properly identified the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating factor based upon defendant\u2019s failure to stop after he hit the Cote vehicle. The court also properly viewed the risk that defendant would commit another offense and the need for deterrence as additional aggravating factors based on the fact that defendant continued to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated despite 6 prior convictions for driving while under the influence and a 22 year suspension of his license. However, the court erred in identifying the harm inflicted on the victim and defendant\u2019s prior criminal record as aggravating factors. Therefore, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">When an essential element of a crime is a specific fact, that element may not be used as an aggravating factor to impose a sentence which is longer than the presumptive term or includes a parole ineligibility period. <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 645 (1985), <em>cert. </em>den. 475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 308 (1986). Thus, since the death of the victim is an essential element of aggravated manslaughter, that fact could not be considered an aggravating factor. <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 404 (1989). Moreover, the trial court erred in treating the emotional trauma to the victim\u2019s family caused by his death as an aggravating factor. The wording of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:44-1a(2), which includes consideration of the victim\u2019s power of resistance, indicates that the Legislature intended this aggravating factor to relate to harm inflicted on the \u201cvictim of the offense\u201d rather than the victim\u2019s relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(6) provides that \u201c[t]he extent of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which he has been convicted\u201d is an aggravating sentencing factor. The trial court erred in finding that defendant\u2019s six prior convictions for driving while under the influence of alcohol made this aggravating factor applicable. Driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ing while under the influence of alcohol is not a crime. <em>State v. Linnekan, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41 (App.Div.1984), certif. den. 99 <em>N.J. </em>236 (1985); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4. Moreover, it is not designated a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4b. Consequently, driving while under the influence is not an \u201coffense\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-14k. Therefore, defendant\u2019s prior convictions under <em>N.J. S.A. </em>39:4-50 could not be considered an aggravating factor under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(6), although they could be considered as part of defendant\u2019s overall personal history in the same fashion as convictions in municipal court or a juvenile record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Marzolf, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>167, 177 (1979); <em>State v. Taylor, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 453-454 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Because the trial judge imposed the maximum term of imprisonment and maximum period of parole ineligibility even though defendant was 64 years old at the time of sentencing and had never before been convicted of an indictable offense, we cannot assume that the judge would have imposed the same sentence even if the incorrectly identified aggravating factors were eliminated from consideration. In fact, we have serious doubts regarding the sustainability of this sentence, especially the parole ineligibility component. However, in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent admonition that \u201cthe exercise of appellate original jurisdiction should not occur regularly or routinely\u201d and that \u201cin the face of deficient sentences, a remand to the trial court for resentencing is to strongly be preferred,\u201d <em>State v. Jarbath, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 411, we conclude that the most appropriate disposition here is to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction but vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We note that defendant did not seek to bar the admission of this evidence pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>55. Moreover, defendant refers to Evidence Rule 55 only by way of analogy in his brief filed in this court. Therefore, no issue of admissibility under <em>Evid.R. </em>55 is before us. In any event, there was no direct evidence that defendant had driven while under the influence of intoxicants on other occasions. In fact, the bartender testified that defendant often slept at Rova Farms over the weekend, which might negate any impression in the mind of the jury that he regularly drove while intoxicated. Consequently, it is unclear whether the requisite foundation could have been established for an argument under Rule 55. <em>See generally State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 298-304 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Subsequent to the date on which defendant committed the instant offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4c was amended to provide that a person convicted of aggravated manslaughter \"may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection a, of N.J.S. 2C:43-6, be sentenced to an ordinary term of imprisonment between 10 and 30 years...\u00bf.1986, c. 172, \u00a7 1. In addition, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(1) was amended to provide a presumptive term of 20 years for aggravated manslaughter. \u00bf.1986, <em>c. </em>172, \u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The trial court also properly recognized that these convictions were pertinent to the risk that defendant would commit another offense and the need for deterrence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
