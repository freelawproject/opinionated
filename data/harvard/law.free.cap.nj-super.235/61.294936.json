She brought a complaint against defendants Louis C. Gilde and Patricia Gilde, owners of a four family rental apartment building which abuts the sidewalk, seeking to recover for injuries she allegedly sustained as a result of her fall. Defendants successfully argued on motion for summary judgment that they were immune from liability because the municipality had assumed control over the tree that caused the elevation of the pavement by adopting an ordinance creating a shade tree commission. Plaintiff appeals and contends that the trial judge erred in holding that the municipal ordinance immunizes defendants. Plaintiff argues that the rule of law to be applied is that commercial landowners are responsible for maintaining their sidewalks in reasonably good condition and are liable to pedestrians injured as a result of their negligent failure to do so. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Plaintiff does not contend on appeal that genuine issues of fact exist which prevented the trial judge from ruling in favor of the defendants. Rather, plaintiff contends that the trial judge was bound by the decision in <em>Stewart v. 104 Wallace St., Inc., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>146 (1981). <em>Stewart </em>held that commercial property owners are responsible for maintaining sidewalks abutting their properties in reasonably good condition and that they are liable to pedestrians injured as a result of negligent failure to do so. Plaintiff correctly asserts that defendants are commercial property owners. <em>Hambright v. Yglesias, </em>200 <em>N.J. Super. </em>392, 394-395 (App.Div.1985). Defendants\u2019 argument, on the other hand, is that the existence of a Shade Tree Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>sion immunizes defendants from liability. This precise issue was not addressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Stewart </em>or in any subsequent case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Defendants rely on a line of cases starting with <em>Rose v. Slough, 92 N.J.L. </em>233 (E. &amp; A. 1918). In <em>Rose, </em>the Court of Errors and Appeals stated that the general rule is that a property owner owes no duty to keep a sidewalk abutting his property in repair. <em>Id. </em>at 234. The Court held: \u201cThere being no legal duty cast upon the owner to repair, there can be no recovery for an injury sustained, by reason of such defective sidewalk arising from a failure to repair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238-239. See also, <em>Yanhko v. Fane, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>528, 532 (1976). However, the court gave an alternative basis for its decision in favor of the landowner. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">Where a municipality, in pursuance of state legislative sanction, assumes control of the trees within its territory, an abutting owner, on a street of such municipality, is relieved from the care of a tree standing on the sidewalk in front of his premises, to the extent that he will be exempt from liability to respond in damages, in a civil action, to an individual who has suffered an injury of which the tree is the producing cause. <em>Rose, </em>92 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 239.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Although <em>Stewart </em>created a commercial property exception to the general rule established in <em>Rose </em>and <em>Yanhko </em>that a property owner owed no legal duty to keep a sidewalk abutting his property in repair, there was no indication in <em>Stewart </em>that the alternative ground for the ruling in <em>Rose, </em>i.e., that a shade tree commission ordinance immunizes property owners from liability, was affected by that exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In <em>Hayden v. Curley, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>420 (1961), a pedestrian sought damages for injuries sustained when he fell over a portion of sidewalk broken and raised by the roots of a tree. The municipality had created a shade tree commission. <em>Id. </em>at 422-423. The court held that <em>Rose </em>controlled: \u201cIn the present case, the municipality, by ordinance adopted pursuant to state statute, assumed exclusive control of the planting and maintaining of shade trees in the public sidewalk. The assumption of such control relieved defendant Curley of any responsibility for maintaining the planted tree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Later, in <em>Bennett v. Gordon, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252 (App.Div.1968), certif. denied 52 <em>N.J. </em>499 (1968), the situation again involved a municipal ordinance creating a shade tree commission and a pedestrian injured by a sidewalk raised by the roots of a shade tree. The court found that the municipality\u2019s ordinance had authorized \u201ccomplete control and maintenance of the trees by the Commission and limited such control on the part of the abutting owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>101 <em>NJ.Super. </em>at 258. We held that it was \u201cinequitable to subject the property owner to liability where he had no right to maintain the tree and no legal authority to remedy any danger it might create.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Merchantville adopted an ordinance in 1942 which created a shade tree commission. The ordinance provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">The regulation, planting, care and control of shade and ornamental trees and shrubbery upon and in the streets, highways, public places, parks and parkways of the Borough of Merchantville shall hereafter be exercised by a Commission ... which shall be known as the \u201cShade-Tree Commission of the Borough of Merchantville.\u201d Merchantville Code, Art. II, \u00a7 13-5</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The Merchantville Code also provided that its Shade Tree Commission \u201cshall exercise the powers conferred and perform the duties imposed upon it by Chapter 64 of Title 40 of the Revised Statutes of the State of New Jersey of 1937 (R.S. 40:64-1 to 40:64-14) as amended and supplemented____\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13-8. In 1978 Merchantville adopted the Shade Tree Commission Supplemental Ordinance. Section 2 of the ordinance required that no person shall \u201c[c]ut, disturb or interfere in any way with any root\u201d without first acquiring a permit from the Shade Tree Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Plaintiff relies upon an ordinance passed by Merchantville in 1972 concerning sidewalk construction. The applicable provision of the Merchantville Code, Art. I, \u00a7 73-1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">It shall be the duty and obligation of the abutting landowner to construct and maintain the curbs, sidewalks, and drive aprons fronting the property. All owners and persons holding real estate in the Borough of Merchantville, lying or fronting on any part to the streets of said borough, shall, within sixty (60) days after written notice being given by the Clerk of said Borough of Merchant-ville, construct and maintain the sidewalks, curbs and drive aprons along his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>her property according to the grade established by said Borough. The Borough Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works shall determine when the condition of any sidewalk, curb or drive aprons becomes unsafe or is in need of repair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The Sidewalk Construction and Maintenance Code also addressed shade tree removal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">In the event any sidewalk, curb or drive apron construction or maintenance will involve the removal of any tree or part thereof, including roots, situate between the edge of the sidewalk and the curb, the owner shall first secure written approval for said work from the Shade Tree Commission of the Borough of Merchantville. Merchantville Code, Art. I, \u00a7 73-4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">This latter provision was based upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:64-10 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">No statute giving any person or State, county of municipal board, body or official, power or authority to lay any sidewalk along, or to open, construct, curb or pave any street, or to do any similar act, shall be construed to permit or authorize any interference with or injury to a highway shade tree without the consent of the shade tree commission within whose jurisdiction such tree shall be located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Plaintiff asserts that the rationale of <em>Stewart, </em>together with the statutory concerning sidewalk maintenance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:65-14 and the Merchantville code, Art. I, \u00a7 73-1 and \u00a7 73-4, supersede the \u201cold law\u201d as represented by <em>Rose, Hayden </em>and <em>Bennett. </em>Plaintiff argues that <em>Bennett </em>and <em>Hayden </em>are distinguishable from the present case because both involved residential properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Although that statement is true, the Shade Tree Commission statute and ordinance does not distinguish between residential and commercial property owners. Because the present dispute centers on whether the existence of the Merchantville Shade Tree Commission immunizes defendants from liability, it is immaterial that <em>Bennett </em>and <em>Hayden </em>involved residential properties. Rather, what is important is that <em>Bennett, Hayden, </em>and <em>Rose </em>stand for the proposition that the existence of a shade tree commission immunizes property owners, without distinction as to the nature of ownership, from liability for injuries stemming from defective sidewalks caused by shade tree roots.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Plaintiff next argues that <em>Bennett </em>and <em>Hayden </em>were decided prior to the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:65-14 and the Merchantville Sidewalk and Maintenance Ordinance, Art. I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u00a7 73-1 and 4, which impose a duty on property owners to maintain sidewalks. Plaintiff\u2019s contention is that the sidewalk ordinance is more specific and imposes an additional duty on the property owner. Defendants counter with the assertion that the enactment of the sidewalk ordinance is immaterial. Defendants correctly cite <em>Yanhko, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 536, in which the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">[W]e reject the thesis that a municipal sidewalk ordinance creates a tort duty owing to passersby on the public passageway. Our settled law is to the contrary. Our cases have consistently refused to find that ordinances requiring land owners to repair or maintain abutting sidewalks create a duty running from the property owner to the injured plaintiff, unless a statute explicitly establishes civil liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">While <em>Stewart </em>reversed the <em>Yanhko </em>decision on other grounds, we find nothing in <em>Stewart </em>which erodes this well established principle concerning the effect of ordinances on tort duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Although plaintiff contends that the property owner should be required to notify the Shade Tree Commission of a defect in the sidewalk, the Merchantville Code places the burden on the Borough to notify the property owner, who then contacts the Shade Tree Commission. It is clear from the Merchantville Code that it is the Borough Engineer or Superintendent of Public Works who determines when a sidewalk \u201cbecomes unsafe or is in need of repair.\u201d Merchantville Code, Art. I, \u00a7 73-1. Regardless of the sidewalk construction and maintenance statute and ordinance, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:64-5 gives the Shade Tree Commission \u201cfull and exclusive control\u201d over the shade trees and surrounding grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Finally, plaintiff argues that public policy considerations \u201cdemand\u201d that all commercial property owners be liable for injuries caused by defective sidewalks abutting their properties, notwithstanding the existence of a shade tree commission. Plaintiff sites Justice Proctor\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Murray v. Michalak, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>220 (1971) for the proposition that the common law rule immunizing a property owner from liability for failing to maintain abutting sidewalks has no place in today\u2019s society. Plaintiff states that \u201cJustice Proctor\u2019s words are no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>less true just because of the existence of a Shade Tree Commission.\u201d However, Justice Proctor stated: \u201cOcean City has no shade tree commission and never had one. It does not plant or maintain the shade trees in the city, nor does it construct or maintain sidewalks.... Thus, there is no question here of the defendants being relieved of any duty because of municipal responsibility for the tree or the sidewalk.\u201d 58 <em>N.J. </em>at 221. It appears, that, although Justice Proctor may have disagreed with the majority view, he would, nonetheless, join the majority and grant immunity to a defendant property owner in a municipality with a shade tree commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In order to adopt plaintiffs argument we would have to substantially expand the liability imposed on commercial property owners in <em>Stewart </em>and eschew a substantial body of law emanating from our highest court granting immunity in instances such as this where there is a shade tree commission. \u201cExtensive policy shifts of this magnitude should not be initiated by an intermediate appellate court. The appropriate tribunal to accomplish such drastic changes is either the Supreme Court or the Legislature.\u201d <em>Namm v. Charles E. Frosst &amp; Co., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 35 (App.Div.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
