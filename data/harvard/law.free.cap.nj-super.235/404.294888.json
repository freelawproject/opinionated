Each of the properties is generally similar. They front on the Atlantic Ocean and extend from the bulkhead line well into the ocean.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parcels include unencumbered upland property, beach property encumbered by public easement for bathing and recreation and a possible interest in a paper street adjoining the bulkhead line. A complete description is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tained in <em>Borough of Wildwood Crest v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. 127 </em>(App.Div.1986), certif. den. 107 <em>N.J. 51 </em>(1986).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Following a <em>de novo </em>nonjury trial on appeal from a commissioners\u2019 award, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13, the trial judge found the fair market value of the Smith property on the stipulated valuation date (February 7, 1983) to have been $466,075, and that of the Monterey Motel property to have been $453,250. When a dispute arose as to the amount and nature of the interest to be awarded on the deficiency in moneys previously deposited by plaintiff, the court took testimony and in a written opinion of January 26, 1988 ordered rates which coincided with those approved by court rules but, more critical to this appeal, ordered that the interest should be compounded annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In their cross-appeals, each of the parties essentially attacks the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact with respect to valuation. The weight to be given to the testimony of the experts is within the competence of the fact-finder. We are satisfied that his acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s experts\u2019 opinions as to highest and best use and comparables was supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record. <em>See Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">However, after accepting plaintiff's comparables, the trial judge made a substantial upward adjustment in the expert\u2019s value of the encumbered beach property from $.95 \u2014 $1 per square foot to $9.50 per square foot. He did this because he took judicial notice that the comparable properties had been subject to the same public easement which encumbered the subject lands. Thus, he reasoned that in comparing the values no adjustment should have been made for the encumbrance. We agree with his logic. That similar public easements existed has been conceded by the parties at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>In its appeal plaintiff also claims error in the award of compound interest rather than simple interest. We agree with the trial judge and affirm substantially for the reasons given in his written opinion of January 26, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Defendants\u2019 predecessors acquired the riparian rights from the State many years ago.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The earlier litigation involved the nature and extent of defendants\u2019 holdings, thus providing a predicate for the valuation determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
