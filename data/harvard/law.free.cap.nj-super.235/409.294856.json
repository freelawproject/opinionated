The Law Division affirmed the conviction based upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the record and imposed the same fine imposed by the municipal court. 235 NJ.Super. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">On this appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that the radar reading which resulted in his conviction was reliable. Defendant also argues that he was improperly convicted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98 because this section only specifies the lawful speed at which a vehicle may be operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and does not proscribe any conduct as being unlawful. We reject both of defendant\u2019s arguments substantially for the reasons expressed in Judge Steinberg\u2019s opinion of September 23, 1988. <em>See also State v. Dantonio, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>570, 580 (1955); <em>State v. Dickens, </em>130 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 79 (App.Div.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
