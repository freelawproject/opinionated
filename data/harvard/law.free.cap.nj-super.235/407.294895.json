The trial judge ruled that Worker\u2019s Compensation is the exclusive remedy available to plaintiffs and that the dual capacity doctrine must be rejected in this context. Accordingly, he granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 negligence actions. We agree with this disposition. While the dual capacity doctrine may have viability in some circumstances, it is clearly inapplicable here, where the employee is injured during the course of his employment on the premises of his employer. We thus affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Menza in his thoughtful opinion of August 5, 1988. 235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
