Steinmann appeals from a final determination of the New Jersey Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) denying her request to convert her ordinary disability retirement plan to an early service retirement. On appeal she contends that TPAF\u2019s failure to render its final determination within 45 days of the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, which recommended approval of petitioner\u2019s request, made the ALJ\u2019s recommendation a final decision pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52-.14B-10(c). In the alternative, she argues that TPAF\u2019s denial of her request to convert was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. We reject both contentions and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Petitioner enrolled in TPAF when she began her teaching career on September 1, 1957. Her membership continued until retirment in March 1983. Petitioner sustained work-connected injuries in April 1981 and filed a petition for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On January 81, 1983 she applied to TPAF for accidental disability retirement. Prior to filing the application, petitioner received a \u201cbenefits\u201d booklet from TPAF which described eligibility requirements for accidental disability retirement as well as ordinary disability retirement. It also described eligibility requirements for early retirement benefits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>including entitlement to full benefits upon 25 years of service, regardless of age. The book also explained that if the retiree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">... is receiving periodic benefits under Workmen\u2019s Compensation, the actuarial equivalent of such benefits remaining to be paid will reduce the pension portion of his allowances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On petitioner\u2019s application for accidental disability benefits she was asked whether she had filed for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and if so, what benefits she was then receiving. The application also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">... see benefit booklet for [workers\u2019 compensation benefits] effect on retirement allowance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Petitioner disclosed on the application that she had filed a compensation claim and was receiving $58 temporary benefits weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">On December 19, 1983, petitioner\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement was denied. However, pursuant to <em>N.J. S.A. </em>18A:66-39b, TPAF granted her ordinary disability retirement benefits effective March 1, 1983. On February 7, 1984 the Division of Pensions advised petitioner of her option to change from an option 1 allowance which paid $800.72 monthly to a maximum allowance of $908.57. The notice also contained the following reminder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">Please note that if you are receiving any periodic Worker\u2019s Compensation payments after the effective date of your retirement, your retirement allowance could be subject to a reduction. You must advise this office if and when you receive any Worker\u2019s Compensation Benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">On February 18, 1984 petitioner elected the maximum allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">On July 10, 1984 petitioner recovered a workers\u2019 compensation award of partial permanent benefits totalling $44,775. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>thereupon notified TPAF of the award. On January 7,1985 she wrote to TPAF with the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">It is my understanding that my ordinary disability pension is not subject to any offset. If I am not correct in this matter, please change my pension to years in service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The Division of Pensions responded on September 25, 1985, advising petitioner that her monthly allowance was being reduced to $559.88 per month because of the workers\u2019 compensation set-off. She was also advised that she could not convert to an early retirement plan because TPAF had already approved the ordinary disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">On November 7, 1985 petitioner made formal application to TPAF for a conversion to a early retirement plan. Under that plan, petitioner would have received $752.93 monthly instead of the reduced amount of $559.88. TPAF denied the request, stating that once a retirement plan became effective, \u201cthe choice is irrevocable.\u201d Petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In his initial decision of November 17, 1986, the AU recommended reversal, concluding that TPAF had not dealt fairly with petitioner in failing to apprise her of her right to take early retirement in lieu of ordinary disability when her accidental disability claim was denied. The judge concluded that petitioner had demonstrated the requisite good cause and reasonable diligence to permit reopening of the retirement plan and conversion to an early retirement plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">TPAF\u2019s time period for the rendering of final decision was extended by the OAL until January 8, 1987. On that date TPAF rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommendations and denied petitioner\u2019s conversion request by a unanimous vote. On March 5, 1987 TPAF made its written findings. It concluded that petitioner knew at the time she accepted ordinary disability retirement that the benefits would be subject to a workers\u2019 compensation set-off, that she also then knew she was eligible for the early retirement plan. It also found that since petitioner\u2019s ordinary disability retirement was being granted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39 upon the denial of her accidental disability applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tion, it had no obligation to advise her of the early retirement plan option.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We reject petitioner\u2019s procedural argument that TPAF failed to render a decision within 45 days as mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10c. That provision states that the agency shall adopt, reject or modify the AU\u2019s recommendations no later than 45 days after receipt, and if the agency fails to do so, the AU\u2019s decision shall be deemed adopted as the final decision of the agency. Here, the OAL extended the time period for TPAF\u2019s decision until January 8, 1987, and on that date the board unanimously rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommendation. <em>N.J. S.A. </em>52:14B-10d requires that \u201c[a] final decision or order adverse to a party in a contested case shall be in writing or stated in the record.\u201d TPAF\u2019s decision was \u201cstated in the record\u201d on January 8, 1987, within the time period as extended by the OAL. While it is true that for a decision to become effective, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(e) requires that it be delivered or mailed to the parties, the provision contains no explicit time constraint. <em>See Belleville v. Coppla, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 152 (App.Div.1982). TPAF\u2019s written findings were prepared on March 5, 1987 and sent to petitioner\u2019s attorney on March 6, 1987. We are entirely satisfied that the findings supporting the decision were made within a reasonable period of time after TPAF made its decision. <em>See id. </em>Further, there is absolutely no showing that petitioner was in any way prejudiced by the two-month delay. In the circumstances, we see no basis to invalidate its action on this procedural ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We also reject petitioner\u2019s contention that TPAF\u2019s rejection of her conversion request was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. We are sensitive to the fact that petitioner has contributed to TPAF as a participating member for 25 years and are sympathetic to her efforts in securing the most advantageous retirement plan available. Indeed, if we were establishing regulations <em>de novo, </em>we might conclude that retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>plans could be reopened at any time to provide the maximum benefits available to retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">However, our role in reviewing an agency\u2019s decision is narrowly circumscribed. Ordinarily, we will reverse the decision only if it is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or it is not supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-580 (1980); <em>Mayflower Securities v. Bureau of Securities, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 92-93 (1973). Moreover, we are not at liberty to substitute our judgment for that of the administrative agency, <em>see Dougherty v. Human Services Dep\u2019t., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6 (1982), and we must be mindful that a presumption of reasonableness attaches to the agency\u2019s action. <em>Gerba v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirem. Sys. Trustees, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>174, 189 (1980); <em>Boyle v. Riti, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 166 (App.Div.1980). Further, although we consider the ALJ\u2019s Initial decision as part of the record, it is TPAF that \u201cis the primary factfinder\u201d and it is TPAF\u2019s decision that we review. <em>Public Advocate Dep\u2019t v. Public Utilities Bd., </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 507 (App.Div.1983); <em>see also Hiering v. Board of Trustees of Public Employees, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>14, 19 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Applying the appropriate standard of review, we conclude that there is no basis to disturb TPAF\u2019s determination. We have found no statutory or regulatory authority to permit the reopening of a retirement plan once it becomes due and payable. A member is entitled to change an application for retirement at any time before his retirement allowance becomes due and payable; thereafter the retirement shall stand as approved by the board. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>17:8-6.2(a). A member\u2019s retirement allowance becomes \u201cdue and payable\u201d 30 days after the board\u2019s approval of the application. <em>NJ.A.C. </em>17:3-6.3(a). Petitioner\u2019s final retirement selection of the maximum benefits was approved as of March 1, 1984 and thus became \u201cdue and payable\u201d on April 1, 1984. Therefore, her ordinary disability retirement plan became fixed on that date. Implicit in TPAF\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>determination is a respect for the finality of a retirement plan as. found in the regulatory scheme and a proper consideration of the essential need to protect the financial integrity of the pension system from unanticipated conversions at added cost to the fund. <em>See Fiola v. N.J. Treas. Dept., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Notwithstanding the absence of authority in the statute or regulations to reopen, our Supreme Court in <em>Duvin v. State, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>203 (1978), held that an administrative body has the inherent power, in the absence of legislative restriction, to reopen or modify orders previously entered. However, that power must be exercised reasonably and invoked only for good cause shown, and only where the applicant acted with reasonable diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 207 <em>Duvin </em>involved a public employee's request to PERS to convert an early retirement allowance to an accidental disability retirement. The court remanded to PERS for a \u201cgood-cause\u201d hearing as to the employee\u2019s application. <em>Id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Applying <em>Duvin </em>to the facts before us, we are satisfied that petitioner failed to demonstrate \u201cgood cause.\u201d Citing <em>Fiola v. N.J. Treas. Dept., supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, petitioner argues that TPAF\u2019s failure to advise her of the availability of early retirement and that ordinary disability benefits would be off-set by compensation payments when her application for accidental disability benefits was denied constitutes \u201cunfair dealing\u201d and thus \u201cgood cause\u201d under <em>Duvin </em>to reopen and convert to early retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In our view, keeping in mind our narrowly circumscribed scope of review, there is no basis for petitioner\u2019s claim of \u201cunfair dealing.\u201d The sole purpose of TPAF\u2019s December 19, 1983 letter was to advise petitioner of the denial of her application for accidental disability benefits, and the granting of ordinary disability benefits. It focused entirely upon petitioner\u2019s disability application made pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39 and thus had no reason to address early retirement eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66~87. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s claim, TPAF had no \u201clong-standing practice\u201d of advising employees of their right to convert to early retirement when their accidental disability, claim is denied. TPAF\u2019s policy is to offer members who file for a particular retirement plan a better benefit if the member qualifies. Here, the alternative plan paying the highest benefit to petitioner when her accidental benefit claim was denied was the ordinary disability plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">There is ample evidence to support TPAF\u2019s findings that petitioner knew at the time her accidental disability claim was denied that she knew of her entitlement to early retirement benefits, and further that ordinary disability benefits would be off-set by workers\u2019 compensation payments. Petitioner had TPAF\u2019s \u201cbenefit booklet,\u201d which described eligibility for early retirement, before she applied for accidental benefits. She therefore knew, or should have known, of her eligibility for early retirement prior to the time her disability plan became fixed, but elected not to apply for those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Further, the booklet, her application for accidental disability benefits, and TPAF\u2019s letter of February 7, 1984 advising petitioner of the ordinary disability options, all referred to the effect a workers\u2019 compensation award could <em>have on her </em>disability retirement allowance. Thus, petitioner was placed squarely on notice that her election of a disability retirement program may be effected by the consequences of her workers\u2019 compensation ease. Petitioner was represented by counsel both during her appeal from the denial of her accidental disability claim and in her workers\u2019 compensation case. There is no question that, as of the date petitioner\u2019s accidental disability claim was denied, the status of the law was that <em>all </em>public employee disability pensions, including teachers\u2019 disability pensions, were subject to the workers\u2019 compensation set-off, and that age and service pensions <em>were </em>not. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-82.1; <em>N.J.S.A. 84:15-</em>43; <em>Starkey v. Treasury Dep't Pensions Div., supra, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <em>4-5. </em>Both counsel could have advised petitioner that her ordinary disability retirement plan was subject to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation set-off as a matter of law. It was therefore not \u201cunfair\u201d for TPAF to assume that petitioner would know of the off-set without so advising her.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Moreover, while TPAF knew when it denied petitioner\u2019s accidental disability claim that she had a pending workers\u2019 compensation claim, it had no way to evaluate what compensation award, if any, would ultimately be entered. Petitioner and her counsel were clearly in the best position to predict the probable <em>quantum </em>of a set-off the compensation award would have on petitioner\u2019s disability benefits. Thus, petitioner and not TPAF, was best able to choose the most beneficial retirement program after consideration of the potential consequence of a workers\u2019 compensation set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Our dissenting colleague, in asserting that TPAF\u2019s findings are not supportable, focuses on segments of petitioner\u2019s testimony before the ALJ which are essentially self-serving. What the dissent ignores is that we must review the \u201cproofs as a whole\u201d in the record before TPAF to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision is supportable. <em>Mayflower Securities v. Bureau of Securities, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 93. Although petitioner testified she did not know her ordinary disability benefits would be off-set by compensation payments, the benefits booklet, disability application and the February 7, 1984 letter from TPAF regarding the ordinary disability benefit options, all reminded her that the disability allowance could be subject to a reduction. TPAF could conclude from this evidence, as well as the fact that petitioner was represented by counsel in both her disability claim appeal and compensation case, that she knew her ordinary disability benefits were subject to reduction as a matter of law, despite her testimony to the contrary. Indeed, it may well be that petitioner and counsel were of the view at the time petitioner accepted the ordinary disability plan, that the compensation claim, not yet resolved, would not reduce the ordinary disability benefits below what petitioner would receive under early retirement, and thus chose the latter. The point is that the AU\u2019s acceptance of petitioner\u2019s testimony as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>credible is not dispositive; so long as sufficient credible evidence on the record as a whole supports the agency\u2019s factfinding, we must give deference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As we have stated, the only issue before us is whether or not there was such \u201cgood cause shown\u201d under <em>Duvin, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 207, to reopen petitioner\u2019s retirement plan; that is, whether TPAF acted \u201cfairly\u201d in not advising petitioner at the time her application for accidental disability was denied that she had an option to seek early retirement instead of ordinary disability benefits. The dissent\u2019s conclusion that there was no fair dealing here is predicated solely on its \u201cfact-finding\u201d that petitioner did not know ordinary disability benefits would be off-set by compensation payments. By making such a finding, the dissent undercuts the agency\u2019s independent fact-finding role and ignores our scope of review. We conclude that TPAF\u2019s fact-finding and its implied determination that it did not deal unfairly with petitioner, are supportable on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Fiola v. N.J. Treas. Dept., supra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, on which petitioner relies, is distinguishable. <em>Fi\u00f3la </em>was a firefighter who resigned his membership in the Police and Firemens\u2019 Retirement System. Upon his resignation, PFRS notified him that he was eligible to apply for the withdrawal of his contribution to the fund. While the notification also contained a list of various retirement possibilities, no application form was included with the notice other than that pertaining to the withdrawal of contributions. When Fi\u00f3la applied approximately five years later for a deferred net allowance, PFRS denied the request because more than two years had elapsed after his last payment into the fund. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-3(3). We reversed, noting that the denial was tantamount to a \u201c[forfeiture of earned pension rights, drastic penalty which the New Jersey Supreme Court has become increasingly loath to permit[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347-348. In dictum, we further noted that in sending only an application for withdrawal of contributions, PFRS dealt unfairly with Fi\u00f3la since the notice \u201cclearly intended to encourage exercise of the withdrawal option and conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>quent termination of any further pension opportunity____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Here, there is no \u201cconsequent termination of any further pension opportunity____\u201d Indeed, petitioner obtained the highest paying benefit available to her at the time her accidental disability application was denied. Further, TPAF\u2019s dealings with petitioner were never calculated to mislead petitioner into forfeiting other options more beneficial to her. To the contrary, we are convinced that TPAF acted in good faith in processing petitioner\u2019s disability application and that it had no obligation, in the circumstances here present, to advise petitioner of her eligibility for early retirement benefits. We therefore conclude that petitioner has not demonstrated the requisite \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen the ordinary disability plan and to convert to early retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The booklet containing the workers' compensation set-off against all retirement plans, was published in 1973.

I would reverse the final decision of TPAF and remand with directions substantially for the reasons set forth in the initial decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ). I agree with his conclusions that TPAF did not deal fairly with petitioner and that petitioner demonstrated good cause and acted with reasonable diligence within the two-prong test of <em>Duvin v.

The ALJ specifically questioned petitioner about this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">THE COURT: Your thinking was the offset would only be with respect to accidental and not ordinary disability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">THE WITNESS: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Notwithstanding this testimony, which the fact-finder found to be credible, TPAF made a finding of fact to the contrary. As we said in <em>State, Dept. of Health v. Tegnazian, supra, </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 450:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">While the commissioner is not legally bound to follow the AU\u2019s recommendations, he may not brush them aside. Indeed, his failure to deal with them in his decision so as to satisfy a reviewing court that they have been seriously studied may spell the difference between agency action which is or is not found to be supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. This is particularly true where factual issues are the focus of attention and questions as to the weight and credibility of evidence must be treated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">TPAF considered its finding \u201csupported by petitioner\u2019s subsequent correspondence in July 1984 to the Board wherein she advised that she was in receipt of a workers\u2019 compensation award.\u201d Petitioner testified this notice was given to TPAF pursuant to its letter of February 7, 1984, explaining her benefits, which included the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">Please note that if you are receiving any periodic Worker\u2019s Compensation payments after the effective date of your retirement, your retirement allowance <em>could </em>be subject to a reduction. You must advise this office if and when you receive any Worker\u2019s Compensation Benefits. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Contrary to the findings of TPAF, petitioner\u2019s follow-up letter of January 7, 1985 specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>It is my understanding, that my ordinary disability pension is not subject to any offset. If I am not correct in this matter, please change my pension to years in service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">This letter was not answered until September 25, 1985, when TPAF simply advised, \u201cWe cannot change this decision.\u201d As suggested <em>in </em>that letter, petitioner wrote to Anthony Ferrazza, Board Secretary, by letter dated November 7, 1985, to which Mr. Ferrazza, on behalf of TPAF, responded on January 21, 1986 stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">It was the Board\u2019s decision and determination to deny your request. The Board determined that once a retirement has become effective, <em>no change in the type of retirement or payment to he received is possible. </em>The choice is irrevocable <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>18A-.66-47, 58.1). The Board, therefore, declared that you will be continued on retirement under the Ordinary Disability provision of the retirement system. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">This is untrue, TPAF <em>does </em>have power to reopen pension proceedings after a pension has been granted. <em>See Duvin v. State, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 207. The statutory authority cited by TPAF does not support its incorrect statement. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-47 deals with options which a retired member may select and is concerned with rights that may survive the death of the retired member. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-58.I deals with fixing annuity values without reference to sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">TPAF also placed some significance upon its finding that petitioner knew she had over 25 years of service which, of course, is a statement of the obvious. Her knowledge of that fact, however, was not the issue. At issue was whether or not petitioner knew her ordinary disability pension was subject to actuarial reduction based upon a workers\u2019 compensation award, and an early retirement was not subject to such reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">As we stated in <em>Fiola v. N.J. Treas. Dept. </em>193 <em>N.J.Snper. </em>340, 347 (App.Div.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">It is virtually axiomatic that statutory pension provisions are to be liberally construed in favor of public employees and that pensions represent not merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the gratuity of a benevolent governmental employer but rather that they constitute deferred compensation earned by the employee during his years of service. <em>See Masse v. Public Employees Retirem. Sys., </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>252, 259-261 (1981); <em>Uricoli v. Police &amp; Fire Retirem. Sys., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>62, 70-73 (1982). Forfeiture of earned pension rights, therefore, constitutes a drastic penalty which the New Jersey Supreme Court has become increasingly loathe to permit even in the case of employee misconduct unless that penalty has been clearly mandated by the Legislature. <em>See, e.g., Masse v. Public Employees\u2019 Retirem. Sys., supra; Uricoli v. Police &amp; Fire Retirem. Sys., supra; Eyers </em>v. <em>Public Employees Retirem. Sys., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>51 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">I conclude that the findings of TPAF are not supported by substantial, credible evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-580 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that petitioner is not forfeiting any of her pension benefits is incorrect. Her ordinary disability retirement has been reduced to an amount which is less than petitioner was entitled to after over 25 years of service in an early retirement pension, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A.-66-37.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The workers\u2019 compensation award was for permanent disability resulting from job-related injuries. Since the <em>accidental </em>disability allowance sought by petitioner under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39c was also based upon her permanent disability from those injuries, it is logical that it be reduced by the amount of the workers\u2019 compensation award. However, it is not logical that an <em>ordinary </em>disability under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39b will be reduced by a workers\u2019 compensation award since the disability need not be \u201ca direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of [her] regular or assigned duties\u201d as required for accidental disability benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39c, nor even \u201cby accident arising out of and in the course of employment\u201d as required for an award of workers\u2019 compensation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. Moreover, early retirement after 25 years of creditable service pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-37 has nothing to do with injuries or disability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>only service. In my opinion, to the extent that her ordinary disability pension, as reduced, is less than the early retirement for service pension, she is forfeiting that portion of her service pension. I fail to see how the financial integrity of the pension system can be affected by an adjustment to award a member an early retirement pension based upon service to which she is clearly entitled. Refusal to do so represents a forfeiture by this member of $193.05 per month from the amount to which she is entitled by virtue of her service.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In my opinion, TPAF should have exercised its power to reopen petitioner\u2019s pension proceeding even after allowance of an ordinary disability pension. While that power should be invoked only for good cause, petitioner certainly has shown good cause and she acted with reasonable diligence within the reasoning of <em>Duvin v. State, supra. </em>Neither petitioner nor the board knew at the time she applied for her <em>accidental </em>disability pension, nor when she was awarded her <em>ordinary </em>disability pension, what the amount of her workers\u2019 compensation award for permanent disability would be. I agree with TPAF that it could not be held to predict the amount of that ultimate award, nor, conversely, could petitioner, notwithstanding that she was represented by counsel. The same information available to her attorney was available to TPAF, an expert in the field of pension and disability benefits. I see nothing sinister, as suggested by the majority, in petitioner or her attorney seeking the largest amount of pension to which she is legally entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The conclusion by TPAF and the majority begs the question, because the issue is not predicting the ultimate quantum of the workers\u2019 compensation award, but rather the type of pension against which it would be offset The board knew this, petitioner did not. The failure of TPAF to advise petitioner that the ultimate workers\u2019 compensation award would be offset against her ordinary disability pension, but not against her early retirement pension, led the ALJ to conclude that TPAF did not deal fairly with petitioner. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>It seems to me that when we review the findings of fact by an ALJ, who saw and heard the witness testify, as opposed to the findings of fact made by the administrative agency from a review of the record, particularly where the AU has found the agency did not act fairly, great weight should be placed upon the findings of fact by the ALJ. As noted by our Supreme Court in <em>Hackensack v. Winner, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 37, it was anticipated that the findings and recommended dispositions of the AU would carry substantial weight in the final determination made by the administrative agency. This principle should have even greater application where the conclusion of the independent AU is that the agency did not act fairly. Obviously, a conclusion that it did not act fairly is difficult for the agency to accept and its refusal to do so is, in my opinion, suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">I would reverse and remand to TPAF to reopen petitioner\u2019s pension application and convert her pension from ordinary disability retirement to early retirement, making all necessary adjustments so that her early retirement pension be made retroactive to the time her ordinary disability pension began.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-12\">The \"benefits\u201d booldels supplied to petitioner by TPAF erroneously stated that ali pensions could be subject to such a reduction. <em>See </em>pp. 357-58 in the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Her ordinary disability benefit was $908.57 per month. When offset with the workers' compensation award it was reduced to $559.88. It was stipulated that her early retirement benefit would be $752.93 or $193.05 more.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
