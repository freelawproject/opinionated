This case also requires our consideration of whether exhaustion of State administrative and statutory remedies is a prerequisite prior to bringing an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a Federal statute permitting civil actions for alleged deprivations of constitutional or statutory rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The following facts may be gleaned from the pleadings and exhibits filed by both parties in the action below.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Commencing in November of 1980, Elsie Crawford, appellee, a white female, was employed by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (the Commission) as a Secretary III. In this capacity Crawford, among other duties, supervised four other Commission employees and was responsible for editing and correcting the work of 29 professionals and four clerical/secretarial employees. Although her performance had been rated Very Good (less than Exceptional but superior to Good), Crawford desired a lateral transfer to a position with less supervisory duties. Such a position became available on August 6, 1982, when the Commission announced recruitment for a Career Merit System Position Administrative Typist III, Grade 10, in the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Parks &amp; Recreation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>History Division. Crawford received a memorandum from a Commission Personnel Technician alerting her to this announcement and encouraging her to apply for this position. Duly interested, Crawford applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">On September 3, 1982, the Employee Relations and Development Office forwarded 34 applications to Marye Wells, Associate Director of Parks <em>&amp; </em>Recreation, appellant, stating that those 34 applicants were eligible for consideration for the typist position. The list was winnowed to five candidates; Crawford was one of these five candidates. On October 29, 1982, a panel consisting of John M. Walton, Jr., Coordinator of the Commission\u2019s History Division, Frances Hagye, Secretary to the Director of Parks &amp; Recreation, and Bianca Floyd, Manager of the Prince George\u2019s County Black History Project, interviewed four candidates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Crawford was unanimously selected to be the most fully qualified for the position and was listed by the panel as their first choice. Ranked second was Nadine Callahan, a minority (black) applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Sometime within the following week Walton contacted Wells. Walton explained that Hagye had informed him that the subject position was in a deficient class (job category) which had not met the established goals of a Conciliation Agreement entered into by the Commission with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Hagye had further explained to him that Commission Executive Director Thomas H. Countee Jr., appellant, had recently granted a \u201cconcurrence\u201d or exception to the EEOC agreement in this employment category and that the next position should be filled by a minority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Walton queried wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>er this information meant he was compelled to hire a minority candidate. Wells responded that the EEOC agreement indicated that in order for a non-minority candidate to receive the position, that candidate must be clearly superior to the minority candidate. Wells further stated that the final decision for hiring rested with Countee as the Commission\u2019s Executive Director. When asked for his recommendation, Walton indicated that he believed that Crawford, the non-minority candidate, should be offered the position. Wells instructed him to submit a memorandum of the panel\u2019s findings. In the meantime, she intended to investigate further the requirements of the EEOC agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">On October 29, 1982, the panel, through a detailed memorandum authored by John Walton, forwarded its recommendation to Wells. This memorandum provided six reasons why the panel believed that Crawford was \u201cclearly more qualified\u201d than the second-ranked Callahan. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon a review of this memorandum, Wells failed to discern a clear explanation for the panel\u2019s recommendation of Crawford over Callahan. According to Wells, her further questioning of Walton elicited that the only specific difference between the candidates was that Crawford had more work experience and had worked with the Commission. Wells informed Walton that work with the Commission was not an adequate reason for requesting an exception (\u201cconcurrence\u201d) to the EEOC conciliation agreement. Wells next spoke with Hagye. Hagye also indicated that Crawford\u2019s edge was due to her experience with the Commission. When questioned by Wells as to Callahan\u2019s ability to handle the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>position, Hagye assured her that Callahan was a good candidate. Wells told Hagye she would continue her review of the applicants and forward her recommendation to the Commission\u2019s Director of Parks and Recreation, Hugh B. Robey, appellant, for his approval. Wells recontacted Walton and informed him she would rewrite his memorandum and forward it to Robey.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On November 2, 1982, Wells submitted a memorandum recommending that Callahan be hired for the Administrative Typist III position. Wells identified the vacancy as a deficient class (job category) under the EEOC agreement and Callahan as a minority applicant. Robey approved the recommendation and forwarded it to the Employee Relations and Development Office for processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At trial, Crawford testified that she was informed she had been denied the lateral transfer in mid-November. She called Walton to determine why she did not receive the job. Walton explained \u201cit was determined that the last position went to a non-minority on the stipulation that the next two must go to minorities. The position [Crawford] had applied for was the next one.\u201d Walton also stated that \u201c[Crawford] has been rejected based upon race because the job had to go to a minority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">December 15, 1982 Crawford filed an administrative grievance with the Commission and, pursuant to Commission procedures, requested that the matter be submitted to Director of Parks &amp; Recreation Robey and Executive Director Countee for their findings and recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">January 11, 1983 In a \u201cGrievance Response Form\u201d addressed to Commission Executive Director Countee, Director of Parks &amp; Recreation Robey stated that he had communicated with the interview panel and learned that Crawford was the panel\u2019s first choice. He pointed out, however, that the Commission's conciliation agreement with the EEOC mandated the hiring of minorities in \"effected classes.\u201d As the subject position fell within an \"effected class,\u201d Robey concurred with Wells\u2019 recommendation to hire Callahan over Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>January 17, 1983 Crawford noted an appeal to Executive Director Thomas H. Countee Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">February 10, 1983 Crawford filed a declaration in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County alleging the action of the Commission, Countee, Wells and Robey amounted to racial discrimination in violation of her civil rights as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the United States Constitution, and the Maryland Constitution. Additionally, Crawford alleged that the Commission, Countee and Wells had conspired to prevent Crawford from appealing the action because of her race. Crawford sought monetary damages and a lateral transfer to the position of Administrative Typist III.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">February 14, 1983 Commission Executive Director Countee rendered his opinion denying Crawford\u2019s request for transfer. Countee reiterated the facts as previously explained and opined that the \u201cinvestigation of this grievance revealed no misapplication or misinterpretation of Commission rules, regulations or policies or any arbitrary or capricious action taken against Ms. Crawford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">February 17, 1983 Pursuant to the Commission\u2019s Merit System Rules and Regulations, Crawford appealed Countee\u2019s decision to the Merit Service Board of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">March 2, 1983 Appellants filed a demurrer to Crawford\u2019s declaration in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County contending that the action was premature in that administrative grievance procedures were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">March 7, 1983 A hearing was held on appellants\u2019 demurrer before Circuit Court Judge Perry G. Bowen Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">April 8, 1983 Judge Bowen overruled appellants\u2019 demurrer and ordered that the case be set in for trial forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">April 15, 1983 The Merit System Board affirmed Countee\u2019s findings, discerning \u201cno misapplication or misinterpretation of Commission rules, regulations or policies in non-selecting [Crawford] for the vacancy in question because of her race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>A trial on the merits was conducted on June 1 and 2, 1983, before Judge Bowen. In addition to receiving evidence as to the aforementioned facts, Judge Bowen heard the following testimony from Frances Hagye. Regarding Marye Wells\u2019 rewriting of the interview panel\u2019s hiring recommendation memorandum, Ms. Hagye related that she had never heard of such a practice in her sixteen and a-half years with the Commission. The following colloquy transpired later in Ms. Hagye\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Q [By appellee\u2019s counsel:] Do you know any basis, other than the color of Mrs. Crawford\u2019s skin, as to why she wasn\u2019t hired?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">A Well, under the EEOC agreement, and it was a deficient class, I do not know of any other reason. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Q The only reason is the color of her skin, isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">A Under the EEOC agreement, I would have to \u2014 I suppose that would be the reason, but we had a deficient class here, too, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Q Yes, ma\u2019am. But anybody that came in that had the color of her skin couldn\u2019t have the job, isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">A Is that in my bailiwick? I just \u2014 it is a deficient class, so I was under the impression that a class had to be filled by a minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Q Yes, ma\u2019am. But that means on your understanding, in response to my colleague\u2019s questions, no matter how well qualified this woman is, maybe she is the world\u2019s greatest legal stenographer, but with the color of her skin, she couldn\u2019t have been hired for this job, could she?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>A To the best of my knowledge, I suppose not.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Bowen found that:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">(a) there was no evidence in the case that the [appellants] intended to violate [Crawford\u2019s] rights or deliberately conspired or planned or had any program whereby they were depriving anyone of what was supposed to be due them under law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">(b) the only reason why [Crawford] was not granted a transfer to which she was entitled under the rules and regulations and for which she was clearly the best qualified applicant, was that she was white.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">(c) there was no basis for award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">(d) [Crawford] was entitled to $500.00 as award for compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">(e) [Crawford] was entitled to injunctive relief directing her transfer to the position of Administrative Typist III.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">(f) [Crawford] may be entitled to counsel fees and was granted 30 days to file a petition for award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">June 15, 1983 Appellants noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">June 22, 1983 A hearing was held on Crawford\u2019s Petition for Counsel Fees. Crawford\u2019s counsel was awarded $24,971.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">Appellants ask us to consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-16\">I. Whether the trial court was in error in not sustaining the Appellants\u2019 Demurrer to the Declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>based on Plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing the action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">II. Whether the employment decisions of the Appellants, taken to implement the Affirmative Action provisions of a Conciliation Agreement with U.S. E.E.O.C., violated a nonminority applicant\u2019s Constitutional right to equal protection of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">III. Whether the trial court having found that the Appellants\u2019 had no intent to violate the Appellee\u2019s Constitutional or legal rights, erred in granting the injunctive relief and damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">IV. Whether the trial court erred in exercising jurisdiction to adjudicate the Petition for Award of Counsel Fee after the notice of appeal was filed and the appeal was perfected?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Additionally, the State has filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief requesting us to hold that a Maryland court is not obliged to entertain an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when the plaintiff has not exhausted administrative and statutory remedies. In their reply brief, appellants have adopted the arguments raised in the State\u2019s <em>amicus curiae </em>brief. We consider the State\u2019s argument to be an offshoot of Issue I raised by appellants. Accordingly, we shall address the points raised by the State in Part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">I. <em>Failure to Exhaust Administrative and Statutory Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">As detailed in our procedural chronology, Crawford filed her civil action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on February 10, 1983. At that time her appeal to Executive Director Countee was still pending. After Countee denied Crawford\u2019s request for transfer, Crawford proceeded to file an appeal to the Merit System Board on February 17, 1983. The Merit System Board\u2019s decision was not filed until April 15, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Appellants assert that Judge Bowen should have sustained their demurrer at the March 7, 1983 hearing. They reason that at the time her civil suit was filed, Crawford had not exhausted her administrative remedies. The State, in its <em>amicus curiae </em>brief, expresses its concern over the propriety of Maryland courts adjudicating claims based on a Federal statute prior to the exhaustion of State administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The authority to create the Commission\u2019s administrative remedial procedures mentioned by appellants and the State are found in Md.Ann.Code, art. 28, \u00a7 2-112 (1983 Repl.Vol.). The Commission is required to create a Merit System Board to prepare and recommend comprehensive rules and regulations governing the operation of the Merit System for Commission employees. Section 2-112(a)-(c). Pursuant to this statutory mandate, the Commission adopted in 1976 Merit System Rules <em>&amp; </em>Regulations. Chapter 1700 of those Rules governs Adverse Actions, Grievances and Complaints. Section 1730 provides that any Commission employee \u201cwho feels aggrieved for matters relating to his/her job, pay, working conditions, or treatment ... should utilize the Commission Practice, Administrative Grievance Procedure.\u201d Chapter 1740 provides that any Commission employee who has a complaint alleging discrimination based on \u201crace, sex, religion, national origin, color, age, or any other non-merit factor may file a complaint of alleged discrimination using the procedures outlined in the Affirmative Action Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Court of Appeals has stated on numerous occasions that a party must seek redress under statutory procedures established by the Legislature prior to invoking the ordinary general jurisdiction of the courts. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 283-84, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980) (and cases cited therein), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981). Reasons cited for this requirement include: (1) deference to the expertise of administrative agencies; (2) compliance with the Legislature\u2019s view that certain claims can best be han<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>died initially by an administrative agency; and (3) abstention from deciding issues which may be resolved by the provided administrative remedy. <em>Id., </em>288 Md. at 284, 418 A.2d 1155 <em>(citing Gingell v. County Commissioner, </em>249 Md. 374, 376-77, 239 A.2d 903 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">There are, however, certain exceptions to the-exhaustion requirement, which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">1. When the legislative body has indicated an intention that exhaustion of administrative remedies was not a precondition to the institution of normal judicial action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">2. when there is a direct attack, constitutional or otherwise, upon the power or authority (including whether it was validly enacted) of the legislative body to pass the legislation from which relief is sought, as contrasted with a constitutional or other type issue that goes to the application of a general statute to a particular situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">3. when an agency requires a party to follow, in a manner and to a degree that is significant, an unauthorized procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">4. where the administrative agency cannot provide to any substantial degree a remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">5. when the object of, as well as the issues presented by, a judicial proceeding only tangentially or incidentally concern matters which the administrative agency was legislatively created to solve, and do not, in any meaningful way, call for or involve applications of its expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\"><em>Id., </em>288 Md. at 284-85, 418 A.2d 1155 (citations omitted). To this list of five, we shall add a sixth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">In <em>Patsy v. Board of Regents of the State of Florida, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982), the Supreme Court expressly held that \u201cexhaustion of State remedies should not be required as a prerequisite to bringing an action pursuant to \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 102 S.Ct. at 2568. The Court did not treat the issue as one of first impression. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Rather, the <em>Patsy </em>decision was an affirmation of the principles set out in <em>McNeese v. Board of Education, </em>373 U.S. 668, 671-72, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1435, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963). Speaking through Justice Douglas, the <em>McNeese </em>Court stated that \u201crelief under [\u00a7 1983] may not be defeated because relief was not first sought under state law which provided a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 83 S.Ct. at 1435. This is so because \u201c[t]he federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Several state courts have interpreted the holding in <em>Patsy </em>as permitting \u00a7 1983 actions in state courts prior to the exhaustion of state administrative remedies. <em>Logan v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit District, </em>136 Cal.App.3d 116, 124, 185 Cal.Rptr. 878, 883 (1982); <em>Jackson v. Inhabitants of Town of Searsport, </em>456 A.2d 852, 857 n. 20 (Me.) (dicta), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 95, 78 L.Ed.2d 101 (1983); <em>Stratos v. Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 439 N.E.2d 778, 783 (1982); <em>Montalvo v. Consolidated Edison Company of New York, </em>92 A.D.2d 389, 460 N.Y. S.2d 784, 793 (N.Y.1983); <em>Broadway &amp; 67th Street Corporation v. City of New York, </em>116 Misc.2d 217, 455 N.Y.S.2d 347, 353 (N.Y.Sup.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We agree with the reasoning of these cases and, therefore, hold that Crawford was not required to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by the Commission prior to instituting her \u00a7 1983 action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">We now turn to the State\u2019s argument regarding the exercise of jurisdiction by Maryland courts to hear actions brought under \u00a7 1983. In <em>DeBleecker v. Montgomery County, </em>48 Md.App. 455, 427 A.2d 1075 (1981), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>292 Md. 498, 438 A.2d 1348 (1982), we examined this issue and aligned Maryland with other states which hold that state courts have concurrent authority with federal courts to adjudicate civil rights actions brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 48 Md.App. at 458-59, 427 A.2d 1075. The State does not dispute this. Instead, the State urges us to recognize that <em>\u201ca </em>state court has discretion to decline to entertain a Federal cause of action if an otherwise \u2018valid excuse\u2019<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> exists.\u201d In other words, the State wishes us to declare that the State courts may refuse to hear actions such as those brought by Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The short answer to the State\u2019s argument is that the circuit court <em>could </em>properly exercise its discretion and entertain jurisdiction of Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See, DeBleecker v. Montgomery County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">II. <em>Affirmative Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As of this date, the United States Supreme Court has handed down three decisions dealing with race-conscious affirmative action: <em>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978); <em>United Steel Workers of America v. Weber, </em>443 U.S. 193, 99 S.Ct. 2721, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979); <em>Fullilove v. Klutznick, </em>448 U.S. 448, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (1980). None of these rulings has entirely resolved this paradoxical issue. Each case is restricted to an examination of a special program<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and none addresses \u201cthe basic constitutional issue of the standard of review that should be employed to determine the compatability of a. benign classification with the equal protection guarantee.\u201d Nowak, Rotunda &amp; Young, <em>Constitutional Law </em>665 (2d ed. 1983). One legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>scholar has observed, with respect to the <em>Bakke </em>opinions, that the Court\u2019s \u201cambivalent posture\u201d is a \u201cwise and politic resolution to an exceedingly difficult societal problem.\u201d P. Mishkin, <em>The Uses of Ambivalence: Reflections on the Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Affirmative Action, </em>131 U.Pa.L.Rev. 907, 929 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cambivalent posture\u201d in these three cases, we believe it is possible to extrapolate certain general precepts which apply to all affirmative action plans. <em>Bakke </em>teaches us, in part, that the Constitution forbids \u201cpreferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin,\u201d 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2757 (separate opinion by Powell, J.). In that case, it was also observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">The difficulty of the issue presented \u2014 whether Government may use race-conscious programs to redress the continuing effects of past discrimination \u2014 and the mature consideration which each of our Brethren has brought to us have resulted in many opinions, no single one speaking for the Court. But this should not and must not mask the central meaning of today\u2019s opinions: Government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice, at least when appropriate findings have been made by judicial, legislative or administrative bodies with competence to act in this area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">438 U.S. at 324-25, 98 S.Ct. at 2765-66 (Brennan, White, Marshall &amp; Blackmun, JJ. concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><em>Weber </em>and <em>Fullilove </em>suggest that affirmative action plans which produce discrimination against non-minorities solely on the basis of race, sex or national origin are permissible where strict guidelines and safeguards are established and obeyed. <em>Weber, </em>443 U.S. at 208-09, 99 S.Ct. at 2729-30; <em>Fullilove, </em>448 U.S. at 487-90, 100 S.Ct. at 2779-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>In <em>United Steel Workers of America v. Weber, supra, </em>the High Court examined in the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an affirmative action plan which provided for a degree of racial preference. The United Steel Workers and Kaiser Aluminum Chemical Corporation had voluntarily entered into a collective bargaining agreement which contained, among other things, an affirmative action plan designed to eliminate racial imbalance in what was at the time an almost exclusively white craft-workforce. The plan reserved 50% of the openings in craft-training programs for black employees until the percentage of black craft-workers was commensurate with the percentage of blacks in the local labor force. Weber, a white production worker, filed suit challenging the program after he was passed over for the training program in favor of a less senior black employee. . Weber alleged that the program had resulted in junior black employees receiving preference over similarly situated white employees in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The <em>Weber </em>Court, speaking through Justice Brennan, held that Title VII did not forbid private employees and unions from \u201cvoluntarily agreeing upon bona fide affirmative action plans that accord racial preference in the manner and for the purpose provided\u201d in the plan that was before the Court. 443 U.S. at 200, 99 S.Ct. at 2726. This particular plan did not run afoul of Title VII because of the temporary duration of the plan, the remedial purpose of breaking down the traditional patterns of racial segregation in job classifications, the voluntary nature of the plan, and the fact that the plan did not unnecessarily trammel the interests of white workers because the plan did not \u201ccreate an absolute bar to the advancement of white employees [because] half of those trained in the program will be white.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208-09, 99 S.Ct. at 2729-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>While the <em>Weber </em>Court did not expressly state that strict adherence to the affirmative action plan was required, it follows from the Court\u2019s reasoning that an affirmative action plan which is not complied with is, in fact, no plan at all. Manifestly, the Supreme Court could not have held the <em>Weber </em>affirmative action program permissible had the employers failed to abide by the strict hiring requirements of the program. For it is the affirmative action plan and its faithful execution which sanctifies otherwise impermissible discriminatory employment practices. Therefore, employment practices which depart from the plan\u2019s guidelines lose the sanctification provided by a valid affirmative action program.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In <em>Weber, </em>the Supreme Court declined to draw \u201cthe line of demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative action plans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 99 S.Ct. at 2729. Similarly, we need not establish that line nor decide the validity of the Commission\u2019s affirmative action plan under the United States Constitution, Title VII or Md.Ann.Code, art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 14-18 (1979 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.), Maryland\u2019s analogue to Title VII. Rather, we perceive the appropriate issue in this case to be whether Crawford\u2019s rights were violated due to the discrimination which resulted from appellants\u2019 failure to adhere correctly to the EEOC conciliation agreement \u2014 that is, failure to follow the Commission\u2019s affirmative action plan through use of the concurrence procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\n<em>The Case Sub Judice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Appellants assert, as they did below, that all employment decisions regarding Crawford\u2019s transfer were guided by their attempt to comply with the affirmative action provisions of the conciliation agreement entered into by the Commission with the EEOC. The conciliation agreement was entered into by the Commission in August 1977 to resolve a complaint filed against it under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The agreement expressly provided that it \u201cdoes not constitute an admission by the [Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>sion] of any violation of Title YII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964____\u201d The Commission agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">all hiring, promotion practices and other terms and conditions of employment shall be maintained and conducted in a manner which does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, religion or national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended[;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVK\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">that it shall make every good faith effort to employ minority group individuals where practicable in each department in all job categories as outlined in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission State and local Government Information forms (EEO-4) so that by 1980, their representation shall closely approximate, but not be limited to, their representation in the [Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area] workforce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">An EEOC investigation in July 1980 determined that the Commission had not fully complied with the conciliation agreement. Thus, the conciliation agreement was further extended for an additional period of four years commencing from December 16, 1980. In that extension the Commission agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[U]ntil the goals for black/minority hiring and promotions mutually agreed upon by the Commission and Respondent on December 15, 1980, are met, <em>one black/minority applicant shall be hired or promoted for each non-minority applicant who is hired or promoted for vacant positions for all job categories pursuant to the Respondent\u2019s internal policies and procedures, </em>submitted to the Commission under Reporting, Section 12 of the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">(emphasis supplied). The Commission\u2019s internal hiring policies and procedures may be gleaned from the trial testimony of its Executive Director, Thomas H. Countee Jr. First, an interview panel makes its hiring recommendation to the appropriate department head. If the position is in a deficient class and the selected candidate is a male or a non-mi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>nority, the department head must submit a memorandum to the Executive Director indicating \u201cclearly and in sufficient fashion why the department head feels the candidate is a clearly superior candidate.\u201d This procedure is known, in Commission vernacular, as requesting a \u201cconcurrence.\u201d The Executive Director\u2019s decision may be reviewed by the County Planning Board Chairman. An exhibit introduced into evidence by the Commission revealed that the Executive Director had granted 24 out of 26 requests for concurrence between December 1980 and September 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">This procedure was <em>not </em>followed in this case. While not following their own personnel procedures, appellants assert that their actions were compelled by the EEOC agreement. Appellants fervently believe that the facts in this case are analogous to those presented in <em>United Steel Workers v. Weber, supra. </em>We cannot agree. The plan approved in <em>Weber </em>was followed scrupulously. <em>See, </em>443 U.S. at 198-99, 99 S.Ct. at 2724-25. The Commission cannot boast compliance with its plan. Thus, assuming arguendo that the plan is constitutionally sound, the Commission should not be able to use it as a shield from liability for any discriminatory acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Commission\u2019s hiring procedures provided for approval or \u201cconcurrence\u201d from the Executive Director when the Commission sought to employ a clearly more qualified non-minority over a minority candidate. Yet, Judge Bowen observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">You have someone here, someone who was clearly superior and better qualified, but no concurrence was asked for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">The only thing I care about is that nobody asked for concurrence for this candidate although she was in the exact position where she needed one if you were going to comply with [the EEOC agreement], ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Testifying for the Commission, Wells provided further evidence of the Commission\u2019s failure to comply with its own procedures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">I found that we had, that the executive director had recently granted two exceptions to our department and that w\u00e9 had stated that the very next position must be filled by a minority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">I looked at what we needed in terms of the position. I looked at the qualifications of both the applicants. I found that, yes, indeed, Mrs. Crawford did have outstanding qualifications. I looked at the fact, also, that the executive director had stated that the next position filled in that classification would have to be filled by a minority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">I also take into consideration the possibility of asking the executive director for a further exception. We had, I had had an experience with that before where I had asked that \u2014 we had tried to find a minority for a position that had been designated as a minority position. After three unsuccessful advertisements, which took about six months, we were able to fill the position. At this point I just felt that I was kind of in a Catch-22. I needed to get the job filled, I was looking at the directive of the executive director.<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> I looked at the qualifications, I looked at the needs of the job, and because of business necessity, I made a recommendation that Mrs. Callahan be chosen to fill the position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Wells\u2019 understanding of the Executive Director\u2019s directive that the next position must go to a minority does not justify her failure to follow the Commission\u2019s procedures by failing to request a concurrence for Crawford\u2019s hiring. On cross-examination, Wells admitted that she had never met with Crawford and had never taken the opportunity to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>whether Crawford possessed the necessary skills and was the clearly superior candidate. This demonstrates that Wells\u2019 recommendation was based solely on her predisposition to hire a minority applicant. Moreover, Frances Hagye\u2019s testimony regarding the extraordinary practice of rewriting an interview panel\u2019s recommendation memorandum serves as additional evidence that the Commission was not adhering to the affirmative action plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">During closing arguments, appellants\u2019 counsel opined, \u201cThe facts of this case will have to show that we violated the plan and did not give her the position.\u201d In the instant case, ample evidence was adduced to permit Judge Bowen to find that the Commission misapplied its own procedures by hiring a minority applicant over a \u201cclearly more qualified\u201d non-minority applicant for the singular reason of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">In sum, appellants cannot find succor in any of the relevant Supreme Court cases. In none of those cases did the Court sanction affirmative action plans which created an absolute bar to the employment of non-minority employees. In <em>Bakke, </em>Justice Powell stated that race alone may not be the sole factor in a selection process. 438 U.S. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2757. The Commission\u2019s concurrence procedure reflects this concept by allowing a \u201cclearly more qualified\u201d non-minority candidate an equal opportunity for each available employment position. The Commission\u2019s failure to follow that concurrence procedure here runs afoul of the letter and spirit of the policy\u2019s purpose to provide equal or near equal consideration. Although the minority candidate was qualified, the trial judge could and did find, in effect, that Crawford, who had superior qualifications, was \u201cforeclosed from all consideration ... simply because [she] was not the right color....\u201d <em>Bakke, </em>438 U.S. at 318, 98 S.Ct. at 2762 (separate opinion by Powell, J.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>We do not here today criticize or condemn affirmative action plans generally or the Commission\u2019s plan specifically. We emphasize that our holding neither approves nor disapproves the constitutionality of the Commission\u2019s plan. </em>Assuming for the sake of argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>plan is constitutional, we hold that Judge Bowen, as trier of the facts, could find that the affirmative action plan was incorrectly applied with regard to Crawford because the appellants failed to adhere to the Commission\u2019s own rules. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">III. <em>Injunctive Relief and Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"AfW\">Title VII provides a vehicle for recovering damages under \u00a7 1983 for civil rights violations arising out of unlawful employment practices. Title YII states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aetm\">If the court finds that the respondent <em>has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice </em>charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">At the outset of his oral opinion, Judge Bowen said: Let me say at the beginning of these remarks that the court finds no evidence in this case that anybody connected with the Park and Planning Commission intended to do any violations to anybody\u2019s rights or deliberately conspired or planned or had any program whereby they were depriving anyone of what was supposed to be due them under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Seizing upon these prefatory extemporaneous remarks, appellants posit that in the absence of a finding of intent to violate Crawford\u2019s rights, Judge Bowen erroneously granted appellee injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Appellants have misconstrued the trial judge\u2019s comments. While Judge Bowen may have found the appellants did not connive to deny Crawford the transfer because of her race, the point remained that appellants performed intentional acts which they knew would deny Crawford the transfer solely because of her race. Associate Director Wells testified that she was aware of the candidates\u2019 races. Her testimony made clear that she intentionally recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>hiring a minority applicant over a non-minority applicant in a misconceived effort to comply with the conciliation agreement. Executive Director Countee\u2019s grievance reply approved of Wells\u2019 handling of the matter. In that reply memorandum, Countee wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">Reviewing the situation,. Ms. Wells determined that the position was in an EEOC category, (Category 6 clerical) targeted for specific minority hiring goals and that the second choice of the panel was a highly qualified minority applicant. Ms. Wells also knew that just prior to this hiring/promotion opportunity on September 26, 1982, Mr. Countee had concurred in a non-minority selection in this category with the understanding that the Department of Parks and Recreation make every effort to hire a minority in the next vacancy in this category. At the time of the Administrative Typist advertisement the Parks and Recreation Department was still deficient in Category 6 minority employees. <em>Accordingly, the provisions of the Conciliation Agreement Extension especially the Hiring and Promotion Procedures, provide the compelling reason for the Department to select a highly qualified minority applicant for this position.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">(Emphasis added.) Countee\u2019s memorandum underscores the Commission\u2019s intentional denial of Crawford\u2019s transfer solely due to her race.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">For a plaintiff in a Title VII suit to prove <em>intentional </em>discrimination, the plaintiff must show that the discrimination was \u201cnot accidental, inadvertent or heedless or that it arises from a mistake.\u201d <em>Bradington v. International Business Machines Corp., </em>360 F.Supp. 845, 853 (D.Md. 1973), <em>aff'd, </em>492 F.2d 1240 (4th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Here, Crawford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>proved that appellants\u2019 discriminatory act with respect to her was deliberate and purposeful and not accidental or inadvertent. The fact that appellants may have acted in good faith is of no moment. In <em>Albermarle Paper Company v. Moody, </em>422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975), the Supreme Court held that an employer\u2019s lack of bad faith did not preclude the plaintiff\u2019s recovery of back pay in a Title VII action. \u201cTitle VII is not concerned with the employer\u2019s \u2018good intent or absence of discriminatory intent\u2019 for \u2018Congress directed the thrust of the Act to the <em>consequences </em>of employment practices, not simply the motivation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 95 S.Ct. at 2373 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">At trial, Crawford proved the intentional nature of appellants\u2019 acts. Accordingly, Judge Bowen did not err in awarding her injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">IV. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">June 13, 1983 Judge Bowen enjoined appellants to transfer Crawford to the position she sought and entered judgment in favor of Crawford in the sum of $500. Additionally Judge Bowen granted Crawford 30 days to submit a petition for counsel fees<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">June 15, 1983 Judge Bowen\u2019s Order was filed. Appellants noted an appeal from \u201cthe final judgment and Order filed in this case on the 15th day of June, 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atq\">June 22, 1983 The trial court ordered that judgment for Crawford\u2019s counsel be entered in the sum of $24,971.10 for attorney\u2019s fees. At this hearing, appellants asserted that the court was divested of jurisdiction due to the filing of an appeal to the June 15th Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>June 27, 1983 Judge Bowen reaffirmed his June 22nd Order for attorney\u2019s fees and ordered that Crawford be placed in the new job by July 11, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Interestingly, both parties advance jurisdictional defects. Appellants renew their position that Judge Bowen was without jurisdiction to rule on Crawford\u2019s prayer for counsel fees due to their pending appeal on the case\u2019s merits. On the other hand, Crawford initially avers that this Court lacks jurisdiction because appellants did not appeal from a final order, and further argues that appellants have failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of attorney\u2019s fees because appellants\u2019 June 15, 1983 notation of appeal did not encompass the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">(a) <em>Trial Court\u2019s Jurisdiction to Award Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">We discern no error in Judge Bowen\u2019s election to rule on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees after appellants\u2019 appeal had been noted. At the June 22 hearing, the trial judge acknowledged appellants\u2019 objection to a ruling on counsel fees, but expressed his belief that it was wiser to award attorney\u2019s fees at the time to avoid multiple appeals and to allow an appellate court to review that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">The Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca request for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action.\u201d <em>White v. New Hampshire Dep\u2019t of Employment Security, </em>455 U.S. 445, 451, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 1166, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982) (footnote omitted). Therefore, we conclude that Judge Bowen had proper jurisdiction on the collateral matter of attorney\u2019s fees after appellants had appealed the Order filed June 15, 1983. <em>See also Bittner v. Sadoff &amp; Rudoy Industries, </em>728 F.2d 820, 52 U.S.L.W. 2480 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>(b) <em>This Court\u2019s Jurisdiction on the Merits of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Aside from the fact that the judgment of June 15, 1983 awarded damages, an injunction issued. To the extent that the Order was arguably interlocutory, it is clear that an immediate appeal may be filed from \u201c[a]n order ... [gjranting or dissolving an injunction____\u201d Md.Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-303(c)(l). Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">(c) <em>This Court\u2019s Jurisdiction to Entertain Appellants\u2019 Argument on Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In the June 13th Order, Judge Bowen \u201cordered, that plaintiff is granted thirty (30) days from the date of this Order to submit a petition for counsel fees.... \u201d Thus, the trial judge explicitly retained jurisdiction over the issue of attorney\u2019s fees for a period of at least 30 days. The noting of an appeal divests the trial court only on issues which are appealed. <em>Link v. Link, </em>35 Md.App. 684, 686, 371 A.2d 1146 (1977) (and cases cited therein). In that appellants failed to appeal from the trial court\u2019s Orders of June 22 and June 27, they have failed to preserve the issue of attorney\u2019s fees for appellate review. <em>See, </em>Maryland Rule 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We dismiss any argument that appellants\u2019 June 15th notation of appeal included the court\u2019s impending award of attorney\u2019s fees. Manifestly, no appeal could be taken on an issue which had yet to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Even assuming arguendo that the issue were properly before us, we would uphold the trial court\u2019s awarding of attorney\u2019s fees and the amount of fees awarded. Memoranda in favor and in opposition to the amount of fees to be awarded were filed by trial counsel. Both parties had an opportunity to argue their views to the trial judge. Finally, Judge Bowen meticulously articulated his method of arriving at the proper award for this case by touching on each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the twelve considerations outlined in the case of <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial judge weighed each consideration and concluded that five of the factors merited the award of a modest bonus to the basic fee for the case. Judge Bowen also added the court costs expended by Crawford\u2019s counsel. Another fact which exemplified the careful approach taken by the trial judge was that the award ordered was <em>less </em>than the amount requested by Crawford\u2019s counsel. Accordingly, if the issue had been presented for appellate review, we would hold that Judge Bowen did not abuse his discretion in determining the counsel fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-11\">.
