While Hackney was held at gunpoint in the downstairs den, Hughes was led upstairs to his bedroom and forced to open a safe. He was then taken back downstairs, where he and Hackney had their hands bound behind their backs and were required to lie down next to each other in prone position. Their heads were covered with various bedding items \u2014 pillow, sheets, and sleeping bags. Eventually, someone shot Ms. Hackney in the head five times. It is not clear whether any of those shots were intended for Hughes. The three men then left, taking with them cash, drugs, and other valuable items.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Hughes identified both Emmit Brown, whom he knew, and appellant as two of the armed intruders. Brown, arrested within hours, also implicated appellant and a warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Six weeks after this event, appellant was arrested in New Jersey in connection with an armed robbery which occurred in that State. He gave the New Jersey police a false name and address. It was not until late 1982 that the Maryland authorities discovered his whereabouts and ultimately obtained custody of him. He was brought to trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and, on May 4, 1983, was convicted of first degree murder, two counts of armed robbery, and two counts of using a handgun in a crime of violence. From the judgments entered upon those convictions, appellant brings this appeal, complaining that (1) the court erred in refusing to permit defense counsel to inspect the grand jury testimony of Detective Barry Collier after Collier\u2019s in-court testimony on direct examination, and (2) the court erred in admitting evidence and instructing the jury upon appellant\u2019s use of a false name and address in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Coupled with appellant\u2019s appeal is the State\u2019s cross-appeal with respect to the sentence imposed. The State moved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>court to impose a mandatory twenty-five year sentence without possibility of parole, pursuant to Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c), and complains of the court\u2019s refusal to invoke that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Although we agree, and indeed the State concedes, that the court erred in rejecting counsel\u2019s request to inspect Collier\u2019s grand jury testimony, we shall nevertheless affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">(1) <em>Grand Jury Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The circumstances surrounding the shooting of Ms. Hackney were somewhat unusual and were by no means beyond dispute. To some extent, they suggested the possibility that Hughes may have shot his fiancee, and that, indeed, was argued to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">There was considerable evidence that Hughes was involved in drug trafficking. He admitted to having two or more pounds of marijuana in his home at the time of the shooting, as well as to having dealt in that product with Emmit Brown in the past. According to Hughes, when Brown knocked on the door at 2:30 in the morning, Ms. Hackney was vacuum cleaning the living room, and he was in the process of shampooing his hair. Hughes\u2019s sister and her nine-year old daughter were asleep in one of the bedrooms; yet, despite the vacuum cleaner, the shampooing, the movement throughout the house by the three intruders, and the firing of five shots, they were not awakened. Finally, ballistics analyses established that the bullets that killed Ms. Hackney were fired from either a .38 caliber or .357 magnum pistol. Hughes admitted to owning and having in his house both a .38 caliber and a .357 magnum pistol, that he claimed the intruders took. Although he denied having fired any guns on the day in question, a neutron activation analysis revealed traces of barium and antimony on both of his hands, those materials being indicative of gunshot residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">On the other hand, depending upon the credibility of two State\u2019s witnesses, the case against appellant was a strong one. Hughes positively identified appellant as one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>three intruders, the one who accompanied Hughes upstairs to open the safe and who removed certain jewelry from Ms. Hackney before she was shot. Douglas Dawkins, an acquaintance of appellant for some four or five years, testified that he had seen appellant in New Jersey in 1981, and that appellant had admitted not only the robbery but to shooting \u201cthe female.\u201d According to Dawkins, appellant stated that he was with two other men, both named Brown, and that he shot the woman five or six times because she knew him. The story relayed by Dawkins, though brief, corroborated some of the details testified to by Hughes. In addition, photographs of the crime scene taken by the police showed the position and condition of Ms. Hackney\u2019s body as Hughes described it, <em>i.e., </em>her hands were tied with plastic cord and she was covered with various items of bedding.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">A number of police officers testified, although they added little to the basic story related by Hughes. Essentially, they described the crime scene and identified certain items of evidence collected by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">On March 2, 1983 \u2014 two months before trial \u2014 appellant asked the court to direct the State to \u201ctranscribe the Grand Jury testimony of all witnesses who will be called to testify at the trial.\u201d No request was made, at that time, to inspect any such testimony. The State opposed the motion on the ground that the only purpose for a transcription would be to provide access to appellant and that appellant had failed to establish a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for such access. The court (Judge Raker) granted the motion. On April 17, 1983, it ordered that all grand jury proceedings in the case be transcribed prior to May 2, 1983, and that the cost of the transcription be paid by the public defender, a condition to which the public defender had agreed. Pursuant to that order, the grand jury testimony of Detective Barry Collier was transcribed and was in the possession of the prosecutor at time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Collier was one of five police officers who investigated the shooting; he was the last of the five to testify at trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>On direct examination he: (1) confirmed that certain photographs which had already been admitted into evidence without objection accurately depicted the scene of the crime as he had observed it, (2) stated that he had assisted Detective Arnold in collecting evidence at the scene, (3) stated that he was present at the autopsy performed on Ms. Hackney, and identified certain items of clothing and bullet fragments removed from her at that time, all of which were admitted into evidence without objection, and (4) identified a .25 caliber pistol taken from Emmit Brown at the time of his arrest, the pistol having previously been placed into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On cross-examination, Collier acknowledged that he was \u201cone of the chief investigators\u201d in the case and that his duties included the gathering of evidence and the delivery of certain items to the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for analysis. He identified, from a list shown him by defense counsel, the items taken to that agency, including the victim\u2019s clothing, bullets and bullet fragments, carpet samples, a blanket and a pillow, the handgun taken from Emmit Brown, and the neutron analysis kit containing the swabbings from Hughes\u2019s hands. The items themselves had already been placed into evidence and identified by the expert witness from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Finally, Collier acknowledged having testified before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">When nearly finished with cross-examination of Detective Collier, counsel, for the first time, asked to see his grand jury testimony, calling the court\u2019s attention to Judge Raker\u2019s pre-trial order. The court, however, summarily and, in our judgment, erroneously denied the request. The colloquy following counsel\u2019s request was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t need a bench conference to deal with this. We can take a lunch recess. Have you finished cross-examining him?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">MS. DUROVIC [Defense Counsel]: Well, Your Honor, I can\u2019t make that determination because I have to first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>request from the Court what I\u2019d like, which is, I\u2019d like a copy of his grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know where his grand jury testimony is. You know as well as I do that they don\u2019t get that transcribed right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">MS. DUROVIC: Judge Raker ordered that it be transcribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">MR. DEAN [State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, could we have arguments at the bench. I think it would be more appropriate at the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">THE COURT: Well does the bench transcribe?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">MS. DUROVIC: Your Honor, Judge Raker ordered\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">THE COURT: Wait a minute. You already said that</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">once. I don\u2019t need to hear that again.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">MS. DUROVIC: I don\u2019t know, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">THE COURT: All right. Well I don\u2019t have anything to produce because no one knows where it is. So, do you have any other questions of him?</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">MS. DUROVIC: Your Honor, we would ask that the Court inquire of the State as to whether, in fact, the grand jury transcripts have been transcribed in compliance with Judge Raker\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to ask him that right now. Do you [apparently referring to the prosecutor] have any other questions of this witness?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">Throughout this colloquy, the prosecutor, <em>who had the grand jury transcript in his possession, </em>inexplicably remained mute, thereby permitting the court to labor under the impression that the transcript was not available. Responding to the court\u2019s invitation, the prosecutor then asked a few more questions on redirect, following which defense counsel engaged in brief recross examination. The court then excused the jury for lunch, and the conversation regarding the grand jury transcripts continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: ...</p>\n<p id=\"b132-18\">Ms. Durovic, you want to make a big point out of Judge Raker\u2019s order in connection with this matter, in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>grand jury proceedings. There\u2019s a docket entry in here number 56 that says, \u2018Hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for appropriate relief, Raker, J., granted. Proceedings of grand jury not already transcribed are to be transcribed. Office of public defender to pay cost of transcript. Court denies defendant access to transcript. Order to be submitted.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u2018On April 18th, 1983 your order of Court, Raker, J., that expense for transcribing portion of the grand jury proceeding shall be paid for by the public defender\u2019s office file\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Now, I don\u2019t know where those transcripts are but I do object to the fact that you make a big point about it in front of the jury when it\u2019s obviously the public defender\u2019s office responsibility to see that they are transcribed and paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">MS. DUROVIC: Your Honor, excuse me.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">THE COURT: Now, I don\u2019t want to hear anything more about this.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">MS. DUROVIC: Your Honor, let me just make this clear for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t want to hear anything more.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">MS. DUROVIC: The state was\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">THE COURT: Ms. Durovic, I said I don\u2019t want to hear anything more about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">MS. DUROVIC: Your Honor, I\u2019ve got to make a record.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">THE COURT: Listen, can you hear? You just keep quiet a minute. You\u2019re trying to embarrass the Court in front of the jury. Now, I don\u2019t know whether the public defender\u2019s office made arrangements to get that transcribing done. If they didn\u2019t, you should make sure that it was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">The transcript of the proceedings is not here with the jacket and I object to the fact that you keep insisting upon the fact that I should have this transcript. I had nothing to do with the transcript, if it were going to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>prepared it was the responsibility of your office to see that it got prepared and I don\u2019t want to hear anything more about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">At that point, the prosecutor finally advised the court that, in accordance with Judge Raker\u2019s order, he had directed the grand jury stenographer to prepare a transcript of the testimony taken before the grand jury, and that he had in fact received and had available the transcript of Detective Collier\u2019s testimony. He nevertheless, for the first time at trial, formally objected to defense counsel having access to it because \u201cthere\u2019s no showing of a particularized need for the transcripts.\u201d In response, counsel called the court\u2019s attention to <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 631, 421 A.2d 85 (1980), <em>aff'd </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981), to which the court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, there\u2019s already an order in the Court that says you\u2019re not to have that.\u201d That ended the discussion on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">At the time of trial in this case, it was clear from <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), and <em>Leonard v. State, supra, </em>that once a State\u2019s witness has testified on direct examination, defense counsel is entitled to inspect any prior written statement given by the witness that is relevant to his testimony and that is available, for possible use in cross-examination. That right of inspection, it was said in both <em>Carr </em>and <em>Leonard, </em>is not limited either by the pre-trial discovery rules or to statements that are merely exculpatory in nature. The purpose of the inspection is for counsel to determine whether the earlier statement is in any material way inconsistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony and so may be used to impeach the credibility of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Neither <em>Carr </em>nor <em>Leonard </em>dealt specifically with grand jury testimony, although in <em>Erman v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 605, 618, 434 A.2d 1030 (1981), <em>cert. denied </em>456 U.S. 908, 102 S.Ct. 1756, 72 L.Ed.2d 165 (1982), we suggested (without deciding) that, on the basis of a statement in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Strathen, </em>287 Md. 111, 117, 411 A.2d 102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>(1980), the principle announced in <em>Carr </em>and <em>Leonard </em>may-well apply to such testimony. That suggestion was made again in <em>Gillis v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 691, 695, 456 A.2d 89, <em>cert. denied </em>296 Md. 172 (1983), decided three months before the trial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">All doubt about the matter was put to rest by <em>Jones v. State, </em>297 Md. 7, 464 A.2d 977 (1983), decided shortly after the trial here. In <em>Jones, </em>the Court of Appeals held explicitly that \u201cafter a State\u2019s witness has testified on direct examination, a defendant is entitled to inspect [that witness\u2019s] grand jury testimony for cross-examination purposes without any requirement that he show any other need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 464 A.2d 977. That ruling, said the Court in addressing the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration, was based on \u201ccommon law principles of procedure and evidence\u201d and did <em>not </em>represent a change in the law. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 464 A.2d 977. It merely \u201cexplained the \u2018particularized need\u2019 referred to in <em>Strathen.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Under <em>Jones, </em>therefore, if not under <em>Carr, Leonard, Erman, </em>and <em>Gillis, </em>it is clear that appellant was entitled to inspect Detective Collier\u2019s grand jury testimony, which had been transcribed and was available, and that the court erred in refusing to permit that inspection. The question raised by the State is whether, under the circumstances of this case, that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In determining whether an error is harmless, we look to see whether \u201cthe erroneous ruling, in relation to the totality of the evidence, played a significant role in influencing the rendition of the verdict, to the prejudice of the appellant.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 653, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Unless we, \u201cupon [our] own independent review of the record, [are] able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d 665. <em>See also Spence v. State, </em>296 Md. 416, 425, n. 2, 463 A.2d 808 (1983); <em>Huffington v. State, </em>295 Md. 1, 16, 452 A.2d 1211 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>In <em>Jones v. State, supra, </em>the defendant had sought the grand jury testimony of the State\u2019s two principal witnesses. According to the briefs filed in the case, one of the witnesses, Lawson, was an independent eyewitness to the robbery and shooting with which Jones was charged; the other, Clanton, was an accomplice of Jones who had agreed to testify against him. The trial court examined the grand jury testimony of both witnesses.' It concluded that Lawson\u2019s testimony before that body varied in some respects from his trial testimony and thus made parts of his grand jury testimony available to counsel. The court found no such inconsistencies in Clanton\u2019s earlier testimony, however, and therefore refused to permit an inspection of his grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The Court of Appeals rejected that approach, as we and it had earlier in <em>Leonard, </em>for essentially the same reason. The trial judge is not in the same position as defense counsel either to discern potential inconsistencies or to evaluate their possible relevance and impact for purposes of cross-examination. Thus [297 Md.] at p. 17, 464 A.2d 977, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201cWe see no difficulty with the trial judge reviewing the witnesses\u2019 grand jury testimony and excising those matters which do not relate to the subject case, but he should not be making decisions as to what is or is not inconsistent or immaterial to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Thus finding error, the Court continued [297 Md.] at p. 17, 464 A.2d 977: \u201cWe do not believe it appropriate for this Court to review the trial testimony of Clanton and Lawson for the same reasons outlined above with respect to the trial judge; not doing so, we cannot apply the harmless error rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">From this last statement in <em>Jones, </em>it is clear that the question of whether the court\u2019s error was harmless cannot be resolved on the basis of <em>our </em>perception of Collier\u2019s grand jury testimony. For purposes of this case, we must assume that there may have been some statements therein that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>were inconsistent with his trial testimony and that might have been used to impeach his credibility. That does not end the inquiry, however. We still must consider whether the presumed inability to impeach the testimony given by Detective Collier could have \u201cplayed a significant role in influencing the rendition of the verdict....\u201d The <em>Jones </em>Court was spared the need to engage in that kind of analysis because the answer in that case was obvious; the two witnesses, as noted, were critical ones to the State\u2019s case. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The case against appellant, as we have observed, rested almost entirely on the testimony of Hughes and Dawkins, which was corroborated to some extent by the physical evidence admitted prior to Collier\u2019s taking the stand. The critical issue of credibility related to their testimony, not Collier\u2019s. Collier, as we have said, did little more than identify items of physical evidence already admitted as exhibits. It is hard for us to imagine how his credibility, or lack thereof, could in any way have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. If the jury had disbelieved everything Collier said, it would still have been left with the same physical evidence and the same testimony from Hughes and Dawkins. Appellant has not cited to us any benefit he may have derived from impeaching Collier\u2019s credibility through a showing of inconsistent testimony, and we fail to discern any.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Cf Kanaras v. State, </em>54 Md.App. 568, 460 A.2d 61, <em>cert. denied </em>297 Md. 109 (1983). On <em>that </em>basis, we are able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the denial of access to Detective Collier\u2019s grand jury testimony in no way influenced the verdict, and that the error was therefore harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(2) <em>False Name And Address</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">In an apparent effort to show a flight from the scene of the crime, from which an inference of consciousness of guilt might arise, the State produced testimony from Addison Webster and John Hines. Mr. Webster, a principal with the District of Columbia school system, testified that appellant had been employed as an educational aide, and that, on or about January 5, 1981 \u2014 the date of the shooting \u2014 appellant called him on the telephone and said that he (appellant) would not be returning to work. Mr. Hines was a detective employed by the Union, New Jersey police department. Without objection, Detective Hines stated that he had had contact with appellant in New Jersey in February, 1981, and that appellant had then identified himself as Leroy Boone and given an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey. No motion was made to strike that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In its instructions, the court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">\u201cIf you should find that the defendant did an act demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, you are permitted to infer that he did so to conceal his part in the criminal activity. Although you may not conclude that he is guilty based on acts showing consciousness of guilt alone, you may consider that along with all the other evidence, giving it such weight as you believe it deserves in arriving at your verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Flight from justice or the assumption of a false name or such act, if you find that the defendant did flee and assume a false name, you may infer that his acts were aimed at concealing his part in the crime. That is, his consciousness of guilt and thus of guilt itself. You may not conclude that he is guilty based upon those acts standing alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">However, you may consider it in light of all the other evidence, giving it such weight as you believe it deserves in arriving at your verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Appellant argues to us now that the evidence did not suffice to support that instruction \u2014 that the giving of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>fictitious name and address in New Jersey six weeks after the event does not establish flight or a consciousness of guilt. Coupled with Mr. Webster\u2019s testimony, we think the instruction had sufficient evidentiary support. <em>See Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 105-06, 205 A.2d 254 (1964), <em>cert. denied </em>382 U.S. 945, 86 S.Ct. 402, 15 L.Ed.2d 354 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">(3) <em>State\u2019s Cross-Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The State urged the trial court to sentence appellant pursuant to Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201cAny person who (1) has been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence where the convictions do not arise from a single incident, and (2) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence, shall be sentenced, on being convicted a third time of a crime of violence, to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years.... <em>A separate occasion shall be considered one in which the second or succeeding offense is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding occasion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">As a basis for the application of \u00a7 643B(c), the State established: (1) that in April, 1973, appellant had been convicted in New Jersey of armed robbery, that he had been sentenced on that conviction to eighteen years in prison, and that he had actually served a portion of that sentence before being released on parole; (2) that the current offenses were committed on January 5, 1981, and that the statement of charges and arrest warrant for them was issued the next day, January 6, 1981; and (3) that on February 20, 1981, appellant was arrested in New Jersey for an armed robbery committed there, that he was convicted of that offense in July, 1981, and that in September, 1981, he was sentenced to twenty years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Using the chronology of <em>convictions </em>as the relevant criterion, the State argued that, as the current conviction was the third, in chronological order, of a crime of violence and as appellant had actually served part of one term of confinement, the statute applied and the twenty-five year minimum sentence was mandatory. The court read the statute differently, however. To apply, it held, the third <em>(i. e., </em>current) <em>offense </em>must have been committed after the charging documents for the first and second offenses were filed, and that did not occur here. The charging document for the second offense relied on \u2014 the 1981 armed robbery in New Jersey \u2014 was not filed until after the Maryland offense at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We agree with the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, although not quite with its analysis. We think that, for the statute to apply, the current offense must post-date the two predicate <em>convictions, </em>which, in this case, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Enhanced punishment statutes such as \u00a7 643B(c) are not unique to Maryland, nor, indeed, is \u00a7 643B(c) the only enhanced punishment statute in Maryland. <em>See, for example, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 36B, 286, and 643B(b) of art. 27. Most of the States have such statutes in one form or another, some providing for increased penalties upon conviction of a subsequent \u201coffense,\u201d some speaking merely in terms of subsequent \u201cconvictions,\u201d some referring to prior convictions, some specifying a particular chronology, some not. But, as noted in Annot., <em>Habitual Criminal Statutes, </em>24 A.L.R.2d 1247, 1248 (1952):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">\u201c[Regardless of the difference in phraseology, the preponderance of authority supports the view that <em>the prior convictions, in order to be available for imposition of increased punishment of one as a habitual offender, must precede the commission of the principal offense, that is, the latest prosecution in point of time. </em>In this connection, it has been brought out in numerous cases that, although differing somewhat in language, the same principle is inherent in a habitual criminal statute, name<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ly, that the legislature in enacting such a statute intended it to serve as a warning to first offenders and to afford them an opportunity to reform, and that the reason for the infliction of severer punishment for a repetition of offenses is not so much that defendant has sinned more than once as that he is deemed incorrigible when he persists in violations of the law <em>after conviction of previous infractions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The caselaw, including opinions written after the publication of that 1952 annotation, confirms the accuracy of that conclusion. <em>See, for example, State v. Carlson, </em>560 P.2d 26 (Alaska 1977); <em>People v. Gennaitte, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 544, 274 P.2d 169 (1954), <em>cert. denied </em>348 U.S. 983, 75 S.Ct. 574, 99 L.Ed. 765 (1955); <em>People v.

Some courts have interpreted recidivist statutes as <em>not </em>requiring the prior conviction to be rendered before commission of the instant offense. <em>See, for example, United States v. Bridgeman, </em>523 F.2d 1099 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied </em>425 U.S. 961, 96 S.Ct. 1744, 48 L.Ed.2d 206 (1976); <em>State v. Hannah, </em>126 Ariz. 575, 617 P.2d 527 (1980); <em>Conley v. State, </em>272 Ark. 33, 612 S.W.2d 722 (1981); <em>Jordan v. State, </em>383 So.2d 495 (Miss.1980); <em>United States v. Hilliard, </em>366 A.2d 437 (D.C. App.1976); <em>State v. Cain, </em>107 N.J.Super. 215, 257 A.2d 746 (1969); 24B C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 1960(5). That view seems to rest on- the premise that the legislative intent behind the particular statute under consideration was not to warn or reform the offender, and thus to deter future criminal activity, but simply to punish career criminals based on their record, and to protect society in that manner. The achievement of <em>that </em>end, of course, does not depend upon any particular sequence of offenses; only the sequence of convictions matters. In most of these cases, the court has discerned this alternative legislative intent from some clear legislative statement or action, such as an amendment to a prior statute. <em>See, for example, Conley v. State, </em>272 Ark. 33, 612 S.W.2d 722, reversing <em>Washington v. State, </em>271 Ark. 420, 609 S.W.2d 33 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Maryland appellate courts have yet to address the question squarely.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">It is difficult to judge whether, in enacting \u00a7 643B(c), the Legislature was guided more by one philosophy than another \u2014 whether its primary goal was the protection of society through deterrence, which would presuppose a sequence of offenses, or through the <em>ex post facto </em>imposition of substantial punishment based on what the court ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>finds before it. The bill enacting \u00a7 643B(c) (1977 Md.Laws, ch. 678), was directed primarily at a wholesale rewriting of the \u201cdefective delinquency\u201d law (Md.Code Ann. art. 31B) and the restructuring of Patuxent Institution. The available legislative history indicates that, in large measure, \u00a7 643B(c) was intended as a partial replacement for the previously authorized indeterminate commitment to Patuxent Institution, which the bill repealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That, in turn, would tend to suggest some mixture of both intents \u2014 deterrence/ reform and secure and lengthy removal from society.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">As initially enacted, \u00a7 643B(c) did not contain what is now its last sentence, defining the term \u201cseparate occasion.\u201d It provided simply that a person who (1) had been \u201cconvicted on two separate occasions\u201d of a crime of violence where the convictions did not arise from a single incident and (2) has served at least one term of confinement as the result of a conviction of a crime of violence, shall receive the mandatory minimum sentence. As so worded, though couched in terms of \u201cconvictions\u201d rather than offenses, absent some clear expression of legislative intent, the statute could as easily have been construed in accordance with either the majority or the minority rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>In <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 478, 418 A.2d 1241 (1980), <em>aff'd </em>290 Md. 1, 425 A.2d 1361 (1981), we pointed out that \u00a7 643B(c) was ambiguous in a number of respects, and in a footnote at p. 490, suggested the need for legislative clarification. One of the problems we noted had to do with the requirement that the prior convictions occur on \u201ctwo separate occasions.\u201d We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201cIn addition, we note that unless a defendant\u2019s two prior convictions occur on \u2018two separate occasions\u2019 the predicates of \u00a7 643B(c) have not been satisfied. This is true even when the two prior convictions arise from totally separate incidents. Thus, a defendant who is convicted at one trial of several crimes of violence may escape the mandatory sentence of \u00a7 643B(c). In contrast, however, the mandatory life sentence provision, \u00a7 643B(b), requires only \u2018three separate convictions.\u2019 It does not require that the convictions be obtained on separate occasions. These discrepancies and variations are indicative of the need for legislative clarification of the statutory enactment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">This hypothetical concern became a real problem in <em>Lett v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 668, 445 A.2d 1050, <em>cert. denied </em>294 Md. 442 (1982). The two prior qualifying convictions relied upon by the State there, though arising from separate crimes of violence, were entered the same day, apparently after a single- trial at which the two offenses had been consolidated. Lett argued, and we agreed, that as a result, he had not been convicted \u201con two separate occasions,\u201d and thus \u00a7 643B(c) could not be applied. We noted the concern expressed in <em>Calhoun </em>and again invited the Legislature to consider the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Unbeknown to us, the General Assembly had already taken our cue from <em>Calhoun </em>and, by 1982 Md.Laws, ch. 479, clarified the meaning of \u201cseparate occasion\u201d by adding to \u00a7 643B(c) the statement, \u201c[a] separate occasion shall be considered one in which the <em>second or succeeding offense </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding occasion.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">This provision was added by a House Judiciary Committee amendment to a bill whose initial and principal purpose was to include certain burglary offenses within the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 643B(a). Although there is no direct legislative history available to explain the amendment, we have little doubt that it was in response to the footnote in <em>Calhoun. </em>Unfortunately, while it may have cleared up the ambiguity noted therein, in the process of doing so, it compounded the problem now before us, as it introduced into the statute for the first time as explicit criteria or measuring rods the date of the offense and the date of the charging document. Were those events intended to relate only to the prior convictions, <em>inter sese, </em>or were they intended to affect the relationship between the prior convictions and the instant one as well?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Had the Legislature not spoken in terms of the second \u201cor succeeding\u201d offense, the argument could well be made that it intended to address no more than the problem of two prior convictions rendered the same day, and otherwise to leave the law as it was. The introduction of the \u201csucceeding\u201d offense, however, makes the force of that argument somewhat less clear. The Legislature may have meant only to clarify that \u00a7 643B(c) could be invoked where there were more than two prior convictions, <em>i.e., </em>to cover the gap where the defendant had more than two prior convictions, thus precluding the application of \u00a7 643B(b). We noted that problem as well in <em>Calhoun, </em>46 Md.App. at 490 (n. 5), 418 A.2d 1241. But the addition of the word \u201csucceeding\u201d could as easily be read as expressing an intent to implicate the instant conviction as well. From the evidence available to us, we simply cannot tell.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Many of the cases adopting the majority rule stress that enhanced punishment statutes, being penal in nature, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>be strictly construed in favor of the defendant, with any ambiguity as to meaning or application resolved in his favor. That, of course, is a common rule well recognized in Maryland. We think that it applies to \u00a7 643B(c) and, by its application, tilts the balance in favor of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We therefore align ourselves with the great majority of States and conclude that in order for a defendant to be sentenced under \u00a7 643B(c), the two convictions serving as the predicate for the enhanced sentence must precede in time the commission of the offense upon which the instant conviction is based. Deterrence, rather than retribution, is the legislative intent we shall infer; and that, as the cited authority makes clear, requires that the instant offense\u2014 the one for which the enhanced punishment is imposed \u2014 be committed after the two predicate convictions. The defendant is being more heavily punished for disregarding the statute\u2019s warning and proceeding to commit the third offense after being twice convicted on two earlier occasions. Accordingly, we find the State\u2019s cross-appeal to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE ASSESSED ONE-HALF TO APPELLANT, ONE-HALF TO MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. In his brief, appellant seems to suggest that Collier\u2019s grand jury testimony may have been useful in implicating Hughes as the killer. But the testimony could not be used for that purpose.
