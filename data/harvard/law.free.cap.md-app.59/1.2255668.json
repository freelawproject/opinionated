The circuit court held that, in the absence of fraud, heirs at law could not challenge the will of the decedent by filing a petition to caveat the will more than six months following the first appointment of a personal representative under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">On appeal, the appellants present the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-14\">1. Whether the provisions of the Maryland Estates and Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 5-207(a) are mandatory in that, under no circumstances, can a petition to caveat be filed after the expiration of six months following the first appointment of a personal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-15\">2. Whether the notice requirements of Maryland Estates and Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 2-210, when \u201cLists of Interested Persons\u201d provided pursuant to Section 7-104 is inaccurate or incomplete, satisfies the procedural due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hold that the circuit court did not err in dismissing the appellants\u2019 petition to caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\n<em>Statement of the Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Orville Oscar Outten (the decedent) lived and worked in Pocomoke City, Worcester County, Maryland for most of his adult life. He was the owner of several large tracts of real estate in Worcester County. Mr. Outten never married and had no children; his parents and only brother predeceased him.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">On May 29, 1980, while hospitalized for a lengthy illness in Peninsula General Hospital, Orville Outten executed his last will and testament. In this holographic will, the decedent devised all of his estate to one Nora V. Windsor for the term of her natural life, and after her death to Larry G. Sterling. These persons were not related to the decedent. The will was witnessed by Susan L. Peacock and Henry P. Walters. Mr. Outten died on July 3, 1980. The will was admitted to administrative probate on July 7, 1980, and on that day, Mr. Walters, an attorney in Pocomoke City, who had known the decedent and the decedent\u2019s family for over fifty years, was appointed personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Pursuant to his duties as personal representative, Mr. Walters delivered the will to the Register of Wills for Worcester County, and filed a petition for probate in the Orphans\u2019 Court. He also furnished the court with a list of the names and addresses of the heirs and legatees of the decedent, to the extent known to him. Notices were duly sent by the Register of Wills to those individuals named by Mr. Walters. Notice of the appointment of Henry P. Walters as personal representative and of the probate of the decedent\u2019s will, was published in a newspaper of local distribution. Through that notice, all persons having any objection to the appointment or the probate of the will were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>notified of their requirement to file their objections with the Register of Wills on or before January 7, 1981. The notice also informed claimants that any claim not so filed on or before January 7, 1981, or any extension thereof as provided by law, would be unenforceable thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">On October 16, 1981, the appellants, Paul Durham and twenty-six other persons, identifying themselves as issue of the decedent\u2019s maternal and paternal grandparents, filed a petition and caveat in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Worcester County. By this petition, the appellants asserted that as notice of the probate had not been sent to any of the issue of decedent\u2019s grandparents, the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court which admitted the decedent\u2019s alleged will to probate should be annulled, and that the letters testamentary granted to Henry B. Walters should be revoked. An amended petition and caveat was filed on November 13, 1981 by the appellant Paul Durham. The amendment brought the total number of caveators to thirty-nine heirs at law of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Petitioners asserted that the will was invalid because it was not signed by the decedent or witnessed by two people in the decedent\u2019s presence; that it was not read by or to the decedent before its execution; and that it was procurred by undue influence. All of these allegations were denied by the personal representative who further answered that he had delivered to the Register of Wills all names and addresses of the decedent\u2019s heirs known to him. The personal representative also asserted that the petition and caveat was not timely filed pursuant to Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann., \u00a7 5-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">On December 15, 1981, the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered that the administrative probate in the case be set aside and replaced by a judicial probate. Mr. Walters opposed the judicial probate in a petition to dismiss the caveat proceedings. This petition was denied by the Orphans\u2019 Court and appeal was taken to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">A hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Worcester County on July 8, 1982. At this hearing, Mr. Walters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>testified that he was very familiar with the Outten family, having known the decedent for more than fifty years. The personal representative related his knowledge that the decedent\u2019s mother and father and only brother had predeceased the decedent, and that three aunts of the decedent had survived him. The personal representative further stated that to the best of his knowledge as of July 7, 1980, he knew of no other relative of the decedent. There was no testimony or evidence whatsoever that the personal representative failed to act with due diligence in attempting to ascertain the existence of heirs beyond those known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">On March 30, 1983, the Circuit Court for Worcester County issued its opinion and order in the case. By this order, the court granted the petition of the personal representative to dismiss the amended petition and caveat of the decedent\u2019s purported heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">I. <em>Six Month Filing Period in Caveat Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Maryland Estates and Trusts (Est. &amp; Trusts) Code Annotated, \u00a7 5-207 (1974) sets forth in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">(a) <em>Filing petition to caveat. </em>\u2014 Regardless of whether a petition for probate has been filed, a verified petition to caveat a will may be filed at any time prior to the expiration of six months following the first appointment of a personal representative under a will, even if there be a subsequent judicial probate or appointment of a personal representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Applying the pertinent statute, Md.Code Ann. Art. 94, \u00a7 2, which sets out the manner of computation for determining any period of time prescribed by statute, the six month filing period under Section 5-207(a) for an estate in which the personal representative was named on July 7, 1980, would have expired on January 7, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The appellants, however, contend that there are exceptions to the provisions of Section 5-207(a) which should permit the filing of caveats against a will more than six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>months after the first appointment of a personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The appellants present a three-fold argument in favor of their contention. First, the appellants assert that the language of the statute itself is \u201cnot imperative on its face\u201d and that arguably, the Orphans\u2019 Court is \u201cnot deprived of jurisdiction to entertain a petition to caveat made after the expiration of six months.\u201d Second, the appellants assert that the statute should not operate to their detriment in this case because the personal representative\u2019s failure to notify the decedent\u2019s heirs constitutes \u201ca fraud, innocent or otherwise\u201d, that should preclude the personal representative from invoking the limitation set forth in Section 5-207 to the detriment of the legal heirs. Finally, the appellants assert that \u201cin certain circumstances the otherwise mandatory provisions of Section 5-207 can be interrupted by the principles of waiver and estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We shall examine each of these three contentions <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">a. <em>Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Prior to 1894, it was the established law of Maryland that a lapse of time would not exclude the inquiry into whether a certain paper constituted the will of a decedent. <em>Emmert v. Stouffer, </em>64 Md. 543, 559, 6 A. 177 (1886); <em>Clagett v. Hawkins, </em>11 Md. 381, 387 (1857). Nearly a century ago, however, the Legislature enacted Chapter 405 of the Acts of 1894. This statute provided in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">No will, testament, codicil or other testamentary paper shall be subject to caveat or other objection to its validity after the expiration of three years from its probate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">The Court of Appeals first interpreted this statute in <em>Garrison v. Hill, </em>81 Md. 551, 32 A. 191 (1895). The Court held that the new statute would act as a bar to belated caveat proceedings against wills probated after the passage of the Act. Judge Boyd, speaking for the Court of Appeals, explained the purpose of the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The statute is a very important one. Great injustice was possible to be done to devises [sic] and legatees, as well as to testators themselves, by permitting caveats to be filed at any time, however long after the probate of wills. Designing parties could wait until the death of those familiar with the circumstances under which a will was executed before proceeding against it, and other dangers suggest themselves under the former practice in this State. The Legislature had, therefore, wisely undertaken to limit the time within which wills can be attacked. <em>Garrison v. Hill, </em>81 Md. at 555-556, 32 A. 191.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">By Chapter 357 of the Acts of 1933, codified at Maryland Code, Art. 93, \u00a7 352, the Legislature reduced the statutory time limitation for the filing of caveats to one year. The language of the section, however, remained otherwise unchanged. Commenting on this statute, Judge Philip L. Sykes, in his treatise, <em>Contest of Wills in Maryland </em>(1941), \u00a7 3 at p. 4 stated, \u201cThe language of the statute is imperative, and deprives the Orphans\u2019 Court of jurisdiction to entertain an objection made after the expiration of the year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">A subsequent amendment to the statute reduced the period of time from one year to six months. Acts of 1957, Chap. 173, codified at Maryland Code, Art. 93, \u00a7 375. In Section 375, however, the mandatory language of the statute limiting jurisdiction was maintained. <em>\u201cNo will or codicil shall be subject to caveat </em>or other objection to its validity at the expiration of six months from its probate.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">As the appellants note in their brief, the present statute, based on the language of the 1969 amendment, Acts of 1969, Chap. 3, no longer contains the mandatory term \u201cshall\u201d. Rather, the statute now states \u201ca verified petition to caveat a will <em>may </em>be filed any time prior to the expiration of six months____\u201d Section 5-207. The appellants assert that this change in the language of the statute indicates that the Orphans\u2019 Court is no longer deprived of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>jurisdiction to entertain a petition to caveat filed after the expiration of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The language of Section 5-207 is unambiguous and permits only one possible interpretation. We conclude that the provision, like its predecessors, precludes the consideration of a belated caveat after a fixed lapse of time. <em>Meyer v. Henderson, </em>88 Md. 585, 593, 41 A. 1073, <em>on motion for reargument, </em>42 A. 241 (1899). The 1969 amendment to Section 5-207, changing the language of the statute from \u201cshall\u201d to \u201cmay\u201d merely clarified the form of the statute without affecting its substance. Read in its complete context, the statute continues to require that a caveat be filed, if an interested party chooses to contest a will, no later than six months after the first appointment of the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The provision also serves to confer jurisdiction upon the Orphans\u2019 Court over such proceedings. It is, therefore, not a statute of limitations in the usual sense of the term. 3 Bowe-Parker: <em>Page on Wills, </em>\u00a7 26.48 at 103 (rev. ed. 1961). Rather, Section 5-207 divests the Orphans\u2019 Court of its jurisdiction to entertain a caveat filed after more than six months from the first appointment of a personal representative. <em>Schlossberg v. Schlossberg, </em>275 Md. 600, 625, 343 A.2d 234 (1975); <em>Meyer, supra. </em>In identical fashion, the time constraints of Section 5-207 prohibit the belated filing of an amended caveat. <em>Elliott v. Maryland National Bank, </em>291 Md. 69, 79-80, 432 A.2d 473 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We hold that the Circuit Court for Worcester County did not err in ruling that because the personal representative of the estate of Orville Oscar Outten was first appointed on July 7, 1980, the Orphans\u2019 Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a caveat filed after January 7, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">b. <em>Fraud Against the Heirs at Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">In their amended petition and caveat, the appellants allege that no notice of the administrative probate of the estate of Orville Oscar Outten was sent to any of the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of the decedent\u2019s paternal grandparents \u201cwho were entitled to receive notice of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The decedent\u2019s personal representative, the appellee, answered the caveators\u2019 allegation stating that he had no knowledge of the existence of the issue of the decedent\u2019s grandparents and that he delivered to the Register of Wills for Worcester County \u201cthe names and addresses of the heirs and decedents to the extent known to him.\u201d He further replied that notice of his appointment was published once a week for thre\u00e9 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">At the circuit court hearing held on July 8, 1982, the Register of Wills testified that she had no reason to believe that the appellee knew of any other heirs at law whom he should notify.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The appellee, Henry P. Walters, testified that as of July of 1980, he knew of no other relatives of the decedent with the exception of the decedent\u2019s aunts. The appellee only learned of the existence of these aunts through information provided by Orville Outten. He stated that he was unaware that the decedent\u2019s father had brothers and sisters, although he personally knew the decedent\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">On appeal, the appellants renew the argument which they made to the circuit court, i.e., because the personal representative was required to notify the decedent\u2019s heirs and legatees, the failure of the appellants to receive notice constitutes \u201ca fraud, innocent or otherwise, against those heirs.\u201d The circuit court quickly disposed of this contention by declining to find that the personal representative committed any fraud upon the decedent\u2019s heirs at law. We reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Maryland Estates &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2-210 and 7-104 set forth the personal representative\u2019s obligations regarding notice to heirs and legatees. These provisions state in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u00a7 2-210. Personal notice to heirs and legatees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">Within five days after receiving the text of the first published newspaper notice as provided in \u00a7 7-103 and the written notice from the personal representative of the names and addresses of the heirs and legatees as provided in \u00a7 7-104, the register shall forward to each such person a copy of the newspaper notice published according to \u00a7 7-104, in the manner prescribed in \u00a7 l-103(a), directed according to the information received from the personal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">\u00a7 7-104. Personal notice to heirs and legatees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">(a) <em>General. </em>\u2014 Not later than 20 days after his appointment the personal representative shall deliver to the register the text of the first published newspaper notice of his appointment and shall advise the register of the names and addresses of the heirs of the decedent and of the legatees <em>to the extent known by him, </em>so that the register may issue the notices provided in \u00a7 2-210. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The unrefuted testimony of the Register of Wills and the personal representative completely supports the circuit court\u2019s determination that the appellee did not perpetrate a fraud upon the appellants. Rather, the evidence presented in this case clearly reveals that the appellee satisfied the requirements of Sections 2-210 and 7-104(a) by notifying the Register of all of the decedent\u2019s heirs that were known to him. The law requires nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Undeterred, the appellants assert that the \u201cinaccuracy or misstatement\u201d of the personal representative should not work to their detriment, but rather that the operation of the estates statute should be suspended because of the appellee\u2019s \u201cfailure... to provide the Orphans\u2019 Court with the names of the heirs at law.\u201d The appellants boldly contend that Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann., \u00a7 5-304 (1974 repl. vol., 1983 cum. supp.) \u201cprovides a statutory scheme to short circuit\u201d the time constraints imposed by Section 5-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">Section 5-304(a) provides that actions taken after administrative probate \u201cshall be final and binding as to all interest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ed parties\u201d unless a request for judicial probate is properly filed within six months of the administrative probate. Section 5-304(b) enumerates certain narrow exceptions by which administrative probate may be set aside and judicial probate instituted if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">[Fallowing a request by an interested person <em>within 18 months of the death of decedent, the </em>court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI\">(1) The proponent of a later offered will, in spite of the exercise of reasonable diligence in efforts to locate any will, was actually unaware of the existence of a will at that time of the prior probate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">(2) The notice provided in \u00a7 2-210 was not given to such interested person nor did he have actual notice of the petition for probate; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">(3) There was <em>fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity </em>in the prior probate proceeding, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Sehlossberg, 275 </em>Md. at 619, 343 A.2d 234, explicitly rejected a party\u2019s argument that Section 5-304, which controls the finality of action regarding administrative probate, created an exception to the jurisdictional time limitation for filing a caveat. The Court held instead that \u201cthe section merely fixes a time within which an action taken during administrative probate shall be considered \u2018final and binding\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">On the authority of <em>Meyer </em>and <em>Sehlossberg, </em>we hold that the time constraint for the filing of caveats imposed by Section 5-207(a) is neither tolled nor extended in the absence of fraud, material mistake or substantial irregularity. Were the law otherwise, then the six month period in which to file a caveat would be meaningless because any unknown heir could mount an attack at any time by averring lack of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">c. <em>Waiver and Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">After the judicial probate hearing in this case, but prior to the filing of the circuit court\u2019s opinion and order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>this Court held in a separate case that the equitable principles of waiver and estoppel may be applied to toll or otherwise interrupt the mandatory time constraint imposed by Section 5-207. <em>Sole v. Darby, </em>52 Md.App. 218, 447 A.2d 506 (1982). We concluded in <em>Sole </em>at 224, 447 A.2d 506 that when confusion and ambiguity in the publication of a notice of appointment was chargeable to the Register and resulted in the caveatrix filing her caveat six months and four days after the appointment of a personal representative, rigid adherence to the terms of Section 5-207 would lead to an unduly harsh result.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Although the appellants failed to raise the issues of waiver and estoppel before the lower tribunals, they request this Court to apply the holding of <em>Sole v. Darby </em>to the present case. We decline to do so. The equitable issues are clearly beyond the scope of our review because they were not decided by the court below. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">For the benefit of the parties, however, we shall, as dicta, distinguish the circumstances of the present case from those in <em>Sole v. Darby. </em>In <em>Sole, </em>the Register of Wills notified the decedent\u2019s daughter of her mother\u2019s death, but misinformed the daughter as to the deadline for filing a caveat. Relying on this information, the daughter failed to file her caveat until shortly after the expiration of the six-month time constraint of Section 5-207. Reversing the dismissal of the caveat, this Court specifically exonerated the caveatrix from any fault in the belated filing. <em>Sole v. Darby, </em>52 Md.App. at 223, 447 A.2d 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In contrast to the conduct of the caveatrix in <em>Sole, </em>the appellants in the present case were at fault by failing to file their caveat for over 15 months after due notice of the appointment of the decedent\u2019s personal representative had been provided by publication. In fact, although the record does not indicate when the appellants first learned of the decedent\u2019s death, the pleadings reveal that several of the appellants live in Worcester County where the notice had been published.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Discussing the operation of the present statute\u2019s lineal predecessor, Judge Sykes, in his treatise, <em>Contest of Wills in Maryland, </em>\u00a7 3 at 4-5 (1941), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">A person is charged with the knowledge that the law gives him a right to caveat a will, <em>Johnston v. Schmidt, </em>158 Md. 555, 557, 572, 149 A. 283 [1930], and the statute makes no exception in favor of relatives unaware of the probate. <em>Bowen\u2019s Estate </em>[190 A. 674], 140 A.2d 674, 172 Md. 698 [1937].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In this case, with no evidence that the decedent\u2019s death was fraudulently concealed from the appellants, the equitable doctrine of laches would surely bar any application of waiver or \u00e9stoppel in the appellant\u2019s favor. <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. 549, 568-570, 429 A.2d 538 (1981); See <em>Kent v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit Co., </em>225 Md. 590, 171 A.2d 723 (1961) affirming the denial of a belated petition to revoke letters testimentary because of the petitioner\u2019s \u201cacquiescence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">II. <em>Constitutional Requirements of Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"AB\">On the assumption that the decedent\u2019s personal representative may have fully complied with the Maryland estates article regarding notice, the appellants attack the law itself as being \u201cviolative of the procedural due process requirements\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a State provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">[N]otice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"><em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). Although individuals undeniably possess a right to be informed of matters pending in which they have an interest, we must also be cognizant' of the vital interest of the State in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>bringing issues to a final settlement. Where further notice is not reasonably possible or practical under the circumstances because of the cost or difficulty of investigation into the status of unknown parties, the requirements of due process may be satisfied by publication. <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 317-318, 70 S.Ct. at 658-659; <em>James v. Zantzinger, </em>202 Md. 109, 114, 96 A.2d 10 (1953). Any stricter interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment would create obstacles in the path of litigants and impose severe burdens on the judicial system without concommittant benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">We hold that the notice requirements of Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann., \u00a7\u00a7 2-210 and 7-104 are not violative of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
