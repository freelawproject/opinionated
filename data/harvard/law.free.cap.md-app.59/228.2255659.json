We have stated previously that \u00a7 33 \u201cattempts to prevent double payment from the public treasury to civil servants for an injury arising out of the employment relationship by providing that government employees covered by both a pension plan and worker\u2019s compensation are entitled to but a single recovery for a single injury.\u201d <em>Tsottles v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>55 Md.App. 58, 59, 460 A.2d 636 (1983). Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have had numerous opportunities to apply this statement of public policy to various factual permutations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This case presents yet another opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Thomas E. Potter, appellant, worked as a firefighter for the Bethesda Fire Department, Incorporated, appellee. On January 24, 1978, appellant sustained a work related injury to his back. He filed a claim and was determined by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Maryland to have suffered a compensable injury. As a result, appellant received medical expenses and temporary total disability benefits from the Insurance Company of North America, appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Thereafter, appellant remained in the employ of the Fire Department, but continued to have difficulties with his back. On August 20, 1980, in the course of Fire Department work, appellant reinjured his back. A second claim was filed. Appellant retired from the Fire Department on December 31, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Both claims were heard by a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commissioner on July 16, 1982. At this hearing, appellees raised the issue of their entitlement to a \u00a7 33 set off based on disability retirement payments of approximately $1600 per month already being paid to appellant by Montgomery County. Testimony revealed that the Fire Department was fully financed by Montgomery County and that appellant\u2019s disability retirement payments exceeded any benefits he was eligible for under \u00a7 33. The Commissioner found that appellant had suffered two job related injuries and directed that the Insurance Company of North America, appellee, pay 20% of the disability for that portion of the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>attributable to the August 20, 1980 injury, and that Montgomery County t/a the Bethesda Fire Department, Inc., Self-Insured, appellee, pay 50% of the disability. Appellees\u2019 request for the \u00a7 33 set off was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Unsatisfied by this outcome, appellees appealed the Commissioner\u2019s ruling to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and subsequently filed motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of their entitlement to a \u00a7 33 set off. The matter came on for hearing on August 17, 1983 before Judge Stanley B. Frosh. Following the submission of briefs and oral argument, Judge Frosh entered partial summary judgment granting appellees the set off refused by the Commissioner. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 605(a), the circuit court certified that this aspect of the case was a final judgment. Disgruntled by this turnabout, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Maryland \u25a0 Ann.Code, art. 101, \u00a7 33(c) (1979 Repl.Vol., 1983 Cum.Supp.) states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">Whenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of employers covered under \u00a7 21(a)(2) of this article, ... the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full as the case may be, the liability or obligation of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for any benefit under this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Section 21(a)(2) denotes those employers subject to Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. They include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">The State, any agency thereof, and each county, city, town, township, incorporated village, school district, sewer district, drainage district, public or <em>quasi-public corporation, </em>or any other political subdivision of the State that has one or more employees subject to this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Appellant asserts that the circuit court erroneously permitted appellees the set off allowed for in \u00a7 33 because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>employer, the Bethesda Fire Department, is a private corporation and not one of the \u00a7 21(a)(2) employers covered by the Act. Appellees contend that the Bethesda Fire Department is a quasi-public corporation, an entity within the definition of \u00a7 21(a)(2). Hence, appellees respond that Montgomery County\u2019s payment of appellant\u2019s pension benefits discharges appellees\u2019 obligation to pay Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits. A plain reading of the relevant statutes, a review of the definition of a quasi-public corporation, and our observance of the clear public policy against double dipping by government (or quasi-government) workers mandates our affirmance of the judgment entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The Montgomery County Council has authorized the establishment of comprehensive insurance and self-insurance programs \u201cin cooperation with the employees or any portion thereof in any office, agency, or branch of the government of the county and with paid <em>employees of quasi-public corporations engaged in the performance of governmental functions, such as fire </em>departments____\u201d Montgomery County Code \u00a7 20-37(b) (1972, 1977 Repl.Vol., 1981 Cum.Supp.) (emphasis supplied). Thus, Montgomery County has recognized the County fire departments as quasi-public corporations \u2014 an employer included in Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. See, Md.Ann.Code, art. 101, \u00a7 21(a)(2), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The County\u2019s self-labelling of their fire departments as quasi-public corporations, however, does not end our analysis. We must examine whether the fire departments, in fact, function as quasi-public corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The term \u201cquasi-public corporation\u201d is not defined in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and there has not been a Maryland appellate decision construing the term for over 150 years. The definitions stated by our sister states have not always been precise. We therefore turn to the relevant treatises for guidance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">The term \u2018quasi-public corporation\u2019 has been applied, ... without sharp distinction to, (a) public service corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tions operating under private corporation laws and as private corporations, and (b) those which organically are \u2018quasi-public,\u2019 as well as partially public in their ends and purposes. Undiscriminating use of the term has continued too long to make it possible now in a treatise to align them accurately into these distinctive classes, except as follows. A \u2018quasi-corporation\u2019 is what this term implies, treated hereafter, and not to be confused with \u2018quasi-public corporation,\u2019 which implies a corporation but regards it as \u2018quasi-public.\u2019 The fact that the public is interested in the objects of a corporation does not determine its character as quasi-public or private. Quasi-public corporations may be formed in some states by special act, though it is forbidden as to ordinary private corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">Quasi-public corporations have been defined as private corporations which have accepted from the state the grant of a franchise or contract involving the performance of public duties. A quasi-public or public service corporation has been defined also as one private in its ownership but having an appropriate franchise from the state to provide for a necessity or convenience of the general public incapable of being furnished through the ordinary channels of private competitive business, and dependent for its exercise upon eminent domain or some agency of government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">1 Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 63 at 601-02 (Perm.Ed.1983) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">A quasi-public or quasi-municipal corporation has also been defined as a corporation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjD\">created or authorized by the legislature which is merely a public agency endowed with such of the attributes of a municipality as may be necessary in the performance of its limited objective. In other words, a quasi-municipal corporation is a public agency created or authorized by the legislature to aid the state in, or to take charge of, some public or state work, other than community government, for the general welfare. \u2018Quasi-municipal\u2019 corporations are public in nature, but not, strictly speaking, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>municipal corporations. They are bodies which possess a limited number of corporate powers and which are low down in the scale or grade of corporate existence, and consist of various local government areas established to aid the administration of public functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">1 McQuillen, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations, </em>\u00a7 2.13 at 151 (3d ed. 1971) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In 1827, the High Court of Chancery of Maryland<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated that a quasi-public corporation possesses the attributes of both public and private corporations in that it is \u201cconcern[ed] with some of the expensive duties of the State, the trouble and charge of which are undertaken and defrayed by them, in consideration of a certain emolument allowed and secured to their members.\u201d <em>McKim v. Odom, </em>3 Bland [407] 402, 419 (Md.High Ct. of Chancery 1827).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">From these resources, we are able to identify the characteristics of a quasi-public corporation. A quasi-public corporation must be private in ownership. It must enjoy privileges not bestowed upon the general public because of the benefits such a corporation confers to the public. Lastly, a quasi-public corporation must provide a service necessary to the general welfare of the public. <em>See, Attorney General v. Haverhill Gaslight Co., </em>101 N.E. 1061, 1063, 215 Mass. 394 (1913); <em>Newcomb v. Boston Protective Dep\u2019t, </em>151 Mass. 215, 24 N.E. 39, 39-40 (1890); <em>Wilentz v. Hendrickson, </em>33 A.2d 366, 385 (N.J.Ch.1943); <em>Philadelphia Rural Trust Co. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>309 Pa. 84, 159 A. 861, 863 (1932). Further discussion of the concept of quasi-public corporations may be found in 18 Am.Jur.2d <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 9 at 555-56 (1965) (1983 Cum.Supp.) and 18 C.J.S. <em>Corporations </em>\u00a7 18 at 396-98 (1935) (1983 Cum.Supp.). A delineation of those organizations held to be quasi-public corporations may be found in 35A <em>Words and Phrases, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201cQuasi-Public Corporation,\u201d at 488-94 (1963, 1983 Cum. Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">We now apply the criteria we have explained to the facts presented by the case <em>sub judice. </em>At a hearing before a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commissioner, Leonard Schoenberger, an employee of the Fire Department, testified that the Bethesda Fire Department is a private corporation funded solely by Montgomery County. The Bethesda Fire Department has been granted certain privileges by the County Council in exchange for its performance of emergency services. For instance, a director of fire and rescue services and his representatives are authorized to enter buildings without consent where necessary to perform the duties outlined in the Fire Safety Code. <em>See, </em>Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 22-7 (1972, 1977 Repl.Vol., 1981 Cum. Supp.). It is elementary that a fire department provides a service essential to the general public\u2019s welfare. In sum, the Bethesda Fire Department is a private organization funded by taxpayer\u2019s money to perform a public service. It is not entirely a private venture; it is not a public agency; it is an amalgamation of these two concepts. Indeed, this case illustrates that when the Montgomery County Council used the words quasi-public corporation to describe the county fire departments, it meant that the county fire departments were quasi-public corporations within the ambit of Md.Ann.Code, art. 101, \u00a7 21(a)(2), <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, \u00a7 33 mandates that appellees receive a set off of workmen\u2019s compensation from those retirement benefits received by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This result is consistent with the \u201clegislature\u2019s intention to minimize the burden on the public treasury that would result from providing duplicate benefits to public employees.\u201d <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. at 661, 399 A.2d 250. Appellant receives disability retirement benefits from Montgomery County. He seeks workmen\u2019s compensation from the Bethesda Fire Department, a quasi-public corporation funded by Montgomery County. It is undisput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ed that appellant\u2019s disability retirement benefits exceed those eligible from workmen\u2019s compensation. Maryland law, through \u00a7 33, precludes the receipt of such duplicate benefits. Accordingly, appellees were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
