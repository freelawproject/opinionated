The trial court sentenced him to state prison for 375 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">On appeal, defendant r\u00e1ises the following contentions:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) the court erred in admitting into evidence his prior sex offenses and in instructing the jury on their 'use; (2) trial counsel was ineffective; and (3) the court committed sentencing error.

(counts one-five)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">C.J. met defendant when was she was 12 years old, and he was her parents\u2019 realtor. She started working for him doing \u201cchores\u201d to earn money. On eight to 10 different occasions during the summer of 1995, defendant had C.J. rub his penis until ejaculation and then had C.J. apply wart medication. During one of these episodes, defendant made C.J. press her lips against his penis. During another episode, defendant made her \u201ctickle [his] balls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\n<em>Molestation of T.B. (counts six-ten)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">T.B. was a 20-year-old college student at the time of trial. Before she moved away to college, T.B. and her family lived a few houses away from defendant in Citrus Heights. Defendant was \u201cgood friends\u201d with her family, and he was like an uncle to her. Defendant molested her for the first time when she was approximately seven years old. Defendant unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis, and \u201csuggested that [T.B.] touch it.\u201d She complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">During other incidents at defendant\u2019s house, he would ask her to put wart medication on his penis, and again she complied. These incidents occurred from the time T.B. was seven years old to the time she was 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">There were incidents when T.B. was nine or 10 years old when defendant made her put her mouth on his penis, and he put his hand up her skirt or shorts and stroked her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">At some point, defendant moved to Granite Bay. T.B. recalled one incident there when she was 11 years old and defendant touched her thigh, unzipped his pants, and directed her to apply medication to his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">\n<em>Molestation of S.J. (counts eleven-fifteen)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">S.J. was 16 years old at the time of trial. She met defendant was she was seven or eight years old, and he was her parents\u2019 realtor. She frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>visited defendant\u2019s house with her family. On five to 10 occasions, defendant had her move her hand up and down his penis so it would become \u201cbig\u201d so he could apply wart medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Defendant made S.J. \u201cwatch a video on how to give oral sex\u201d and look at Playboy magazines. He later made her put her mouth on his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\n<em>Prior Acts of Molestation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">N.J. was 49 years old at the time of trial. She met defendant when she was seven years old, and he was living in her neighborhood with a family friend of N.J.\u2019s. Once, while N.J. was at her friend\u2019s house, defendant exposed his penis, testicles, and legs, told her that he had hurt his leg, and said that he wanted her to \u201crub it for him.\u201d When N.J. started rubbing his leg, defendant took NJ.\u2019s hand, put it on his penis, and with, his hand on top of hers, starting massaging his penis. He also had her rub his inner thigh and put her lips on his peqis. As a result of these acts, defendant pled guilty in 1963 to committing a lewd act on N.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">\n<em>The Court Did Not Err in Admitting into Evidence Defendant\u2019s Prior Sex Offenses and in Instructing the Jury \u2022 on Their Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Defendant contends the admission of his prior sex offenses pursuant to Evidence Code section 1108' denied him a fair trial and violated his right to due process under the United States Constitution. He further contends the instruction regarding the prior sex offenses was \u201cstructural\u201d error requiring automatic reversal of his convictions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to Evidence Code section 1108 was rejected in <em>People v. Falsetta </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 922 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 847, 986 P.2d 182]. We are bound to follow it. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>As to defendant\u2019s challenge to the instruction, it is based on his assertion that the instruction on the use of prior sex offenses \u201cwholly swallowed the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 requirement.\u201d The California Supreme Court has rejected this argument in upholding the constitutionality of the 1999 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reliford </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1007, 1012-1016 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 254, 62 P.3d 601].) The version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01 considered in <em>Reliford </em>is similar in all material respects to Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions (2006) CALCRIM No. 1191 (which was given here) in its explanation of the law on permissive inferences and the burden of proof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are in no position to reconsider the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Reliford (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 455), and by analogy to <em>Reliford, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s argument regarding the jury instruction on use of his prior sex offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">II, III<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Sims, Acting P. J., and Butz, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-12\"> We address defendant\u2019s arguments only to the extent they are properly reflected in the headings and subheadings of his opening brief. As we have recently explained, \u201cappellant\u2019s brief \u2018must\u2019 \u2018[s]tate each point under a separate heading or subheading summarizing the point. . . .\u2019 [Citations.] This is not a mere technical requirement; it is \u2018designed to lighten the labors of the appellate tribunals by requiring the litigants to present their cause systematically and so arranged that those upon whom the duty devolves of ascertaining the rule of law to apply may be advised, as they read, of the exact question under consideration, instead of being compelled to extricate it from the mass.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re S.C. </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 396, 408 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 453].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-13\"> Defendant\u2019s attack on the constitutionality of Evidence Code section 1108 is based on the United State Supreme Court\u2019s construction of the Federal Rules of Evidence. We note that Evidence Code section 1108 was modeled on a federal rule of evidence that has also withstood such attacks. <em>(People v. Falsetta, supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 912, 920.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\"> The version of CALCRIM No. 1191 given to the jury in this case reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cYou may consider [the uncharged sex offenses] evidence only if the People have proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant in fact committed the uncharged offenses. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence is a different burden of proof from proof beyond a reasonable doubt. A fact is proved by a preponderance of the evidence if you conclude that it is more likely than not that the fact is true, [f] If the People have not met this burden of proof, you must disregard this evidence entirely, that is, the uncharged crimes evidence, [f] If you decide that the defendant committed the uncharged offense or offenses, you may, but are not required to, conclude from that evidence that the defendant was disposed or inclined to commit sexual offenses, and based on that decision, also conclude that the defendant was likely to commit the sex offenses as charged here. [1] If you conclude that the defendant committed the uncharged offense or offenses, that conclusion is only one factor to consider along with all the other evidence. It is not sufficient by itself to prove that the defendant is guilty of the charged sexual offenses. The People must still prove each element of every charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The version of CALJIC No. 2.50.02 given to the jury in <em>Reliford </em>reads, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cIf you find that the defendant committed a prior sexual offense in 1991 involving S[.]B[.], you may, but are not required to, infer that the defendant had a disposition to commit the same or similar type sexual offenses. If you find that the defendant had this disposition, you may, but are not required to, infer that he was likely to commit and did commit the crime of which he is accused. H] However, if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed a prior sexual offense in 1991 involving S[.]B[.], that is not sufficient by itself to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the charged crime. The weight and significance of the evidence, if any, are for you to decide.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reliford, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1012.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 83.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
