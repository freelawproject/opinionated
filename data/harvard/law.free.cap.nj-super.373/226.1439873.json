The aggregate sentence therefore is fourteen years with four and one-half years to be served before parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Defendant appeals and argues that the sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Specifically, he contends that \u201cthe sentence imposed on the defendant is unconstitutional in that it exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The background relating to the trial is fully set out in <em>State v. Natale, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>625, 792 A.2d 565 (App.Div.2002), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>and remanded, 178 <em>N.J. </em>51, 834 A.2d 1024 (2003). In its opinion, the Supreme Court ordered that on remand the State could elect to try the NERA predicates to a jury or have defendant resentenced without imposition of the NERA ineligibility term. <em>See Natale, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 54, 834 A.2d 1024. On the remand, the State elected not to try the NERA issue, and the trial judge imposed a new sentence without the NERA component. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>judge concluded that the aggravating factors embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(1) and (2) applied because of the length and duration of the beating and its impact on the victim. The judge also concluded that the aggravating factors under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a (3) and (9) were applicable because similar beatings occurred in the past. The judge additionally determined that the mitigating factor <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1b(7) applied because the defendant had no criminal record, although in the context of finding the aggravating factors the judge concluded, as already stated, that there had been prior beatings. The reasons for the sentence were comprehensively embodied in the judgment of conviction, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">With this indictable conviction, the Court does find aggravating factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the role of the actor therein, including whether or not the crime was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">The nature and circumstances of the offense and whether it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner clearly applies in this case and this factor is weighed heavily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">The Court agrees with the State\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s conduct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">The assault in the present case was both brutal and prolonged, and evidenced a grim determination on the part of the defendant to inflict maximum damage to the victim by any available means. The assault continued for almost an hour. During that time the defendant punched, choked, and kicked the victim, who was desperately pleading for him to stop. He dragged her by her hair, smashed her head repeatedly into walls, onto the ground, into a wooden pillar. He struck her in the head with any heavy object at hand and repeatedly slammed a door closed on her head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">The relentlessness and brutality of the attack is most clearly demonstrated by defendant\u2019s determination to pursue the victim and continue the beating even as she sought refuge in the apartment of her neighbor Gary Smith, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade defendant to let the victim go. Moreover, in addition to the physical damage defendant inflicted, he terrorized the victim and humiliated her by ripping off her clothing during the assault leaving her half naked in the bitter cold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">To continue to assault the victim even after a neighbor tried to intervene shows the purposeful nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct and his unrelenting determination to injure and humiliate his victim. For him to have continued the beating even after a neighbor knocked on the door shows that the offense was cruel and depraved, as does the severity and duration. This factor is weighed very heavily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-12\">(2) The gravity and seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim including whether or not the Defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>due to advanced age, disability,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ill-health or extreme youth or was, for any other reason, substantially incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">For the defendant to have been found guilty of 2|nd degree] Aggravated Assault, the jury would only have to have found that he attempted to cause a serious bodily injury. In this case, the defendant pulled out clumps of her hair, and bashed her in the head so many times with various heavy objects that she continues to experience memory deficits. In addition, she suffered loosened teeth for which she continues to require dental treatment. An attempt to inflict even a single serious injury is sufficient for a conviction. In this case, however, the defendant caused two different injuries which can constitute \u201ca protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d Whenever a defendant inflicts additional injuries above and beyond those which are minimally sufficient to constitute the crime, any additional injuries are an aggravating factor[,] <em>State v. Mara, 253 N.J.Super. </em>204, 214, 601 A.2d 718 (App.Div.1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">This factor is given slight to moderate weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">(3) The risk that the Defendant will commit another crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">Although this is the defendant\u2019s first conviction, the victim testified at a Rule 104A hearing outside the presence of the jury and she testified before the jury that the present assault was merely the most serious act of violence in a relationship that was characterized by regular beatings and constant threats. It is not necessary to relate here the various details to which Gina Marie Lerro testified, but it is sufficient to note that the defendant is a person who committed other acts of violence even though he was not charged with them. Accordingly, aggravating factor 3 applies and is weighed heavily</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">(9) The need for deterring the Defendant and others from violating the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">Clearly there is a substantial need to deter others, and this defendant in particular, from acts of violence such as this. This defendant must be deterred, in the strongest possible terms, from committing further violations of the law. This was a brutal beating, and the need for deterrence is weighed very heavily The Court finds mitigating factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">(7) The Defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">The defendant is 36 years old and has no prior convictions. This factor is weighed fairly heavily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">The presumption of incarceration applies. It has not been overcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">Therefore, at this time, in weighing those aggravating and mitigating factors on a qualitative as well as quantitative basis, the Court is clearly convinced that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Against this background, we examine the constitutional challenge raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Ralph Howard Blakely pled guilty to the offense of second-degree kidnapping, a Class B felony, which carried a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment pursuant to the Washington statute governing sentencing. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2534-35, 159 L.Ed.2d at 410. Washington, however, adopted a second statute, the Sentencing Reform Act, which authorized sentencing guidelines to structure the exercise of judicial discretion within the statutory range. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2535, 159 L.Ed.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">By virtue of the offense and Blakely\u2019s admitted use of a firearm in the commission of the crime, the guidelines set forth a \u201cstandard range\u201d sentence of between forty-nine and fifty-three months in prison. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2534-35, 159 L.Ed.2d at 410-11. However, under Washington law, the trial judge was permitted to increase the sentence, subject to the ten-year statutory maximum, based on a finding of \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The departure had to be based on a list of \u201caggravating factors,\u201d which were stated to be \u201cillustrative rather than exhaustive,\u201d and which could be \u201c \u2018considered only if it takes into account factors other than those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the offense\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Gore, </em>143 Wash.2d 288, 21 P.3d 262, 277 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">Based on the trial judge\u2019s finding, Blakely received an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines because he was found to act with \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d during the commission of the second-degree kidnapping in a \u201cdomestic violence\u201d case. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2535, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d at 411, 413. In light of his finding, the trial judge imposed \u201can exceptional sentence of 90 months \u2014 37 months beyond the standard maximum\u201d of the guideline range, but within the ten-year maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>sentence authorized by law. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2535, 159 L.Ed.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The Court of Appeals of Washington affirmed the conviction and sentence, and rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the sentence was unconstitutionally imposed under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>435 (2000). <em>See State v. Blakely, </em>111 <em>Wash.App. </em>851, 47 P.3d 149, 157-59 (2002), <em>review denied, </em>148 Wash.2d 1010, 62 P.3d 889 (2003), <em>rev\u2019d sub nom. Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403, <em>reh. denied, </em>_ <em>U.S. </em>_, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>21, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>851 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The United States Supreme Court reversed because the standard guideline sentence under Washington law, forty-nine to fifty-three months, established the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes, although it was below the ten-year statutory maximum for the Class B felony kidnapping offense. The Court reaffirmed <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>holding that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2536, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 412 (quoting <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 490, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2362-2363, 147 L.Ed.2d at 455). Writing for the majority in <em>Blakely, </em>Justice Scalia had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">In this ease, petitioner was sentenced to more than three years above the 53-month statutory maximum of the standard range because he had acted with \u2018deliberate cruelty.\u2019 ... The State nevertheless contends that there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation because the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not 53 months but the 10-year maximum for class B felonies in \u00a7 9A.20.021(1)(b).... Our precedents make clear, however, that the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>... In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \u2018which the law makes essential to the punishment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-16\"><em>[Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d at 413-14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The Court also indicated \u201cevery defendant has the <em>right </em>to insist that the prosecutor prove to a jury all facts legally essential to the punishment.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2543, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 420 (citing <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>at 466, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d at 435.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Defendant contends that, because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(1) creates presumptive sentences which cannot be increased unless the \u201ccourt\u201d finds the existence of one or more aggravating factors embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a, and that such factor or factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the sentence above the presumptive term embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(a) cannot be constitutionally imposed because those factors have not been found by the jury. Stated differently, defendant contends that under the New Jersey sentencing scheme the \u201cfacts reflected in the jury verdict\u201d permit only the imposition of a presumptive sentence, because the aggravating factors embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la are not relevant to the elements of the offense or to the defendant\u2019s guilt. Hence, defendant asserts that the presumptive sentence is the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for constitutional purposes and, therefore, that in this case the presumptive sentence of seven years for the second-degree aggravated assault could not be increased. At oral argument we also allowed defendant to raise a challenge under <em>Blakely </em>to the other sentences imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">We recognize that Washington\u2019s statutory complex is different than the New Jersey statute. Washington\u2019s Reform Act provides guidelines based on offender and offense-based factors embodied in a statute separate from the one which provides a ten-year maximum for the Class B felony. Based on the former, the defendant has a reasonable expectation that the sentence shall be in the range created by the guidelines, <em>see Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2540, 159 L.Ed.2d at 417, and an \u201cexceptional\u201d sentence is imposed when the judge imposes a higher sentence based on additional fact-finding. 542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2535, 159 L.Ed.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>On the other hand, our statute creates a \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d in an offense-based sentencing structure in which aggravating and mitigating factors are used to increase or decrease the presumptive term within the only sentence range created by statute for the offense. <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 377, 471 A.2d 389 (1984) (stating \u201csentence imposed must reflect the Legislature\u2019s intention to focus on the degree of the crime itself as opposed to other factors personal to the defendant\u201d); <em>see also State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 630, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193, 89 L.Ed.2d 308 (1986) (stating \u201cthe Code\u2019s paramount sentencing goals [are] that punishment fit the crime, not the criminal, and that there be a predictable degree of uniformity in sentencing\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the State that the statutes are very different. However, the statutory wording and nomenclature do not control, and the question is whether there is a material difference for constitutional purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">There is no doubt that the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice permits only the presumptive sentence embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(1) to be imposed based on the jury\u2019s verdict. The presumptive sentence embodied in that section \u201cshall\u201d be imposed unless the sentencing judge finds that an aggravating or mitigating factor or factors exist and weigh \u201cin favor of a higher or lower term within the limits provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.\u201d Therefore, the presumptive sentence, on its face, \u201cis the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 414. Stated differently, in the words of <em>Blakely, </em>the \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d is \u201cthe maximum [the judge] may impose without [making] any additional findings\u201d not made by the jury. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[Tjhe jury\u2019s verdict alone does not authorize the [enhanced] sentence\u201d above the presumptive. <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2538, 159 L.Ed.2d at 414 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Accordingly, we find <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(1) unconstitutional to the extent that it permits the trial judge to increase the presumptive sentence in the absence of jury fact-finding, based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, of the aggravating factors on a basis other than relating to a prior conviction. <em>See, e.g., People v. Butler, </em>122 Cal.App.4th 910, 19 <em>Cal.Rptr.3d </em>310, <em>mod. on o.g., </em>Oct. 13, 2004; <em>People v. Lemus, </em>122 Cal.App.4th 614, 18 <em>Cal.Rptr.3d </em>835 (2004); <em>People v.

Of course, a defendant may provide such factual basis for an enhanced sentence in a guilty plea or negotiate a particular disposition based on the facts \u201cadmitted by defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, supra, </em>542 <em>U.S. </em>at _, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2537, 159 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">We remand to the Law Division to consider the appropriate remedy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State shall be given the opportunity to reconsider its <em>pre-Blakely </em>waiver of the right to present the NERA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>factors on the second-degree aggravated assault to a jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State may also elect to try the relevant aggravating factors, previously found by the trial judge, to the jury on all convictions. If the State seeks the latter, the judge shall consider all issues raised concerning the need for a supplementary indictment before the aggravating factors are presented to the jury. <em>See State v. Fortin, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>540, 632-50, 843 A.2d 974 (2004). We find no double jeopardy concern in these circumstances so long as the sentence is not increased. <em>See State v. Natale, supra </em>(remand for trial on NERA); <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 277, 478 A.2d 408 (1984). <em>See also, e.g., State ex rel. Smith v. Conn, supra; State v.

We are satisfied that the judge may impose a period of parole ineligibility, notwithstanding imposition of the presumptive term, if the judge is \u201cclearly convinced that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. That is because we must be concerned with the \u201creal time\u201d consequences of a sentence, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>523, 541, 766 A.2d 1126 (2001); <em>State v.

However, unless NERA factors have been found by the jury, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ineligibility term must not exceed 50% of the specific term imposed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b. <em>State v. Kruse, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>354, 521 A.2d 836 (1987), permits an ineligibility term to be imposed on a presumptive sentence when specific reasons warrant same, and we find no constitutional impediment to such fact-finding by the sentencing judge. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. United States, </em>536 <em>U.S. </em>545, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002); <em>McMillan v. Pennsylvania, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>79, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986); <em>State v. Stanton, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>75, 820 A.2d 637 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>903, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>259, 157 L.Ed.2d 187 (2003) (authorizing judge fact-finding to sustain minimum sentence).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We also decline to prohibit the imposition of consecutive sentences based on judicial fact-finding. <em>See State v. Abdullah, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 281, 858 A.2d 19 (App.Div.2004); <em>see also People v. Picado, supra, </em>123 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>1216, 20 <em>Cal.Rptr.3d </em>647 (2004); <em>People v. Vaughn, </em>122 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>1363, 19 <em>Cal.Rptr.3d </em>460 (2004); <em>People v. Ochoa, </em>121 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>1551, <em>18 Cal.Rptr.3d </em>365 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">We stay our opinion in this case and direct that, until the Supreme Court considers the issue, the trial courts continue sentencing under New Jersey law as established before today because a defendant not sentenced consistent with our understanding of the mandate of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Blakely </em>can obtain relief on direct appeal and on petition to correct an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d by petition for post-conviction relief, <em>see R. </em>3:22-2(c), if sentenced after the filing of our opinion. On the other hand, the State would have no remedy in terms of an appeal from sentences imposed consistent with this opinion. This is because the sentence would still fall within the range authorized by the Legislature and would be legal and, independently, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>among the limited number of cases subject to appeal by the State pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2), relating to the downgrading or imposition of a non-custodial or probationary sentence for a first or second-degree crime. Moreover, without a stay authorized by the Rules of Court, <em>see R. </em>2:9-3(d); 2:9-10; 3:21 \u2014 4(i), there would be a double jeopardy problem caused by the partial execution of defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See State v. Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>1, 429 A.2d 332, <em>cert. denied, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>880, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>363, 70 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>190 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Our stay is conditioned upon the filing of a notice of appeal or petition for certification by the State within ten days of the filing of this opinion. This stay shall be automatically vacated if the State fails to act in a timely fashion or if the Supreme Court dismisses the appeal or denies certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings, subject to the stay we impose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\"> He had originally been sentenced to nine years with 85% to be served before parole eligibility under NERA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-12\"> In his brief, defendant does not challenge the concurrent five-year sentences for the third-degree crimes or their consecutive feature. Nor did defendant respond to the State\u2019s desire for a bifurcated jury trial on the aggravating factors if <em>Blakely </em>applies. In fact, he initially stated his lack of objection. We permitted him to change his position on both subjects at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-16\"> The word \u201cdisability\u201d does not appear in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> It is also clear that <em>Apprendi </em>itself dealt with an enhancement or required \u201cextended term\u201d above the standard range by virtue of judicial fact-finding relating to a \u201chate crime\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\"> Given the factors used here, we decline to consider that the judge\u2019s findings are subject to a harmless error analysis. Moreover, in the absence of a conviction, the \"prior conviction\" exception does not apply. <em>See State v. King, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. 227, </em>245-46, 858 A.2d 4 (App.Div.2004); <em>State v. Abdullah, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 280-81, 858 A.2d 19 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> This crime occurred before the June 29, 2001 amendments to NERA which made second-degree assault under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 12-1b automatically subject to NERA. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> In future cases, it would be prudent to try the factors necessary for an extended term, as required by <em>Apprendi, </em>at the same time as the aggravating factors, as required by <em>Blakely, </em>following the initial verdict. As to the ability of the judge to make fact-findings prerequisite to an extended term based on prior convictions, <em>see, e.g., State v. Dixon, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 787 A.2d 211 (App.Div. 2001) <em>certif. denied, 172 N.J. </em>181, 796 A.2d 898 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b268-8\"> <em>Stanton, supra, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 820 <em>A.2d </em>637, involved a statute requiring fact-finding by \"the court.\" <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 11-5b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
