After breaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>into Christian\u2019s car through the front passenger window and partially removing the radio, defendant was confronted by Christian, who chased, and eventually tackled and restrained defendant until the police arrived. Christian was principally assisted in apprehending defendant by his father, Ernesto Guidos.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Defendant, who testified at trial despite multiple prior convictions, admitted to the burglary and attempted theft but contested the existence of a second-degree robbery, which required proof that, while committing the theft, he had inflicted bodily injury or used force upon another.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Testimony provided by Christian and defendant differed as to what took place. According to Christian, upon hearing his car alarm and observing someone crawling in the broken passenger window of his car, he went to the area where his car was parked, confronted defendant, asked what he was doing, and \u201cwithout thinking\u201d he \u201ctried to grab\u201d defendant. Defendant, in turn, slapped defendant\u2019s hands off, \u201cstarted kicking a little,\u201d and then \u201cjust got out [of] the car real quick.\u201d When on direct examination at trial Christian was asked to further describe the kicking, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Q. You said he started kicking. Did he \u2014 did he make contact with you with his feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">A. Yeah. Uh-hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">Q. Where was he kicking you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">A. Kind of kicking, I guess to get out. I mean, just tried kicking at the window.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">Q. Where was he kicking you? Where were you getting hit when he started kicking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">A. Oh. Just got hit in my hands, I guess, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">Q. Did that cause you to do or stop doing anything once he started kicking at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-17\">A. Yea, I stopped and X backed off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-18\">Q. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-19\">A. I just stopped, you know, because he was kicking a lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">Defendant then allegedly exited feet-first out of the passenger window, and, out of necessity, there being no other way, \u201cstarted coming toward Christian.\u201d As defendant approached, Christian took a swing at him with a closed fist, hitting him \u201cin the arm or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>something, I don\u2019t know.\u201d It was then that defendant \u201ckind of pushed\u201d Christian and started running through the parking lot toward the street with Christian in pursuit until, at the end of the street, defendant turned. According to Christian\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APH\">at that point I don\u2019t know if he was tired or what but, you know, he turned around, and I don\u2019t \u2014 some kind of swinging at me, and I ducked, and I grabbed him by the chest. And, you know, that\u2019s when we started struggling, we made like a 360 and we both fell on the ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As defendant and Christian fell, Christian stated that he hit his head on the pavement \u201cpretty hard.\u201d Christian held on, and the struggle continued, with both eventually returning to their feet and falling again several times. At some point, Christian admittedly placed defendant\u2019s head in what he variously described as a choke hold or as a head lock, but defendant broke free.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">According to Christian, as the two struggled, his father caught up to them and attempted to assist. Eventually, Christian and defendant tired, and defendant \u201ckind of gave up.\u201d Christian lay on top of him, placing defendant\u2019s arms behind his back. Defendant remained immobilized by Christian, his father, and a third person named Eric Conti until the police arrived. As a result of the struggle, Christian claims to have sustained a lump on his head, as well as multiple scrapes and bruises on his knees and elbows. Photos of his scrapes were introduced at trial. He was examined at a hospital emergency room and, according to Christian, was told that he was \u201cfine.\u201d Christian left prior to his discharge. No treatment was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Christian\u2019s father, Ernesto, who also testified, claimed that he witnessed none of the events at the car. However, he followed Christian and defendant during the chase, testifying in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">Q. What did you do, Mr. Guidos?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">A. I continued following him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">Q. How did you follow him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-12\">A. Running.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-13\">Q. Okay, What happened? What did you see occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-14\">A. When they got to the corner of Maple, they were wrestling around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Q. How did they \u2014 how did they come to come into contact with each other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj8M\">A. I just saw my son grabbing him and that\u2019s all but I was stUl somewhat far away from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">Q. And what occurred between this individual and Christian?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">A. Well, they were wrestling around. When I arrived, I started helping out my son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">Q. Okay. Well, how were they wrestling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">A. They were \u2014 they were fighting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">Q. When you say fighting, what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">A. My son was actually grabbing him, that\u2019s all. Fighting, I guess, both of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-12\">Q. Okay. Well, what was the individual doing when Christian grabbed him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">A. Trying to defend himself perhaps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">When Ernesto reached the struggling pair, he proceeded to attempt to hit and grab defendant, also. Defendant thereupon allegedly hit Ernesto in the jaw and pushed him. Ernesto \u201cwent backwards,\u201d hitting his left hand, breaking or damaging his little finger, and twisting his right ankle. He received no treatment for his alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">Defendant provided a different version of the events. He stated that Christian initiated the confrontation by striking at him in the side of the head with a wooden bat as defendant, seated within Christian\u2019s car, struggled to remove the radio from its housing. Defendant thereupon opened the passenger door, exited the car, and ran past Christian and his father, who was also carrying a bat. Although they both converged on defendant, he was able to escape and run down the street in the direction of Route 22. A bat was thrown at defendant as he ran, but it missed. When defendant approached Route 22, he \u201cstopped to give up.\u201d As he did so, he turned and observed Christian running full speed down the hill. When Christian approached, he grabbed defendant. As defendant describes it: \u201c[W]e both practically looked like a helicopter blade, we both did a 360, wham, right onto the ground.\u201d Christian then grabbed defendant in a choke hold, but defendant was able to free himself. At that point, \u201canother body\u201d hit defendant, and he was immobilized. As he lay on the ground, defendant saw a woman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>that he presumed to be Christian\u2019s mother. As she verbally took defendant to task, Christian allegedly stated: \u201cMom, quiet down. Be quiet. Grab the bats, hide them, call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Following defendant\u2019s arrest, he was treated at Muhlenberg Hospital for head injuries diagnosed as \u201ca contusion, a crushing of deep tissues\u201d that a police witness admitted were consistent with being hit on the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We address first defendant\u2019s argument that the court committed plain error in failing to charge attempted theft, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-1, as a lesser-ineluded offense of robbery, and that by failing to charge the lesser crime, the court in essence coerced the jury into finding defendant guilty of robbery as the only means for holding him legally accountable for attempting to steal Christian Guidos\u2019s car radio. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Although defense counsel inexplicably did not seek an attempted theft charge at the conclusion of trial, that crime was admitted by defendant, and it was his position throughout the trial proceedings that his conduct constituted an attempted theft, and nothing more. We acknowledge that the evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct in confrontations with Christian Guidos and his father following their discovery of the attempted theft was sufficient to support a conviction for second-degree robbery pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a(1), which includes within its purview the infliction of bodily injury or force upon another \u201cin an attempt to commit theft or in immediate flight after the attempt.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 495-501, 457 A.2d 455 (1983) (holding that injuries to a police officer seeking to apprehend defendant following a theft raised the crime from a theft to a robbery). Nonetheless, the jury could have viewed defendant\u2019s conduct after he was discovered in Christian\u2019s car as causally unrelated to the theft or as justified on grounds such as self-defense, a matter that we will discuss in the next section of this opinion. A charge on attempted theft should therefore have been given. <em>State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 179-81, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>827 A.2d 243 (2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>1160, 124 <em>S. Ct. </em>1169, 157 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1204 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">As Judge Pressler recently stated in <em>State v. Simms:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">It is virtually axiomatic that a defendant is entitled to the benefit of a charge explaining lesser-included offenses. The well-established rule is that if a charge on the lesser-included is requested, it must be given if rationally based on the evidence, and if not requested, must nevertheless be given if clearly indicated by the evidence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 179-181, 827 A.2d 243, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 <em>U.S. </em>1160, 124 <em>S.Ct </em>1169, 157 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>1204 (2004); <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 396-397, 799 A.2d 477 (2002); <em>State v. Dixon, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>223, 255-256, 593 A.2d 266 (1991). Beyond that, the judge has an independent obligation to instruct on clearly indicated lesser-included offenses even if the defendant objects. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>347, 361, 840 A.2d 242 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\"><em>[Simms, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 471, 849 A.2d 573 (App.Div.2004).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Because we find that the court\u2019s error in failing to charge attempted theft was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result,\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2, we reverse and remand this matter for a new trial. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971); <em>Simms, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 472, 849 A.2d 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">For the court\u2019s guidance upon retrial, we address defendant\u2019s argument that, on the evidence presented at the initial trial, he was entitled to a jury instruction on the right of self-defense against the use of excessive force pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4. In support of his claim that such force was utilized, defendant has relied on his own testimony that Christian struck him in the head with a wooden bat after defendant was found in Christian\u2019s car, and that both Christian and his father carried bats as they chased defendant down the street. Defendant has relied additionally on testimony by both Christian and himself that, at some point after defendant stopped his flight, Christian held him in a choke hold. Defendant does not appear to argue that he notified Christian of any intent to give up his flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">The State argues that a charge on use of force in self-defense was not warranted, even if it had been requested, which it was not, because the charge can be utilized only when the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>force by the initial aggressor (in this case, by Christian or his father) is unlawful. The State argues additionally that self-defense \u201cdoes not excuse committing a robbery\u201d and that defendant \u201ccannot belatedly attempt[] to justify his conduct after conviction by now claiming that self-defense should have been charged since he supposedly only used force against the victims because they used force against him when attempting to stop his crime in progress.\u201d We disagree, finding that upon a suitable factual showing, self-defense may be asserted as a defense to a charge of second-degree robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">a. ... Subject to the provisions of this section and of section 2C:3-9, the use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes that such force is Immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">b. Limitations on justifying necessity for use of force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">(1) The use of force is not justifiable under this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">(b) to resist force used by the occupier or possessor of property or by another person on his behalf, where the actor knows that the person using the force is doing so under a claim of right to protect the property, except that this limitation shall not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">(in) The actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3 \u2014 4b(1)(b)(iii) has not been judicially construed, we are satisfied that its construction follows that utilized in evaluating conduct under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(1)(a), which permits the use of reasonable force<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in self-defense in circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>stances in which a police officer has utilized excessive force in seeking to effect an arrest, regardless of whether the arrest is legal or not. <em>See, e.g., State v. Mulvihill, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>151, 270 A.2d 277 (1970). As stated in <em>Mulvihill: </em>\u201cIf, in effectuating the arrest or the temporary detention, the officer employs excessive and unnecessary force, the citizen may respond or counter with the use of reasonable force to protect himself, and if in so doing the officer is injured no criminal offense has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 156, 270 A.2d 277.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In <em>Mulvihill, </em>the Court emphasized the obligation of a citizen to submit quietly and without physical resistance to an arrest by an officer acting in the course of his duty, even if the arrest were illegal, since the right to be free from unreasonable seizure and confinement could be protected later through judicial process. <em>Ibid. </em>However the Court distinguished that circumstance from one in which excessive force by the arresting officer was met by reasonable resistance. Such resistance, the Court held, was lawful as a means designed to protect a person\u2019s bodily integrity and health. <em>Id. </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 156-57, 270 A.2d 277. \u201cSimply stated, the law recognizes that liberty can be restored through legal processes but life or limb cannot be repaired in a courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 157, 270 A.2d 277. Although recognizing a right to utilize reasonable force in this circumstance, the Court qualified the right by holding that a citizen cannot defend against an officer\u2019s excessive use of force by utilizing force greater than that which reasonably appears to be necessary. If greater force is used, the citizen becomes the aggressor and the right to claim self-defense is lost. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, if the arrestee recognizes that if he ceases his defensive measures and submits to arrest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>officer\u2019s unlawful exercise of excessive force will cease, the arrestee must submit or lose the privilege of self-defense. <em>Ibid. See also State v. Washington, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>160, 162-64, 270 A.2d 282 (1970); <em>Simms, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 472, 849 A.2d 573; <em>State v. Lore, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 282, 484 A.2d 1259 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Moriarty, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 573, 338 A.2d 14 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>172, 343 A.2d 459 (1975). <em>Compare State v. Doss, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 456-58, 708 A.2d 1219 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>589, 715 A.2d 992 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">None of the decisions that we have cited turned on whether the initial force of the arresting officer was illegal or not, and, as we have noted, <em>Mulvihill </em>expressly found that distinction to be immaterial. The emphasis was instead on the degree of force exerted in relationship to the goal of effecting an arrest. In this circumstance, excessiveness was substituted for unlawfulness in gauging whether self-defensive force was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We recognize that in the present case no arresting officer was on the scene at the time of the initial encounter between defendant and Christian, and no officer appeared until defendant had been thoroughly immobilized by the three persons who restrained him. Nonetheless, we find no principled legal basis for distinguishing the present case from one involving the excessive use of force by an arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">A person acting in defense of personal property is similarly justified in the use of reasonable force. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-6c. Further, except in certain instances in which force is used to repel an intruder in a dwelling <em>(see gen. N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4c; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-6b(3)), the use of force by one acting in defense of property is limited, like that of an arresting officer, to that which is reasonable in the circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Beyond that point, the defense of self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>defense may arise if injury occurs as a result of measures taken to counter the excessive force. <em>Cf. State v. Bess, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>10, 16, 247 A.2d 669 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We reject as too broad the State\u2019s argument that self-defense is unavailable as a defense to defendant because it cannot excuse commission of a robbery. In support of that position, the State relies principally on out-of-state decisions concerning armed robbery that adopt directly or by implication the principle that one who provokes an assault cannot then escape criminal liability by invoking self-defense. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </em>34 F.3d 44, 48 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom Lawrence v. U.S., </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>1101, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>774, 130 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>670 (1995); <em>State v. Bryant, </em>336 <em>S.C. </em>340, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999); <em>Gray v. Alaska, </em>463 P.2d 897, 909 (Alaska 1970); <em>People v. Beebe, </em>38 <em>Colo.App. </em>80, 557 P.2d 840, 841 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">That principle is consistent with New Jersey precedent. <em>See, e.g., State v. Moore, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>292, 311-12, 729 A.2d 1021 (1999) (defendant cannot claim self-defense when he was the aggressor); <em>State v. Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 628, 532 A.2d 215 (1987); <em>State v.

Rivers, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142, 149-50, 599 A.2d 558 (App.Div.1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4b(2)(a) (The use of deadly force is not justifiable if \u201c[t]he actor, with the purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, provoked the use of force against himself in the same encounter\u201d). Its rationale is inapplicable in instances such as this in which defendant contends that he was not the aggressor, and that no weapon, force or threat was utilized by him at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Of course, testimony may differ in a second trial. For that reason, we direct that, upon remand, the trial court determine on the basis of the record before it and the principles that we have set forth whether a tailored charge on self-defense <em>(State v. Gartland, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>456, 475-76, 694 A.2d 564 (1997); <em>State v. Bilek, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 10-12, 705 A.2d 366 (App.Div.1998)) is warranted. If it is found to be so, we note further that the jury must be instructed that the State bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense is untrue. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 200, 478 A.2d 364 (1984); <em>State v. Abbott, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>63, 72, 174 A.2d 881 (1961); <em>State v. Blanks, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 69-70, 712 A.2d 698 (App.Div.1998); <em>State v. Bryant, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 35-36, 671 A.2d 1058 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>589, 677 A.2d 761 (1996); <em>Rivers, supra, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 149, 599 A.2d 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Because we have already found grounds for reversal as the result of the court\u2019s failure to charge the lesser-included offense of theft in this case, we need not discuss defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error. We nonetheless note that it was improper for the prosecutor to urge the jurors to consider the peaceful character of Christian and Ernesto Guidos in the absence of any evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>relating to the issue and any instruction as to the proper use of such evidence, if any. Evidence that an alleged victim possesses a peaceful trait of character is admissible pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(2) only in a homicide prosecution. <em>See also State v. Aguiar, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 181, 730 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1999). Even if the evidence were otherwise admissible, in the present ease no such evidence appears in the record. The comment, which had the capacity to negate, in part, defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, was thus improper. <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 85, 727 A.2d 1 (1999); <em>State v. Clausell, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>298, 342, 580 A.2d 221 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We decline to address at length defendant\u2019s further argument that the court erred in permitting the prosecutor to argue over defense counsel\u2019s objection that Christian and Ernesto Guidos were more likely to tell the truth than defendant because they lacked any criminal convictions, finding the argument to have been incomplete at the time that the objection was interposed, and never meaningfully expressed to the jury after the objection was overruled. Nonetheless, we find no rule or precedent to support the position that the credibility of a witness can be bolstered by evidence of a lack of criminal convictions, and disapprove of any practice that suggests such to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Defendant additionally challenges the sentence on his conviction for robbery as excessive. In light of our reversal of that conviction, any consideration of that argument is unnecessary. Defendant does not appeal from his sentence of four years in custody for burglary, which would not merge with convictions either for theft or second-degree robbery. <em>State v. Subin, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 234-36, 536 A.2d 758 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>580, 546 A.2d 506 (1988) (theft); <em>State v. Pyron, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 504-05, 495 A.2d 467 (App.Div.1985) (second-degree robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Defendant\u2019s conviction for burglary was not appealed. His conviction for robbery is reversed, and the matter is remanded for re-trial on that charge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-14\"> The defendant must harbor an actual reasonable belief that his use of force is necessary to prevent the imminent application of unlawful force by the assailant. <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 199, 478 A.2d 364 (1984). The reasonableness of the belief is a jury issue. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 478 A.2d 364. In reaching its determination, the jury must use \u201can objective standard of what a reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>have done in defendant\u2019s position in light of the circumstances known to defendant at the time that the force was used.\u201d <em>State v. Aguiar, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 180, 730 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\"> An arresting officer is permitted to utilize force in effecting an arrest, as are persons assisting the officer, only as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> Similar principles apply to tort law. <em>See, e.g., Restatement (Second) Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 77, 81(1); Dan B. Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 76 at 170-71 (2001); <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, </em>Ch. 4, \u00a7 21 at 132 (5th ed.1984); <em>Hunt v. Caskey, </em>60 <em>A. </em>42 (N.J.Sup.Ct.1905).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"><em> </em>Two of the cases upon which the State relies are statutorily based. <em>See Snead v. State, </em>490 N.E.2d 761 (Ind.1986) and <em>Henderson v. State, </em>795 N.E.2d 473, 478 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). As a final matter, <em>State v. Celaya, </em>135 <em>Ariz. </em>248, 660 P.2d 849, 854 (1983), supports defendant\u2019s position, because it finds after analyzing the facts of the matter, that the defendant was entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of theft and on self-defense as it related to a determination of whether defendant could be found guilty of theft or robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\"> The State additionally relies upon <em>State v. Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>128, 158-59, 162, 590 A.2d 624 (1991). However, the Court in that murder case found that defendant might have been entitled to a charge of self-defense if requested. Because it was not requested and because the defense strategy was \"non-compatible\" with the charge, the court determined that it could not conclude that the trial court committed plain error in not charging self-defense <em>sua sponte. Id. </em>at 162, 590 A.2d 624. <em>See also State v. Vasquez, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 550, 628 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>A.2d 346 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>480, 634 A.2d 527 (1993) upon which the State also relies. The principal grounds for our determination in another case cited by the State, <em>State v. Doss, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 456-58, 708 A.2d 1219 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>589, 715 A.2d 992 (1998), that a self-defense charge was not required was the fact that insufficient evidence existed to support the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
