The trial judge imposed an extended term of fifty years with twenty-five years of parole ineligibility. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3. On July 6 the defendant moved for reconsideration which we granted because defendant\u2019s pro se supplemental brief had never been brought to our attention. We then filed a supplemental opinion reaffirming the conviction and the extended term sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-16\">In that opinion we summarily rejected defendant\u2019s nine claims of error and affirmed under <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). We now file this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>redacted version of our first supplemental opinion, for publication purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In an addendum to his supplemental filing, defendant had made this claim:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\n<em>LEGAL ARGUMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">APPELLANT\u2019S SENTENCING PROCEDURE IMPOSING THE <em>EXTENDED TERM, </em>DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS <em>STATE </em>AND <em>FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT </em>TO HAVE A JURY DETERMINE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT ALL FACTS LEGALLY ESSENTIAL TO HIS SENTENCE AND TO THE CONTRARY WAS A DENIAL OF APPELLANT\u2019S <em>DUE PROCESS/EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE </em>PURSUANT TO THE <em>U.S. CONST. 14th, </em>AND <em>6th AMEND. </em>AND <em>N.J. CONST. ART. 1. PARA 1, 9, </em>&amp; <em>10.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">We also reject this additional supplemental claim. As to this issue, freshly raised in the wake of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>_ <em>U.S. </em>_, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we find no merit. Defendant claims that his extended term was illegal and a violation of his constitutional rights. The extended term enhancement was based on defendant\u2019s criminal history as a persistent offender. <em>Id. </em>at 2536. <em>See State v. Dixon, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 139-41, 787 A.2d 211, 220-21 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>181, 796 A.2d 898 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">This case falls squarely within the recidivism exception to <em>Blakely </em>and does not require any further jury finding for enhancement purposes. Defendant conceded that he was a persistent offender. There is no constitutional infirmity. <em>See also Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>466, 488, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2348, 2361-62, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, 454 (2000). We reaffirm our ruling in <em>State v. Dixon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
