Plaintiffs are appealing from a grant of summary judgment dismissing their complaint in its entirety. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Plaintiffs were employed at PWs Morristown office. Lewis was hired as a broker in 1993 and Mandel was hired as a bond broker in 1994. Defendant Hayden was the Branch Manager and defendant Romany was the Branch Operations or Administrative Manager of the Morristown office. Hayden was Romany\u2019s direct supervisor. Romany was responsible for handling client complaints and agency inquiries, as well as providing liaison and fact-gathering support for litigation matters. She was also responsible for contacting clients regarding their accounts, especially if those accounts were listed on PW\u2019s \u201cMonthly Active Account Review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Hayden, as branch manager, was responsible for the daily review of trading in the accounts at the Morristown office. PW\u2019s Trade Monitor Manual authorized Hayden to delegate some of the necessary steps in reviewing the accounts to the branch management team, and he specifically designated Romany to contact clients of all the brokers in the Morristown office. She made approximately thirty calls per month to clients. Many of the brokers routinely complained to Hayden when Romany called their clients because the brokers were concerned that the calls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>gave their clients the impression that something was wrong with their accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Pursuant to PW policy, when Lewis was hired, she received a $180,000 inducement and a \u201cforgivable loan\u201d of $142,000. It was PWs policy to forgive the loan if the broker remained employed for four years. When Mandel was hired, he received a \u201cforgivable loan\u201d of $234,000. Notwithstanding their complaints of discrimination, tortious interference and third-party sexual harassment, both plaintiffs remained at PW for more than four years and then-loans were forgiven. Lewis voluntarily left her employment with PW in August 1998, and immediately found a new job. Mandel resigned in June 1998, rather than be terminated by the company, and he, too, found a new job immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that their income dropped each year they were employed at PW. They alleged \u201cupon <em>information and </em>belief\u2019 that Hayden and Romany were \u201cengaged in a close, intimate personal relationship.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lewis blamed Romany for the decrease in her income, claiming that Hayden found her attractive and that Romany was jealous, leading Romany to call Lewis\u2019s clients and undermine Lewis\u2019s accounts. Mandel claimed that his income declined each year he was employed at PW because of Romany\u2019s interference, as well. Both plaintiffs maintained that Romany did not like them because they were Jewish.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Throughout the litigation, plaintiffs maintained that Hayden and Romany were having an affair and that plaintiffs purportedly suffered from third-party sexual harassment by Romany as a result of her intimate relationship with Hayden. Indeed, plaintiffs continued to insist that Hayden and Romany were having an affair despite the fact that there was no factual basis for the allegation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Rather, plaintiffs relied on \u201cperception\u201d and office gossip in their attempt to create a basis for their claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Lewis made numerous allegations against Romany that were based on Lewis\u2019s \u201cfeelings.\u201d Among the allegations for which there was no factual basis was Lewis\u2019s claim that Romany was \u201cpossibly\u201d impersonating her, making appointments at beauty salons, nail salons or electrolysis offices in Lewis\u2019s name, and those establishments called Lewis to confirm these phantom appointments. Lewis further alleged that during her employment, items were stolen from her office, including jewelry, nail polish, paperwork, a mortgage payout and a diamond earring. Lewis \u201csuspected\u201d Romany of stealing her things, but admitted that she had no evidence whatsoever to support those suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Lewis acknowledged that it was Romany\u2019s job to contact clients regarding their accounts, but nevertheless alleged that Romany intended to poison Lewis\u2019s client relationships, causing Lewis\u2019s income to drop. Lewis submitted the testimony of four clients who received calls from Romany, none of whom indicated that Romany attempted to \u201cpoison\u201d their relationship with Lewis. Lewis further acknowledged that she and Romany often had cordial and personal conversations and that she could not remember any Jewish discrimination issues that arose during their conversations. Indeed, during her deposition, Lewis stated that \u201cfor me the issue was more of a hatred for being a woman more so than being Jewish.\u201d She complained to Hayden about Romany\u2019s not liking her, but claimed that Hayden never did anything in response to her complaints. She also complained to Human Resources because she was \u201cdistressed\u201d that Romany had referred to her as a \u201ccancer,\u201d but, again, made no complaint of religious or gender-based discrimination. Lewis claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Human Resources did nothing about her complaints either and that when Hayden found out she had gone to Human Resources, he came to Romany\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Lewis further alleged that Romany maintained an \u201cA-list\u201d and a \u201cB-list\u201d of brokers in the office; the \u201cB-list\u201d was comprised of the less favored brokers. Lewis admitted that the majority of brokers on Romany\u2019s B-list were not Jewish, but were of various religious and ethnic backgrounds. She nevertheless alleged that the lists were maintained to target Jewish brokers for unfair treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Mandel also claimed that Romany targeted him because he was Jewish. He nonetheless acknowledged that many Jewish brokers worked with Romany and were very successful. Mandel maintained, however, that he was \u201cvery, very much involved in [his] religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Mandel\u2019s complaints focused on his relationship with PWs municipal bond desk (bond desk). On his first day of employment in the Morristown office, he engaged in a shouting match with Nancy Hawkins, the supervisor of the municipal bond desk, over office policies. While he accused Romany of <em>coming </em>between him and the bond desk from his first day of employment, he admitted in his deposition that it was unlikely that Romany had influenced the bond desk at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Mandel\u2019s problems with the bond desk continued throughout his employment and he claimed that Romany interfered with every transaction between him and the bond desk. Hawkins, however, routinely complained to Hayden about Mandel\u2019s abusive office behavior and his practice of \u201cflipping,\u201d which was inconsistent with PW policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mandel was cited three times in 1994 for improperly entering \u201cblock orders\u201d with the bond desk. That is, Mandel failed to follow the PW policy requiring that \u201call employee and employee related orders be segregated and fully disclosed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>being employee or employee related at the time the order is entered.\u201d Mandel was cited for the same violation again in March 1995. Notwithstanding his repeated violations of PW policy, Mandel accused Romany of influencing the bond desk not to give him favorable prices. Despite his persistent allegations, at his deposition, Mandel admitted that he had no evidence to support his claim that Romany interfered with his relationship with the bond desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Moreover, Mandel\u2019s behavior to and about Romany was demeaning and sexist. For example, he admitted calling her a \u201cbitch\u201d when he was talking to other brokers in the office; and he acknowledged that he cursed in the office and called Romany \u201ca cunt\u201d when speaking to the other brokers. He conceded that his offensive language was against PWs Code of Conduct and that he could have been immediately terminated for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In February 1997, Mandel was suspended from dealing with the bond desk for ninety days because he had contacted dealers in California regarding bond offerings without first seeking permission. He acknowledged that Romany had nothing to do with his suspension. Moreover, during his suspension, Romany made many calls to the bond desk on his behalf. Mandel complained to Hayden about his suspension and his problems with the bond desk but did not refer to any problems with Romany, nor did Mandel mention that he was being discriminated against because of his religion. Mandel also complained to divisional management that Hawkins and the bond desk did not like him or his methods, but never mentioned Romany or religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">In 1998, the bond desk again refused to do business with Mandel. Hawkins, the bond desk supervisor, complained about Mandel to PWs Regional Manager, Barry Buchsbaum, who is Jewish. Buchsbaum decided to terminate Mandel, but Hayden persuaded him to permit Mandel to resign instead to make it easier for Mandel to get another job. In June 1998, Mandel resigned from PW and began working with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc., the same month.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Plaintiffs retained Jerome A. Cha\u00f1es as an expert in antiSemitism. Cha\u00f1es is an adjunct professor of sociology at Barnard College, an author of numerous published texts and articles, and active in the Jewish community. In his report, Cha\u00f1es recites as the factual basis for his opinion, plaintiffs\u2019 hearsay assertions of two remarks purportedly made by Romany. One of the \u201cJewish\u201d comments ascribed to Romany related to the office fantasy football league when Romany allegedly said, \u201cThis is the gentiles against the Jews and the plaque should never hang in anybody\u2019s office that doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas.\u201d Neither Mandel nor Lewis were present when that remark was reportedly made and neither heard about it until after they left their employment at PW. Romany also was alleged to have referred to Lewis as \u201csomething like a Jew bitch\u201d to another woman in the office. Again, Lewis was not present when the remark was purportedly made and did not learn of it until after she left PW.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Chanes\u2019s report presents a lengthy dissertation on anti-Semitism and concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">In my opinion, the behavior of defendant Jane Romany constituted discrete and explicit expressions of antisemitism, which, coupled with other abusive acts\u2014 themselves linked to, indeed of a piece with, antisemitic expression \u2014 constituted damage, including loss of income, to the plaintiffs Leonard Mandel and Susan Lewis. Whilst the overall incidence of antisemitism in the American workplace is low, consistent with data on the general state of Jewish security in America, instances of antisemitic expression in the workplace, especially in \u201ccorporate America,\u201d do exist (possibly to a greater extent than the formal data show) and those instances, when refracted through the prism of the overall security of America\u2019s Jews, are unusually traumatic and damaging.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Moreover, Cha\u00f1es dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 behaviors, particularly Mandel\u2019s conduct, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">To suggest that it was the behavior of the plaintiffs that resulted in damage to them and to their loss of income may be in some extremely-narrow, highly-literal, and very-limited sense true; but this would be a sorry and sad example of \u201cblaming the victim.\u201d I would suggest that this approach is violative of psychological and sociological theory and practice, of professional ethics, and of common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Plaintiffs also submitted an expert report prepared by Brad Palmer, a certified public accountant, to support their damages claims. Palmer analyzed plaintiffs\u2019 income from 1991 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>their employment at PW to their subsequent employment. He concluded that Lewis lost $2.1 million and Mandel lost $2.35 million while employed at PW.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Against this factual background defendants moved for a summary judgment. The motion was granted and plaintiffs appealed, arguing that (1) <em>N.J.R.E. </em>704 permits an expert to provide an opinion which embraces the ultimate issues to be decided by the trier of fact; (2) summary judgment should not have been granted where there were disputed material issues of fact; (3) the evidence supported plaintiffs\u2019 claims that they were treated in a disparate and hostile manner because of their religion; (4) plaintiffs were subjected to third-party sexual harassment as a result of the \u201cclose, intimate personal relationship\u201d between Hayden and Romany; (5) Lewis has stated a colorable claim of gender discrimination under the LAD; (6) Romany and Hayden tortiously interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 business relationships with their clients; (7) plaintiffs have stated valid claims against Romany and Hayden under the LAD; and (8) PW negligently retained Romany. We find no merit in these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment on their claims for hostile work environment and disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In assessing discrimination claims under the LAD, we employ a three-step, burden-shifting analysis developed under the federal anti-discrimination laws. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>792, 802, 93 <em>S.Ct </em>1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 677 (1973); <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. 55, </em>81-82, 389 A.2d 465 (1978). Under that approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">(1) the plaintiff must come forward with sufficient evidence to constitute a prima facie case of discrimination; (2) the defendant then must show a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision; and (3) the plaintiff must then be given the opportunity to show that defendant\u2019s slated reason was merely a pretext or discriminatory in its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>[Dixon v. Rutgers, The State Univ. of N.J., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>432, 442, 541 A.2d 1046 (1988) (citing <em>Peper, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 82-83, 389 A.2d 465; <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>at 807, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1826, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 680).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">When there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff-employee must first prove by a preponderance of the evidence the four elements of a prima facie case. <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>at 802, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d at 677. <em>See Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 209, 723 A.2d 944 (1999) (holding that cases relying on circumstantial evidence should use the burden-shifting methodology of <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas). The general structure of a prima facie case under <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requires a plaintiff to prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">(1) that he or she is a member of a protected class; (2) that he or she was qualified for the job; (3) that he or she was negatively affected by the defendant\u2019s employment decisions; and (4) that he or she was treated less favorably than employees not within the protected class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\"><em>[Murphy v. Horn. Auth. &amp; Urban Redevelopment Agency of Atlantic City, </em>32 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>753, 763 (D.N.J.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>208 F.3d 206 (3d Cir.2000).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">If a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, it creates a presumption of discrimination, and the burden shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its actions against plaintiff. <em>Mogull v. CB Commercial Real Estate Group, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>449, 462, 744 A.2d 1186 (2000); <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 723 A.2d 944. Once the employer produces evidence of a legitimate reason for its actions, the presumption of discrimination disappears, and the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the employer\u2019s reasons were a pretext for discrimination, i.e., they were false, and the real reason was discrimination. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>502, 515, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2742, 2751-52, 125 L.Ed.2d 407, 422 (1993); <em>Mogull, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 462, 744 A.2d 1186; <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 723 A.2d 944. The ultimate burden of proof always remains with the plaintiff. <em>St. Mary\u2019s, supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 518, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 423; <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 723 A.2d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the motion judge ignored their expert\u2019s report and dismissed its critical value. They argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Chanes\u2019s report embraced the ultimate issue of fact and was therefore admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>704. They maintain, moreover, that given the quantity and quality of Chanes\u2019s unrebutted opinions regarding Romany\u2019s behavior, the judge erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We disagree with plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that an unrebutted expert opinion is admissible per se simply because it addresses the ultimate issue of fact. The trier of fact has no duty to give controlling effect to uncontradicted expert testimony and it need not accord the expert testimony greater weight than other evidence. <em>Waterson v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>238, 248, 544 A.2d 357 (1988). Expert testimony should be weighed and judged as any other testimony and may be totally disregarded. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The standard on summary judgment, however, is not to weigh the credibility or preponderance of the evidence. <em>Tomeo v. Thomas Whitesell Constr. Co., </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>366, 370, 823 A.2d 769 (2003). Rather, in determining a motion for summary judgment, the judge must decide whether \u201cthe competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational fact/finder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Summary judgment must be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). \u201cIf there exists a single, unavoidable resolution of the alleged disputed issue of fact, that issue should be considered insufficient to constitute a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of material fact for purposes of <em>Rule </em>4:46-2.... [Wjhen the evidence \u2018is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law,\u2019 the trial court should not hesitate to grant summary judgment.\u201d <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146 (citation omitted). On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>we apply the same standard. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">An expert\u2019s opinion cannot provide the factual basis for denying summary judgment. <em>See Todd v. Sheridan, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 401, 633 A.2d 1009 (App.Div.1993). Indeed, an expert\u2019s opinion is rendered a \u201cnet opinion\u201d if it is based on unfounded facts. <em>Brach, Eichler, P.C. v. Ezekwo, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 11, 783 A.2d 246 (App.Div.2001). Chanes\u2019s report is grounded on plaintiffs\u2019 essentially unsupported allegations. The only anti-Semitic allegations are (1) Romany\u2019s purported remark during the office fantasy football league: \u201cThis is the gentiles against the Jews and the plaque should never hang in anybody\u2019s office who doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas;\u201d and (2) Romany\u2019s purported reference to Lewis as \u201csomething like a Jew bitch,\u201d to another employee. Neither of the plaintiffs heard these remarks or were even aware of them until after they left PW. None of the other allegations against Romany, including her alleged affair with Hayden, are supported by anything more than plaintiffs\u2019 suspicions and office gossip. Moreover, Cha\u00f1es ignores Mandel\u2019s conduct and states that taking Mandel\u2019s conduct into consideration is tantamount to \u201cblaming the victim.\u201d Taken to its logical conclusion, in Chanes\u2019s opinion no employee in a protected category under the LAD could be reprimanded, disciplined or terminated by an employer, regardless of how offensive that employee\u2019s conduct may be, because that would be \u201cblaming the victim.\u201d Obviously, this is not the intent of the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Chanes\u2019s opinion, which is based upon unsupported allegations, lacks the necessary foundation and is a \u201cnet opinion.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Brack, Eichler, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 11, 783 A.2d 246; <em>Gore v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 303-04, 762 A.2d 292 (App.Div.2000); <em>Grzanka v.

Disparate treatment is demonstrated when a member of \u201ca protected group is shown to have been singled out and treated less favorably than others similarly situated on the basis of an impermissible criterion\u201d under the anti-discrimination laws. <em>EEOC v. Metal Serv. Co., </em>892 F.2d 341, 347 (3d Cir.1990). \u201cThe burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous\u201d; the function of the prima facie case is to eliminate \u201cthe most common nondiseriminatory reasons for the plaintiffs rejection.\u201d <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>v.

That is, \u201c[t]he initial burden of showing a prima facie case is met when the plaintiff shows that \u2018it is more likely than not\u2019 that the employer\u2019s actions were based on unlawful considerations.\u201d <em>Dixon, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 443, 541 A.2d 1046 (quoting <em>Furnco Constr.

Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 763 (3d Cir.1994). On a motion for summary judgment, the judge must determine whether a plaintiff alleging disparate treatment has produced sufficient evidence to rebut the employer\u2019s alleged legitimate reason for its adverse action. <em>Id. </em>at 764. The plaintiff may defeat the motion \u201cby <em>either </em>(i) discrediting the proffered reasons, either circumstantially or directly, or (ii) adducing evidence, whether circumstantial or direct, that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">The non-moving plaintiff must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, ineohereneies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder <em>could </em>rationally find them \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d <em>Ezold [v. Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, </em>983 F.2d 509, 531 (3d Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>826, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>88, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>56 (1993) 1, and hence infer \u201cthat the employer did not act for [the asserted] nondiseriminatory reasons.\u201d <em>Josey v. John R. Hollingsworth Corp., </em>996 <em>F.2d </em>632, 638 (3d Cir.1993). <em>[Fuentes, supra, </em>32 F.3d at 765 (alteration in original); (other citations omitted); (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">We have adopted and applied the <em>Fuentes </em>standard in reviewing a grant of summary judgment in disparate treatment cases under the LAD. <em>See, e.g., Kolb v. Burns, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 479-83, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999) (holding that a teacher who alleged the superintendent of schools retaliated against her for testifying in favor of a handicapped student regarding his placement had presented sufficient evidence to rebut defendants\u2019 proffered reasons to overcome summary judgment); <em>Greenberg v. Camden County Vocational &amp; Technical Schs., </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 207, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>708 A.2d 460 (App.Div.1998) (holding that a teacher who alleged age and gender discrimination in denial of tenure had sufficiently-rebutted defendant\u2019s proffered reasons to overcome a motion for summary judgment); and <em>Romano v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>284 <em>N. J.Super. </em>543, 554, 665 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.1995) (holding that an employee who alleged retaliatory discharge for testifying on behalf of a co-employee in her sexual harassment case \u201cestablished enough of an inference that defendant\u2019s proffered reason was not the actual motivating reason behind its actions\u201d to defeat a motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Here, plaintiffs contend that they established a prima facie case because they were qualified for their positions and they are Jewish. Nevertheless, there is simply no evidence of discriminatory animus to support plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of disparate treatment. A plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate that the employer was motivated by discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Viscik v. Fowler Equip. Co., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 800 A.2d 826 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">First, there is no evidence that Romany treated Jewish brokers less favorably than the other brokers. Most of the people on her \u201cB-list\u201d were not Jewish, and most of the top brokers in the office were Jewish.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Second, Lewis presented no evidence to show that Romany singled her out because she was Jewish. PW\u2019s manuals show that Romany, as Branch Administrative Manager, was responsible for calling Lewis\u2019s clients. Moreover, none of Lewis\u2019s clients testified that Romany made any discriminatory statements, nor did any of Lewis\u2019s clients refuse to use Lewis as a broker after Romany\u2019s calls. Similarly, Lewis presented no evidence to show that Romany instigated the calls to Lewis from beauty or nail salons.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Third, Mandel cannot show that Romany interfered in his relationship with the bond desk. Mandel admitted that he had engaged in a shouting match with the bond desk supervisor on the very first day of his employment and that the bond desk eventually refused to deal with him due to his conduct. He has not cited a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>single instance in which Romany interfered with his relationship with the bond desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Fourth, and most important, there is no evidence \u2014 other than plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s opinion \u2014 that the decrease in plaintiffs\u2019 income was due to any disparate discriminatory treatment by Romany. Damages alone cannot constitute a prima facie case of disparate treatment. <em>See Nappe v. Anschelewitz, Barr, Ansell &amp; Bonello, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>37, 41 n. 1, 477 A.2d 1224 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We, therefore, affirm dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claims of disparate treatment based on religious discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in dismissing their cause of action for third-party sexual harassment. Plaintiffs based this claim on their allegation that Hayden and Romany were \u201cengaged in a close, intimate personal relationship.\u201d Despite the fact that this case was pending for two and one-half years before summary judgment was granted, plaintiffs never presented one iota of evidence to support that allegation beyond office gossip and \u201cperception.\u201d Indeed, at oral argument before the motion judge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel finally admitted that the allegation was \u201cspeculation.\u201d Nevertheless, plaintiffs have persisted in the claim through this appeal and now argue that they \u201cwere denied discovery on the issue\u201d because subpoenas for Hayden\u2019s and Romany\u2019s personnel records from their prior employers were quashed. Plaintiffs have not appealed the orders quashing those subpoenas, however, and we will consider the record before us which is devoid of evidence supporting an \u201cintimate\u201d or sexual relationship between Hayden and Romany. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">To sustain a claim for third-party sexual harassment, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) employment opportunities or benefits were bestowed upon a third party due to that third party\u2019s \u201csubmission\u201d to the employer\u2019s coercive sexual advances; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and (2) the plaintiff was qualified for but was denied the same opportunities or benefits bestowed on the third party because of the coerced sexual harassment. <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 557, 569 A.2d 793 (1990). An adverse employment action allegedly resulting from a consensual, non-eoercive relationship between the employer and the third party, is insufficient to establish a claim of third-party sexual harassment. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">A sexual relationship between a supervisor and a co-employee could adversely affect the workplace without creating a hostile sexual environment. A supervisor could show favoritism that, although unfair and unprofessional, would not necessarily instill the workplace with oppressive sexual accentuation. The boss could treat everyone but his or her paramour badly and all of the subordinates, save the paramour, might be affected in the same way. <em>Erickson </em>clearly states that this kind of situation does not create a claim for sexual harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\"><em>[Drinkwater v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>904 F.2d 853, 862 (3d Cir.1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Even the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has adopted the position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit isolated instances of preferential treatment based upon consensual romantic relationships:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">Not all types of sexual favoritism violate Title VII. It is the Commission\u2019s position that Title VII does not prohibit isolated instances of preferential treatment based upon consensual romantic relationships. An isolated instance of favoritism toward a \u201cparamour\u201d (or a spouse, or a Mend) may be unfair, but it does not discriminate against women or men in violation of Title VII, since both are disadvantaged for reasons other than their genders. A female [plaintiff] who is denied an employment benefit because of such sexual favoritism would not have been treated more favorably had she been a man nor, conversely, was she treated less favorably because she was a woman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">[EEOC Policy Guidance on Employer Liability under Title VII for Sexual Favoritism, EEOC Notice No. 915-048, at 2 (Jan. 12,1990), as cited in <em>Harvey v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>961 <em>F.Supp. </em>1017, 1030 (S.D.Tex.1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 third-party allegation of sexual harassment requires proof of a <em>coerced </em>sexual relationship between Hayden and Romany. Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any sexual relationship, let alone a coerced sexual relationship. Accordingly, the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 third-party sexual harassment claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Lewis contends that the judge erred in dismissing her cause of action for gender discrimination. Again, Lewis failed to present any factual evidence to support her allegations and \u201csuspicions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Once again, during oral argument before the motion judge, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acknowledged, \u201cWe don\u2019t have actual evidence of this other than ... [Lewis\u2019s] speculation----\u201d Lewis now argues that Hayden made comments about her legs, and that his complimentary comments compounded the hostility that Romany had toward her. Lewis maintains that the \u201cperception\u201d that Hayden and Romany were having an affair somehow supports her claim that Romany was hostile towards other women, particularly her. \u201cPerception\u201d like \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201csuspicion\u201d cannot support a cause of action. Viewing the evidence in a light favorable to Lewis, the record contains no evidence that any harassment by Romany was based on gender. The dismissal of her gender discrimination claim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Plaintiffs next contend that the judge erred in dismissing their claims for tortious interference with their prospective business relationships with their clients. The motion judge found that plaintiffs failed to identify even a single client with whom defendants had interfered and concluded that there was \u201cnothing other than pure speculation as to ... the cause ... for their loss in income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">\u201cThere is no question that New Jersey law protects both contracts and prospective business relationships from tortious interference.\u201d <em>Van Natta Mech. Corp. v. Di Staulo, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 182, 649 A.2d 399 (App.Div.1994). To establish that cause of action plaintiffs must demonstrate that (1) they had some reasonable expectation of economic advantage; (2) the defendants\u2019 actions were malicious in the sense that the harm was inflicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>intentionally and without justification or excuse; (3) the interference caused the loss of the prospective gain or there was a reasonable probability that the plaintiff would have obtained the anticipated economic benefit, and (4) the injury caused the plaintiff damage. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 751-52, 563 A.2d 31 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u201c[I]t is \u2018fundamental\u2019 to a cause of action for tortious interference with a prospective economic relationship that the claim be directed against defendants who are not parties to the relationship.\u201d <em>Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 752, 563 A.2d 31; <em>See Van Natta, supra, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 649 A.2d 399; <em>Silvestre v. Bell Atl. Corp., </em>973 <em>F.Supp. </em>475, 486 (D.N.J.1997) (holding that \u201c[a] tortious interference with contract claim can be waged only against a third-party who is not a party to the contractual or economic relationship at issue.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>156 F.3d 1225 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Plaintiffs argue that PWs clients essentially contract only with their particular brokers and not with the financial services corporation or trading firm. They have produced no evidence to support that claim, however. Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that plaintiffs were PW employees and their clients were PWs clients: plaintiffs were compensated by PW, PW paid them commissions on sales for their clients\u2019 accounts, PW extended \u201cforgivable loans\u201d to plaintiffs, and PW supervised their accounts, their trading practices and conduct. Moreover, plaintiffs have specifically alleged that they were PW employees and that Hayden and Romany were their supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Inasmuch as plaintiffs and defendants were, at all times, parties to the corporate relationship between PW and its clients, plaintiffs cannot maintain an action for tortious interference against defendants. \u201cOne cannot interfere with one\u2019s own economic relationship, since in such an instance the matter is governed by principles of contract law.\u201d <em>Van Natta, supra, 277 N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 649 A.2d 399. <em>Accord Sandler v.

The tortious interference claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Based upon our holding affirming the grant of summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the LAD and for tortious interference, we need not address plaintiffs\u2019 arguments respecting the claims against Hayden and Romany individually and as aiders and abettors under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(e), or plaintiffs\u2019 claim against PW for negligent retention of Romany.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">In their reply brief, plaintiffs contend that the $500 sanction imposed by the judge on their attorney personally must be reversed because it constituted an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">During the June 21, 2002 oral argument on defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, the judge initially noted that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel ignored the requirements of <em>R. </em>4:46 \u2014 2(b) in failing to file a statement with the court responding to, admitting or denying each of defendants\u2019 statements of material facts filed pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:46-2(a). The motion judge noted that the violation \u201cwas brought to [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s] attention and nobody moved to correct it.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded that her partner filed the responding papers, and she had no explanation for the firm\u2019s noncompliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>with the rule. She apologized, stating that \u201c[i]t was just an oversight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The motion judge commented that she and her law clerk \u201chad to spend hours and days\u201d going through the record. \u201c[I]nstead, what you forced the two of us to do is to struggle through everything because you didn\u2019t do your job.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the judge ordered sanctions against plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in the amount of $500 \u201cfor violation of a court rule [and for] delaying the Court\u2019s time in doing its work properly and interfering with other things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The requirements of <em>R. </em>4:46-2(a) and (b) for filing statements of material facts by parties to a motion for summary judgment are designed to \u201cfocus ... attention on the areas of actual dispute\u201d and \u201cfacilitate the court\u2019s review\u201d of the motion. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment <em>R. </em>4:46-2. Indeed, we noted in <em>Housel v.

Judges have \u201can inherent authority\u201d to impose sanctions for blatant violations of our court rules apart from any specific provisions setting forth those sanctions. <em>Summit Trust Co. v.

The document clearly does not comply with the rule, however. It appears to be an unsigned affidavit by one unnamed plaintiff and is not responsive to defendants\u2019 Statements of Material Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has given no reason for failing to comply with the court rule. Moreover, it appears from the record that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel was made aware of the violation prior to oral argument but still failed to file a compliant statement. In our view, the motion judge did not abuse her discretion by imposing a $500 sanction on plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. The sanction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In defendants\u2019 cross-appeal, they argue that the motion judge erred in denying their application for counsel fees pursuant to the frivolous litigation statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A.15-59.1, and the LAD\u2019s fee-shifting provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1. Defendants contend that they are entitled to fees because plaintiffs\u2019 claims were based on fabricated allegations that had no reasonable basis in fact or law. In denying defendants\u2019 application for counsel fees, the motion judge indicated that the test is whether the action was filed in bad faith. She concluded that although plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence to maintain their claims, they did not act in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">After oral argument before us, we were particularly dismayed by plaintiffs\u2019 persistence in pursuing their allegation that Hayden and Romany \u201cengaged in a close, intimate personal relationship.\u201d When pressed for the factual basis for this claim, plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>counsel equivocated on whether \u201cintimate\u201d meant \u201csexual\u201d and once again relied on nothing more than office gossip in insisting that \u201cperceptions\u201d are sufficient to pursue a claim for third-party sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Notwithstanding our concerns with plaintiffs\u2019 failure to present factual evidence to support their claims, we do not find that the motion judge abused her discretion in denying defendants\u2019 motion for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> The \"facts\u201d purportedly underlying plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of a \"close, intimate personal relationship\u201d between Hayden and Romany are that they had lunch together almost every day and met at the gym in the morning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\"> At oral argument, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel indicated that the allegation of a \"close, intimate personal relationship\u201d did not necessarily mean Hayden and Romany were having a sexual affair. When questioned as to his use of the term \"intimate,\" counsel gave a Clintonesque response that \"intimate\" did not necessarily mean \"sexual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\"> The term \"flipping\" refers to the practice of selling a bond to another broker, rather than a PW client, at a heavily discounted price. The broker in turn sells the bond to another broker, and the PW broker earns a commission on the deal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\"> Although plaintiffs initially raised this issue in their reply brief filed on November 3, 2003, we granted their motion to consider this issue as if it had been raised in their merits brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> We can empathize with the trial judge. On appeal, plaintiffs have submitted nine volumes of appendices incorporating more than 1,100 pages, in addition to their seventy-nine page initial brief and their forty-page reply brief, albeit we granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to file an overlong brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
