Zeidell, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>417, 713 A.2d 401 (1998), the Supreme Court defined second-degree-tender-years sexual assault as an intentional touching by the actor of his or her intimate parts, for arousal or sexual gratification, <em>in the view of </em>an underage child, whom the actor knows to be present. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 713 A.2d 401 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b, 14-1d). The central question we must answer in this appeal is: can a defendant be convicted of this offense when it is undisputed that the underage victim did not actually view the allegedly offensive conduct? After consideration of the arguments advanced by the parties and in light of prevailing legal standards, we conclude that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">An analysis of this issue requires us to demarcate the outer limits of conduct sufficient to constitute \u201cin the view of\u2019 the underage victim. Ordinarily, \u201cin the view of\u2019 contemplates a scenario where the victim actually witnesses the offensive conduct. We hold, however, that, in order to satisfy this statutory element, the State is not required to prove that the underage child actually observed the offensive touching. To establish that the offensive conduct occurred \u201cin the view of\u2019 the underage victim, it is sufficient for the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that either (1) the underage child actually observed the act; or (2) there was an unreasonable risk that the underage child might view the act. Our holding in this respect is informed by the Court\u2019s dictum in <em>Zeidell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Defendant Russell Breitweiser was tried before a jury and convicted of seeond-degree-tender-years sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. The court granted the State\u2019s motion for an extended term of imprisonment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a, and, thereafter, sentenced defendant to: (1) serve a discretionary extended term of fifteen years, with seven and one-half years to be served without parole eligibility; (2) comply with the registration requirements imposed by \u201cMegan\u2019s Law;\u201d (3) submit to community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>supervision for life; (4) provide a DNA sample for inclusion in a sex offender population database; and (5) serve a five-year term of parole supervision commencing upon Ms release from prison. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -19; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-6.4. The court also imposed the mandatory fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Defendant now appeals raising the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS CHARGE TO THE JURY AND IMPROPERLY INCORPORATED LANGUAGE FROM <em>STATE V.

On March 6, 2001, Thomas Wolf was working as a loss prevention officer in a Shop Rite supermarket located in Franklin Township. He was stationed in a catwalk located in the rear of the store when he first noticed defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Wolf described the catwalk as \u201ca hallway which overhangs the back of the store, which allows loss prevention personnel and authorized store management to monitor the store [by looking] through vents.\u201d These modified heating vents, which were also referred to as viewing ports during the trial, are located at the end of each store aisle. The particular vent that Wolf was looking through when he sighted defendant measured over nineteen inches in length and over four inches in width. A series of slats ran vertically across the vent with each separated from the other by one-half inch of space.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Through the vent, Wolf observed defendant walk past aisle two carrying a rotisserie chicken. Also in aisle two, standing by the eye care section, was an eight-year-old girl whom we will refer to as \u201cNancy.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant was thirty-seven years old at the time. From his vantage point Wolf saw defendant walk directly toward Nancy. As defendant got within a few feet of the child, she turned around, looked straight at him and walked around him, going across the aisle to the greeting cards section. Defendant then began walking down the aisle toward the front of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">There was one unidentified woman standing near the greeting cards rack when Nancy reached this area. As he walked down the aisle, defendant continued to look back toward the area where the woman and Nancy were standing. When the woman left the area, defendant immediately turned around and headed straight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>toward <em>Nancy. </em>Wolf gave <em>the </em>following description of what occurred next.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Q. Where was the Defendant looking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">A. Looking directly at [Nancy].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">Q. Did he look at any other merchandise in that aisle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">A. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">Q. While the Defendant turned around and looked at [Nancy], did he proceed to walk anywhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">A. Yes, he proceeded to walk towards [Nancy].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">Q. How close did he get to [Nancy]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">A. Within one foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-14\">Q. While he proceeded to walk towards [Nancy], from what vantage point were you able to see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-15\">A. I was above the aisle, in the catwalk, and I had a full vantage point. There was nothing <em>obstructing my view.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-16\">Q. Full frontal view of him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-17\">A. Frontal view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-18\">Q. Could you see him head to toe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-19\">A. Yes, I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-20\">Q. While you had that full frontal view of the Defendant and he was walking towards [Nancy], did he do anything with his hand that caught your attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqqt\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-21\">Q. What did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-22\">A. He began to masturbate through his jeans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-23\">Q. You\u2019re using the word \u201cmasturbate\u201d, I have to ask you this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-24\">A. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-25\">Q. How do you know that he was masturbating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-26\">A. Because he was grabbing his penis and stroking it in an up and down motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXn\">Q. Could you see his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-27\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-28\">Q. Would you be able to demonstrate for the jury the way that the Defendant had his hand positioned in relation to his penis on the clothes? Could you demonstrate for us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-29\">A. Yes, It was half cupped, like this, and he was stroking it back and \u2014 up and down on his penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-30\">Q. Cupped in such a way, could you tell whether it was cupped around the penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaH\">DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Objection, Judge, that\u2019s a leading question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-31\">THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-32\">A. Repeat the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Q. Was it cupped in such a way that you could tell whether it was cupped around something or around the penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">A. You could tell it was definitely on the penis. I couldn\u2019t tell you if it was directly around it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Q. As he was, as the Defendant was walking towards [Nancy], you said he was \u2014 I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, moving his hand up and down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">A. He was stroking it up and down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">Q. Where was he looking as he was walking towards [Nancy] with his hand on his penis stroking it up and down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">A. He was looking at, directly at [Nancy].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">Q. Did he stop to look at any merchandise in the aisle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">Q. Did you see him turn his head to look at any merchandise in the aisle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-14\">Q. Did he ever turn his head at all from where [Nancy] was positioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-15\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-16\">Q. When he got up behind \u2014 you said he got right up next to [Nancy]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-17\">A. Yes, right behind her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-18\">Q. While you were watching this happen, were you actually counting the number of seconds that it was happening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-19\">A. I wasn\u2019t counting the number of seconds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-20\">Q. When the Defendant got right up behind [Nancy], what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-21\">A. He got right behind her, he was still stroking himself, and about a split second [Nancy] turned around and noticed that he was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-22\">Q. After [Nancy] turned around, well, when she turned around, who did she look at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-23\">A. The Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-24\">Q. And during this period of time that the Defendant walked up to [Nancy] and is initially standing behind her, is anybody else in that greeting card aisle besides the Defendant and [Nancy]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-25\">A. No, there is not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-26\">On cross-examination, Wolf testified that he did not see defendant expose his penis or any other part of his genitalia. He also did not see any indication that defendant had an erection.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-27\">The entire episode was captured on videotape by a store security surveillance camera. The recording was admitted into evidence and shown to the jury. In contrast to Wolfs \u201cfull frontal view\u201d line of vision, the camera recorded defendant\u2019s movement from behind and to the side. Although the recording is unable to fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>corroborate Wolfs description of defendant\u2019s \u201cmasturbation-like\u201d movements as he walked toward Nancy, it does show defendant\u2019s hand move to his groin area. Defendant is also seen ostensibly walking down the aisle and away from Nancy, while repeatedly looking back at an adult woman as she walks out of the aisle. Once the woman leaves, defendant immediately turns around and heads directly to where Nancy is standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The videotape clearly shows defendant standing in close proximity to and directly behind the child during the time Wolf testified the sexual touching took place. In fact, at one point, the tape shows defendant standing at an angle to the child, in such a manner as to place his movements within the scope of her peripheral vision. The recording also shows that the child turned her head, as if sensing defendant\u2019s presence, and looked straight at defendant. The camera\u2019s on-screen chronometer indicated that the entire episode lasted approximately ten seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">It is undisputed that Nancy never saw defendant touch himself. In fact, the evidence is clear that Nancy left the store that day unaware that anything untoward had taken place. Her parents, in an effort to shield her from the traumatic experience of having to testify at the trial, refused to cooperate with the State in this prosecution. It is thus entirely possible that this child remains, to this day, blissfully unaware that this entire incident ever took place.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Wolf detained defendant as he was about to leave the store and escorted him to the manager\u2019s office. Once there, he advised defendant that he was not suspected of shoplifting and asked him if he knew why he was being detained. According to Wolf, defendant responded: \u201cbecause of the little girl.\u201d Also present at the time was store manager Salvatore Gatto, who testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>defendant repeated this statement, \u201cbecause of the little girl\u201d two to three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it relied on the following dictum from <em>Zeidell </em>to (1) deny his motion to dismiss the indictment; (2) deny his motion for a judgment of acquittal; and (3) craft the instructions given to the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">[Slexual assault does not require the underage child to actually observe the touching. The requirement \u201cin the view of\u2019 an underage child does not require any <em>mens rea </em>at all; it is a factual question: Was the prohibited act done in a child\u2019s field of vision or not? <em>Alternatively, \u201cin view of\u2019 could be interpreted to mean that there were unreasonable risks that an underage child present might view the act. </em>Here, evidence established that defendant knew the children were present and that he was in their field of vision. The testimony that the children actually saw the prohibited act establishes that the act must have been in their view. Thus, where there is an actual underage child who has actually viewed the defendant and as in this case, whose presence is known by the defendant, <em>the Court need not reach the more difficult question of whether the defendant would be guilty if he engaged in sexual contact in front of a child'whom he knew to be present and within view, but who, for whatever reason, did not actually view or observe the conduct. In the latter situation, the \u201cin view of\u2019 standard could constitute a basis for strict liability under the Code and the defendant might be guilty regardless of whether a child whom he knew to be present actually witnessed the act. In contrast, the \u201cin view of\u2019 standard might constitute a basis for guilt if there was an unreasonable risk that a child might see the defendant engage in the sexual contact. </em>Those issues, however, are not raised by the facts in this case, and we decline to reach them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\"><em>[Zeidell, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 431-32, 713 A.2d 401 (emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">As the <em>Zeidell </em>Court itself recognized, the emphasized language cited above touched upon legal issues that were not raised by the factual context of the case. In that sense, the Court\u2019s analysis is clearly dictum. That being said, we find little analytical value in attempting to draw meaningful distinctions between a Supreme Court\u2019s holding and expressions of well-reasoned dictum. Both are legal pronouncements by our State\u2019s highest judicial body and are therefore worthy of and entitled to the utmost respect. Indeed, as an intermediate appellate court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>we consider ourselves bound by carefully considered dictum from the Supreme Court. <em>Barreiro v. Morais, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 468-69, 723 A.2d 1244 (App.Div.1999). <em>See also Commercial Realty and Resources Corp. v. First Atlantic Properties Co., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>577, 590 n. 9, 563 A.2d 866 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd as modified </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>546, 585 A.2d 928 (1991) (\u201cDicta by our Supreme Court is entitled to weight.\u201d); <em>Lehigh Valley R.R. Co. v. Chapman, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>177, 187, 171 A.2d 653, <em>cert. denied, </em>368 <em>U.S. </em>928, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>364, 7 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d 192 (1961); <em>cf. Shaw v. City of Jersey City, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 229, 787 A.2d 268 (App.Div.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>567, 811 A.2d 404 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We do recognize, however, that there are situations where the Court engages in collateral discussions about a subject matter that is not before it, for either didactic purposes, or as a means of elucidating a complex legal principle. We are satisfied that the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Zeidell, </em>relied upon by the trial court, constituted dictum entitled to deferential application because, although not necessary to the decision reached, the language cited dealt directly with the central issue in the case, to wit, the delineation of conduct sufficient to support a conviction for seeond-degree-tender-years sexual assault. <em>See, e.g., Crescent Ring Co. v. Travelers\u2019 Indem. Co., </em>102 <em>N.J.L. </em>85, 89, 132 A. 106 (E. &amp; A.1926); <em>In re Chadwick\u2019s Will, </em>80 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>168, 82 A. 918 (Prerog.Ct.1912). We will thus utilize it here to guide and inform our analysis of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">We are confronted here, as was the trial court, with the \u201cmore difficult question\u201d the <em>Zeidell </em>Court acknowledged was not directly before it. That is, can a defendant be found guilty of second-degree-tender-years sexual assault when (1) the child does not see defendant engage in the sexual contact; and (2) the contact occurs while the child has his/her back to defendant? In addressing these issues, we will be guided by the <em>Zeidell </em>Court\u2019s analysis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>will utilize the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d standard the Court predicted would apply to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Defendant argues that, even if there is no requirement that the child actually sees the act, the offending conduct must, at least, take place within her \u201cfield of vision.\u201d Through its verdict, the jury found that def\u00e9ndant engaged in what Wolf described as over-the-clothing \u201cmasturbation-like\u201d movements, from a distance of approximately one foot away and directly behind the eight-year old victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this light, and without conceding culpability, defendant argues that his conduct was never in the child\u2019s field of vision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument lacks both textual and common sense support. As previously noted, the Supreme Court has stated that a victim of second-degree-tender-years sexual assault need not actually observe the offending conduct. <em>Zeidell, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 713 A.2d 401. <em>See also State v. Hackett, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>66, 74-75, 764 A.2d 421 (2001). In our judgment, the so-called \u201cin the field of vision\u201d test includes, as an indispensable component, the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d factor. That is, as stated by the Court in <em>Zeidell, </em>there must be \u201can unreasonable risk that the child might see the defendant engage in the sexual contact.\u201d <em>Zeidell, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 432, 713 A.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">What amounts to an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d involves, by necessity, a fact-sensitive analysis. Here, defendant stood in close proximity to the child while he engaged in the sexual contact. The fact that she was facing away from him is of no moment. There was clearly an unreasonable risk that she would turn her head and look behind her, which she did at one point. We see no meaningful distinction between a child who is facing the actor, with her head down, perhaps reading a book, and one who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>standing with her back to him. In both instances, the child-victim is exposed to the unreasonable risk that he or she might see the actor engaged in the prohibited act. In fact, a literal application of the \u201cline of vision\u201d test could criminalize conduct that takes place seventy-five feet from the victim and insulate from prosecution behavior that occurs one foot behind the victim. We decline to endorse such an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">As a logical extension of our analysis, we also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the record only supports a conviction for the disorderly persons offense of lewdness. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4a defines this offense as the commission of \u201cany flagrantly lewd and offensive act which [the actor] knows or reasonably expects is likely to be observed by other nonconsenting persons who would be affronted or alarmed.\u201d Although the prohibited conduct involved here is arguably covered by this definition, the age of the intended victim renders <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4a inapplicable on its face, because an underage child is legally incapable of consenting to any type of sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Defendant also argues that adoption of the \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d standard for determining whether the sexual contact occurred \u201cin the view of\u2019 the underage victim would create a bizarre and legally untenable outcome. It would treat conduct that the underage victim never sees (sexual contact by the actor with himself) more harshly than seemingly more objectively shocking conduct, fourth-degree lewdness involving actual exposure by the actor of his or her private parts. According to defendant, the latter conduct (lewdness) must actually be seen by the child-victim in order to sustain a conviction. Defendant is incorrect as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b defines fourth-degree lewdness as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">(1) He exposes his intimate parts for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the actor or of any other person under circumstances where the actor knows or <em>reasonably expects he is likely to be observed </em>by a child who is less than 13 years of age where the actor is at least four years older than the child. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>As the emphasized language clearly shows, in order to sustain a conviction for fourth-degree lewdness, the State need not prove that the prohibited conduct was actually seen by the underage victim. It is sufficient that the evidence show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the exposure occurred \u201cunder circumstances where the actor knows or reasonably expects he is likely to be observed\u201d by the child victim. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4b(1). This language speaks to the actor\u2019s <em>mens rea, Zeidell, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 713 A.2d 401, not to the conditions affecting the victim\u2019s perception of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Thus, a conviction for fourth-degree lewdness could rest on proofs showing that the actor exposed his private parts, for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his or her sexual desire, in front of a grammar school playground while school was in session. From this evidence, a jury can draw the rational inference that the actor knew or reasonably expected that children under the age of thirteen were likely to see him. Actual victim observation is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d standard, applicable in cases involving second-degree-tender-years sexual assault, does not require any <em>mens rea </em>at all. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cUnreasonable risk\u201d envisions circumstances that expose the child-victim to the strong likelihood that he/she will actually see the prohibited act. An actor\u2019s mental state is not implicated in this determination. It is purely an issue of fact to be determined by the jury from the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">We therefore hold that, in order to convict a defendant of second-degree-tender-years sexual assault, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant engaged in an intentional touching of his or her intimate parts, for arousal or sexual gratification, <em>in the view of </em>an underage child, whom defendant knows to be present. To establish that the sexual contact occurred \u201cin the view of\u2019 the underage victim, it is sufficient for the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that either (1) the underage child actually observed the act; or (2) there was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>unreasonable risk that the underage child might view the act. We are satisfied that the record here amply supports defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The balance of defendant\u2019s arguments lack sufficient merit to warrant extensive discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Defendant argues that the trial court erred when it declined to give an adverse inference charge based on the State\u2019s failure to call Nancy as a witness. <em>State v. Clawans, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>162, 170, 183 A.2d 77 (1962). However, as the prosecutor conceded during her summation, the State did not present any evidence that the child actually saw defendant engage in sexual contact. In this light, even assuming that the trial court erred when it concluded that Nancy was unavailable, such alleged error was without legal consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">There is also no evidence that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion in responding to an isolated incident of possible juror misconduct. The court properly dismissed the potential tainted juror and, thereafter, reassured itself that the rest of the panel had not been contaminated. Finally, there is no evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to the jury were in any way improper. The prosecutor properly limited her comments to addressing the stipulation that defendant\u2019s presence at the Shop Rite may have been related to a legitimate business appointment. The prosecutor\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s actions as opportunistic and impulsive, as opposed to thought-out or premeditated, are characterizations supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">There is also no evidence that the trial judge was in any way unfair or biased against defendant or his counsel. Each evidentiary ruling had appropriate legal support and was communicated to counsel in a professional and dignified manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Finally, the extended-term sentence imposed by the court was supported by the record and followed the required procedures. <em>State v. Dunbar, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>80, 527 A.2d 1346 (1987); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3. Defendant was thirty-seven years old at the time he committed this offense. By this time, he had amassed five indictable convictions, including second-degree robbery, possession of cocaine, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a federal conviction for abusive sexual contact with a minor aboard an aircraft,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2244. He also has had multiple unsuccessful terms of probation and, while on parole, has repeatedly violated the conditions imposed thereunder, requiring his re-incarceration. In these circumstances, the court\u2019s findings as to aggravating factors <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1a (3), (6) and (9), were well-supported by competent, reasonably credible evidence. <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-10\"> \"Nancy\" is a fictitious appellation used here to protect the child\u2019s anonymity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> Although Nancy gave a statement to the police shortly after the incident, there is nothing in the record that suggests that she is aware of the substance of the charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> As noted earlier, the videotape depicts one instance when defendant stands at angle to the child, possibly coming within the scope of her peripheral vision. For purposes of our discussion, however, we will assume that tire child\u2019s back was turned toward defendant during the time he engaged in the prohibited act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\"> The victim in that case was a thirteen-year-old girl whom defendant lured into his car. Defendant, thereafter, masturbated in front of the child and ejaculated on her pants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\"> The victim in that case was a fourteen-year-old girl whom defendant molested aboard an airplane while the child was traveling with her eighteen-year-old sister. According to the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, defendant touched the child\u2019s leg and upper and inner thigh and masturbated with a pillow on his lap.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
