We conclude that the Division validly asserted a lien for the recovery of Medicaid benefits against the assets of the testamentary trust established for Michael\u2019s benefit by his wife, Anne. However, because the trial court did not determine the amount of the lien, we remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Michael DeMartino and his wife Anne were the owners of a home at 7-M Dennison Drive, in East Windsor, New Jersey. By deed dated September 15, 1999, Michael made a gift of all of his right, title and interest in the property to Anne. Michael entered the Cranbury Nursing Home on April 1, 2000 and he began receiving Medicaid benefits to pay the cost of his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Anne DeMartino died on October 29, 2000, leaving a will dated October 19, 2000 that provided for the creation of a testamentary trust for Michael\u2019s benefit. In her will, Anne bequeathed to the trustee that portion of the residue of the estate required to satisfy Michael\u2019s elective share pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1. According to the will, these monies were to be held by the trustee on certain conditions. The will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">3.2.1.1.1. <em>Income </em>\u2014 My Trustee shall pay to or apply for the benefit of my Beneficiary all of the net income, in quarterly or other convenient installments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">3.2.1.1.2 <em>Principals </em>\u2014 My Trustee shall pay to or apply for the benefit of my Beneficiary such amounts of the Trust principal, or all thereof, in such proportions at such time and in such manner as my Trustee, in my Trustee\u2019s sole and absolute discretion, may decide is appropriate for the satisfaction of my Beneficiary\u2019s special nonsupport needs, if any. As used in this instrument, \u201cspecial nonsupport needs\u201d refers to the requisites for maintaining my Beneficiary\u2019s good health, safety, and welfare when, in the discretion of the Trustee, such requisites are not being provided by any public agency, office, or department of the state where my Beneficiary lives, or of the United States, or are not otherwise being provided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>other sources of income available to my Beneficiary. Special nonsupport needs shall include, but not be limited to, the list of suggested nonsupport items set out in this Section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The will further provided that upon Michael\u2019s death, the trustees shall distribute the remaining principal of the trust equally to Anne\u2019s children, \u201cand if any of my children fails to survive me, then to such children\u2019s descendents on a per stirpes basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">Theresa Ramellini and Rosemarie Rumac were designated in the will as co-executors of Anne\u2019s estate and co-trustees of the trust established for Michael. Ramellini and Rumac are Anne\u2019s and Michael\u2019s daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">According to the complaint, Anne\u2019s estate contained the following assets: a checking account with deposits of $5,000, a car with a \u201cblue book\u201d value of about $1,000, and the former marital residence. On April 3, 2001, the residence was sold for a gross sales price of $67,000, with net sale proceeds of $60,729.27 after payment of closing costs. Thus, the gross value <em>of Anne\u2019s </em>estate was $66,729.27. Anne\u2019s estate allegedly incurred expenses of $8,034.81, leaving a net estate of $58,424.46.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Michael DeMartino died on May 6, 2001. The trust created under Anne\u2019s will was not funded during his lifetime. Ramellini claims, however, $925 of Michael\u2019s share of Anne\u2019s estate was spent for Michael\u2019s meals, entertainment, clothes, haircuts and other needs. Ramellini also asserts that $300 from Michael\u2019s share was spent for a repast after Anne\u2019s funeral \u201cin accordance with [Michael\u2019s] wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">By letter dated August 23, 2001, the Division informed Ramellini that it was asserting a claim in the amount of $52,522.19 against Michael\u2019s Estate for the funds expended by the Medicaid program for Michael\u2019s health care. The letter noted that the Division intended to file a lien against the estate to secure its claim pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2. The Division informed the Estate of the procedures that could be followed if the Estate wished to seek a waiver or compromise of the lien on grounds of undue hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>On March 1, 2002, Ramellini filed a complaint on behalf of Michael\u2019s Estate in the Chancery Division seeking to set aside the Division\u2019s lien. The Estate alleged, among other things, that the Division could not assert a lien against the assets in the trust because, at the time of his death, Michael did not have any \u201clegal title or interest\u201d in the trust assets. The Estate argued that the assertion of the lien contravened federal and state law. In addition, the Estate challenged the validity of <em>N.J.A.C </em>10:49-14.1(n) which defines \u201cestate\u201d to include assets in certain testamentary trusts. The Estate also argued that the Division had not provided notice of its lien in accordance with federal guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The trial judge filed his opinion and order on December 24, 2002. The trial judge rejected the Estate\u2019s contentions and dismissed the complaint. The judge determined that the Division\u2019s lien was valid because the trust assets were part of Michael\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d and were subject to Medicaid estate recovery pursuant to state and federal law. The trial judge additionally found that the Division had provided notice of its lien in accordance with applicable federal guidelines. The judge determined that the Division was entitled to recover the monies \u201cthat were used to fund the testamentary trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On this appeal, the Estate argues that the assets held in the trust created by Anne\u2019s will are not subject to recovery by the Division because these assets are not part of Michael\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d under 42 <em>U.S.CA. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B) and <em>N.J.SA. </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3). The Estate claims that, at the time of his death, Michael did not have \u201clegal title or interest\u201d in these assets and, therefore, the Division may not reclaim the assets for purposes of recouping the cost of Medicaid benefits paid for Michael\u2019s care. We disagree with the Estate\u2019s contentions and, for the reasons that follow, conclude that the Division may assert a lien against the trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Medicaid is a federal-state program \u201ccreated to provide medical assistance to the poor at the expense of the public.\u201d <em>Mistrick v. Div. of Med. Assist. &amp; Health Services, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>158, 165, 712 A.2d 188 (1998) (citing <em>Atkins v. Rivera, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>154, 156, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2456, 2458, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>131, 137 (1986)). The Federal Government shares the costs of medical assistance with states that elect to participate in the Medicaid program. <em>Id. </em>at 165-66, 712 A.2d 188 (citing <em>Atkins, supra, 477 U.S. </em>at 156-157, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2458, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 137). Participating states must adopt medical assistance plans that meet the requirements of the federal Medicaid law. <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>297, 300-301, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2671, 2680, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>784, 794 (1980); <em>Waldman v. Candia, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 470, 722 A.2d 581 (App.Div.1999), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>599, 767 A.2d 480 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">New Jersey has elected to participate in the Medicaid program and its medical assistance program is set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 to -42. The Department of Human Services, through the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, administers New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid program. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-4 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4D-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Since the enactment of the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, federal Medicaid law has required participating states to enact certain \u201cestate\u201d recovery provisions as part of their medical assistance plans. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 </em>1396p(b)(1), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(18) and 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396c. States must seek adjustment or recovery [from an individual\u2019s estate] of any medical assistance correctly paid on behalf of the individual under the State plan ... [i]n the case of an individual who was 55 years of age or older when the individual received such medical assistance.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(1)(B). States may recover Medicaid benefits after the death of the recipient\u2019s surviving spouse provided that the Medicaid recipient leaves \u201cno surviving child who is under age 21, or ... is blind or permanently and totally disabled.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(2)(A). The states also must establish procedures for the waiver of recovery of Medicaid bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>fits where recovery would work an \u201cundue hardship.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">To meet the federal estate recovery requirements, each participating state must define a decedent\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d to include at a minimum \u201call real and personal property and other assets included within the [recipient\u2019s] estate, as defined for purposes of State probate law.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(A). In addition, participating states may adopt a broader definition of \u201cestate\u201d and may include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">any other real and personal property and other assets in which the individual had any legal title or interest at the time of death (to the extent of such interest), including such assets conveyed to a survivor, heir, or assign of the deceased individual through joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, or other arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[42 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">New Jersey has enacted legislation to comply with the federal estate recovery requirements. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(2), the Division may file a lien against and seek recovery of the cost of Medicaid assistance from the \u201cestate\u201d of a deceased recipient. \u201cEstate\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3) consistent with federal law. In addition, the Commissioner of Human Services is required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7(j) to take all necessary action to recover the cost of Medicaid benefits correctly provided from the estate of a Medicaid recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The Commissioner of Human Services has adopted regulations applicable to these estate recoveries. The Division is authorized by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-14.1(d) to \u201cfile any claim or lien against an estate ... within 90 days after receiving actual written notice from the personal representative of the estate or any other interested party of the death of a Medicaid beneficiary.\u201d The definition of \u201cestate\u201d in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-14.1(1)(2) is essentially the same as the definition of that term in <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3). The regulations further provide that the term \u201cestate\u201d shall not include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALg\">A testamentary trust established by a third party (including the spouse of the now-deceased Medicaid beneficiary) for the benefit of the now-deceased Medicaid beneficiary, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>i. The trust is a discretionary trust, constructed in such a way that the Medicaid beneficiary could not compel distributions of the trust; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">ii. The trust contains no assets in which the Medicaid beneficiary held any interest within either five years prior to applying for Medicaid benefits, or five years prior to the beneficiary\u2019s death----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-14.1(n)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Our role is to interpret a federal statute in light of the purposes that Congress sought to achieve through its enactment. <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>600, 608, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1905, 1911, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>508, 516 (1979). In doing so, we look not only at the particular statutory language but also to the design of the statute as a whole. <em>Van Holt v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>163 <em>F.</em>3d 161, 166 (3d Cir.1996). We interpret the language of the statute in accordance with its ordinary meaning and in a common sense manner so as to accomplish the purpose and intent of Congress. <em>Liberty Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>171 F.3d 818, 822 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Congress mandated that participating states adopt the estate recovery provisions and permitted states to adopt an expansive definition of \u201cestate\u201d to address the increased demand for Medicaid benefits from the nation\u2019s aging population. <em>State Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v. Estate of Ullmer, </em>120 <em>Nev. </em>108, 87 P.3d 1045, 1049 (2004)(citing Jon M. Zieger, <em>The State Giveth and the State Taketh Away: In Pursuit of a Practical Approach to Medicaid Estate Recovery, </em>5 <em>Elder L.J. </em>359, 365 (1997)). In doing so, Congress intended to give states \u201cwide latitude\u201d in seeking estate recoveries. <em>In re Estate of Thompson, </em>586 <em>N.W.2d </em>847, 851 (Sup.Ct.N.D.1998). \u201cAllowing states to recover from the estates of persons who previously received assistance furthers the broad purpose of providing for the medical care of the needy; the greater amount recovered by the state allows the state to have more funds to provide future services.\u201d <em>Belshe v. Hope, </em>33 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>161, 173, 38 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>917, 925 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">We are satisfied that, under this particular statutory scheme, the assets of the testamentary trust at issue are part of Michael\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d as defined in <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>30:7.2(a)(3). Here, the testamentary trust was merely a vehicle for the transfer of Michael\u2019s assets to his heirs. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1, Michael had a right to an elective share of Anne\u2019s estate equal to one-third of the \u201caugmented estate.\u201d The proceeds of the sale of the former marital home were part of Anne\u2019s \u201caugmented estate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Rather than make an outright bequest to Michael of these monies, Anne placed Michael\u2019s elective share in a trust under which he had only a life estate in the trust\u2019s income and discretionary distribution of trust principal. The trust assets passed to Michael\u2019s and Anne\u2019s children upon his death. But for the trust arrangement, Michael\u2019s elective share would have been part of his own estate and those monies would have been available to the Division for the recovery of the Medicaid benefits paid for Michael\u2019s care. By establishing a trust with Michael\u2019s elective share and by limiting his interest to a life estate in income and discretionary distributions of trust principal, Michael\u2019s assets were transferred to his heirs upon his death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In our view, a testamentary trust of the sort employed here qualifies as an \u201carrangement\u201d for the conveyance of the assets of a Medicaid beneficiary within the meaning and intent of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p (b)(4)(B). Although created by a third party, rather than the Medicaid recipient, a testamentary trust that effects the transfer of the recipient\u2019s assets to his survivors, heirs or assigns, is similar in purpose and effect to the forms of conveyance mentioned in 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396p (b)(4)(B). Such a trust includes a \u201clife estate\u201d for the Medicaid recipient as well as \u201csurvivorship\u201d interests for his heirs. When assets of a Medicaid recipient are conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign by such an \u201carrangement,\u201d the assets remain part of the recipient\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p (b)(4)(B) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the plain language of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B) and Congress\u2019 intent to allow participating states broad authority to seek recovery of Medicaid benefits when a recipient\u2019s assets are transferred by the methods of conveyance set forth in the statute, or \u201cother arrangement.\u201d Courts in other jurisdictions have interpreted 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B) to allow estate recovery when the recipient\u2019s assets are transferred at death by conveyances of the sort mentioned in the statute. <em>See State Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v. Estate of Ullmer, supra, </em>87 <em>P.3d </em>at 1049 (estate recovery permitted against marital home of deceased Medicaid recipient because surviving spouse acquired the recipient\u2019s interest through joint tenancy); <em>In re Estate of Thompson, supra, </em>586 N.W.2d at 850 (state could recover cost of Medicaid benefits from the estate of deceased spouse of recipient if recipient\u2019s interest was conveyed to spouse by any of the means identified in 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B)); and <em>In re Estate of Jobe, </em>590 N.W.2d 162, 165 (Ct.App.Minn.1999)(expansive definition of \u201cestate\u201d in federal Medicaid law allows recovery of Medicaid benefits from non-probate assets conveyed to surviving spouse through joint tenancy or \u201cother arrangement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Our conclusion is also consistent with the intent of New Jersey\u2019s lawmakers to recover correctly paid benefits from the \u201cestates\u201d of deceased Medicaid recipients. That intention is shown by New Jersey\u2019s enactment of the expansive definition of \u201cestate\u201d for purposes of estate recovery. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3). It is also revealed in the directive to the Commissioner of Human Services in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7(j) to take \u201call necessary action\u201d to recover the cost of Medicaid benefits from the estate of recipient. Our Supreme Court has stated that New Jersey Medicaid law reflects an \u201cunmistakable intent to afford the State every opportunity to recoup its payments from third parties.\u201d <em>Hedgebeth v. Medford, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>360, 366, 378 A.2d 226 (1977). That same principle applies to \u201cestate\u201d recovery under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The Estate argues, however, that the Division may not recover the assets in the testamentary trust because such a recovery represents the imposition of a \u201cpayback\u201d requirement in contravention of federal law. Under federal Medicaid law, transfers of assets are taken into account in determining eligibility for Medicaid benefits. 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396p(c). When certain individuals transfer assets to an inter vivos trust, the transferred assets are not considered in determining eligibility if the trust meets certain conditions. One condition requires that naming of the state Medicaid program as primary remainder beneficiary of the trust assets. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(d)(4)(A)(B) and (C). The Estate argues that, because Congress has not required a similar \u201cpayback\u201d for testamentary trusts, a state Medicaid agency may not recover these trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We disagree. Congress has enacted specific Medicaid eligibility requirements and also has prescribed the requirements for the recovery by participating states of correctly paid Medicaid benefits. Although federal law expressly requires for eligibility purposes a specific pay back provision in respect of certain inter vivos trusts, that does not foreclose the Division from seeking recovery of assets in a testamentary trust so long as the requirements of <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(b)(4)(B) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3) are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The Estate also challenges the validity of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49\u2014 14.1(n)(3) which, as stated previously, excludes assets in certain testamentary trusts established by a third party (including the Medicaid recipient\u2019s spouse) from the definition of \u201cestate\u201d if the trust is discretionary and contains no assets in which the Medicaid recipient held any interest within a five year \u201clook back\u201d period. The Estate contends that the Division may not treat assets in a testamentary trust as assets of the \u201cestate\u201d of the Medicaid recipient merely because the recipient had an interest in the trust assets in the five-year \u201clook back\u201d period.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In addressing this contention, we are required to accord the administrative regulation a presumption of validity. <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>415, 430, 852 A.2d 167 (2004). Therefore, the Estate has a \u201cheavy burden\u201d of demonstrating that the regulatory requirement is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 852 A.2d 167 (citing <em>New Jersey League of Municipalities v. Dept. of Comm. Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21 (1999)). We will not set aside agency rulemaking unless the agency\u2019s action is inconsistent with the legislative mandate. <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>In re Township of Warren, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>1, 26, 622 A.2d 1257 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As we understand it, the purpose of the regulation is to allow the Division to recover the cost of Medicaid benefits from the assets in a testamentary trust where the trust has been employed as an \u201carrangement\u201d to transfer the assets of a Medicaid recipient to a survivor, heir or assign. One of the assumptions underlying the regulation is that, if the Medicaid recipient had an interest in the trust assets within the five-year \u201clook back\u201d period, the trust probably is being employed as an \u201carrangement\u201d to transfer the recipient\u2019s assets to the recipient\u2019s survivors, heirs or assigns. Although a case may arise presenting circumstances where the validity of this assumption may be called into question, this is not such a case. As applied here, the regulation is entirely consistent with federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>As we have explained, the testamentary trust at issue was employed as an \u201carrangement\u201d for the transfer of Michael\u2019s assets to his children. Because Michael had a right under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-1 to an elective share of Anne\u2019s estate, and because the trust was funded with an amount equal to Michael\u2019s elective share, he clearly had an interest in the trust assets when the trust was created. Michael thus had an interest in the trust assets within the five-year \u201clook back\u201d period in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-14.1(n)(3)(ii). The fact that Michael did not have complete legal and beneficial ownership of the trust assets at the time of his death is of no consequence. The testamentary trust was employed as a means to limit Michael\u2019s ownership of his elective share to a life interest in income and discretionary distributions of trust principal. The trust was little more than a vehicle to convey Michael\u2019s assets to his children upon his death, thereby avoiding any potential claim for estate recovery. We therefore conclude that application of the regulation to these facts and circumstances is entirely consistent with 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396p(4)(B)(2) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-7.2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The Estate next argues that the notice of lien provided to the Estate failed to comply with federal law because the notice was sent to the personal representative of the estate and failed to provide the beneficiaries of the estate notice of the right to apply for an undue hardship waiver or compromise of the hen. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, formerly the Health Care Financing Administration, issues certain mandatory, advisory and optional Medicaid policies and procedures to state Medicaid Agencies. Transmittal 63 defines the type of notice necessary regarding estate recovery: Section 3810(G)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">You should give a specific notice to individuals affected by the proposed recovery whenever you seek adjustment or recovery. The notice should be served on the executor or legally authorized representative of the individual\u2019s estate, or, if these are not known to the State, other survivors or heirs. The executor or legally authorized representative should be required to notify individuals who would be affected by the proposed recovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The Division\u2019s notice was consistent with the federal requirements as set forth in Transmittal 63. The Division\u2019s notice was sent to Ramellini, the executrix of the Estate. The notice informed her of the procedures to be followed to obtain a waiver or compromise of the lien. Moreover, in the notice, the Division instructed Ramellini to inform all persons who might be affected by the proposed estate recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Finally, the trial judge here opined that the amount of the Division\u2019s lien is the amount of the monies that were used to fund the testamentary trust. However, the trial judge did not determine the amount of Michael\u2019s elective share. The parties disagree as to the amount of the trust assets. The Estate claims that the Division\u2019s lien is $9,420.24. The Estate asserts that Michael\u2019s elective share must be determined by deducting the estate\u2019s administrative expenses as well as amounts expended for Michael\u2019s care. The Estate also seeks to deduct the Trustees\u2019 commissions and legal fees allocable to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In our view, these issues should be addressed in the first instance by the trial court. The Estate has not substantiated its claim for expenses or the amounts allegedly paid for Michael\u2019s care. The Estate has not presented an affidavit of services to support a claim for counsel fees. Moreover, there is an issue as to whether the Division\u2019s lien should be reduced by the cost of the Estates\u2019 unsuccessful challenge to the validity of the lien. These issues should be addressed by the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Affirmed in part and remanded in part for a determination as to the amount of the Division\u2019s lien.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> The Estate argues that the marital home was excluded from Anne's \"augmented estate\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-5, which provides that \"[a]ny transfer of property shall be excluded from the augmented estate under [N.J.S.A.] 3B:8-3 if made with the written consent or joinder of the surviving spouse.\" The transfer by Michael to Anne of his interest in the marital home was not a transfer within the ambit of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>3B:8-3 because that statute applies to transfers by the decedent, not the surviving spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> The Estate contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:8-17 specifically permits a decedent to bequeath to the surviving spouse an amount sufficient to satisfy the elective share in the form of a trust. The Estate contends that so long as the surviving spouse has a \"present income interest\u201d in the trust assets, the elective share requirements are satisfied. We disagree. The statute cited by the Estate as authority for this proposition merely provides the method by which the surviving spouse\u2019s interest in a life estate or trust is to be valued in an action for an elective share. <em>Matter of Estate of Post, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 72-73, 659 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1995). The surviving spouse's interest is valued at one-half of the total value of the property or trust. The statute makes clear that the value of assets subject to a life estate or trust is not the monetary equivalent of the value of an outright bequest of those assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
