For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The material facts in this matter are as follows. Decedent, Maria Rodd, had a history of severe diffuse bilateral fibrocystic disease, a condition which results in dense breast tissue that appears white in a mammogram, although it is not cancerous. She also underwent operations for cyst aspirations in both breasts, bilateral needle biopsies, and an incisional biopsy, which resulted in scarring. She began having mammography screenings to detect breast cancer early, beginning at some point in 1979 at the age of 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Mammography screenings are x-rays of the breast that are taken from two directions \u2014 the vertical cranial caudal direction and the horizontal medial lateral oblique direction \u2014 in order to detect cancer. To study a mammogram, a radiologist places it in a view box and analyzes it with his naked eye and a hand-held magnifying glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The density of the structures between the x-ray beam create an image on the film. Fatty tissue appears grayish black, and calcifications, which are non-caneerous deposits of the mineral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>calcium, and breast cancer appear white. Clusters of calcifications that are smaller than a millimeter are referred to as microcalcifications and are indicators of possible malignancies. Radiologists consider both the vertical cranial caudal x-ray and the horizontal medial lateral oblique x-ray to determine whether micro-calcification clusters exist. Two views are necessary because while the view from one direction may indicate a cluster, when viewed from the other direction, the cluster may reveal itself to be calcifications existing on different levels that are not grouped together. The radiologist must examine the shape and edges of the calcifications; round or oval calcifications are generally benign, while clusters of calcifications with ill-defined margins and bizarre shapes may indicate cancer. Radiologists also compare the x-rays of each breast with the other, to determine whether the calcifications correspond with each other, or are significantly different. In order to assess whether changes have occurred in the breast tissue, radiologists compare available films from prior years with the film they are evaluating to see if there is a change in the area of density or increased calcifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">A grouping of six or more abnormally shaped calcifications in a volume of one to two cubic centimeters is considered a cluster that raises suspicion of malignancy. However, a radiologist also considers whether the calcifications are \u201cfocal\u201d or \u201cdiffused.\u201d Suspicion is raised if the calcification is focal rather than diffused. The calcifications are focal if they are seen \u201cin only one relatively small part of the breast.\u201d On the other hand, diffused calcifications are considered a \u201cgeneral phenomenon\u201d if they occur throughout a patient\u2019s breast, and they do not indicate malignancy. Ultimately, the radiologist looks to see if \u201cone part of one of the two breasts ... is obviously different from the remainder of that breast and the opposite breast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Indisputably, decedent\u2019s mammograms were negative for cancer through 1995. Defendant Kotler (defendant), a radiologist with a sub-specialty in mammography, interpreted decedent\u2019s mammography films on August 11,1997 and August 11,1998, using a hand-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>held 2.5 power magnifying glass that magnified the image by four times, which was the recognized diagnostic tool at the time. Defendant reported that the calcifications appearing in the 1997 and 1998 x-rays were not indicative of cancer, and he recommended a one-year follow-up. Specifically, defendant found that the calcifications in decedent\u2019s 1997 mammogram films were fairly widely distributed throughout her breasts and that no one area of calcifications appeared more suspicious than another area within both her breasts. He found that there was not a solitary cluster of calcifications that stood out more strongly against the rest of the calcifications diffused through her breasts. No one part of one breast appeared obviously different from the remainder of that breast or the opposite breast. He also found that the calcifications in the 1997 films were generally unchanged from those in the 1996 films. The calcifications in decedent\u2019s 1998 mammogram films were also fairly widely distributed through both breasts, due to her diffuse bilateral fibrocystic disease, and they were unchanged since the 1997 mammogram.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Decedent discovered a lump in her breast in early 1999. She was diagnosed with infiltrative intraductal carcinoma by biopsy on January 9, 1999. She died on August 30, 2002, after unsuccessful treatment. This medical malpractice complaint was filed on September 14, 2000, and amended to include a count for wrongful death on November 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">For use at trial, plaintiff digitally scanned select portions of the 1997 and 1998 mammograms into a computer to produce super-magnified images, which were then projected onto a six-foot by eight-foot screen for the jury to view. This demonstration was purportedly offered to aid the jury in explaining the nature of the appearance of a malignancy in a mammogram, but was used, in effect, to simulate for the jury what defendant actually saw when he viewed the films using the magnifying lens, namely, clustered micro-calcifications in decedent\u2019s left breast indicative of cancer. In fact, plaintiffs expert, Dr. Berg, testified that viewing the computerized images on the large screen from the perspective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the jury was similar to a radiologist viewing a mammogram film on a light box from close observation using a four-times magnifying glass. Nevertheless, these digitalized, computerized images were selectively composed by plaintiffs counsel and magnified by anywhere between thirty and 150 times the size of the x-rays. For example, one image of a 1996 x-ray was blown up so that a distance of 1.5 centimeters on the mammogram was represented on the screen to be fifteen to sixteen inches \u2014 a magnification of more than thirty times.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Defendant objected to the use of these super-magnified computer images. In the first place, defendant had not received notice in discovery and only first learned of their existence at a pre-trial conference, too late to adequately test the process by which the images were created. Further, the trial judge rejected defendant\u2019s requests that plaintiffs computer operator and all of the computer images created from the x-rays, even those rejected by plaintiff, be made available to the defense. In fact, only a log or printout of selected images were made available to defendant, and not until midway through the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Most significantly, defendant objected because of the potential for distortion and confusion engendered by use of the super-magnified images. On this score, defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Becker, testified that \u201c[tjhis is such an artificial situation,\u201d and that \u201c[njever having viewed a mammogram at this degree of magnification, I\u2019m having difficulty telling what\u2019s a calcification and what is breast tissue.\u201d Dr. Becker observed that, in presenting the images, plaintiff \u201csubtracted the ruler so I can\u2019t say whether they\u2019re micro-calcifications,\u201d and that \u201cthere are multiple other areas that [plaintiff had] chosen not to box that show white dots, calcifications in groupings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Defendant himself testified that the great magnification blurred calcifications that were actually sharp images, and indicated that if the computer images were accurate, x-ray films would not be used by radiologists. He expressed concern that plaintiff may have created the appearance of the cluster by compressing the image, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and further, may have created the appearance that the cluster was focal, rather than part of a general phenomenon of numerous diffuse calcifications, by showing only a selective cluster rather than an all-inclusive picture of the calcifications. Even plaintiffs expert, Dr. Berg, stated that he examines mammograms with a hand-held magnifying glass and that he does not project mammograms to the size used in court. On cross-examination, Dr. Berg at first testified that a dot on the screen could possibly represent a calcification, but then acknowledged that the dot might actually be a dust particle, and therefore, he could not be sure if a particle was a calcification because of the \u201cgrain on the film when you magnify it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Despite these objections, the trial judge allowed the use of the large screen computer projections, explaining that such demonstrative evidence would aid the jury. Yet, the judge never gave an instruction limiting the use of such evidence for this narrow purpose. Instead, plaintiffs counsel used the computer imagery extensively throughout trial to suggest to the jury that because the cluster was so clear in the blown-up computer images, it was equally clear when viewing the mammogram films under a hand-held magnifying glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">For example, in his opening statement, plaintiffs counsel projected a cluster of irregularly shaped micro-calcifications, blown up on the screen and circled in red, and told the jury that it was a suspicious cluster of micro-calcifications that appeared on decedent\u2019s <em>1997 </em>mammogram, but that Dr. Kotler did not <em>report </em>it even though \u201cit was cancer, clear as a bell.\u201d Likewise, during direct examination of his expert, plaintiffs counsel used the computer imagery to \u201czoom in\u201d and demonstrate that the 1997 mammogram of decedent\u2019s left breast had a cluster of more than a dozen calcifications within one cubic centimeter area. Plaintiffs counsel had the computer operator magnify a purported calcification cluster viewed on the computer images of the medial lateral oblique (MLO) view, and then, after confirming that it was \u201cthe standard of care to look at the other view,\u201d counsel had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>operator bring the cranial caudal (CC) view into focus, to make it \u201cbrighter\u201d and to increase the magnification. Counsel used the same technique with the 1998 film, prompting Dr. Berg to remark on the improved ease for viewing calcifications with the computerized magnification: \u201cIt\u2019s actually easier to see. The projection is a little bit different, and they always are a little different. But you can see without any difficulty at this magnification a whole slew of tiny calcifications in a cluster up in this part of the breast ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Plaintiff also relied heavily on the computer projections in counsel\u2019s cross-examination of defendant\u2019s expert, challenging Dr. Becker\u2019s testimony that decedent\u2019s breast contained so many calcifications that the horizontal and vertical x-ray views did not indicate whether the group of calcifications visible in one breast corresponded with the other, and that the different angles which the two views produced indicated that the calcifications visible in one x-ray were not, in fact, clusters. And in summation, plaintiffs counsel again emphasized that the suspicious calcification cluster shown in the computer image was \u201cclear as day\u201d and that it was \u201cthe standard of care\u201d for defendant to see that cluster regardless of the cysts and other densities in decedent\u2019s breasts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">But with the densities, with some cysts, with the fact that there was some calcifications elsewhere, none of that obscured what you\u2019ll see here as clear as day and what you see on the opposite view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Why did Dr. Kotler miss it?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiff $1.5 million for loss of consortium; $1.7 million in survivorship damages; and $40,000 for wrongful death. Defendant moved for a new trial on the ground, among others, that the computer magnification of the mammograms was unfair. The judge denied the motion, reasoning in part that the jury is disadvantaged in radiology cases because, while radiologists with fifteen to twenty years of experience are able to interpret small x-rays, the jury has no prior experience. He, therefore, concluded that allowing plaintiff to super-magnify an image helps to reduce the handicap jurors are operating under in medical malpractice cases. The judge com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>pared blowing up the mammogram to blowing up an intersection of a highway, and concluded that it only acted to bring the jury up to speed with what a radiologist interprets. He went on to say that \u201cthe message may get \u2014 get out now, that in radiology, and I know the radiologist is under awesome pressure reading these films, that maybe they ought to blow it up like that.\u201d The judge continued by asserting that \u201cmaybe the whole industry is negligent. Maybe in this case, something ought to be done ... maybe this message is gonna get out____it seems, to me, to be very simple and very easy to implement, in a radiology group, blowing it up on a screen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Defendants raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">I.

Demonstrative or illustrative evidence may be evidence that replicates the actual physical evidence, <em>State v. Scherzer, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 434, 694 A.2d at 230, or demonstrates some matter material to the case, <em>State v.

It is in the nature of a visual aid \u2014 \u201ca model, diagram or chart used by a witness to illustrate his or her testimony and facilitate jury understanding.\u201d <em>Macaluso v.

Scherzer, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 434-45, 694 A.2d at 230-31; <em>State v. Feaster, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 82, 716 A.2d at 435-36; Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>611 (2004). That is, the trial court controls not only the admission of this type of evidence, but also the form and limits of its presentation, as well. Although discretionary, the admissibility of such evidence turns, in part, on whether it \u201csufficiently duplicates the original event.\u201d <em>Persley v. New Jersey Transit Bus Operations, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 14-15, 813 A.2d 1219, 1227-28 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>490, 828 A.2d 918 (2003); <em>see also Balian v. General Motors, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 126, 296 A.2d 317, 321 (App.Div.1972), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>195, 299 A.2d 729 (1973). Not only must such evidence be authenticated, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>901, and relevant, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>401, its probative value must not be offset by undue prejudice, unfair surprise, undue consumption of trial time, or possible confusion of issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>due to the introduction of collateral matters. <em>Balian, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 127, 296 A.2d at 321-22; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Thus, in <em>Crispin v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 248 N.J.Super. 540, 556-57, 591 </em>A.2d 966, 974-75 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>385, 599 A.2d 162 (1991), we rejected a video simulation of a high-speed rear-end automobile collision, finding there were too many variables between the tests and the evidence presented with respect to the motor vehicle accident to render them probative on any point raised. In <em>Suanez v. Egeland, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 196, 749 A.2d 372, 375 (App.Div.2000), we rejected a similar videotape not only because of differences between the crash test depicted on the tape and the actual accident, but also because it had not been provided to the plaintiff in discovery; the judge failed to instruct the jury the tape was not substantive evidence; the tape was not properly authenticated by the bioengineer who merely assured that it was \u201cinternationally known;\u201d and the accident on the video was shown only in extreme slow motion which gave the impression of less movement and thus less impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">In <em>Macaluso v. Pleskin, supra, </em>we ruled that an animated video depicting the anatomy associated with various musculoskeletal injuries should not have been played for the jury because it was not used as a visual aid and it contained \u201cspeculation regarding the possible consequences of hypothetical injuries.\u201d 329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 353, 747 A.2d at 835. We found the video essentially \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature, and because the tape\u2019s contents were susceptible of being accepted by the jury as substantive evidence, we concluded a new trial was warranted. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Also in <em>Macaluso, </em>the defendant objected to the use of computerized images of plaintiffs x-rays, taken by her treating chiropractor, solely on the grounds that the physician had not made the computerized images. In holding this evidence properly admissible, we relied on the fact that the treating physician took the x-rays, ordered the computerized images, and authenticated them by testifying that they were \u201ca fair and accurate depiction of the x-rays he had taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 747 A.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>In the present case, defendant\u2019s objection to the use of the computerized imagery of decedent\u2019s x-ray films goes far beyond the fact that plaintiffs testifying expert had neither created nor directed the presentation. In addition, defendant complains of surprise and the lack of notice, the failure to instruct the jury as to the limited purpose of the computerized images, the absence of a sufficient foundation to support their presentation to the jury, and the highly influential and testimonial nature of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Plaintiff counters that the computer enlargement was not meant as substantive evidence, but only for demonstrative purposes, as a visual aid to assist the jury in understanding the radiologists\u2019 expert opinions and to explain the nature of the appearance of a malignancy in a mammogram. This distinction, however, was never made clear to the jury. The jurors were never instructed as to the limited purpose for which the computerized images were being shown. They were never told, for instance, that the computer images were only an aid to help understand the technical medical testimony as opposed to proof of what defendant actually observed. From the jury\u2019s point of view, the computer images were indistinguishable from any other evidence. Compounding this problem is the fact that the gross magnification of the mammography films had a tendency, according to defendant and his expert, to distort, rather than clarify, that which was actually viewed by defendant. More significant, given that the very essence of the malpractice claim was error in visual observation, the so-called \u201cvisual aid\u201d took on testimonial significance, and its contents were highly susceptible of being perceived by the jury as substantive evidence. Indeed, rather than being apprised that the computer imagery was not intended to be the exact replication of every detail that could or should have been seen by defendant, the jury was repeatedly told by plaintiffs expert just the opposite, namely, that the computer magnification was an identical representation of the images apparent on the mammogram films when viewed under the standard magnifying glass.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Of course, the issue was not whether the calcification clusters could be viewed in a super-magnified computer image, but whether defendant deviated from the accepted standard of care when he concluded that which he viewed on the x-rays was not suspicious of cancer. In other words, computerized magnification was not the mechanism used by radiologists following the standard of care recognized in the medical community, which was, indisputably, to view the mammogram with a 2.5 power magnifying lens. However, the use of computerized images to demonstrate that a cancerous cluster existed on the mammogram films and was so \u201cclearly visible\u201d that it should have been detected by defendant had the clear potential to confuse the jurors and distract them from assessing defendant\u2019s action under the correct standard of care. The danger here was that the jury could assume that defendant should have used the computer technology being presented at trial, despite the absence of any evidence of a medical consensus that the images in a mammogram are accurate where the x-ray is scanned into a computer, blown up, and projected on a large screen. As such, the \u201cdemonstration\u201d did more than simply illustrate expert testimony. It provided the jury with testimonial evidence \u2014 independent proof \u2014 of that which could and should have been seen by defendant using the standard hand-held magnifying glass used to interpret mammograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We cannot be certain what role this presentation actually played in the jury\u2019s evaluation, although the computer imagery was repeatedly displayed to the jury and was a substantial part of both the direct examination of plaintiffs expert and the cross-examination of defendant\u2019s expert. To be sure, during deliberations, the jury had the ability to view the mammogram films on a light box utilizing a traditional magnifying glass. But the very real danger persisted that the jurors could not erase from their minds the images being continually projected on the screen when they later returned to the jury room to consider the actual evidence. Suffice it to say, in the absence of a limiting instruction, such imagery is clearly capable of influencing a jury, of generating confusion over the appropriate standard of care, and thus, unduly prejudicing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>defendant, entitling him to a new trial wherein the concerns raised herein must be fully addressed before introduction of this type of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Heightening our concern is the lack of adequate notice afforded defense counsel of the use of this technology and the failure to lay a complete foundation for its introduction. <em>See, e.g., Suanez v. Egeland, supra, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 193-96, 749 A.2d at 373-75; <em>Balian v. General Motors, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 126-29, 296 A.2d at 321-22. As to the latter, plaintiffs expert, a radiologist through whom the computer imagery was introduced, neither created nor directed either the underlying x-ray or the computer projection. Nor was he present when either was made. The medical expert offered no account of how the films were scanned into the computer, or how the computer program operated. Consequently, he added very little to explain the circumstances surrounding the computer images\u2019 creation and was not even aware of the actual level of magnification involved in the computer enlargement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In our view, the use of a computer-generated exhibit requires a more detailed foundation than that for just photographs or photo enlargements. The latter \u201cmust be proved to be faithful representations of the subject at the time in question. Fundamentally, photographs are deemed to be pictorial communications of a qualified witness.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>433, 448, 142 A.2d 890, 899 (1958). However, considering the reliability problems arising from computer-generated exhibits and the processes by which they are created, <em>see State v. Swinton, </em>268 <em>Conn. </em>781, 847 A.2d 921, 941-43 (2004), there must be \u201ctestimony by a person with some degree of computer expertise, who has sufficient knowledge to be examined and cross-examined about the functioning of the computer.\u201d <em>American Oil Co. v. Valenti, </em>179 <em>Conn. </em>349, 426 A.2d 305, 310 (1979). Mere visual inspection, as was done here by Dr. Berg, is simply not enough to ensure the reliability of the computer-generated exhibit. <em>State v. Swinton, supra, </em>847 A.2d at 952 fn. 47. Rather, what is required is testimony from a witness who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>possesses sufficient knowledge of the technology used to create the exhibits. <em>Ibid.; see also Nooner v. State, </em>322 <em>Ark. </em>87, 907 S.W.2d 677 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>1143, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1436, 134 L.Ed.2d 558 (1996); <em>English v. State, </em>205 <em>Ga.App. </em>599, 422 S.E.2d 924 (1992). This was not accomplished here.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We are also persuaded that the error in permitting the computer presentation was not harmless, even assuming the only issue in dispute is not what was actually seen on the x-rays, but its significance. Both experts appear to agree that a cluster of five or more differently shaped calcifications in less than one square centimeter and detected on both views is suspicious of cancer. They disagree, however, about whether the calcifications were visible on both views of the breast and whether the calcification cluster was \u201cfocal\u201d \u2014 appearing in one part of one breast and, therefore, suspicious of cancer \u2014 or \u201cdiffused\u201d \u2014 part of a general phenomenon of multiple calcifications throughout the patient\u2019s breasts, due to her preexisting condition of bilateral fibrocystic disease. Here again, the capacity of computer projection to mislead was very real because it may have created the appearance of a \u201cfocal\u201d cluster, rather than part of a small sample of a general phenomenon, by showing only a selective image instead of an all-inclusive picture. Moreover, as to whether the two views were the same \u2014 a requisite for finding a suspicion of cancer \u2014 the computer projection could have created the appearance that the clusters were in the same locations by compressing the image, especially in light of defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion that the cluster shown in the CC projection did not correspond with that shown in the MCO projection because the cluster in the former was far deeper in the breast. Whether or not any such manipulation occurred is, of course, not the point. That the computer-generated images were <em>not </em>the medically accepted diagnostic tool very much is the point. Under these circumstances, we are convinced the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Because the computer imagery displayed to the jury was unduly influential, potentially confusing, susceptible of being accepted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>substantive evidence, and clearly capable of producing an unjust result, we reverse and remand. In light of our disposition of the principal issue and the remand for a new trial, we need not decide defendants\u2019 remaining arguments. Because of the possibility of a recurrence, however, we are constrained to briefly comment on certain remarks by plaintiffs counsel in his summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">During summation, plaintiffs counsel suggested that defendant missed the evidence of cancer because he cared more about \u201cmaking money\u201d and living \u201cthe good life,\u201d spending only thirty-six seconds looking at each mammogram film \u2014 a number determined based on the hours defendant presumably worked in a week and the number of mammograms he reviewed each year. Counsel continued by disparaging defendant\u2019s expert, who, he maintained, argued \u201ca little bit more like a lawyer than a doctor\u201d and was \u201ca professional witness\u201d who \u201cadjust[s] his testimony for every ease.\u201d He went on to inform the jury that the defense failed to produce a journal article supporting its position and stated \u201cdo you think that a doctor with his lawyer and their resources wouldn\u2019t produce that article to you if it existed?\u201d These comments remained uncorrected by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Although attorneys are given broad latitude in summation, they may not use disparaging language to discredit the opposing party, or witness, <em>Henker v. Preybylowski, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 518-19, 524 A.2d 455, 458-59 (App.Div.1987); <em>Geler v. Akawie, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 470-71, 818 A.2d 402, 423-24 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>223, 827 A.2d 290 (2003), or accuse a party\u2019s attorney of wanting the jury to evaluate the evidence unfairly, of trying to deceive the jury, or of deliberately distorting the evidence. <em>See Henker v. Preybylowski, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518-19, 524 A.2d at 458-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Here, counsel\u2019s comments in summation were unduly harsh and amounted to an attack on defendant\u2019s character and his witness\u2019s integrity. They occupy no rightful place in proper commentary on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the evidence and the credibility of testimony. They are not to be repeated on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
