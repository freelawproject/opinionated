The orders also grant intervenor access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>122 of 315 pages of those documents. Goodyear does not appeal the grant of CARS\u2019s motion to intervene. <em>See Hammock v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>356, 379, 662 A.2d 546, 558 (1995). It does appeal the access order.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">At the beginning of discovery, plaintiffs and Goodyear agreed to a protective order, obviously in anticipation that some of the discovery documents would eventually become court filings. Plaintiffs and Goodyear ultimately settled and none of these documents were ever filed with the court, except as part of motions relating to intervenor\u2019s efforts to gain access to the discovery documents. As we understand the current legal principles applicable to intervenor\u2019s efforts to gain such access, intervenor has no legal basis therefor. This is because the documents remained in the private possession of litigation counsel, never becoming a part of the court files, either by way of a nondiscovery pretrial motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or trial proceeding. Thus, while the trial judge\u2019s analysis of the good cause criteria that must be demonstrated under <em>R. </em>4:10-3 for the purposes of a protective order and his application of those criteria to the documents at issue here is well supported, his fundamental legal premise for access is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We, therefore, reverse. In doing so, we need not tarry long on the subject. As we have said, the documents produced during discovery never became a part of the court records, aside from the motions that produced the orders now before us. There is, of course, a \u201cpresumption\u201d of public access to documents filed with the court in connection with civil litigation. <em>Hammock v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 375, 662 A.2d 546. That presumption, however, does not apply to discovery motions, <em>id. </em>at 380, 662 A.2d at 556, and may be overcome upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>demonstration that the \u201cneed for secrecy substantially outweighs the presumption of access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 662 A.2d at 559. Neither the \u201cpresumption\u201d nor the outweighing considerations are applicable here. This is so because \u201cthere continu\u00e9is] to be confidentiality of materials submitted in the discovery process. The discovery delivered to a plaintiffs counsel under a protective order is not subject to public access as long as it remains in the private domain of plaintiffs counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379, 662 A.2d at 558.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In rejecting appellant\u2019s contention that intervenor did not have a presumptive right of access to unfiled discovery documents, the trial judge wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">This argument, although superficially appealing, overlooks an important premise of <em>Hammock. </em>The Court acknowledged in <em>Hammock </em>that there was a valid protective order in place between plaintiff and defendant Roche. The procedural history recited by the Court indicates that after plaintiff had sought some 1,000 internal Roche documents in discovery, Roche moved for a protective order pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:10-3. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 662 A.2d 546[,549], In support of that motion Roche had filed with the trial court two sworn affidavits, one by a doctor. <em>Id. </em>The affidavits \u201cexplained that some of the information sought was essential\u201d to Roche\u2019s applications with the Food and Drug Administration required \u201cto obtain approval to market a prescription drug.\u201d <em>Id. </em>FDA regulations provided that the data contained in such filings is not subject to public disclosure. <em>Id., </em>citing 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 20.111(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">Having the benefit of those affidavits and the applicable federal regulations, the trial court in <em>Hammock </em>made a specific finding that \u201cgood cause\u201d existed under <em>Rule </em>4:10-3(g) justifying the entry of a protective order sealing the documents. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">We disagree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the existence of a \u201cvalid\u201d protective order in <em>Hammock, </em>as opposed to the consent protective order here, requires us to ignore the fundamental principle espoused in <em>Hammock </em>that there exists no right of public access to unfiled discovery documents. The protective order in <em>Hammock </em>was important there because the documents at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>issue, in fact, were filed court documents. Thus, the Court began its opinion, \u201c[t]his case requires us to decide whether the public has a right of access <em>to judicial records and materials filed with the court </em>in civil litigation.\u201d <em>Hammock, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 360-61, 662 A.2d at 548 (emphasis added). Simply put, the <em>Hammock </em>documents were subject to a presumption of public access. When that presumption arises, the opposing party must rely upon the provisions of <em>R. </em>4:10-3 if public access is to be protected against and must, thus, have a \u201cvalid\u201d protective order in place. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Intervenor argues that: \u201cUnder <em>Rule </em>4:10-3, there is a presumptive statutory right of access to discovery documents.\u201d We reject this contention as entirely without basis. Certainly there is nothing in the text of <em>R. </em>4:10-3<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which creates a presumptive right of access to unfiled discovery documents. Were <em>R. </em>4:10-3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>such a substantive provision, the Court in <em>Hammock </em>surely would have included the rule in its reference to the available avenues by which the public may access certain records. <em>See Hammock, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 370-71, 662 A.2d at 553-54.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Intervenor, however, asserts that several federal cases which construe <em>Federal Rule </em>26, the federal counterpart to <em>R. </em>4:10-3, support its position, citing <em>Leucadia, Inc. v. Applied Extrusion Tech., Inc., </em>998 F.2d 157 (3d Cir.1993), <em>Public Citizen v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>858 F.2d 775 (1st Cir.1988), and <em>Stinson, Lyons, Gerlin &amp; Bustamante v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>736 <em>F.Supp. </em>614 (D.N.J.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>944 F.2d 1149 (3d Cir.1991). These cases are inapposite. To be sure, there is language in all three to the effect that: \u201cAs a general proposition, pretrial discovery must take place in the public, unless compelling reasons exist for denying the public access to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Public Citizen v. Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>858 F.2d at 789. <em>See Leucadia, supra, </em>998 F.2d at 165, n. 12; <em>Stinson, supra, </em>736 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 618-19. But all three cases discuss public access to discovery documents under <em>Federal Rule </em>26 when <em>Federal Rule </em>5(d), since amended, required that all discovery motions and responses be filed with the federal district courts. In all three cases, then, a presumptive right of access existed in the documents because they were court filings. This distinction was recognized in <em>Leucadia </em>when the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">It has not been suggested that the \u201craw fruits\u201d of discovery in the possession of private litigants that have not been filed with the court are subject to any right of access. As we explained in <em>Bank of America [v. Hotel Rittenhouse Assocs., </em>800 <em>F.</em>2d 339 (3rd Cir.1986)], \u201cdiscovery ... which is ordinarily conducted in private, stands on a different footing than does a motion filed by a party seeking action by the court.\u201d 800 F.2d at 343. <em>See Mokhiber v. Davis, </em>537 A.2d 1100, 1109 (D.C.App.1988) (\u201cno right of public access to pretrial depositions, interrogatories, and documents gained through discovery\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>[998 F.2d at 163, n. 9.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>See Rosado v. Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., </em>77 <em>Conn.App. </em>690, 825 A.2d 153, 176 (2003) (recognizing that <em>Federal Rule </em>5(d) \u201ccreates a presumption that all discovery material will be available to the public because they will be filed in court....\u201d). <em>See also Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, </em>23 F.3d 772, 781, 780-83 (3d Cir.1994) (whether or not a document is subject to the right of access turns on whether it is considered to be a \u201cjudicial record\u201d and that depends upon whether the document has been filed with the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In short, there presently exists no presumptive right of public access to unfiled documents exchanged during discovery in civil litigation. In light of the parties\u2019 settlement here prior to any court filings of the documents, it is immaterial whether they may or may not have been the proper subject of a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> As we have said, the documents were filed in connection with the access motions. But as the trial judge observed: \u201cThe pending motions clearly relate to discovery, not to substantive matters ... under <em>Hammock [v. Hoffmann LaRoche, Inc., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>356, 662 A.2d 546 (1995)], materials attached to such discovery-related filings do not trigger a right of public access. <em>Hammock, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 379[, 662 A.2d at 558].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> In restating this principle in <em>Hammock, </em>the Court observed that: \"To hold otherwise would be incongruous with the goals of our broad discovery process embodied in <em>Rule </em>4:10-2, intended to effectuate \u2018the public policies of expeditious handling of cases, avoiding any stale evidence, and providing uniformity, predictability and security in the conduct of litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379-80, 662 A.2d at 558 (quoting <em>Zaccardi v.
