Pron, attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $16,848.01 for a technical violation of the CFA. The violation was defendant\u2019s misrepresentation in its advertising not to use subcontractors in the construction of an in-ground pool. Defendant also appeals the July 15, 2003 order denying its motion for reconsideration. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>On March 11, 2002, plaintiff, Michael J. Pron, filed a five-count complaint against defendant alleging breach of contract, breach of express warranties, breach of implied warranties, unjust enrichment and consumer fraud arising from defendant\u2019s construction of an in-ground pool at plaintiff\u2019s residence. A bench trial was conducted on March 4, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The following facts were testified to at trial. On April 13, 2000, plaintiff entered into a contract with defendant for the construction of a 650-square-foot plaster in-ground pool. Before entering into the contract, defendant\u2019s representative made a presentation regarding the construction of the pool. According to plaintiff, the representative \u201ckept dwelling on the fact that the whole pool will be constructed by Carlton ... [that] they would not sub any of the work out [and] use all their own employees.\u201d Defendant also provided plaintiff with a written advertisement that stated \u201c[a]ll phases of your pool constructed by our own crews (No SubContractors).\u201d Plaintiff testified that this representation \u201cwas probably the biggest thing that got [him] to sign.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">About a year after the construction, A &amp; L Pools, a company plaintiff hired for maintenance on the pool, alerted plaintiff that the pool\u2019s plaster finish was substandard and would need to be replastered. There was etching, roughing and discoloration on the pool surface. Defendant sent two representatives to plaintiff\u2019s residence to inspect the pool. They conducted a sanding test and concluded that the pool\u2019s finish was not defective. Any change in the pool surface was seemingly due to improper application of chemicals, not to faulty materials or faulty construction of the pool surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">During plaintiff\u2019s ease-in-chief, Robert Olsen, director of operations for defendant, testified that two subcontractors were used in this project, an electrician and a gas plumber. Olsen, however, testified that no subcontractors were used in the \u201cconstruction\u201d of the pool. Rather, the subcontractors were used for the lighting and heating of the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Following the presentation of plaintiffs evidence, defendant moved for a directed verdict on the contract, warranty and unjust enrichment claims. The court granted the motion. The court found that \u201c[pjlaintiff did not establish a prima facie case that [djefendant\u2019s materials or workmanship was defective in any way to cause the problems with [pjlaintiffs pool, and that [djefendant did not breach its contract or warranty with [pjlaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The judge, then, sua sponte, found that \u201cplaintiff demonstrated that [djefendant misrepresented the material fact that it would not utilize subcontractors in connection with the construction of the pool at issue ... but subcontractors were, in fact, used as part of the process.\u201d The court determined that defendant committed a technical violation of the CFA. However, the court concluded that plaintiff did not suffer any ascertainable loss as a result of this violation because the use of the subcontractors was unrelated to the discoloration, staining, etching and calcification of the plaster finish of the pool. The judge requested both parties to submit briefs concerning whether attorneys\u2019 fees and costs can be awarded for a violation of the CFA, even when no loss occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In a written opinion, the judge, in finding an entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees, quoted from <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>2, 24, 647 A.2d 454 (1994), where our Supreme Court stated: \u201ca consumer-fraud plaintiff can recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, filing fees, and costs if that plaintiff can prove that the defendant committed an unlawful practice, even if the victim cannot show any ascertainable loss and thus cannot recover treble damages.\u201d Since the judge was satisfied that defendant committed an unlawful practice in violation of the Act, the judge found plaintiff was entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees, filing fees and costs upon plaintiffs counsel filing a schedule of services with the court. By order dated May 12, 2003, the court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses in the amount of $16,846.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Defendant filed a motion for a new trial. Defendant alleged that a new trial should be granted because it did not have an opportunity to present evidence to establish it did not commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>violation of the CFA. In a written opinion the judge noted that under <em>R. </em>4:49-1(a), a motion for a new trial is granted only if there clearly and convincingly was a miscarriage of justice under the law. The judge held that defendant failed to establish a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Defendant advances three issues for our consideration. Defendant argues that the trial court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees because our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Weinberg v. Sprint Corp., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>233, 801 A.2d 281 (2002), clarified the <em>dictum </em>in <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 24-25, 647 A.2d 454, and precludes as a matter of law, in a CFA case, the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees where, as here, the court grants a defendant\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal at the end of the plaintiffs case as a result of the plaintiffs failure to prove an ascertainable loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Defendant also contends that at the end of plaintiffs case, the judge erred in sua sponte finding as a matter of law that defendant violated the CFA, without granting defendant the right to present witnesses and other evidence that would have established there was no violation of the CFA. Defendant asserts that no subcontractors were used in the construction of the pool. Any subcontractors were licensed electricians and gas plumbers used for lighting and heating work, which is not part of the pool construction. Third, defendant claims the trial court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount submitted by plaintiff, without examining the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We are convinced <em>Weinberg </em>precludes the awarding of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case. It is unnecessary to address the second and third contentions asserted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In <em>Weinberg, </em>plaintiff, Martin Weinberg, a residential telephone customer of defendant, filed a class-action lawsuit against defendant, Sprint Corporation, a national long-distance telephone service provider, that advertises and provides telephone services to New Jersey residents. Weinberg claimed that defendant\u2019s nation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>al television commercials induced residential customers to use its long-distance services by employing deceptive, fraudulent, misleading, and false advertising and promotional services designed to misrepresent and conceal its practice of charging a full minute of telephone usage, even if the caller was connected for even a few seconds. <em>Weinberg v. Sprint Corp., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 237-38, 801 A.2d 281. Weinberg contended that the practice of \u201crounding up\u201d resulted in millions of dollars in excess billing. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 801 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Weinberg </em>found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9o\">plaintiff has suffered no ascertainable loss because the filed rate doctrine precludes any award of damages to him or to the class, and so dismissal of the claim for damages was appropriate.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] We also conclude that the Act requires ascertainable loss as an essential predicate for a private cause of action. Therefore, because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that his claim of personal ascertainable loss posed a genuine issue of material fact that required submission to a jury, his remaining claims for injunctive relief and for attorneys\u2019 fees properly were dismissed also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\"><em>[Id. </em>at 240, 801 A.2d 281.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The Court made clear that a private cause of action for consumer fraud only exists for victims of consumer fraud who have suffered an ascertainable loss of money or property. <em>Id. </em>at 250, 801 A.2d 281. In reviewing its decision in <em>Cox, </em>the Court stated, \u201cAlthough we found that the plaintiff adequately demonstrated ascertainable loss under the Act and addressed all issues necessary to our decision, we further observed that even if the plaintiff is not successful in proving to the factfinder the existence of ascertainable loss, and thus unable to recover treble damages, the plaintiff can recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if he can prove that the defendant committed an unlawful practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 801 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Court then framed the issue in <em>Weinberg, </em>as follows: \u201cThe question now squarely before us is whether a plaintiff, who pleads but cannot survive a motion for summary judgment in respect of the issue of ascertainable loss, may proceed with remaining claims for ... attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act. We hold that that plaintiff cannot go forward.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">The legislative intent to permit a private cause of action under the Act would be frustrated if a private litigant, who succeeds in bringing such a claim to a jury, must gamble on whether he or she will prevail ultimately on proof of the loss in order to obtain attorneys\u2019 fees, when he or she otherwise proves unlawful conduct. Thus understood, the plaintiff with a <em>bona fide </em>claim of ascertainable loss that raises a genuine issue of fact requiring resolution by the factfinder would be entitled to seek also injunctive relief when appropriate, and to receive an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, even if the plaintiff ultimately loses on his damage claim but does prove an unlawful practice under the Act. The Act\u2019s remedial purposes are promoted thereby and the Legislature\u2019s requirement of ascertainable loss for a private cause of action is respected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">In this action, plaintiff failed to present such a claim of ascertainable loss because operation of the filed rate doctrine precluded him from any claim to monetary damages. He was charged the rate in defendant\u2019s filed tariff. He had no lawful claim to have been charged any other rate and could present no genuine issue of fact on his assertion of loss. We hold that the courts below correctly dismissed his claim for compensatory damages under the Act. Plaintiff may not proceed solely on his claims for injunctive relief and attorneys\u2019 fees. Accordingly, his remaining claims properly were dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 253-54, 801 A.2d 281.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In this case, the trial judge in granting an involuntary dismissal under <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b) determined that plaintiff had shown no ascertainable loss and no right to relief. The judge granted the motion because the damages to the swimming pool were not proximately caused by the electrical or heating subcontractors, whose use the plaintiff contended constituted a misrepresentation by defendant cognizable under the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>R. </em>4:37-2(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">At Trial \u2014 Generally. After having completed the presentation of the evidence on all matters other than the matter of damages (if that is an issue), the plaintiff shall so announce to the court, and thereupon the defendant, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal of the action or of any claim on the ground that upon the facts and upon the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. Whether the action is tried with or without a jury, such motion shall be denied if the evidence, together with the legitimate inferences therefrom, could sustain a judgment in plaintiffs favor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">A defendant\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal at the close of plaintiffs case, even where the trial is by the court without a jury, should be denied, if the plaintiff has proved a prima facie case. Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2 on <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b) (2005). A prima facie ease for purposes of <em>R. </em>4:37\u2014 2 means \u201cany evidence including any favorable inference to be drawn therefrom which could sustain a judgment in plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Conversely, a \u201cdismissal is appropriate when no rational jury could conclude from the evidence that an essential element of the plaintiffs case is present.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969), stated: \u201cthe judicial function [on a motion for an involuntary dismissal under the rule] is quite a mechanical one. The trial court is not concerned with the worth, nature or extent (beyond a mere scintilla) of the evidence, but only with its existence, viewed most favorably to the party opposing the motion.\u201d \u201cThe motion ordinarily may not be granted either on a party\u2019s application or the court\u2019s sua sponte until all the plaintiffs proofs have been presented.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2 on <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The determination that there was no ascertainable loss in <em>Weinberg, </em>however, occurred not as a result of a motion for involuntary dismissal made after plaintiff presented all of his proofs and before the defendant\u2019s ease would ordinarily begin. In <em>Weinberg, </em>Sprint was granted summary judgment under <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>R. </em>4:46-2(c) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">The judgment or order sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law. An issue of fact is genuine only if, considering the burden of persuasion at trial, the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The essence of the inquiry is \u201c \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>242, 251-52, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 214 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Under the CFA, proof of an ascertainable loss is a requirement for a private cause of action. <em>Weinberg, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 801 A.2d 281. Therefore, a plaintiff who pleads, but cannot survive a motion for summary judgment in respect to the issue of ascertainable loss, may not proceed with attorneys\u2019 fees under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 801 A.2d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The standard for granting summary judgment and the standard for granting an involuntary dismissal at the end of the plaintiffs case are the same and functional equivalents. <em>Schneider v. Simonini, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>336, 360, 749 A.2d 336 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1146, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>1083, 148 L.Ed.2d 959 (2001); <em>Van Meter v. Darien Park Dist. </em>207 <em>Ill.2d </em>359, 278 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>555, 799 N.E.2d 273, 278 (2003); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>4:46-2 (2005). Both examine the plaintiffs proofs to determine if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>there is an issue of fact for a factfinder\u2019s decision. If there are no facts in dispute and the applicable law applied to the existing facts permits of but one result, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law or an involuntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In <em>Weinberg, </em>Sprint\u2019s customer suffered no ascertainable loss from paying for time \u201crounded up\u201d to the next minute on the telephone bill, since the filed-rate doctrine precluded an award of money damages. Here, plaintiff, the swimming pool consumer, sustained no ascertainable loss by defendant\u2019s retention of an electrical and heating subcontractor even though the subcontracting for these functions was arguably contrary to the representation in defendant\u2019s advertisement and in the conversation between its representative and plaintiff. The damages to the swimming pool plaster had no proven causal connection to the alleged misrepresentation. The judge so found based on the evidence in the record at the conclusion of plaintiffs case. Defendant was not called upon or indeed permitted to present a defense because, as a matter of law, plaintiff failed to prove a prima facie ease of an essential element for a private cause of action under the CFA. There was an involuntary dismissal of plaintiffs CFA claim because no ascertainable loss was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We hold that in a Consumer Fraud Act case where the defendant obtains a motion for involuntary dismissal at the end of the plaintiffs case for failure to prove an ascertainable loss, and the defendant is not required to present its defense to the plaintiffs claim, and the fact-finder, whether judge or jury is not called upon to decide whether an ascertainable loss has been proved, plaintiff is not entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\"> The filed rate doctrine \u201c 'forbids a regulated entity to charge rates for its services other than those properly filed with the appropriate federal regulatory authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fax Telecommunicaciones, Inc. v. AT &amp; T, </em>138 F.3d 479, 488 (2nd Cir.1998) (citing <em>Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. v. Hall, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>571, 577, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2925, 2930, 69 L.Ed.2d 856, 863-64 (1981)). \" '[T]he [FCA] does not permit either a [customer\u2019s] ignorance or the carrier\u2019s misquotation of the applicable rate to serve as a defense to the collection of the filed rate.' \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Maislin Indus., US., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>116, 120, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2759, 2763, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>94 (1990)). \"[C]ustomers are 'conclusively presumed\u2019 to have constructive knowledge of the filed tariff....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489 (citing <em>Kansas City S.
