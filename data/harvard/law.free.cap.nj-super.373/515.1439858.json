N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 860 A.2d 463 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>151, 862 A.2d 59 (2004). Therefore, the only issue that needs to be addressed in this appeal is the validity of the part of the October 26th notice that closed all lands owned, managed or controlled by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to bear hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Appellants present two arguments in support of their challenge to this part of the October 26, 2004 notice. First, appellants contend that the Commissioner lacks statutory authority to close lands under his control to bear hunting. Second, appellants contend that even if the Commissioner has such authority, his exercise of that authority to close state lands for this year\u2019s bear hunt was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">The Legislature has conferred general authority upon the Commissioner \u201cto direct and coordinate the uses of all public lands under the jurisdiction of the [DEP].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1B-5(a). Lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>under the DEP\u2019s jurisdiction include \u201call State forests, State parks, State recreation areas, State historic sites, and State natural areas, excepting those regulated by interstate eompact[,]\u201d which are managed by the Division of Parks and Forestry \u201cunder the direction and supervision of the commissioner[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-15.101. Lands under the DEP\u2019s jurisdiction also include some lands managed by the Division of Fish and Wildlife. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:25-2.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The Commissioner has adopted extensive regulations that govern the use of State lands managed by the Division of Parks and Forestry, which are known as the State Park Service Code. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:2-1.1 to -17.5. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:2-2.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">The State Park Service [an agency within the Division of Parks and Forestry] shall designate or direct any and all recreational or other use on its lands and waters and within its facilities to such specific areas or locations within or upon said land, waters, and facilities as will be in the best interest of conservation, recreation, preservation and management of the natural and historic resources and the health, safety, and welfare of all persons concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:2-2.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">The Director of the Division of Parks and Forestry or the Assistant Director of the Division for the State Park Service may limit or close to the public use, specific areas, lands, waters and facilities under its jurisdiction and control as part of a State Park whenever such action is deemed necessary for proper management and operation and/or in the best interest of health, safety and the general welfare of the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\"><em>N.JAC. </em>7:2-2.18 deals specifically with the authorization of hunting on lands managed by the Division of Parks and Forestry. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:2-2.18(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">A person shall not hunt, fish and/or trap, except on specifically designated lands and waters of the State Park Service. All such use shall comply with the Game Code, N.J.A.C. 7:25-5....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:2-2.18(b), (c) and (d) impose various restrictions on the manner in which hunting may be conducted on those State lands where the DEP permits hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">Despite the Legislature\u2019s delegation to the Commissioner of general authority \u201cto direct and coordinate the uses of all public lands under the jurisdiction of the [DEP],\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-5(a), which include State parks, forests and recreation areas, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>13:1B-15.101, appellants argue that this authority does not extend to a prohibition against hunting. Appellants argue that the Fish and Game Council has exclusive authority under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-32(c) to establish the \u201cterritorial limits\u201d of a hunt. <em>See U.S. Sportsmen\u2019s Alliance Found., supra, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 603-04, 860 A.2d at 466-67. However, this argument confuses the Council\u2019s regulatory authority to determine \u201cwhen and where ... hunting ... shall take place, and which ... game animals ... may be taken and in what numbers[,]\u201d <em>Humane Soc\u2019y of U.S. v. N.J. State Fish &amp; Game Council, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>565, 569, 362 A.2d 20, 22 (1976), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>723, 50 L.Ed.2d 744 (1977), with the proprietary authority of any private or public landowner to determine whether to allow hunting on its land. The Legislature has delegated this proprietary authority over State parks, forests and recreation areas to the Commissioner, not to the Council. Therefore, while the Council has authority to determine whether the territorial limits of a hunt will include State lands under the DEP\u2019s jurisdiction, the Commissioner has ultimate authority to determine whether to open those lands to hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The Supreme Court specifically indicated, in upholding the constitutionality of the method of appointment of members of the Fish and Game Council, that the Council\u2019s powers do not extend to determining whether state parks, forests and recreation areas will be open to hunting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">The [Fish and Game] Council does not have unfettered authority to decide that hunting or fishing will take place on private property, see <em>N.J.S.A </em>23:7-1, or on state-owned lands. As to the latter, co-existing with the Division of Fish, Game and Shell Fisheries in the Department of Environmental Protection is the Division of Parks, Forestry and Recreation, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-15.100 <em>et seq., </em>which has its own Council.... The competitive interests of the respective Councils are served by the legislative scheme, and it is fair to say that the interests of plaintiffs in enjoying the state\u2019s lands and wildlife for purposes other than hunting and fishing are represented in part by the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Council.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">In summary, what authority the Fish and Game Council has been given by <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1B-30, empowering that body to determine \u201cunder what circumstances, when and in what localities, by what means and in what amounts and numbers\u201d fish and game may be taken, must be said to be circumscribed by other agencies.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>[Humane Soc\u2019y of U.S., supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 576-77, 362 A.2d at 26-27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Subsequent to the <em>Humane Society </em>decision, the Legislature repealed the statute establishing the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Council. <em>L. </em>1978, c. 34, \u00a7 4. However, the functions of that Council had been solely advisory. <em>See L. </em>1966, c. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5. Thus, when the <em>Humane Society </em>case was decided, as at the present time, the ultimate authority \u201cto direct and coordinate the uses\u201d of State parks, forests and recreation areas, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-5(a), including the determination whether to allow hunting, rested with the Commissioner. Therefore, the Fish and Game Council\u2019s statutory authority to determine whether and where to allow hunting is \u201ccircumscribed\u201d by the Commissioner\u2019s statutory authority to determine whether to open State parks, forests and recreation areas to hunting. <em>Humane Soc\u2019y of U.S., supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 362 A.2d at 27; <em>see also Humane Soc\u2019y of U.S. v. Guido, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 230-31, 413 A.2d 990, 993-94 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to close all State lands under the DEP\u2019s jurisdiction to bear hunting was arbitrary and capricious is simply a reformulation of their argument that the Commissioner lacks statutory authority to close State lands to a hunt authorized by the Fish and Game Council. Appellants argue that because the Council has authorized a bear hunt, the Commissioner\u2019s closure of State lands to that hunt subverts the Council\u2019s policy determination to allow bear hunting and is therefore arbitrary and capricious. However, as previously discussed, the Legislature has delegated plenary authority to the Commissioner to determine what \u201cuses\u201d will be allowed in state parks, forests and recreation areas. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1B-5(a). In the exercise of this authority, the Commissioner may close particular parks, forests and recreation areas to all hunting, or the Commissioner may allow the hunting of some game species on those State lands but prohibit other hunting. In the part of his October 26th notice challenged in this appeal, the Commissioner has established the parks, forests and recreation areas under the DEP\u2019s jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>tion as sanctuaries in which bears may not be hunted this season. In making this decision, the Commissioner was exercising the same authority as any other private or public landowner to control the use of its land, including whether to allow hunting. See <em>Humane Society of U.S., supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 576-77, 362 A.2d at 26-27. The Commissioner\u2019s exercise of his authority to control the uses of State parks, forests and recreation areas, like any other authority delegated to an administrative official, may not be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>See N.J. State League of Municipalities v. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21, 27 (1999). Thus, if it could be shown that bears pose a serious threat to public safety and that hunting on state lands must be allowed to combat this threat, the Commissioner\u2019s closure of state lands to bear hunting could be found to be arbitrary and capricious. But the mere fact that the Fish and Game Council has determined to authorize bear hunting does not make the Commissioner\u2019s statutorily authorized decision to close State lands to such hunting arbitrary and capricious, and appellants have not undertaken to demonstrate that there is any public safety or other vital public interest that requires State lands to be open to bear hunting.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the part of the Commissioner\u2019s October 26th notice that closed all lands owned, managed or controlled by the DEP to bear hunting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
