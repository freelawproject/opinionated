On November 15, 1984, DCYS filed a petition in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (a) alleging the child to be neglected and uncared for. On the same date, DCYS also sought and was granted an ex parte order of temporary custody. This order was confirmed on January 8,1985, after three days of hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (b). After numerous pretrial motions, trial commenced on April 26, 1985, and was concluded on July 2, 1985. The court rendered judgment on October 8, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The facts, as found by the trial court, are essentially as follows. Carl O. was the fourth child born to Pamela Y. Parental rights in her three other children had been terminated and the children placed in adoption because Pamela\u2019s long standing mental illness prevented her from caring for her infant children.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">After Carl\u2019s birth, the attending physician asked the parents routine questions regarding preparations for the baby\u2019s care upon his discharge from the hospital. This query was greeted by total silence from the mother and death threats to the physician from the father. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>father also threatened other members of the hospital staff and such threats alarmed the staff to the extent that some of them removed their identification badges. In addition, the father seemed to be preoccupied with the astrological signs accompanying Carl\u2019s birth and showed no concern for any planning required for the care of the newborn child. The father\u2019s verbal responses and his behavior indicated that he was content to leave the care of the child to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">While the mother was still in the hospital after the delivery of the child, she acted confused. At times, she interacted with the baby and at other times she failed to respond to the baby\u2019s needs. Sometimes she would react to the doctor, but at other times she failed to make a verbal response or to maintain eye contact. On occasion, she seemed to be unaware of the baby\u2019s distress. For example, on one occasion, the baby lay choking on her lap for as long as ten to twenty seconds but she did not respond until a staff member intervened. She appeared to hear the nurse\u2019s instructions, but made no change in her behavior or attitude toward the child. According to the attending physician, the mother required \u201ca lot more than average\u201d supervision when the baby was entrusted to her care. This fact, according to the physician, was <em>\u201ca </em>major concern to pediatricians and nurses,\u201d leading the staff to fear that she might forget that the baby was there at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Before the birth of the child, Pamela had displayed aberrant behavior during her prenatal visits to the hospital. She would sit with her head bowed, refuse to wait long enough to take a prescribed blood test, and showed signs of nervousness, anxiety, incoherence and unresponsiveness. This pattern of behavior continued after the child\u2019s birth and during DCYS\u2019s attempt to establish parental ties through visitations. Pamela\u2019s mental condition required that she be admitted to Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>necticut Valley Hospital soon after the child was born. There was no change in her attitude towards the child upon her release from this hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The father acted in a detached manner towards the child. He did not seem to appreciate the limitations on Pamela\u2019s ability to care for the child. Even before the child\u2019s birth, he threatened a social worker with bodily harm, accusing her of wanting to take children away from parents. After the birth, when the social worker attempted to speak to both parents, Merritt became so violent and loud that other patients on the floor became alarmed. He also threatened to kill the social worker. When Pamela was committed to Connecticut Valley Hospital, he offered no plan to care for the baby but expressed a willingness to place the baby in foster care until the mother\u2019s release. During the visitation sessions, Merritt displayed little interest in the child, concentrating his attention on the other adults present and frequently discussing astrology.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Two court appointed evaluators, a psychiatrist and a pediatrician, concluded in a joint report that \u201cneither parent gave any indication of being capable of meeting the complex demands presented by child care\u201d because of their minimizing \u201cto an extreme degree\u201d the problems entailed in the care of an infant. They also concluded that \u201ctheir lack of insight and suspiciousness would make it extremely difficult for them to profit from even an intense remediation program.\u201d Merritt was found to be disorganized, guarded, suspicious and lacking insight into the realities of his own life or the needs of the baby. Pamela fared no better. She too, like Merritt, was disorganized and suspicious, but was, in addition, withdrawn, preoccupied and confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The pediatrician found the baby, Carl, to be more than ordinarily sensitive, needing a caretaker with more than normal child care skills, one able to ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>tain immediate needs and make appropriate responses. Further, the pediatrician concluded that it would be \u201ca hazard to his development\u201d if the child were cared for by his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In a well reasoned, legally sound and meticulously detailed memorandum of decision the trial court expressly found the following facts. Pamela suffers from chronic mental illness with a long history of repeated hospitalizations followed by an established pattern of discontinued medication and outpatient therapy after each discharge. Merritt, while not psychotic, has a history of institutionalizations, economic dependency, and disorganized thinking. The relationship between the parents is stormy. While Pamela passively permitted Merritt to take charge of their lives, she resisted his efforts to see that she received psychiatric treatment and several times accused him of physically abusing her. Both parents lack insight, evidence minimal judgment, are guarded, suspicious, resistant to instruction in child care, and have unreal expectations of a baby. These characteristics render them incapable of either acquiring the necessary \u201cknowledge base\u201d normally acquired from experience of actually caring for a child, or benefiting from community resources. The child, since birth, has always received excellent child care from others than his biological parents, first in the hospital and later in foster care under an order of temporary custody. But for the intervention of the hospital and DCYS in preventing the parents from exercising custody, Carl would have been denied adequate care and would have been in danger of serious injury from the date of his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The court concluded on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence, that Carl was \u201cuncared for\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120. Thereupon, the court rendered judgment committing Carl to the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>sioner of DCYS for the statutory eighteen month period. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">From the court\u2019s judgment, the parents have each filed an appeal, which have been consolidated, and claim, essentially, that the trial court erred (1) in granting and confirming the order of temporary custody, (2) in holding that Carl O. was \u201chomeless,\u201d (3) in holding that Carl O. has \u201cspecial needs,\u201d (4) in denying Pamela\u2019s motion to enforce rights, (5) in granting DCYS\u2019s motion to amend, (6) in interpreting General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-129 and 46b-120 in a manner that is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, (7) in refusing to find that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 was in violation of the due process clauses of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, and (8) in rendering a judgment of commitment where such decision was not supported by the evidence. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The respondents\u2019 first claim of error is that the court erred in granting and confirming the award of temporary custody. Any issues involving the order of temporary custody, however, are moot because that order expired when the child was later adjudicated an uncared for child and was committed to DCYS for the statutory period. The order of temporary custody is therefore academic. Appellate courts will not consider academic questions, particularly where no appropriate relief may be afforded. <em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17, 19, 411 A.2d 1 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In the second and third claims of error, the respondent father claims that the trial court erred in finding that the child was \u201chomeless\u201d and that the parents could not \u201cprovide the specialized care which his physical, emotional or mental condition requires.\u201d The court made these findings when determining pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (d) whether the child was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201cuncared for\u201d as alleged in the petition. The term \u201cuncared for\u201d is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 as follows: \u201ca child or youth may be found \u2018uncared for\u2019 who is homeless or whose home cannot provide the specialized care which his physical, emotional or mental condition requires.\u201d The trial court found that the child was \u201cuncared for\u201d under both the \u201chomeless\u201d and \u201cspecialized care\u201d sections of the statute. We review only the claim that the court erred in concluding that DCYS had established that the child was \u201cuncared for\u201d under the \u201cspecialized care\u201d section of the statute, since our decision that the court did not err in this finding is sufficient to sustain the court\u2019s conclusion that the child was \u201cuncared for\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-129 (b) and 46b-120. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-BC), </em>189 Conn. 66, 69, 454 A.2d 1262 (1983); <em>In re James T., </em>9 Conn. App. 608, 619, 520 A.2d 644 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The respondent father claims that the trial court erroneously concluded that the child had \u201cspecial needs\u201d merely because he was an infant. This claim misconstrues the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. The trial court found that the child required specialized care both because of his infancy and his particularly sensitive nature. The court further found that his parents were not capable of providing that care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence fully supports these conclusions. The pediatrician examining Carl found him to be more than ordinarily sensitive, requiring a caretaker who could detect and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>respond to his immediate needs. Furthermore, there was expert testimony that even with \u201can intensive remediation program\u201d the parents would not be able to minister to the child\u2019s needs. \u201c \u2018[W]e are not in a position to second-guess the opinions of witnesses, professional or otherwise, nor the observations and conclusions of the [trial court] when they are based on reliable evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Theresa S., </em>196 Conn. 18, 27, 491 A.2d 355 (1985), quoting <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-BC), </em>supra, 77. We find no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that the child was \u201cuncared for\u201d because the parents could not provide the specialized care which his physical, emotional or mental condition requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In a fourth claim of error, the respondent mother claims that the court erred in denying her motion to enforce rights. By this motion, the respondent claims that under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the DCYS was required to make reasonable efforts to reunite the family. This issue was recently considered by this court in <em>In re Cynthia A., </em>8 Conn. App. 656, 664, 514 A.2d 320 (1986). There we stated: \u201cThe act, however, is an appropriations act and does not apply to individual actions or judicial findings as the respondent argues, but merely sets forth gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>eral guidelines for a state\u2019s continued eligibility to receive funds for foster care maintenance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601, 627, and 670-72.\u201d <em>In re Cynthia A., </em>supra, 664-65. Furthermore, even if we were to find that this federal act conferred specific rights to the respondents in this situation, the respondent mother has claimed only that the act was violated during the temporary custody proceedings, and not also during the adjudication and dispositional proceedings. As noted above, any claimed errors in the temporary custody proceeding were rendered moot after the child was adjudicated an uncared for child in the later proceeding. We therefore find no merit to this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">A fifth claim of error is that the court improperly allowed DCYS to amend its petition. The respondent mother first asserts that the court abused its discretion by allowing the amendment on the eve of trial. We find no abuse of discretion in this instance. The trial court complied with the appropriate Practice Book section<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and offered to grant the respondents a continuance on at least two occasions to prepare to respond to the amendment. These offers were declined. Second, the respondent mother claims that the court erred in granting the amendment because the amended petition contained allegations relating to events that occurred after the filing of the original petition that are, therefore, only relevant to the dispositional, and not adjudicatory, phase of the hearing. She has failed, however, to refer us to any authority to support her claim that such a procedure is impermissible. The trial court, in response to this claim stated: \u201cMy practice has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>always been that when pleadings are stale, they should be updated so that the basis for the Court taking jurisdiction is not very ancient in time. Six months isn\u2019t always that ancient, but it is for a child six months\u2019 old. It seems to be extremely artificial to put our minds back ... I don\u2019t think it does any hardships since I said that I would grant whatever continuance was necessary to enable you to prepare.\u201d We find no error in this reasoning. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In a sixth claim of error, the respondent mother claims that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129, as applied by the trial court, is unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. She claims that the trial court\u2019s construction of the term \u201chomeless,\u201d one of the two grounds set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 for finding a child \u201cuncared for,\u201d is so broad that an ordinary person would not be advised of what behavior is considered incompetent. We will not review this claim, however, because we have previously held that the trial court\u2019s finding that the child is \u201cuncared for\u201d is sustainable on the alternative ground set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120. An appellate court \u201cwill not pass upon a constitutional question if there is present some other ground upon which the case may be decided.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>183 Conn. 76, 84-85, 438 A.2d 824 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In a seventh claim of error, the respondent mother claims that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (c) violates the due process clauses of the United States and Connecticut constitutions. This statute provides in part: \u201cThe court after hearing on the petition and upon a finding that the physical or mental ability of a parent or guardian to care for the-child or youth before the court is at issue may order a thorough physical or mental examination, or both, of the parent or guardian whose competency is in question.\u201d In the present case, the court, after a hearing, ordered the respondent mother to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>undergo a psychological and psychiatric evaluation pursuant to this section. One of the doctors performing that evaluation later testified as to statements she made. Although the respondent mother claims that the statute violates procedural due process, she essentially argues that the statute violates her constitutional right against self incrimination by compelling her to make statements, albeit to a psychiatrist, that were introduced into evidence against her. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-137 (b); Practice Book \u00a7 1046 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In order to prevail on this claim, the respondent mother would, at a minimum, have to demonstrate (1) that the constitutional right against self-incrimination, a right in criminal prosecutions, extends as a matter of constitutional law to parents in juvenile proceedings, and (2) that if such a right exists, it would prohibit not only the compulsory testimony of a parent, but also the testimony of a doctor examining a parent. The respondent mother has cited no authority to support either of these propositions. Furthermore, there can be no question that the statute complies with procedural due process. \u201cAt their core, the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions require that one subject to a significant deprivation of liberty or property must be accorded adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Council on Probate Judicial Conduct re: James H. Kinsella, </em>193 Conn. 180, 207, 476 A.2d 1041 (1984). General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (c), by requiring the court to conduct a hearing before it may order the parent to undergo a mental examination, provides the necessary procedural protections to satisfy the state and federal due process clauses. We therefore find no merit to the respondent mother\u2019s claim that the statute violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Finally, the respondents contend that the court\u2019s disposition committing the child to DCYS for a period of eighteen months was not supported by a fair prepon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>derance of the evidence. This claim is wholly without merit. The facts and circumstances as revealed by the record and transcript fully support the court\u2019s disposition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> The minor child, Carl 0., has been represented by counsel throughout these proceedings. On appeal, counsel for Carl O. has agreed with DCYS and has adopted its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\"> In granting temporary custody, the court found that the child \u201cwould have been imminently endangered in view of the uncontradicted evidence of parental incapacity.\u201d Under the order of temporary custody, either respondent was allowed to seek an opening of the order at any time provided he or she filed an offer of proof of changed circumstances, such as an improvement in the condition of the mother or suitable child care proposals of the father. Between the date of the order and the date of the trial on the petition for commitment six months later, however, no such offer of proof was made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\"> The court found: \u201cAll babies have special needs that are not shared by older children capable of meeting many of their own needs. Babies are totally dependent upon adult caretakers for every detail of their existence, and a parent capable of caring adequately for a 10 year old, or even a five year old, might not be capable of caring for an infant. In addition, Carl at less than five months of age, was an extraordinarily sensitive baby, needing more than the usual degree of appropriate responsiveness from his adult caretaker. Neither Pamela nor Merritt was capable, as of the time of filing the amended petition, of providing this special care. Carl O. was, therefore, uncared-for in the sense of having parents incapable of providing the care required to meet his special needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 672 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cEach State with a plan approved under this part shall make foster care maintenance payments . . . with respect to a child who would meet the requirements of section 606 (a) of this title or of section 607 of this title . . . if \u2014 (1) the removal from the home occurred pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement entered into by the child's parent or legal guardian, or was the result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child and . . . that reasonable efforts of the type described in section 671 (a) (15) of this title have been made <em>. . . .\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Section 671 of that Act provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn order for a State to be eligible for payments under this part, it shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which \u2014 (15) . . . provides that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 1029 provides: \u201cA petition may be amended at any time by the court on its own motion or in response to the motion of any interested party prior to the final adjudication of delinquency or neglect.
