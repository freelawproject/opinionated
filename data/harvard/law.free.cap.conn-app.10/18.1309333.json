He claims that the trial court erred in its interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, thereby erroneously concluding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate the existence of any material issue of fact. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">The following facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff sued the defendant for legal malpractice arising from the plaintiff\u2019s retention of the defendant to prosecute on behalf of the plaintiff any and all claims arising out of an employment accident that occurred on June 21, 1979. The plaintiff was injured when a forklift operated by a fellow employee ran over his foot. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was negligent in failing to inform him of the possibility of suing the former fellow employee for the alleged negligent operation of the forklift under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the plaintiff had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>to produce any documentary evidence suggesting the existence of a disputed factual issue and demonstrating the collectibility of any judgment which may have been obtained. See <em>Palmieri </em>v. <em>Winnick, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 144, 482 A.2d 1229 (1984). Upon the stipulation of the parties, the trial court vacated this summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">After the plaintiff amended his complaint, the defendant again moved for summary judgment, claiming that the amended complaint did \u201cnothing to create a genuine issue as to the material fact that any judgment which plaintiff may have obtained against his fellow employee would not have been collectible.\u201d In his objection to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff claimed that a judgment against the fellow employee could have been collected under the employer\u2019s \u201cComprehensive General Liability\u201d insurance policy. The plaintiff acknowledged that the policy specifically excluded \u201cbodily injury to any employee of the Insured arising out of and in the course of employment by the Insured.\u201d He contended, however, that General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a rendered that provision of the policy ineffective. The plaintiff relied upon the last two sentences of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a, which renders null and void any provision of motor vehicle insurance policies which \u201cexcludes from coverage thereunder any agent, representative or employee of the owner of a motor vehicle involved in an accident with a fellow employee . . ; . \u201d He argued that under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a, the exclusion in the employer\u2019s comprehensive general liability insurance policy must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">A hearing was held on the motion for summary judgment, at which time the plaintiff agreed that it was necessary to establish the collectibility of any possible judgment, and that, absent the availability of insurance coverage, the putative judgment would not be collectible. The court granted the motion for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ment, finding that the policy in question specifically excluded coverage under the facts of the case, and that General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a did not nullify the insurance policy\u2019s exclusionary provision. It is this finding that the plaintiff challenges in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The relevant portion of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a provides: \u201cNo insurance policy or contract shall be accepted as proof of financial responsibility of the owner and as evidence of the insuring of such person for injury to or death of persons and damage to property by the commissioner of motor vehicles required by chapter 246 [Motor Vehicles] if it excludes from coverage under such policy or contract any agent, representative or employee of such owner from such policy or contract. Any provision of such an insurance policy or contract effected after July 1,1969, which excludes from coverage thereunder any agent, representative or employee of the owner of a motor vehicle involved in an accident with a fellow employee shall be null and void.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the nullification provision applies to the employer\u2019s comprehensive general liability insurance policy, even though he conceded at oral argument before this court that the policy was never submitted to or accepted by the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to chapter 246 of the motor vehicle laws. We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">When General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a is read as a whole; see <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); and in accordance with the plain meaning of the language employed by the legislature; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; it is clear that the nullification provision of the statute invalidates the fellow worker\u2019s exclusion only in insurance policies submitted and accepted as proof of financial responsibility required under the motor vehicle laws as specified in the statute. We find, therefore, that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>was correct in concluding that the plaintiff could not have recovered under the employer\u2019s comprehensive general liability insurance policy. There being no material issue of fact regarding the uncollectibility of a putative judgment against the plaintiff\u2019s fellow employee, the trial court correctly rendered summary judgment for the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-11\"> In his brief, the defendant offers an alternative ground to support the result reached by the trial court. He argues that at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, June 21, 1979, a forklift was not considered a motor vehicle under General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a, which then provided, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cIf an employee or, in case of his death, his dependent has a right to benefits or compensation under this chapter on account of injury or death from injury caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow employee, such right shall be the exclusive remedy of such injured employee or dependent and no action may be brought against such fellow employee except for negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle as defined in section 14-1 or unless such wrong was wilful or malicious.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-293a.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">There is no indication in the record, nor does the defendant claim, that this issue was raised before the trial court. We shall, therefore, decline to review it. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185 (formerly \u00a7 3063). Furthermore, the defendant failed to file a preliminary statement of issues which asserted this alternative ground in support of the conclusion of the trial court, as required by Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (formerly \u00a7 3012). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>McIver, </em>201 Conn. 559, 568 n.3, 518 A.2d 1368 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
