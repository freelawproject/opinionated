We find error on the second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: In the early morning hours of April 11,1984, the complainant was carrying a large radio and walking from the Father Panick Village to his home on Center Street in Bridgeport. As he reached the Highland Avenue Extension, he was approached by two men whom he knew. He had worked with one of them, the defendant, at a fence company and knew him as \u201cJune Bug.\u201d The other man was called \u201cButch.\u201d The three men talked for a time, and eventually the defendant took a small gun from his jacket and commented that he was interested in selling it. He then asked the complainant if he could \u201csee\u201d the radio, and the complainant handed it to him. The defendant, holding the gun in one hand and the radio with the other, told Butch he would give him the radio for his birthday. Moments later, a car drove up, and the defendant and Butch got in and were driven away taking the complainant\u2019s radio with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The jury rendered a guilty verdict. The defendant moved to set aside the verdict, arguing that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, through the use or threat of force, committed a robbery rather than a simple larceny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The disputed issue at trial boiled down to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>whether the defendant threatened the complainant with the use of force by the display of the gun. See footnote <em>2, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt. We address this claim first because \u201c \u2018 \u201cif we were to rule that the evidence was insufficient, the defendant would be entitled to an acquittal rather than a new trial. <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 18, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 46, 463 A.2d 573 (1983). \u201c Tn determining whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict, \u201cthe issue is whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d . . .\u2019(Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 402-403, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981); see also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, reh. denied, 444 U.S. 890, 100 S. Ct. 195, 62 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 666, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). In reviewing the evidence we must construe it in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>supra.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellegrino, </em>194 Conn. 279, 294, 480 A.2d 537 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 21-22, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>8 Conn. App. 496, 499, 513 A.2d 738 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The jury in this case apparently found that the defendant\u2019s display of a gun while accompanied by another man and coupled with his request to \u201csee\u201d the lone victim\u2019s radio, was sufficient to conclude that \u201cthrough the use or threat of force\u201d he committed a robbery rather than a larceny. We are convinced that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>this evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, is sufficient to uphold the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim involves the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jurors that they could draw inferences from circumstantial evidence if \u201cthe inference asked to be drawn is logical and reasonable and strong enough so that you can find <em>it is more probable than not, </em>the fact to be inferred is true.\u201d The defendant contends that this charge unconstitutionally diluted the state\u2019s burden of proving every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt by allowing the jury to infer that he intended to communicate a threat for the purpose of committing a larceny by an erroneous \u201cmore probable than not\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">At the outset, we note that the defendant failed to except to this portion of the charge at trial. Generally, such a failure to except renders the claim of error unreviewable. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 852, 4185 (formerly \u00a7 3063). The defendant seeks review under the <em>Evans </em>bypass; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973); claiming that the error implicates his fundamental constitutional right that the state establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree and therefore will review the claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 756, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>7 Conn. App. 149, 153, 508 A.2d 49, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 512 A.2d 229 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">It is a fundamental principle of both criminal and constitutional law that a defendant is innocent until the state proves him or her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 361, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). Thus, an instruction that dilutes or shifts the state\u2019s burden is unconstitutional. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>202 Conn. 1, 11, 519 A.2d 58 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 131-32, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s instructions concerning circumstantial evidence and inferences to be drawn therefrom permitted the jury to infer his intent to communicate a threat by only a preponderance of the evidence rather than requiring them to infer and find such intent beyond a reasonable doubt. When the principal disputed issue in a case is intent, which is \u201c \u2018characteristically proven by circumstantial evidence; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 105, 505 A.2d 712 (1986); the court\u2019s instructions regarding the use of circumstantial evidence as proof of this essential element are subject to close scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 757, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>supra, 155; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 56-59, 502 A.2d 360 (1986). We have closely scrutinized the court\u2019s charge in this case and conclude that \u201c \u2018it cannot be said that the incorrect statement did not influence the jury\u2019 \u201d with respect to the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant\u2019s intent beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 756-57. We note that this case is distinguishable from another recent instructional error case; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>201 Conn. 659, 673, 519 A.2d 26 (1986); in which our Supreme Court found that a jury had not been misled. The disputed issue in <em>Smith </em>was the victim\u2019s credibility, while in the present case the issue was intent. Thus, we are constrained to follow the <em>Whelan, Rodgers, </em>and <em>Farrar </em>line of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The state argues that even if the charge was improper, it should be deemed harmless through application of the harmless error test. The state claims that the recent case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986), requires such application. We agree and note that this court has recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>held precisely that. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>10 Conn. App. 279, 288-90, 523 A.2d 508 (1987). In order to find the error in this case harmless, we must be able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt, that the evidence on the disputed issue is so strong that the erroneous instruction did not contribute to the guilty verdict. We are unable to so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The evidence tending to prove that the defendant threatened the complainant with the use of force by displaying the gun, while \u201csufficient\u201d was not \u201coverwhelming.\u201d See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 3110, Burger, J., concurring. The evidence showed that the defendant, upon showing the gun, remarked that he wanted to sell the weapon. In addition, the complainant testified that even if the defendant did not have a gun he probably would have given him the radio anyway. Confronted with only this evidence on the issue of intent, we are unable to conclude that the evidence was so overwhelming that it renders the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Our conclusion that the erroneous instruction was not harmless does not undermine our conclusion that the evidence sufficiently supported the verdict. Instructional error on the proper standard of proof may affect the conclusions reached by the jury on the basis of the evidence. It cannot, however, diminish the quantum of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Our resolution of the instructional error claim is dis-positive. Although the defendant has raised a third claim, it is not clear that it will recur in the new trial. We therefore decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-16\"> The defendant was tried simultaneously on another charge of robbery in the first degree.
