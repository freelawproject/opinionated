J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxD\">The defendant pleaded guilty to sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a, and was sentenced to a term of five years. On appeal from the judgment rendered, he claims that the trial court erred (1) by not permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>him to cross-examine the victim at the sentencing hearing, (2) by imposing a sentence based upon unreliable information contained in the presentence investigation report, and (3) by failing to specifically perform its promise to impose a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The following subordinate facts are not in dispute. The defendant was charged in a two count information with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-80 (a), and risk of injury to a minor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21. The defendant subsequently entered into a plea bargain with the state, in which he agreed to enter a plea of guilty to sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In return, the state agreed to substitute the two count information with one count of sexual assault in the second degree, and to make no recommendation as to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">After being advised of the plea bargain at a subsequent hearing, the trial court informed the defendant that if his presentence investigation <em>report </em>was \u201cgood,\u201d the court would give him a suspended sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court also informed the defendant that if it decided to impose more than a suspended sentence, the defendant would be given the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. The defendant thereafter entered a plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of guilty to sexual assault in the second degree. Before accepting the plea and after reviewing the statute, however, the trial court discovered that nine months of the sentence could not be suspended. The trial court therefore advised the defendant to reconsider his plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">After a short recess, the defendant and the assistant state\u2019s attorney agreed that the defendant would enter a plea of guilty to sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (a) (1) (A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant thereafter withdrew his previous pleas, and entered a plea of guilty to sexual assault in the third degree. The trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea after finding that the plea was \u201centered knowingly [and] intelligently with full understanding of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, the fourteen year old victim was allowed to give a statement regarding her attitude towards the defendant. The victim reaffirmed her statements previously made to a probation officer and contained in the defendant\u2019s presentence investigation report. The victim stated that after the incident, she cried in her sleep. She further disclosed that she \u201cfelt like killing [the defendant] afterwards,\u201d and that he should be \u201cput away.\u201d The victim also stated that she would be unhappy if he did not go to jail. The trial court thereafter denied defense counsel\u2019s request to cross-examine the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The trial court concluded that the presentence investigation report was unfavorable. After hearing the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing, the court informed the defendant that it would not suspend the sentence, but gave the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea before a sentence was imposed. The defendant, however, declined to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In his first claim of error, the defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to cross-examine the -victim at the sentencing hearing was violative of due process under both the United States and Connecticut constitutions. The defendant claims that the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>tim had made previous statements prior to the hearing indicating that she did not want the defendant to go to jail. The defendant therefore alleges that he had a right to cross-examine the victim to establish that the statements she made at the sentencing hearing were inconsistent with her prior statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">After a conviction either by trial or plea of guilty, a sentencing judge must necessarily have \u201ca wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in fixing the penalty within the limits prescribed by law. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 [1949].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>147 Conn. 125, 128, 157 A.2d 594 (1960). The sentencing court, therefore, \u201cis not held within the narrow limits of the [evidentiary] rules observed in a criminal trial. ... If the court were, most, if not all, of the benefit which can be had from a presentence investigation and report would be lost to the convicted offender and the state, and the legislative purpose of bringing our criminal procedure more completely in harmony with modern concepts of penology would be thwarted.\u201d Id., 128-29; see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">For these reasons, both the United States Supreme Court and our Supreme Court have recognized that a defendant is <em>not </em>entitled, under the due process clause, to cross-examine witnesses in a sentencing hearing. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 250; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>supra, 129. Rather, the extent to which a defendant may challenge the statements contained in a presentence investigation report must, of necessity, rest in the sound discretion of the sentencing judge. <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Harmon, </em>supra. Where the cross-examination of a witness regarding statements in the report \u201cwould have been tantamount to inviting a lengthy excursion into collateral issues\u201d; id., 129; it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to refuse the defendant\u2019s motion to permit cross-examination of such witness. Id. Nor is it a denial of due process for the sentencing court to rely on information supplied by a witness whom the accused is not permitted to cross-examine. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 251-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The defendant claims that the precedent established by <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>supra, has been severely modified by the holding in <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Florida, 430 </em>U.S. 349, 358, 97 S. Ct. 1197, 51 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1977). In <em>Gardner, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that in capital cases, a defendant is denied due process of law when the death sentence is imposed on the basis of confidential information contained in a presentence investigation report which is not disclosed to defense counsel. The defendant asserts that <em>Gardner </em>has conclusively established that the sentencing process must comport with the requirements of the due process clause, thereby necessitating that he be permitted to cross-examine witnesses at the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument, however, is flawed. The sentencing procedure has never been held to be immune from scrutiny under the due process clause. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 252 n.18. Merely because the due process clause is clearly implicated at sentencing, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ever; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>supra; does not necessarily imply \u201cthat all of the procedural safeguards and strict evidentiary limitations of a criminal trial proper are required.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707, 711 (2d Cir. 1978). The holding in <em>Gardner </em>did not invalidate the general proposition that a sentencing court must be able to draw on information concerning all aspects of the defendant\u2019s life, and that \u201c[t]he type and extent of this information make totally impractical if not impossible open court testimony with cross-examination.\u201d Id., 712, citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 250; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>199 Conn. 121, 127, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986). Moreover, even if <em>Gardner </em>can be interpreted as having qualified <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, \u201cthere can be no doubt that its holding is strictly limited to due process guarantees in <em>capital </em>cases.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fatico, </em>supra, 712 n.10. Contrary to his claims, therefore, the defendant did not have a constitutional right to cross-examine the victim at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The record further reflects that it was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny the defendant\u2019s request to permit such cross-examination in the present case. The victim was a fourteen year old girl who vehemently expressed her desire to be \u201ckept away\u201d from defense counsel. The victim and defense counsel openly displayed hostility towards each other during the hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, remarks made by defense counsel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the court indicated that he wanted to pursue collateral and irrelevant issues on cross-examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To have permitted cross-examination of the victim under these circumstances would have resulted in an illimitable pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>suit of trivial and inappropriate collateral issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, defense counsel established the fact that the victim had manifested a change of attitude through the introduction of testimony from two other witnesses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find, therefore, that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny the defendant\u2019s request to cross-examine the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In his second claim of error, the defendant challenges the reliability of the information contained in the presentence investigation report upon which the trial court relied in imposing a sentence on the defendant. The defendant alleges that the probation officer, in preparing the presentence investigation report, invalidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>such report because of his \u201cdistinct aura of total unreliability due to the view of his job which he claimed was not to get at the truth but only to accurately transcribe what was told him.\u201d Moreover, the defendant claims that such report was unreliable because the probation officer used the victim\u2019s twelve year old brother as an interpreter while interviewing the victim\u2019s mother. The defendant asserts that because the probation officer did not speak Spanish, he could not have known if the twelve year old interpreter had translated the questions and answers correctly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Because judges must necessarily consider a wide variety of information in sentencing proceedings, the trial court need not be restricted to the consideration of such information which meets the same high procedural standard as evidence presented at trial. Rather, the court may consider any responsible unsworn information \u201crelative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person\u2019s life and circumstance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>supra, 127; see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S. Ct. 421, 3 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1959). \u201cIt is a fundamental sentencing principle that a sentencing judge may \u2018appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope, and largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider or the source from which it may come.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S. Ct. 589, 30 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1972).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>supra. As a matter of due process, however, information may be properly considered as a basis for a sentence only if it has some <em>minimal indicium of reliability. </em>Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 320, 507 A.2d 99 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Our role on appellate review of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its wide discretion is limited. \u201cAs long as the sentencing judge has a reasonable, persuasive basis for relying on the information which he uses to fashion his ultimate sentence, an appellate court should not interfere with his discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>supra. We find that the record reflects that there was a persuasive and reliable basis for the trial court to rely on the information presented in the presentence investigation report, and that such information had the minimal indicium of reliability required.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel thoroughly examined the probation officer who prepared ' the report. The probation officer was asked if he, in interviewing the victim, inquired as to whether at one point she did not want the defendant to go to jail. The probation officer informed defense counsel that it was his role to only accurately record the victim\u2019s statements regarding her attitude and injuries. The defendant claims that the probation officer\u2019s proper role was to \u201cget at the truth\u201d in order to provide the sentencing court with as many facts as possible \u201cso that the court could make an intelligent decision.\u201d The defendant thus alleges that the probation officer\u2019s failure to solicit and obtain such information rendered his presentence investigation report unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-91a (c) clearly sets forth the information that a probation officer is required to obtain in preparing a presentence investigation report. That statute provides that in preparing such a report, \u201cthe probation officer shall promptly inquire into the circumstances of the offense, the attitude of the complainant or victim, or of the immediate family where possible . . . and the criminal record, social history and present condition of the defendant. Such investigation shall include an inquiry into any damages suffered by the victim, including medical expenses, loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>of earnings and property loss.\u201d In preparing such report, the probation officer is required \u201cto reflect the feelings and attitudes of the victim as accurately as possible.\u201d Connecticut Probation Officer\u2019s Manual \u00a7 403.01, Sec. 15.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claims, it was not the role of the probation officer to ascertain the truth of the victim\u2019s statements, or to question the victim unnecessarily as to matters outside the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Moreover, there is no duty imposed on the probation officer to ascertain whether an interpreter has accurately translated the questions and answers. Such a requirement would unnecessarily burden and impede the probation officer in the performance of his duties. The record in the present case reflects that the information obtained from the interview with the victim\u2019s mother, in which the victim\u2019s brother acted as an interpreter, was confirmed by the probation officer in subsequent interviews. We find, therefore, that the information contained in the presentence report had, at the very least, a minimal indicium of reliability, and that the trial court did not err in considering such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In his final claim of error, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in not fulfilling its promise to impose a suspended sentence. He asserts that because the presentence investigation report was favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>except for the comments made by the victim, due process mandates a specific performance of the promise by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument is premised upon the erroneous assumption that a trial judge is under a duty to perform a promise made to the defendant regarding the sentence he would impose. He relies upon the holding in <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 260, 92 S. Ct. 495, 30 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1971), as a basis for his claim. Such reliance is misplaced. In <em>Santobello, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a promise or agreement made by a <em>prosecutor, </em>upon which the defendant relied in entering his plea of guilty, must be fulfilled. The same rule, however, does <em>not </em>apply to a trial judge. A trial judge, unlike a prosecutor, may not participate in plea agreements. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gradzik, </em>193 Conn. 35, 47, 475 A.2d 269 (1984). Furthermore, the record in the present case indicates that the sentencing judge\u2019s promise to suspend the defendant\u2019s sentence if the presentence investigation report was favorable was not made as part of a plea agreement, and therefore was not part of the inducement or consideration relied upon by the defendant in entering his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The role of a trial judge at sentencing is such that public policy considerations bear against the specific performance of any promise regarding sentencing made by a judge. Modern precepts of penology require that the discretion of a sentencing judge to impose a just and appropriate sentence remain unfettered throughout the sentencing proceedings. Where a presentence investigation report is statutorily mandated, a judge cannot make any promise or determination of the sentence he will impose before he has reviewed the report. General Statutes \u00a7 54-91a (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaeffer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>5 Conn. App. 378, 387, 498 A.2d 134 (1985);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Dulin, </em>122 Mich. App. 382, 332 N.W.2d 492 (1983); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonilla, </em>87 App. Div. 2d 746, 448 N.Y.S.2d 677 (1982); 66 A.L.R.3d 902, 931. Moreover, \u201c[ujntil sentence is pronounced, the trial court maintains power to impose any sentence authorized by law; and, though the sentencing judge may be conscience-bound to perform his own prior agreements with counsel and the parties, the court is not in law bound to impose a sentence that once seemed, but no longer seems, just and appropriate.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Wilhoit </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>356 So. 2d 817, 824 (Fla. App. 1978). In those circumstances in which the judge cannot in conscience impose the sentence conditionally promised, it has been uniformly recognized that the only obligation he has is to grant the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>State ex rel. Wilhoit </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dulin, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>113 Mich. App. 105, 107, 317 N.W.2d 306 (1982); <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonilla, </em>supra. In the present case, the trial judge gave the defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea, and the defendant elected not to avail himself of such opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Even if we were to assume that the trial judge was under a duty to perform such a promise, we note that, in the present case, the sentencing judge did not breach his promise to the defendant. After reviewing the presentence investigation report, the judge determined that such report was unfavorable. The record reflects that the information contained in the report which was construed as unfavorable by the trial judge included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>the victim\u2019s attitude, statements by her family, and the fact that the defendant showed no remorse for his crime. Moreover, incarceration was specifically recommended by the probation officer in his report. As part of his promise, the judge assured the defendant that in the event that he determined that the report was unfavorable and decided to impose a sentence greater than a suspended sentence, he would give the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his plea. The record reflects, therefore, that the court fulfilled entirely its promise to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 provides in pertinent part: \u201csexual assault IN THE SECOND DEGREE: CLASS C FELONY: NINE MONTHS NOT SUSPENDABLE.

He was trying to get everything out of me.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\u201cMr. Tauber: That\u2019s a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">\u201c[The Victim]: That is not a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201cMr. Tauber: I will bring my paralegal here. She will come in and testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">\u201c[The Victim]: There was no one in there except me and you.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">\u201cMr. Tauber: There were two separate times you were in my office.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">\u201cThe Court: Please tell us what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">\u201cMr. Tauber: Tell us what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">\u201c[The Victim]: And then he was trying to push me into dropping the charges on this guy.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">\u201cThe Court: And that\u2019s what you don\u2019t want to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">\u201c[The Victim]: That\u2019s what I don\u2019t want to do. And that\u2019s what made me say yes I did. But now, I don\u2019t. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b610-16\">\u201cThe Court: Is there anything else that you wish to tell the court?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-17\">\u201c[The Victim]: Yes. Could you please try and get this man away from me. Cause any time, I mean, it\u2019s just that any time he looks at me he\u2019s just hollering. And I\u2019m not lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-18\">\u201cMr. Tauber: You\u2019re not? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b610-19\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. What else do you wish to say?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">\u201c[The Victim]: I don\u2019t want my mother to stay here with that guy.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-21\">\u201cMr. Tauber: Maybe she\u2019s going to run the court here.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">\u201cThe Court: She\u2019s not running the court, Mr. Tauber. She\u2019s fourteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-23\">\u201cMr. Tauber: She\u2019s more experienced than women of thirty and ten of them put together, your honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-24\">\u201cMr. Hudock: That was very kind, too, Mr. Tauber.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b610-25\"> Defense counsel, in his request to cross-examine the victim, stated to the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b610-26\">\u201cMr. Tauber: And the statements \u2014somebody has gotten to this victim to change her\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b610-27\">\u201cThe Court: Who?</p>\n<p id=\"b610-28\">\u201cMr. Tauber: I don\u2019t know. I cannot examine the victim. That is the problem, your honor. It has come to me through the grapevine of the community that pressure has been applied to this victim. She has been sent to a home. She has been threatened with drug prosecutions. She is a drug addict of some kind. And, all this done and my client winds up as the victim in a sense himself, when he has done \u2014 he has a favorable report here, your honor. And, this woman, if she wanted to press the charges, why would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>she go to Mr. Callahan and ask that they not be pressed and this man not go to jail. There were seven continuances in this case, your honor. It took that long to get this victim to come and say that she wants to change her mind? Something\u2019s amiss here, your honor. I mean something is rotten in the state of Connecticut, if I may paraphrase Shakespeare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The record thus reflects that defense counsel wanted to cross-examine the victim in order to raise issues that were extraneous and collateral to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\"> The record reflects an additional factor that was considered by the trial court in reaching its decision to deny defense counsel\u2019s request to cross-examine the witness. The trial court noted that General Statutes \u00a7 54-91c (b) provides that prior to the imposition of a sentence, \u201cthe court shall permit the victim of the crime to appear before the court for the purpose of making a statement for the record. In lieu of such appearance, the victim may submit a written statement to the state\u2019s attorney .... Such state\u2019s attorney . . . shall file the statement with the sentencing court and the statement shall be made a part of the record at the sentencing hearing.\u201d In the present case, the trial court could have accepted and considered a <em>written </em>statement from the victim, thus making it impossible for the defendant to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The court therefore informed defense counsel that \u201c[n]othing in [the statute] states that you have the right to cross-examine the victim. I have made the victim\u2019s statement a part of the sentencing procedure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\"> At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel called the defendant\u2019s employer and the defendant\u2019s girlfriend to the stand. Both witnesses testified that the victim had indicated that she did not want to press charges against the defendant, and that she did not want the defendant to suffer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\"> The defendant also alleges that the information contained in the report regarding the victim\u2019s statements was unreliable because the victim was not subjected to cross-examination at the sentencing hearing. As we have previously noted, however, the defendant had no constitutional right to cross-examine the victim and it was furthermore not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to deny a request to cross-examine her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> Connecticut Probation Officer\u2019s Manual \u00a7 403.01, Sec. 15 provides in pertinent part: \u201cVictim\u2019s Attitude. The victim\u2019s attitude section of the report should not present a third version of the offense. The officer should attempt to reflect the feelings and attitudes of the victim as accurately as possible. Department policy requires in cases in which personal injury was involved or in cases involving sexual attack, information regarding not only the immediate impact of the crime, but also when medical opinion is available, information regarding any longlasting physical or psychological damage should be reported . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-91a(a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo defendant, convicted of a crime. . . the punishment for which may include imprisonment for more than one year, may be sentenced, or his case otherwise disposed of, until a written report of investigation by a probation officer has been presented to and considered by the court, if (1) the defendant is so convicted for the first time in this state . . . The defendant in this case had no prior record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
