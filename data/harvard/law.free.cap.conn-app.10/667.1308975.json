On appeal, the sole issue is whether it was proper for the court to have denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search and seizure. General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a; <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>198 Conn. 92, 101-102, 503 A.2d 136 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The trial court, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J., </em>filed a meticulous, complete and legally sound memorandum of decision in which the court found facts supported by the evidence and drew legal conclusions in conformity with applicable law. After examining the record and briefs of the parties, we conclude that no further articulation of the facts or law is required. See <em>Faith Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>192 Conn. 434, 436, 472 A.2d 16, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L.

App. 165, 166, 476 A.2d 639 (1984). Accordingly, the trial court memorandum of decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>40 Conn.

The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\"> In <em>Faith Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>192 Conn. 434, 436, 472 A.2d 16, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1984), our Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe trial court filed an extensive memorandum of decision ... in which it discussed both the factual and legal issues involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the plaintiffs claims for relief. After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs of the parties and their arguments, we conclude that there is no error in the judgment from which the appeals were taken and that the memorandum of decision filed by the trial court adequately and properly disposes of the contentions of the parties before us. . . . [T]hat decision so completely articulates the issues involved in this appeal and so adequately explains the legal basis for its conclusions that it may appropriately be referred to for a detailed discussion of the facts and the applicable law. To incorporate that discussion herein would be redundant.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
