J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arz\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in dismissing this action due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to allege in his complaint facts sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">The complaint alleged that the plaintiff, through his Illinois corporate employer, rented a motor vehicle in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Alabama from the defendant Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. (Avis), a national corporation which is licensed to do business in Connecticut and maintains an office in this state. The complaint also alleged that the plaintiff, while a passenger in the rented vehicle, was involved in an accident in Alabama in which he was injured due to the negligence of the operator of the car. The complaint further alleged that the motor vehicle owned by the defendant was subject to General Statutes \u00a7 <em>14-154&amp;.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The rental agreement was not attached to the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although not alleged in the complaint, it is not disputed that the defendant is a Delaware corporation, that it named CT Corporation as its agent for service of process in this state, and that it is authorized to do business in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss because it concluded that the plaintiff failed to set forth facts in his complaint sufficient to bring Avis within the jurisdiction of Connecticut courts under General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c). <em>See Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>190 Conn. 245, 253-58, 460 A.2d 481 (1983). The plaintiff\u2019s position is, essentially, that the defendant has subjected itself for all purposes to the jurisdiction of the court by naming an agent for service of process and by operating an office in this state. The plaintiff did not rely, in his complaint, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>argument before the trial court or on appeal, upon General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The writ, summons and complaint, and the return of service were all before the court when it granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The return of service indicated that copies of the original writ, summons and complaint had been delivered both to CT Corporation, the defendant\u2019s appointed agent for service,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to the office maintained by the defendant in this state. This appeal boils down to determining whether the defendant\u2019s maintenance of an office in this state and compliance with the statutory requirement of appointing an agent for service of process is, in effect, a consent to the jurisdiction of this state\u2019s courts for the determination of a cause of action arising out of a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>tract entered into by it and a citizen of this state but executed in another state. Stated another way, the question is whether this state has authorized the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant, and, if so, whether due process would be violated by the assertion of such personal jurisdiction by this state. <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>198 Conn. 243, 246, 502 A.2d 905 (1986); <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>197 Conn. 34, 38, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985); <em>Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>supra, (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Before discussing this issue, it is necessary to make it clear what this case is <em>not </em>about. It does not concern conflicts of laws. We are not involved in a determination of whether General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a applies to contracts executed outside of this state<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or whether, if personal jurisdiction over the defendant exists and it is determined that such jurisdiction should be exerted by our courts, the plaintiff has stated a cause of action pursuant to that statute. General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>is a statute which grants a cause of action to those persons claiming damage because of the operation of a car which is lawfully in the possession of an operator of a car pursuant to the terms of a contract of rental of that car, against the lessor of the car. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 284, 472 A.2d 306 (1984); <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Deconinck, </em>113 Conn. 237, 240, 155 A. 231 (1931). The statute itself has no relation to jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In order to determine whether Connecticut has authorized the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the defendant, we must examine the statutory framework of General Statutes \u00a7 33-411.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 33-411 (b) relates to foreign corporations which transact business in this state in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 33-395 or 33-396<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and makes them subject to suit in this state upon any cause of action arising out of such business. Since the defendant has procured a certificate of authority, it is not transacting business in this state in violation of \u00a7 33-396 and, therefore, \u00a7 33-411 (b) does not apply to it. General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (b) has been interpreted as requiring, for the purposes of withstanding a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation, allegations in the complaint that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tiff\u2019s cause of action arose out of the defendant\u2019s transaction of business in the state. General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c), in contrast, confers jurisdiction over some causes of action without regard to whether a foreign corporation is transacting business here and without regard to any causal connection between the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and the defendant\u2019s presence in this state. <em>Lombard Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>supra, 252-53; see <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>McGowan, </em>supra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (b) makes a foreign corporation amenable to service of process when it has not formally designated the secretary of the state as its agent for service of process but has engaged in business in Connecticut which would subject it to the requirement of obtaining authorization from the secretary of the state. General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (a) makes a foreign corporation amenable to service of process when it <em>has </em>obtained authorization from the secretary of the state to transact business in this state. The defendant in this case has obtained such authorization and is subject to service of process under the terms of subsection (a). General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (b), in effect, puts a defendant in the same position it would have been in, had it conformed to General Statutes \u00a7 33-400 and appointed an agent for service of process because it was conducting business in this state. If this is so, it is logical to conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (a) means that a foreign corporation which has appointed an agent for service of process because it has acknowledged that it is conducting business within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>this state will be subject to suit in this state upon any cause of action arising out of such business. A corporation which complies with the requisites of General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (a) has, in fact, consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by the courts of this state. Such a corporation has \u201cpurposely availed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The question then becomes whether \u201csuch business\u201d is limited to the business of leasing cars in this state, or whether it includes the general business of leasing cars to Connecticut residents, regardless of where the parties may be when the contract is entered into and performed. General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c) makes certain actions of a defendant which may not constitute the transaction of business in this state amenable to suit here, as for example, when the business is solicited here, but the offer to do business is accepted elsewhere. That being the case, there seems no good reason to provide a greater shield to foreign corporations which have acknowledged they do business here than to corporations which have not acknowledged the same or which, in fact, do not ordinarily transact business in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The courts of this state have the authority to determine whether personal jurisdiction may be asserted against a foreign corporation doing business here arising out of a cause of action for activities which occurred in another state and which were unconnected to the activities of the corporation here. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>342 U.S. 437, 446, 72 S. Ct. 413, 96 L. Ed. 485 (1952); see 1 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 43-44. The rationale for \u00a7 44 is set forth as follows: \u201cBy authorizing an agent or public official to accept service of process in actions brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>against it, the corporation consents to the exercise by the state of judicial jurisdiction over it as to all causes of action to which the authority of the agent or official extends. This consent is effective even though no other basis exists for the exercise of jurisdiction over the corporation.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws \u00a7 44, comment (a). We conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (a) makes the defendant amenable to the jurisdiction of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Since the defendant consented to the personal jurisdiction of this state, the plaintiff did not have to allege facts to establish that the defendant had made itself amenable to suit here. See <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>supra, 39. The allegation that the defendant was licensed to do business in this state was sufficient to show that this state had authorized the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant, and that the defendant had consented to that assertion of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The next question to be resolved is whether the assertion of such personal jurisdiction offends due process. The foundation for the assertion of personal jurisdiction in this case is that the plaintiff, a Connecticut resident, rented a car in Alabama, owned by the defendant corporation which corporation was registered to do business in Connecticut. The subsidiary question is whether the defendant could reasonably have anticipated a suit in Connecticut arising from the contract executed in Alabama. <em>Lombard Bros, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Asset Management Co., </em>supra; see <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>supra; 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 50. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss in reliance on General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c), and the hearing held on the motion was restricted solely to the applicability of that statutory subsection. The trial court never reached the issue of whether personal jurisdiction over the defendant would offend due process on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the basis of the facts of this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff, therefore, was not afforded a full opportunity to establish facts sufficient to satisfy due process requisites.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state under General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (a), the plaintiff must be given an opportunity, at a \u201ctrial-like hearing,\u201d to establish such facts. <em>Standard Tallow Corporation </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 50-56, 459 A.2d 503 (1983); see <em>Chevette </em>v. <em>U-Haul Co. of New Mexico, </em>7 Conn. App. 617, 622, 510 A.2d 206 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a provides: \u201cliability of owner for damage caused by rented or leased car.

Even if we assume that Connecticut should exert jurisdiction over the contract executed in Alabama, the issue of which law should govern remains open. See <em>Simaitis </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>182 Conn. 24, 437 A.2d 828 (1980). The Supreme Court of Connecticut has lately hinted that General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a grants a cause of action based on tort, rather than contract. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>201 Conn. 632, 647, 519 A.2d 13 (1986); see <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 286-88, 472 A.2d 306 (1984). The difference, in terms of conflict of laws, would be whether the law of the forum might in some instances be followed in tort actions where the forum\u2019s law bears the most significant relationship to the controversy; <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>supra; or whether the law of the place of the contract should be followed unless the contract is to be performed elsewhere or is intended to have a beneficial operation and effect elsewhere. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>145 Conn. 34, 39-40, 138 A.2d 705 (1958); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Daniels\u2019 U-Drive Auto Renting Co., </em>108 Conn. 333, 338, 143 A. 163 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">It should noted that in this case the defendant does not claim that General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a fails to provide the plaintiff with a cause of action, but does claim that personal jurisdiction over the defendant is lacking. It should also be noted that the plaintiff asserts that General Statutes \u00a7 14-154a gives the Connecticut courts personal jurisdiction over the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 33-411 (c) has been quoted in footnote 3, supra.
