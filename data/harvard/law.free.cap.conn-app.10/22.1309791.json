The defendants claim that the trial court erred (1) in denying their motion for a directed verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was based on the ground that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the action, (2) in failing to instruct the jury properly on ownership of a car, (3) in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict as excessive, and (4) in improperly commenting on the evidence as it related to the fraudulent conveyance count. In her cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erroneously concluded that the jury, not the court, awards attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-110g (d) of CUTPA and, therefore, was in error when it denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for such fees after the jury verdict in her favor. We find no error on the appeal. We find error on the cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. James H. Butts, Jr., the plaintiffs son, purchased a 1975 Volvo automobile in 1977 for $3800 after securing a credit union loan. In 1978 or 1979, Butts joined the Navy and gave the car to the plaintiff, his mother. The registration and certificate of title, however, remained in Butts\u2019 name. The plaintiff paid off $3000 of the $3800 credit union loan, exclusively used the car for almost two years and paid all taxes, insurance and maintenance on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In September, 1980, the plaintiff brought the car to a garage owned by the named defendant, Petrazzuoli Brothers, Inc. (Petrazzuoli), for repairs. Lawrence DeAngelis, president of Petrazzuoli, gave the plaintiff an oral estimate of $400 to $450 for the repair work. A week or two later, DeAngelis called the plaintiff and informed her that her car was repaired and that the bill totaled $991.02. The plaintiff could not pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>entire bill at that time. DeAngelis agreed to hold the automobile until the repair bill was paid, and to accept periodic payments. The plaintiff made a payment of $200 on October 4,1980, and $100 a week or two later. On October 23, 1980, she received a notice from DeAngelis stating that she now had a bill for storage in the amount of $300, and that if the entire $991.02 bill were not paid within five days, the automobile would be sold pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-150.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to this notice, there had been no discussion of storage fees. The plaintiff attempted to contact DeAngelis on numerous occasions but was unsuccessful. Petrazzuoli sold the car for $1000 on October 29,1980. The plaintiff nonetheless continued to make payments on the credit union loan for another two years until it was paid off. Soon after selling the plaintiffs car, Petrazzuoli transferred its real estate to the defendant, Automatic Propane Equipment, Inc., for no consideration. DeAngelis was president of both corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The jury returned a verdict in the plaintiffs favor against both defendants on all four counts of the complaint. The jury awarded the plaintiff $12,816 in compensatory damages, and $3845 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The Defendants\u2019 Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The defendants\u2019 first and second claims of error are flip sides of the same coin and will be treated together. The defendants argue initially that the plaintiff was not the \u201cowner\u201d of the car within the meaning of title 14 of the General Statutes and, therefore, was not injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>by the defendants\u2019 conduct. Consequently, they claim, she lacked standing to bring the action, and the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict on this ground should have been granted. Concomitantly, the defendants claim that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury on the concept of ownership of the car. Additionally, they claim error in the trial court\u2019s failure to charge, as requested, on the statutorily prescribed method of transferring ownership. The success of these claims depends upon our acceptance of the defendants\u2019 definition of \u201cowner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The defendants seek to persuade us that definitions found in title 14 of the General Statutes are controlling in this action. General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (37) states that an owner is \u201cany person holding title to a motor vehicle, or having the legal right to register the same . . . .\u201d That definition applies to chapter 246 of the General Statutes, which covers such subjects as the department of motor vehicles, registration of motor vehicles, dealers\u2019 and repairers\u2019 licenses, required mechanical equipment standards. General Statutes \u00a7 14-165 (f) defines an owner, in pertinent part, as \u201ca person . . . having the property in or title to a vehicle.\u201d That definition applies to chapter 247 of the General Statutes, which is the Uniform Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title and Anti-Theft Act. Under these definitions, the defendants argue, a person is an owner of a motor vehicle only if he holds title to it or has the legal right to register it. Since the plaintiff\u2019s son was the title holder and registered owner of the car, the defendants\u2019 argue, he was the owner for purposes of this case, and the plaintiff lacked standing to sue for the loss of the car. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The definitions in title 14 do not control this action. Those definitions apply to the statutory subjects covered by chapters 246 and 247 of the General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>utes. They do not apply to the private causes of action involved in this case, to which a more expansive definition of \u201cowner\u201d applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>163 Conn. 576, 316 A.2d 407 (1972), our Supreme Court was faced with a similar issue, namely, whether the plaintiff could sue the state of Connecticut for negligent operation of a motor vehicle under General Statutes \u00a7 52-556. That statute authorized a cause of action for injuries caused by motor vehicles owned by the state. The United States government held title to the truck involved in the accident. The truck had been \u201cissued\u201d to the state. The state claimed that since it was not the owner of the truck, the plaintiff could not sue it under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The Supreme Court held otherwise and stated, \u201c[t]he term \u2018owner\u2019 is one of general application and includes one having an interest other than the full legal and beneficial title. . . . The word owner is one of flexible meaning, and it varies from an absolute proprietary interest to a mere possessory right. . . . It is not a technical term and, thus, is not confined to a person who has the absolute right in a chattel, but also applies to a person who has possession and control thereof.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 580-81; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>3 Conn. App. 550, 553, 490 A.2d 539 (1985); <em>Lazoff </em>v. <em>Padgett, </em>2 Conn. App. 246, 249, 477 A.2d 155, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 806, 482 A.2d 711 (1984). \u201cIn addition, it should also be noted that, generally, the individual who must sustain the loss of property in case of destruction is considered the owner and \u2018both in common parlance and legal acceptation, [the] property is <em>his.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>supra, 585. Applying this definition to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court held that the state could be an owner for purposes of being sued under General Statutes \u00a7 52-556 even though the United States government held title to the truck, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>state had exclusive possession and control of the truck at the time of the accident and insured it. Id., 582-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Similarly, we conclude that despite the fact that the plaintiff was not the registered owner of the car, she was nonetheless the owner within the meaning of <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>supra. She had exclusive possession and control of the car. She used it for over two years after her son went into the Navy. She contributed substantially to the purchase price, paid the taxes and maintenance costs on the motor vehicle, and insured it. Additionally, she was treated as the owner of the car by Petrazzuoli. The jury could reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff was the owner of the car, even though it was registered in her son\u2019s name. See also <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>154 Conn. 328, 336-37, 225 A.2d 190 (1966) (car registered in mother\u2019s name was only prima facie evidence of ownership and it remained an issue of fact as to whether son was actual owner); <em>Burakowski </em>v. <em>Grustas, </em>134 Conn. 205, 209, 56 A.2d 461 (1947) (registration \u201cis merely evidence of ownership, to be considered in connection with other evidence in the case upon that issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Because of our conclusion that an owner of an automobile may be a person other than the title or registration holder, we hold that the plaintiff had the requisite standing, as an owner, to bring an action for the loss of the car. The trial court charged the jury on the concept of ownership in accordance with these principles. The defendants\u2019 claim of improper jury instructions must, therefore, also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The defendants next claim that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the verdict as excessive. The defendants\u2019 entire argument on this issqe in their brief consists of the following sentence: \u201cThe verdict awarding $12,816.00 compensatory damages and $3,845.00, punitive damages was clearly excessive since the vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>cle was purchased for $3,800.00 in 1977, three years prior to the incident in question.\u201d There is no citation to legal authority, and no reference to the other evidence of damages which is in the record, namely, that the car was worth $5000 when it was sold, that the plaintiff paid $3000 of the credit union loan after the sale, and that she incurred substantial transportation costs for nearly two years. The defendants failed to present this issue with any modicum of compliance with the rules of practice. See Practice Book \u00a7 4065 (formerly \u00a7 3060F). The defendants\u2019 complete failure to research the issue or formulate any legal argument precludes meaningful appellate review; see <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-3), </em>3 Conn. 194, 197, 485 A.2d 1369 (1985); and we therefore decline to address this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error is that the trial court, during its charge to the jury on the fraudulent conveyance count, improperly commented on the evidence with the effect of directing a verdict on a controverted fact. While the defendants took exception to this charge, this claim was not presented to the court during the hearing on their motion to set aside the verdict. Thus, a review of the claim is limited to determining whether there was plain error. <em>Kemp </em>v. <em>Ellington Purchasing Corporation, </em>9 Conn. App. 400, 406, 519 A.2d 95 (1986). Upon review of the trial court\u2019s jury charge, we do not find that these instructions amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Plaintiff\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The plaintiff claims, on her cross appeal, that the trial court erred in denying her motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under CUTPA after the jury had returned a verdict in her favor. The plaintiff claims that General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) authorizes a bifurcated proceeding whereby the trial court, not the jury, awards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees and costs after the issue of liability has been resolved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is a matter of first impression. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u201c \u2018The fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern this intent, we look to the words of the statute itself . . . to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute ... to legislative practice and policy . . . and to judicial construction.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673-74, 509 A.2d 20 (1986) . . . .\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>201 Conn. 685, 690, 519 A.2d 41 (1986). On the basis of the statutory language, the legislative history and the policy underlying \u00a7 42-110g (d) of CUTPA, we conclude that the legislative intent was that, even in a jury case, the court award attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">First we look to the words of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) provides, in relevant part: \u201cIn any action brought by a person under this section, <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>court may award, </em>to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We cannot assume that the statutory language which states that <em>the court </em>may award attorney\u2019s fees is meaningless or superfluous. <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>2 Conn. App. 36, 41, 475 A.2d 1110 (1984). The legislature, in enacting statutes permitting awards of attorney\u2019s fees, has chosen to include the language which authorizes <em>the court </em>to make the award with respect to some causes of action; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-72 (actions to collect wage claims); General Statutes \u00a7 36-449 (violations of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act); General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 (actions for dissolution of marriage, legal separation and annulment); General Statutes \u00a7 52-484 (action in interpleader); and has chosen not to include the language with respect to other causes of action. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 35-35 (antitrust actions); General Statutes \u00a7 36-498 (a) (Uniform Securities Act violations); General Statutes \u00a7 42-133ee (Franchise Act violations); General Statutes \u00a7 47a-13(b) (actions against landlords for failure to provide essential services). We cannot assume, given the legislature\u2019s enactment of numerous statutes authorizing attorney\u2019s fees, that it acted without purpose in placing such an award, under CUTPA, in the hands of \u201cthe court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The legislative history surrounding the enactment of CUTPA and the legislative policy to be furthered by it also lend support to the conclusion that it is the trial court, and not the jury, which awards attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA. CUTPA was first enacted in 1973. It was originally intended to be the state\u2019s counterpart to the Federal Trade Commission Act. R. Langer <em>&amp; </em>D. Ormstedt, \u201cThe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d 54 Conn. B. J. 388, 389 (1980). The purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the statute was to provide a meaningful avenue of redress for consumers who had been victims of unfair or deceptive trade practices by providing for private as well as public enforcement. Id., 389-90. Subsequently, in order to encourage private litigants to bring actions under CUTPA certain amendments to the act were made. Of most relevance was the amendment in 1976 to the section of the act which covered attorney\u2019s fees. Previously, the 1973 act had authorized the court to award attorney\u2019s fees to either the plaintiff or the defendant. The 1976 amendment provided that the court could award costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff only.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">During the legislative debate, Representative Alan H. Nevas remarked, albeit in opposition to the amendment: \u201cWhen the initial legislation was enacted, the language provided that if there was litigation, <em>the court, at the end of that litigation, could make an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees </em>to either party, depending on the discretion of the court and in its judgment as to which party should be entitled to such an award. Now what it does is to make \u2014 to take away from <em>the court </em>that discretion and to say that that award can only be made to the plaintiff . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2189. Senator Louis S. Ciccarello commented: \u201c[B]oth the Department of Consumer Protection and the Attorney General\u2019s office and private attorneys are all of the opinion that in order to protect consumers of the state that plaintiff\u2019s fees are extremely necessary. The reason for, there is a lot of hesitancy in bringing a lawsuit of this nature and in order to pursue this sort of private attorney general method, you have to have plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. I think it\u2019s fair and I think it should also be pointed out that <em>reasonable attorney\u2019s fees are granted only upon discretion of the court, </em>so therefore, a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>may not be able to receive any fees whatsoever.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 19 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2278.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">These comments strongly suggest that the legislative intent behind the section awarding attorney\u2019s fees, both in the original act and under the 1976 amendment, was for the court to make the award. There is absolutely no indication that such an award was to be placed in the hands of the jury. This is further supported by statements which analogize this provision to provisions in the federal antitrust statute. See 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2192, remarks of Representative Raymond C. Ferrari; 19 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2276, remarks of Senator Ciccarello. Under the provisions of the federal antitrust act; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15; the amount of the award for attorney\u2019s fees is fixed by the trial court. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>399 U.S. 222, 223, 90 S. Ct. 1989, 26 L. Ed. 2d 534 (1970); 54 Am. Jur. 2d, Monopolies \u00a7 365. Thus, the legislative history lends strong support to the conclusion that the trial court awards attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The policy behind CUTPA, namely, to encourage litigants to act as private attorneys general and to bring actions for unfair or deceptive trade practices, is furthered by our conclusion. Integral to effecting this policy, and reflected in the 1976 amendment, is the desire to encourage attorneys to accept and litigate CUTPA cases. CUTPA cases, however, may entail long hours with little likelihood of an award that will cover reasonable expenses. For this reason, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) offers an attorney who accepts a CUTPA case the prospect of recovering reasonable fees and costs. Such fees and costs, however, often have not been exhausted by the time the jury returns its verdict. The parties may file posttrial motions or be forced to respond to them. A successful plaintiff may be required to defend against a defendant\u2019s appeal, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the present case. Thus, it is unlikely that the legislature intended the jury to award attorney\u2019s fees as part of its verdict, since this would thwart full recovery for the services rendered. See <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. Price, 5 Conn. App. 70, 73, 496 A.2d 982 (1985). This interpretation is supported by Representative Nevas\u2019 remark that attorney\u2019s fees would be awarded at the end of litigation. 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1976 Sess., p. 2189.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Additionally, we point out that a jury may not be suited to undertaking an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a CUTPA case. General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) permits the award of attorney\u2019s fees without reference to the actual recovery by the plaintiff. A successful plaintiff\u2019s monetary recovery may be only nominal, more in the nature of a vindication of public rights, whereas a great deal of time may have been logged by counsel in managing the litigation. A jury might find it anomalous to set such potentially disproportionate awards between the successful plaintiff and his attorney. To foreclose the possibility of prejudice entering the decision-making process, the award of attorney\u2019s fees has been placed in the hands of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Finally, we note that the recent Supreme Court case of <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>200 Conn. 172, 510 A.2d 972 (1986), lends support to our conclusion. In that case, the trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 36-498 (a) of the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act (CUSA) after a jury verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. The issue of whether the court or the jury was authorized to make the award was not litigated. Nevertheless, the court recognized the role of the court in this regard: \u201cA plaintiff may recover \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 under \u00a7 36-498 only if he prevails on his \u00a7 36-498 claim. The magnitude of the amount awarded to a victorious party <em>rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>added.) Id.,194-95. General Statutes \u00a7 36-498 (a), unlike General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d) of CUTPA, does not contain statutory language authorizing \u201cthe court\u201d to award attorney\u2019s fees. The provision for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees under CUSA, however, serves the identical purpose of \u201cencourag[ing] the enforcement of CUSA by victims of improper securities transactions who might not otherwise be able to afford to do so. . . .It reflects a legislative recognition that suits under CUSA are often long, complex, and prohibitively expensive for individual investors.\u201d Id., 195-96. We therefore find additional support for our conclusion that the court awards attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA from our Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of this division under CUSA, an act which similarly seeks to encourage private attorney general litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We hold, on the basis of the statutory language and legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d), and the policy underlying CUTPA, that the court rather than the jury determines an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees after the issue of liability had been resolved in her favor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">There is no error on the defendants\u2019 appeal. There is error on the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal, the judgment is set aside as it relates to the refusal to award attorney\u2019s fees and the case is remanded for a hearing on reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-14\"> The original defendant in the trial court was Petrazzuoli Brothers, Inc. The plaintiff successfully moved to add Automatic Propane Equipment, Inc., as a defendant after discovering that Petrazzuoli Brothers, Inc., had transferred property to it on which a prejudgment attachment had been placed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> Although at trial the motion was erroneously characterized as a motion to dismiss, both the defendant and the plaintiff refer to it, in their briefs, as a motion for a directed verdict, and we will treat it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-150 applies to abandoned or unregistered motor vehicles and motor vehicles which are a menace to traffic. Subsection (e) of the statute permits an owner or keeper of a garage who has stored such a motor vehicle, discovered and taken into custody by an inspector of the motor vehicle department or a local or state police officer, to sell it under certain circumstances. The defendant was mistaken in believing that this statute granted him authority to sell the plaintiff\u2019s car after she had brought it to him for repairs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> We are without benefit of a decision setting forth the trial court\u2019s reasoning in denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. It was the responsibility of the cross appellant to provide this court with an adequate record. The plaintiff should have moved for an articulation of the legal basis of the trial court\u2019s decision; <em>Thiel Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Culligan Water Conditioning Co., </em>9 Conn. App. 191, 193, 517 A.2d 1052 (1986); so that this court could effectively review its validity. While normally a failure to perfect the record may preclude appellate review, under the state of the record in this case we are able to discern the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. The plaintiff presented no evidence of attorney\u2019s fees to the jury. Thus, there was no basis on which the court could have submitted that claim to the jury. In light of various colloquies between the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the court, it is apparent that the trial court denied the plaintiffs postverdict motion, not because it was exercising <em>its </em>discretion as to whether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded, but because of its belief that it was the jury\u2019s function to award such fees. Thus, the issue placed squarely before us is whether the trial court erred in denying the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees by construing \u00a7 42-110g (d) of CUTPA to require that the jury, rather than the court, award attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b47-8\"> We point out that the plaintiff remains free on remand to present evidence on reasonable litigation costs incurred in defending this appeal. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>200 Conn. 172, 196 n.20, 510 A.2d 972 (1986).
