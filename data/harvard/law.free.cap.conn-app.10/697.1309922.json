The dispositive claim on appeal is whether the trial court erred by refusing to answer questions of law directed to it, by the jury, in contravention of Practice Book \u00a7 864.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The issue in this case is whether, when the trial court receives inquiries from the foreperson of the jury regarding the legal standards applicable to the facts of the case, it may decline to answer those questions or to clarify its instructions upon its determination that the inquiries were made for the benefit of less than the entire panel. This precise issue has not previously been ruled upon in the courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The right of a defendant in a criminal trial to a trial by jury is guaranteed. U.S. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 2, and amendment VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19; General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b; Practice Book \u00a7 839. The duty of the trial court in such a case is to instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. General Statutes \u00a7 54-89; Practice Book \u00a7 855. \u201cIt is the duty of the court, in charging the jury in a criminal case, to give to them such instructions as may be required to enable them to understand the nature of the offense charged and the questions which they are to decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to weigh the evidence applicable to such questions, and to intelligently decide them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>72 Conn. 39, 43, 43 A. 493 (1899). That duty has remained untarnished and undiluted during the near century which has passed since the foregoing words were written.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The court, in its initial instructions to the jury, stated: \u201cIf you have difficulty recalling testimony . . . [w]e will play it for you. Just be specific and all agree on the note that one should come out. I don\u2019t want 12 notes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because everybody <em>wants to hear something different. But we\u2019ll do that if it has to be done. </em>But agree on what you\u2019d like to hear if there\u2019s a dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">During the course of its deliberations, the jury, through notes signed by the foreperson, submitted several requests to the trial court for rehearing of the testimony and for clarifying instructions. The request to rehear portions of the testimony was granted. The jury asked for a \u201cclarification of charges that could be considered\u201d and the court reread its instructions on the crimes with which the defendant was charged but did not include its charge on self-defense. Other requests, which related to the issue of self-defense and to reasonable doubt were not answered. One of the notes stated that \u201cWe, the jury, attempted to define \u2018reasonable doubt.\u2019 I have reason to feel that this term (reasonable doubt) is still somewhat hazy in the minds of some of the jurors, and possibly in mine. Would you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>re-define \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 when you clarify the charges under which the defendant could be found guilty, or acquitted by reason of self-defense. If the defendant believes in his own mind that a threat exists to his well being (although facts might disprove it), can it be concluded that he may have had just cause to resort to deadly force to protect himself?\u201d Another note stated \u201c(1) I would like to know if the defendant, in his state of mind, truly believed that he was in danger of physical harm. He could justifiably use deadly force even though the danger might not exist. (2) What is reasonable doubt?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The court told the jury that it would not respond to the first note because \u201canyone that reads this note would believe that it was the \u2014 the author is one person individually and their feelings about the understanding of a principle of law by that law and maybe some of the other jurors. I will answer the question if it is properly framed as being the product of the entire jury and the note reflects that .... But I must have it in the form that it appears to be the feeling of the entire panel to have that done.\u201d The court informed counsel that as to the second note it was his intention to ask the jurors \u201cif they all participated in this question and if they do, I will answer it.\u201d The court then informed the jury that it \u201cmust know whether or not that question is the question of one person or does the entire jury agree that the question is asked of the court.\u201d The court then asked the foreperson if he had signed it on behalf of everyone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Upon learning that the inquiry was not made on behalf of everyone, the court stated \u201cthen I cannot answer it. The jury must agree that a question is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>be proposed on behalf of them to the court. You can understand if I ended up with twelve questions. So if you all want to agree on that, I\u2019ll be very glad to do it. But I cannot answer an individual question of a juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The trial court thus interpreted Practice Book \u00a7 864 to imbue it with the discretion to refuse to give clarifying instructions in response to the foreperson\u2019s request when it perceived the request as not being the product of a unanimous jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The function of the jury is to determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant. That determination is dependent upon proper instructions from the trial court. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>475 F.2d 240 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>181 Conn. 268, 435 A.2d 701 (1980), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 1077, 101 S. Ct. 856, 66 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1981). Indeed, \u201cit is the judge\u2019s special business to guide the jury by appropriate legal criteria through the maze of facts before it . . . . \u201d <em>Bollenbach </em>v. <em>United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 613, 66 S. Ct. 402, 90 L. Ed. 350 (1946). The defendant is entitled to a jury which is \u201ccorrectly and adequately instructed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 206, 445 A.2d 314 (1982). In this state, the duty of the judge to instruct the jury on the law is embodied both in the Practice Book and in the statutes. General Statutes \u00a7 54-89; Practice Book \u00a7 864. In the context of civil trials, the Supreme Court of this state has long recognized that \u201c \u2018when it appears, upon an inquiry by the jury, that they have failed to understand a principle of law stated in the charge, it is the duty of the court, upon the request of counsel, to further explain the doctrine in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Intelisano </em>v. <em>Greenwell, </em>155 Conn. 436, 447, 232 A.2d 490 (1967). In a line of civil cases, various courts have held that a frankly expressed confusion of a jury, emphasized by a particular question involving a crucial element in the case, requires further instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>which fully and adequately address the confusion, notwithstanding a proper prior charge. Id.; see <em>Silvester </em>v. <em>Kerelejza, </em>158 Conn. 433, 262 A.2d 157 (1969); <em>Bottaro </em>v. <em>Schoenborn, </em>157 Conn. 194, 251 A.2d 79 (1968); <em>Montagna </em>v. <em>Jewell, </em>119 Conn. 178, 175 A. 570 (1934); <em>Annes </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>107 Conn. 126, 139 A. 511 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">\u201c \u2018A supplemental charge . . . enjoy[s] special prominence in the minds of the jurors\u2019 because it is fresher in their minds when they resume deliberation. <em>Arroyo </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1048, 103 S. Ct. 468, 74 L. Ed. 2d 617 (1982); see <em>Bollenbach </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra, 611-12].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>199 Conn. 30, 41, 505 A.2d 699 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The importance of the court\u2019s discharge of its obligation in criminal trials is highlighted by the Practice Book, which removes any obligation from counsel to request the clarification. The failure of the court to discharge its duty and clarify the instructions upon the request of the jury is in contravention to the mandate of Practice Book \u00a7 864. See, e.g., <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 51, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 441 A.2d 41 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>6 Conn. App. 407, 505 A.2d 1266, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 810, 508 A.2d 771 (1986); <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>1 Conn. App. 260, 470 A.2d 1234 (1984). This Practice Book rule, which protects the fundamental rights of the defendant to be fairly tried by a properly instructed jury, is mandatory and not directory. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>supra. This provision for clarification of the instructions upon the inquiry of the jury stands in contrast to the provisions for the modification of the instructions after exceptions to the charge or upon the court\u2019s own motion, and for the review of testimony when required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>by the jury. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 860<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 863.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The provision for modification states that the court, after exception or <em>sua sponte, </em>may recall the jury for the purpose of correcting or clarifying an ambiguous instruction. Practice Book \u00a7 863; see W. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 105. The determination of whether to correct or clarify or add to the instruction, absent a request from the jury, is within the discretion of the court since the Practice Book sections use the word \u201cmay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The provision for the review of testimony in Practice Book \u00a7 863 requires that the judge, upon a request for review by the jury, make a determination as to whether that request is reasonable, and if it is reasonable, to allow the review of the testimony. A determination of the reasonableness of the request for a review of testimony lies within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rubaka, </em>82 Conn. 59, 72 A. 566 (1909); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>10 Conn. App. 357, 360, 522 A.2d 1250 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The provision for additional instructions when sought by a jury, however, as mandated by Practice Book \u00a7 864, makes no allowance for such a determination, and requires the court to \u201cgive additional instructions necessary to respond properly to the request or to direct the jury\u2019s attention to a portion of the original instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The fact that the jury in this case did not make \u201cunanimous\u201d requests for additional instructions during the course of its deliberations is of no consequence. There is no doubt that the defendant had a constitutionally protected right to a jury properly instructed on the state\u2019s burden of proof and the essential elements of the crime charged. See <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 416, 473 A.2d 300 (1984). The fact that the jury must arrive at a unanimous determination that the defendant is guilty of a particular crime as charged indicates that the jurors must each have an understanding of the crimes charged and must each be guided toward determining if the elements of those crimes were present. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>166 Conn. 569, 574, 353 A.2d 776 (1974). In order for each juror meaningfully to participate in the deliberation process and intelligently to decide the issues facing the jury in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant, each juror, through the foreperson, must be able to apply to the trial judge for the purpose of obtaining a clarification of the applicable law. \u201cIt is the policy of the law that every tribunal for the trial of civil or criminal causes should have open to it the best legitimate means of acquiring such knowledge of the law and facts as will enable it to decide the cases before it fairly and intelligently.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rubaka, </em>supra, 67. Each juror must individually arrive at his or her own conclusion, and not merely acquiesce in the conclusions of the others. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>188 Conn. 626, 641, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1983). It is of the utmost importance that the instructions be clear and comprehensible and provide guidance to the jury in applying the law to the facts it finds established. <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 199-200, 502 A.2d 858 (1985). In keeping with the primacy of this need, each juror must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>an independent voice during deliberations. That independence is weakened or nullified without the ability to deliberate effectively because of a lack of an understanding of the law. Clarification of the instructions when the jury or one of its members manifests confusion about the law is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">If we were to affirm the trial judge\u2019s ruling in this case we would be endorsing a result which would mean that upon a poll of the jurors by the trial court, indicating a lack of unanimity for a need for clarification, one obstinate or uniquely comprehending juror could prevent all of the other members of the jury panel from ever acquiring an understanding of the law necessary to intelligently decide the case. Such a result would deprive a defendant of the fundamental rights which Practice Book \u00a7 864 implements. The authority of the foreperson in presenting the inquiry is sufficient to invoke the trial court\u2019s duty to give the jury a clarification of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial are implicated by the court\u2019s failure in this case to respond to the inquiries of the jury, especially as those inquiries were directed to the law of self-defense and to the requisite \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for conviction. U.S. Const., amends. V, VI, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Utz, </em>201 Conn. 190, 197, 513 A.2d 1191 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 41; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>10 Conn. App. 176, 180-81, 522 A.2d 299 (1987). \u201c \u2018 \u201c[Discussion of the concept [of reasonable doubt] is perhaps the most important aspect of the closing instruction to the jury in a criminal trial.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 420, 464 A.2d 813 (1983). The defendant\u2019s fundamental rights to due process and a fair trial are implemented by the requisites of Practice Book \u00a7 864. In this case, as in all prosecutions by the state, it is axiomatic that \u201c \u2018[t]he defendant was entitled to have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>jury correctly and adequately instructed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 247, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772, reh. denied, 466 U.S. 954, 104 S. Ct. 2163, 80 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In evaluating a claim of constitutional error in the supplemental charge, we would normally review the charge as a whole to determine whether the jury could reasonably have been misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 41. Here, there was no supplemental charge given on reasonable doubt or self-defense. The inquiry of some members of the jury as to their confusion as to the law is manifest by the inquiry by the foreperson and makes evident the reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court erred in its supplemental charge to the jury by failing to reinstruct the jury on self-defense when it reread its instructions on the charges against the defendant. This claim is inextricably bound to the first claim. The jury\u2019s note asking for a redefinition of reasonable doubt, in conjunction with the court\u2019s clarification of the charges against the defendant, also expressed confusion about an acquittal because of his claim of self-defense. The failure of the trial court to reinstruct the jury on the elements of self-defense implicates a fundamental constitutional right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 660, 453 A.2d 427 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The state asserts that the defendant did not preserve this issue on appeal because the defendant did not specify the ground of a constitutional violation in his objection at trial. It is true, of course, that claims not distinctly raised at trial will ordinarily not be reviewed by this court. Such a policy serves to ensure that the court will be alerted to potential error while there is time for corrective action. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Conn. 453, 460-61, 508 A.2d -11 (1986). This rule applies equally to constitutional claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 670; but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In this case, however, the defendant did raise an objection to the court\u2019s failure to recharge on self-defense at the time the charges were reread to the jury. The defendant stated that his objection was based on the fact that the burden is on the state to prove that the defendant was not acting in self-defense. He was not allowed to make his objection more explicit because the trial court foreclosed that possibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The defendant presented a theory of self-defense to the jury. In its initial charge, the court did instruct the jury on self-defense but in its supplemental charge, although the jury manifested a confusion as to it, the court failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Justification, in the form of self-defense, is a legally recognized defense. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-16.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The legislature has provided that the state bear the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>of proof of disproving the defense. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cWhere the legislature has created a legally-recognized defense, in this case [justification], this fundamental constitutional right [due process] includes a properjury instruction on the elements of the defense of [justification] so that the jury may ascertain whether the state has met its burden of disproving it beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>[186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). Thus, when the jury requests clarification or rereading of the charges and simultaneously evinces confusion as to the self-defense claim of the defendant, the trial court is obligated to reinstruct the jury on that defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 277-79; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 708, 425 A.2d 108 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The court\u2019s supplemental instructions, by omitting the self-defense charge, could reasonably have misled the jury in its consideration of the charges against the defendant. On review, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>supra, 279. Reviewing the charge as a whole, in light of the jury\u2019s request for clarification with respect to self-defense, we find that it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled as to the state\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was not justified. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 660; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 660-61, 443 A.2d 906 (1982). The state has not proven this error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 864 provides: \u201cIf the jury, after retiring for deliberations, request additional instructions, the judicial authority, after notice to the parties, shall recall the jury to the courtroom and give additional instructions necessary to respond properly to the request or to direct the jury\u2019s attention to a portion of the original instructions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\"> The defendant was tried by a jury of twelve because he was charged with the crime of murder, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a).

The burden is on the state of course in a self-defense situation to prove, not just the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">\u201cThe Court: Listen, do you have an exception in that I failed to include a charge on self-defense when requested in view of the request of the jury on that.
