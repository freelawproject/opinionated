Defendant challenges the sentences imposed and the failure to merge the two offenses into one conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In case 81-1347, defendant was convicted of theft in the first degree, ORS 164.055, and sentenced to a term of three years imprisonment and ordered, as a condition of parole, to make restitution to the victim and to pay costs. In case 81-1805, defendant was convicted of forgery in the second degree, ORS 165.007, and sentenced to one year in the county jail with execution of the sentence suspended. Defendant was placed on five years\u2019 probation, to commence upon his release from imprisonment on the theft charge and was required to pay costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The state concedes that it was error to impose a five year probationary term consecutive to the three year sentence on the theft conviction. We agree. <em>State v. Lippert, </em>53 Or App 358, 362, 632 P2d 28 (1981); <em>State v. Maddox, </em>29 Or App 787, 564 P2d 1372, <em>rev den </em>280 Or 171 (1977); ORS 137.010(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Defendant also contends that it was error to order the payment of restitution and costs during the periods of parole and probation, because the trial court did not make a finding that defendant is or will be able to pay them. At sentencing, defendant argued that he was unable to pay restitution or attorney fees. The trial court responded by observing, \u201cWell, the payment would be after he is released.\u201d The state argues that \u201cthe court\u2019s comment indicates that it believed the defendant had a future ability to pay such costs and restitution. Statements in the presentence report buttress the court\u2019s apparent conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The court may order restitution, ORS 137.106,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the payment of costs. ORS 161.665.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Huyck, </em>49 Or App 1087, 621 P2d 98 (1980), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\u201cIn determining whether to order restitution, the trial court must take into account the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose. ORS 137.106(2)(a). Similarity, the court cannot sentence a defendant to pay costs unless it determines that the defendant is or will be able to pay them. ORS 161.665(3).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">It is true, as the state argues, that the presentence report detailed defendant\u2019s education, work skills, employment history and past income and that he had no assets nor debts. The difficulty, however, is that the record does not demonstrate that the trial court took into account the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>statutory factors before making a determination that defendant make restitution and pay costs. <em>See State v. Normile, </em>52 Or App 33, 40, 627 P2d 506 (1981); <em>State v. Huyck, supra; State v. Fuller, </em>12 Or App 152, 504 P2d 1393, <em>rev den </em>(1973), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom Fuller v. Oregon, </em>417 US 40, 94 S Ct 2116, 40 L Ed 2d 642 (1974). The orders to make restitution and the imposition of costs were in error. Because the cases are being remanded for resentencing on other grounds, the trial court may reconsider its orders of restitution and the imposition of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Defendant\u2019s last contention is that the two convictions should have been merged into one conviction. That issue was not raised in the trial court, and we will not consider it. <em>State v. Evans, </em>290 Or 707, 713, 625 P2d 1300 (1981); <em>State v. Bolduc, </em>54 Or App 91, 94, 634 P2d 267 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The order of restitution in case 81-1347 and the imposition of costs in cases 81-1347 and 81-1805 are vacated. Cases 81-1347 and 81-1805 are remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> The costs, in both cases, were the fees of court appointed counsel. ORS 161.665(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"> ORS 137.106 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201c(1) When a person is convicted of criminal activities which have resulted in pecuniary damages, in addition to any other sentence it may impose, the court may order that the defendant make restitution to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201c(2) In determining whether to order restitution which is complete, partial or nominal, the court shall take into account:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201c(a) The financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard to the other obligations of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201c(b) The ability of the defendant to pay restitution on an installment basis or on other conditions to be fixed by the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">U * % * * *&gt;5</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-12\"> ORS 161.665 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\">\u201c(1) The court may require a convicted defendant to pay as costs those expenses specially incurred by the state in prosecuting the defendant.
