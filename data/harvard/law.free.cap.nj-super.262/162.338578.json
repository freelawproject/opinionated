The decision of the trial court was based upon the finding that the transfer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>statutorily fraudulent, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-27a. We agree with Judge Himmelberger\u2019s decision and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Defendant Jeffrey Burd suffered gambling losses of $1 million on June 15, 1990. Civil suit followed, ultimately resulting in the entry of summary judgment in plaintiffs favor. Prior to this indebtedness, defendant Jeffrey Burd, on February 28, 1990, executed an agreement to purchase a single family home, then under construction, for his family. On March 19,1990, the sales contract was amended to name defendant Jeffrey Burd\u2019s wife, defendant Louvette M. Burd as the sole purchaser. Settlement, passing title to the wife alone, took place on June 25, 1990 and the deed was recorded on June 27, 1990. The wife admittedly made no contribution toward the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">At issue is whether this transfer was a fraudulent conveyance and, therefore, void as to plaintiff, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-27a which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Defendants contend there was no proof of actual intent to defraud. Alternatively, they argue that the trial court adopted the wrong transfer date in applying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-27 (statutory fraud). The subject debt arose on June 15, 1990. The trial court determined that the \u201ctransfer\u201d took place on June 27, 1990, the date the deed was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Statutory fraud, to void a transfer pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-27a, results when three events occur: (1) the creditor\u2019s claim arises before the transfer; (2) the transfer is made without receiving full value; and (3) at the time of transfer, the debtor is insolvent. Fraudulent intent is not a part of this equation. The trial judge, in determining the date of transfer, applied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-28a(1). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>A transfer is made: (1) [w]ith respect to an asset that is real property other than a fixture, but including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale of the asset, when the transfer is so far perfected that a good-faith purchaser of the asset from the debtor against whom applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the asset that is superior to the interest of the transferee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Judge Himmelberger correctly interpreted this section of the statute when he ruled that the date the deed was recorded, June 27, 1990, was the transfer date.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Not argued in their brief, but strongly urged at oral argument, was defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff had failed to establish the third requirement needed for statutory fraud, namely insolvency. Insolvency, for the purpose of statutory fraud, is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-23a which reads, in pertinent part: \u201c[a] debtor is insolvent if the sum of the debtor\u2019s debts is greater than all of the debtor\u2019s assets, at a fair valuation.\u201d A review of the record indicates that defendants\u2019 argument is without merit. It appears from defendant Jeffrey Burd\u2019s testimony that well before, and continuing to the time of transfer, his debts far exceeded his assets so that by definition, he was insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Lastly, defendant sought, as an alternative, to have the property placed in his name as well as his wife\u2019s, as tenants by the entirety. The trial judge refused, \u201cbecause it was never titled that way in the first place, so there is no \u2018equitable\u2019 reason to do so now.\u201d Defendants urge in support of this alternative, the ruling in <em>ESB, Inc. v. Fischer, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 448 A.2d 1030 (Ch.Div.1982). Key to the decision in <em>ESB </em>was the fact that the parties, prior to the fraudulent transfer, had been tenants by the entirety. <em>ESB, </em>therefore, is not applicable here. Judge Himmelberger\u2019s decision on the issue is sound and will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
