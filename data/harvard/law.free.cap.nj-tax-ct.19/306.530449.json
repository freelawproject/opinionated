The property consists of a 226,568 square foot building on 14.56 acres of land. For the tax years in question, Park Ridge assessed the property at $5,096,000 for the land and $34,759,000 for the improvements, for a total of $39,855,000. The taxpayer, Brae Associates (Brae Associates) c/o Hertz Realty (Hertz) appealed to the Tax Court, which entered judgments setting the true value of the property at $34,078,750 for tax year 1990; $34,006,930 for tax year 1991; $33,497,660 for tax year 1992; $33,236,450 for tax year 1993; $33,150,900 for tax year 1994; $32,630,600 for the tax year 1995. Park Ridge appealed and Brae Associates cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">On its appeal from the Tax Court, Park Ridge argues that the Tax Court judge erred (1) in not dismissing Brae Associate\u2019s complaint for failure to overcome the presumption of correctness; (2) by not including a factor for entrepreneurial profit in the property\u2019s development costs; and (3) in permitting a deduction for physical depreciation/functional obsolescence of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">On its cross-appeal, Brae Associates argues that the Tax Court judge erred (1) in concluding he was bound by precedent to use the cost approach; (2) by allowing Park Ridge to advocate positions it knew were false and misleading;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) by failing to draw a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>negative inference from Park Ridge\u2019s failure to call its own expert whose original valuation was lower than the municipality\u2019s assessment of value; (4) by applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel and law of the case to preclude plaintiff from (a) proving the character of the building as a general office use building, and (b) from using the income method in reaching true value; (5) by fading to consider relevant testimonial and documentary evidence and legal argument; (6) by failing to value the property based on its true value rather than on its \u201cuse value\u201d as a corporate headquarters; (7) by permitting Park Ridge to apply a \u201ccorporate headquarters label\u201d as an appraisal theory when no such theory is recognized as valid in this State;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (8) in rejecting a deduction for economic/external obsolescence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and briefs, in light of the applicable law, and conclude that the arguments raised by both parties are without sufficient merit to require a comprehensive written decision. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(A) and (E). We are satisfied there is substantial credible evidence in the record to sustain the judge\u2019s valuations of the subject property for each year, and we affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Kahn in his opinion decided January 28, 1998. 17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>187 (1998). Nonetheless, we deem it appropriate to provide some further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Because the facts are fully set out in the reported opinion of the Tax Court, 17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>187, we need not repeat them at length here. We simply include a brief statement of facts to provide some context for our comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The property is located at 225 Brae Boulevard in Park Ridge and, during the years 1990 through 1995, was occupied exclusively by Hertz. The property was developed pursuant to a joint venture agreement entered into on December 30, 1986 between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Joseph L. Muscarelle, Inc. (Muscarelle) and Hertz. Pursuant to the agreement, Muscarelle constructed an office building for Hertz\u2019s use. As part of the venture, Muscarelle gave Hertz a 25% ownership interest in the building. The parties also executed a twenty-year lease. Muscarelle later assigned the lease to Brae Associates which became the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Completion of construction occurred in 1988 at a cost of $29,017,977, with a stipulated land value of $5,475,000 for the relevant years. Although the building was especially designed for Hertz\u2019s occupancy, and was, in fact, occupied solely by Hertz, it was constructed to allow future modification for multi-tenant use.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">At the trial, which spanned twenty-one days, plaintiff\u2019s expert, Dale R. Kilpatrick, MAI, real estate appraiser, analyzed all three methods of valuation (cost approach, comparable sales approach, and income approach) in forming his opinion of true value. He determined that the highest and best use of the property was that of a general purpose office building and opined that the income approach should be utilized in determining value.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Park Ridge did not present any evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">At the conclusion of the taxpayer\u2019s case, based on the evidence presented, Judge Kahn determined by the preponderance of the evidence that the highest and best use of the property for the years in question is that of a \u201csingle user corporate headquarters,\u201d and not a multi-tenanted facility, relying on the evidence presented by plaintiffs witnesses. 17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 195-96. Based on the valuation approaches discussed by Mr. Kilpatrick, the judge concluded that the cost approach was the only reliable method of valuing the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>We first address Park Ridge\u2019s contentions that Brae Associates failed to overcome the presumption of validity that ordinarily attaches to a municipality\u2019s tax assessments. It is axiomatic that the municipality\u2019s assessment is entitled to a presumption of validity. <em>Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 412, 495 A.2d 1308 (1985). To overcome the presumption, the taxpayer must present \u201csufficient competent evidence ... to prove a true valuation different from the assessment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413, 495 A.2d 1308 (quoting <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Newark, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>99, 105, 89 A.2d 385 (1952)). The \u201cevidence must be \u2018definite, positive and certain in quality and quantity to overcome the presumption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Aetna Ins. Co., supra, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>at 105, 89 A.2d 385).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Once the Tax Court finds that the presumption has been overcome by cogent evidence, it must independently determine true value. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 495 A.2d 1308; <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Township of Edison, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>290, 312, 604 A.2d 580 (1992). <em>See also Glen Wall Assocs. v. Township of Wall, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>265, 280, 491 A.2d 1247 (1985) (observing that the Tax Court has an obligation to use its \u201cspecial qualification^], knowledge and experience\u201d in determining value). Because the Tax Court has special expertise in such matters, it \u201c \u2018has not only the right[ ] but the duty to apply its own judgment to valuation data submitted by experts in order to arrive at a true value and find an assessment for the years in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>New Cumberland Corp. v. Borough of Roselle, </em>3 <em>N.J. Tax </em>345, 353 (1981)). In departing from the presumptively correct assessment and establishing value, the Tax Court must \u201csupport its own decision,\u201d and, of course, \u201cexercise its jurisdiction selectively and critically.\u201d <em>Pantasote, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 417, 495 A.2d 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In his decision, Judge Kahn did not specifically state that plaintiff had overcome the presumption of correctness. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>after the trial was concluded, at oral argument on the parties\u2019 respective motions to strike portions of each other\u2019s post-trial briefs, the subject arose. In response, Judge Kahn remarked that because he had denied Park Ridge\u2019s motion to dismiss and allowed the taxpayer\u2019s case to go forward, that was \u201csome indication\u201d that he had made a finding that Brae Associates had met its burden of overcoming the presumption of correctness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge then explained, that it was not only his right, but his duty, under <em>Glen Wall, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>265, 491 A.2d 1247, to consider all of the evidence and make an independent determination of value based upon that evidence. Thereafter, Judge Kahn issued his final decision, and these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We have carefully reviewed the record and, although the judge did not make specific findings or conclusions with respect to the presumption of correctness, it is clear that he implicitly found that the taxpayer had overcome the presumption of correctness. Of course, the better course would have been for the judge to have made specific findings and to have given his reasons for the decision; however, any asserted error in this regard is at best harmless. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Nonetheless, Park Ridge essentially argues that the presumption could not have been overcome and the independent valuations arrived at because the judge could not properly have relied on the evidence presented through the taxpayer\u2019s experts, in particular, Mr. Kilpatrick. Park Ridge maintains that because Mr. Kilpatrick concluded the building was a general purpose office building and not a corporate headquarters, the expert evidence could not support the judge\u2019s conclusion to the contrary, or form a basis for his ultimate valuations of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We disagree. Mr. Kilpatrick gave extensive testimony on all three valuation methods and the factors relevant thereto. Judge Kahn was certainly free to utilize those aspects of Mr. Kilpatrick\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>testimony he found cogent and reject others. We perceive no error in the judge\u2019s reliance on that evidence notwithstanding the expert\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Further, we reject Park Ridge\u2019s contention that the judge erred in excluding entrepreneurial profit as. a factor in the property\u2019s development costs. In the absence of market data demonstrating that entrepreneurial profit should be included, the judge properly excluded it. <em>See B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Oldmans Twp., </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>114, 122 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>323 <em>N.J.Super. </em>550, 733 A.2d 1204 (App.Div.1999) (observing that because the municipality failed to offer market data to support the inclusion of entrepreneurial profit as an additional cost, it would not be considered). It has been explained that \u201c[p]roper use of the cost approach requires, not a mechanical addition of 10% for entrepreneurial profit, but a critical analysis of the property in its market on the appraisal date to determine whether cost should be adjusted upward or downward and to take account of market conditions\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122 (quoting <em>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. v. East Amwell Twp., </em>13 <em>N.J. Tax </em>24, 41 (1992)). Judge Kahn extensively questioned Mr. Kilpatrick as to his conclusion that inclusion of entrepreneurial profit w^as inappropriate in this matter, and we are satisfied that the record adequately supports the judge\u2019s findings in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We also reject Park Ridge\u2019s argument that an entrepreneurial profit should have been included because \u201cit makes no sense to suggest that the owner-occupier of the property spends any less time involved in the project than an \u2018entrepreneur\u2019 who is developing property for resale or investment.\u201d Park Ridge should 'have espoused this argument at trial through an expert witness if it wished us to consider it on appeal. It did not, and, therefore, it is inappropriate for Park Ridge to urge review now.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">We next address briefly and reject Park Ridge\u2019s contention that the Tax Court judge erred by permitting a 2.5% annual cumulative deduction for \u201cphysical and functional depreciation.\u201d Park Ridge asserts that because the building is a \u201ccorporate headquarters,\u201d a deduction for \u201cfunctional obsolescence\u201d is im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>proper. Mr. Kilpatrick concluded that a 2.5% \u201cfunctional depreciation\u201d rate was appropriate based on the age of the property, after employing the tables contained in the Marshall Valuation Service, which included the extended life concept. Mr. Kilpatrick\u2019s deduction was not a deduction based on \u201cfunctional or economic obsolescence.\u201d <em>See CPC Int'l v. Bor. of Englewood Cliffs, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 265, 473 A.2d 548 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>578, 483 A.2d 124 (1984) (defining \u201cfun ctional obsolescence\u201d). The features that Mr. Kilpatrick considered for the deduction, namely, HVAC, electrical, acoustical ceilings, roofings, and roofing insulation, were features associated with \u201cphysical depreciation,\u201d not \u201ceconomic obsolescence.\u201d The deduction was not for non-utilitarian features, where their cost could be recovered only in a sale to an extravagant buyer or one having Hertz\u2019s same needs. In other words, even though the building was built to meet Hertz\u2019s specific needs, its features were not so lavish as to preclude a 2.5% \u201cphysical depreciation\u201d rate and, in the absence of any rebuttal evidence from Park Ridge, the Tax Court judge was certainly free to accept Mr. Kilpatrick\u2019s opinion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As for plaintiff\u2019s arguments on the cross-appeal, we add only this brief comment concerning its collateral estoppel argument. Contrary to the taxpayer\u2019s contention, as noted previously, Judge Kahn expressly declined to give preclusive effect to Judge Crab-tree\u2019s determination on the cost approach. Accordingly, he made his own independent findings of the proper valuation approach based on the evidence. <em>See </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 194, 196-97. As for the corporate headquarters finding, although Judge Kahn did give effect to Judge Crabtree\u2019s finding on this point, he also made his own independent findings based on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The judgments reducing the assessments for the years 1990 through 1995 are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-11\"> Brae Associates argues that Park Ridge acted in bad faith in remaining steadfast to the correctness of its original assessment when it knew that its own appraiser had concluded that the property was worth less and that its lax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>assessor had lowered the assessment from $39,855,000 to $34,000,000 for the tax year .1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> Plaintiff argues that if such a theory is valid, we should provide a bright line rule for determining when the \u201ccorporate headquarters concept\" applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\"> Judge Kahn also concluded that the taxpayer was collaterally estopped from asserting that the building was anything other than a corporate headquarters because there had been no change in the lacts surrounding the physical aspects of the building between the tax appeal filed by Brae Associates challenging the 1989 assessment of the propeity and the appeals filed for the ensuing years. <em>Id. </em>at 194. He based that ruling on Judge Crabtree's unreported decision which was affirmed in <em>Brae Associates v Park Ridge Borough, </em>14 <em>N.J. Tax </em>172 (App.Div. 1993). Judge Kahn remarked that Judge Crabtree had concluded \u201cthat (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>property is a corporate headquarters; and (2) the cost approach is the most probative approach to determine the property's true value.\u201d 17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 192. However, Judge Kahn also made his own independent findings with respect to the highest and best use of the building and the valuation approach, as noted above. <em>Id. </em>at 195-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> Regrettably, the judge's final decision on the motion to dismiss was not transcribed and a subsequent motion to \"settle the record\" did not produce a decision by the judge, who stated that he could not recall his reasons for the decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
