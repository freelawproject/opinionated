It claims that in determining the property\u2019s market rental value under the income capitalization valuation method, both plaintiffs valuation exj)ert and the trial judge inappropriately relied upon a lease for the subject property\u2019s main building, a warehouse, which included an \u201cunusual\u201d provision requiring the tenant\u2019s payment of \u201c$170,000 per annum in real estate taxes\u201d to plaintiff as \u201cadditional rent,\u201d regardless of plaintiffs actual tax bill. Defendant claims that plaintiffs expert\u2019s valuation was suspect because he failed to capitalize plaintiffs \u201cadditional gross income,\u201d if any, from the $170,000 per annum after actual taxes in determining the property\u2019s value, and that Judge Kahn\u2019s findings that the warehouse lease was \u201cunusual and not typical of the market place,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cprovideldl some indication as to its rental value,\u201d were inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">We disagree. Defendant\u2019s assessment of plaintiffs valuation is of limited relevance, as Judge Kahn did not rely upon plaintiffs expert\u2019s calculations. There is substantial credible evidence in the record that Judge Kahn rejected both parties\u2019 experts\u2019 market rent opinions, independently determining market rent and true value based upon the \u201csufficient sampling\u201d of eleven lease compa-rables provided. We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in Judge Kahn\u2019s written opinion, which is reported at 18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>416 (Tax 1999). We add the following additional observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We need not reiterate the facts or summarize the judge\u2019s reasoning, as they are clearly set forth in his opinion; however, we again note that the lease between the landlord-taxpayer and tenant contained a provision described as both \u201cunusual and not typical of the market place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 423. That provision fixed the tenant\u2019s responsibility for real estate tax reimbursement at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>$170,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As interpreted, the provision required the landlord to assume the obligation to pay, without reimbursement, any taxes in excess of the $170,000, and to receive the benefit of a tax obligation less than that amount. This was obviously a negotiated provision and reflected the business judgment of the parties to the lease as to allocation of the obligation for taxes and which party would bear the burden of or benefit from any amount greater than or lesser than the strike figure of $170,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">What is readily apparent from Judge Kahn\u2019s analysis is that his approach throughout was consistent. In concluding that the market rent was on a net basis, <em>ibid., </em>he further concluded that \u201cno effective tax rate is added to the overall capitalization rate of 10.52%.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 427. That is, he did not \u201cload\u201d the capitalization rate to reflect a tax obligation. In sum, he defined the nature of the transaction and applied applicable principles accordingly. In reaching his ultimate conclusion as to valuation, the judge found \u201cthe income capitalization approach to be the only reliable method of valuation in this ease,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 421, and delineated the formula for determining property value under the income approach as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>market rent</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">x square footage</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">potential gross income (PGI)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u2014 vacancy and collection losses</p>\n<p id=\"A3h\">effective gross income (EG1)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">- operating expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">net operating income (NOI)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">+ capitalization rate<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOL\">value of property</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 425-26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We can find little fault with this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">While the unique lease provision, and what may have been a wise business decision, may enhance (or detract) from the value of the property on transfer, the value to be determined for assessment purposes is the value of the fee simple with the provision attached on the date of assessment. <em>See, e.g., Cohn v. Livingston Township, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>429, 437-38 (Tax 1999); <em>Lenal Props., Inc. v. City of Jersey City, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>405, 407 (Tax 1999), <em>aff'd, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>658 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>488, 758 A.2d 647 (2000). That value was determined by the trial judge utilizing an appropriate, reasonable, and acceptable methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\"> Certain general principles of law applicable to appeals are particularly relevant here. We pay great deference to the special expertise of New Jersey Tax Court judges, and will not disturb their findings unless plainly arbitrary or unsupported by substantial credible evidence in the record. <em>First Republic Corp. of Am. v. Borough of East Newark, </em>17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>531, 536-37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>(App.Div.1998), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>647, 725 A.2d 1128 (1999); <em>Hartz Mountain Dev. Co. v. Secaucus, </em>16 <em>N.J.Tax </em>474, 479 (App.Div.1997); <em>Global Terminal &amp; Container Serv. v. City of Jersey City, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>698, 702-03 (App.Div.1996); <em>Pine Street Mgmt. Corp. v. City of East Orange, </em>15 <em>N.J.Tax </em>681, 686 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>172, 675 A.2d 1121 (1996). These general principles are especially appropriate when a transaction is unique or, as described here, \u201cnot typical of the market place.\u201d We conclude that Judge Kahn\u2019s consideration of this transaction reflected an appropriate and measured analysis to reach a determination of valuation. We find Iris determination to be well-supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> The provision states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">2.
