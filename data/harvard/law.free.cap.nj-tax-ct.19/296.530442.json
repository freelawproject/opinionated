Kuskin in his oral opinion of October 15, 1999. In fact, as Judge Kuskin pointed out, he was bound by our opinion in <em>Ambrose v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 487 A.2d 1274 (App.Div.1985), which, like this case, dealt with income derived from participation and interest in a New York City law partnership. In <em>Ambrose </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">that the regulations fully comport with the express language contained m the statutory scheme and the underlying legislative design. New York\u2019s statute differs from our own in that the former constitutes a \u201cnet income\u201d tax \u201csimilar in design\u201d to the federal revenue act <em>Sorensen v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 2 <em>N.J. Tax </em>470, 476, 446 A.2d 213, (Tax Ct.1981). Conversely, New Jersey\u2019s tax is on gross income, reduced only by certain limited deductions and credits. Hence, the phrase \u201cincome subject to tax\u201d which appears m <em>N.J.S A. </em>54A:4-1, as defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:35-1.12(a)(4)(i), \u201ccan logically refer to two different things when applied to New York and New Jersey.\u201d <em>Sorensen v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>supra[,] at 476, 446 A.2d 213. Further, the statutory language clearly distinguishes between income actually taxable in the foreign state and the taxpayer\u2019s \u201centire New Jersey income.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:4-1(b). The express statutory terms thus clearly support the Director\u2019s interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">So too, the regulations are fully consistent with the legislative design. We note in that regard that in assessing the validity of ail administrative regulation, we are not wholly limited to the express statutory language. Rather, we may consider as well the spirit of the legislation and the statutory purpose. <em>Cf. In re Weston, supra[,] </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>[258] at 263, 176 A.2d 479. The intent of the credit provision \u201cis to minimize or avoid double taxation.\u201d <em>Nielsen v. Taxation Div. Director, 4 N.J. Tax </em>438, 442 (Tax Ct.1982); <em>Jenkins v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super </em>402, 4 <em>N.J. Tax </em>127, 133, 446 A.2d 217 (Tax Ct.1982); <em>Sorensen v. Taxation Div. Dir., </em>supra], 184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393,] 2 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 475, 446 A.2d 213. \u201cThe calculation of the credit is intended to shield income taxed by another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Nielsen v. Taxation Div. Director, supra], 4 N.J. </em>Tax] at 442. In that respect, our statute seeks to avoid multiple taxation based upon \u201cwhat is actually, not potentially, taxed.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 443. Stated somewhat differently, the rule operates to limit the resident credit to an amount that reflects \u201conly that income taxed by other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Sorensen v. Taxation Div. Director, supra[, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393,] 2 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 475, 446 A.2d 213.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">So posited, we are entirely satisfied that the regulations do not impinge upon the legislative purpose. Although income may be treated differently by New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and the foreign jurisdiction, multiple taxation does not result. The effect of the regulations is to shield only that portion of the taxpayer\u2019s income which is subject to tax in the other state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\"><em>[Ambrose, </em>supra, 198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 552-53, 487 A.2d 1274.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>See also Sutkowski v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 470-71, 474-75, 482, 712 A.2d 229 (App.Div.1998), which emphasized that \u201cif the same income is taxed in another state and in this state for the same tax year, the Legislature intends the New Jersey resident taxpayer to receive a credit for the tax paid in the other state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 712 A.2d 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Plaintiffs also contend that the Tax Court\u2019s holding deprives them of equal protection of the laws in violation of the federal and state constitutions. They assert that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">[A]n identically situated New Jersey resident whose income was from Pennsylvania sources instead of New' York or California would be entitled to a greater credit than Plaintiffs, even though the aggregate amount of Pennsylvania tax paid by that resident might be less than the New York or California taxes paid by Plaintiffs.... It would not be rational to tie New Jersey\u2019s tax revenues from self-employed residents conducting businesses in other states to the happenstance of how those other states characterize the deductions they allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Plaintiffs also appear to contend that New Jersey residents making the identical gross income in two different states might well receive different tax credits in New Jersey and, therefore, pay different income tax here. However, as Judge Kusldn suggested, the New Jersey residents are treated identically in terms of the receipt of a credit for the income subject to taxation in a foreign state. As the late Judge Lawrence Lasser so well said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">The Equal Protection Clause requires that persons or classes of persons similarly situated be treated similarly. <em>Levy v. Louisiana, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>68, 71, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1509, 1511, 20 L.Ed.2d 436 (1968), <em>reh[\u2019g] den. </em>393 <em>US. </em>898, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>65, 21 <em>L.</em>Ed.2d 185 (1968); <em>Wilson v. Long Branch, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>360, 377, 142 A.2d 837 (1958); <em>Robson v. Rodrig[q]uez, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>517, 523, 141 A.2d 1 (1958); <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Board of Reviera, </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>545, 553, 64 <em>A.2d </em>443 (1949); <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. v. Glaser, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 189, 365 A.2d 1 (Ch.Div.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>156 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 384 A.2d 176 (App.Div.1978). Although the New Jersey Constitution docs not contain an Equal Protection Clause, Art. I, par. 1, of the New Jersey Constitution has been held to provide similar equal protection coverage to that contained in the United States Constitution. <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trustees, 77 N.J. </em>55, 79, 389 A.2d 465 (1978). Equal protection permits dissimilar treatment if the classification is not invidiously discriminatory and is rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective. <em>See Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>356, 359, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1001, 1003, 35 L.Ed.2d 351 (1973); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Shepard v. Woodland Tp. Comm. and Planning Bd., </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>230, 247, 364 A.2d 1005 (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">In the subject case, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:4-1 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:35-1.12(a)(8) treat all New Jersey resident taxpayers similarly by providing a credit in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:4-1(a) to all New Jersey residents, limited to the New Jersey tax on non-New Jersey source income. The credit is applicable uniformly to all New Jersey residents as a class. The tax structures of other states may result in the payment of taxes in excess of the credit allowed by the State of New Jersey, either by reason of tax rates or of foreign multiple intrastate taxation of the same foreign income. The credit granted by New Jersey will vary as the foreign tax varies. The method by which the credit is determined is the same for all New Jersey residents. Any inequality in the amount of foreign tax that may be aggregated to reach the allowable New Jersey credit limit is the result of the foreign tax structure and existing interstate tax agreements, not a discriminatory application of the New Jersey credit. We hold that since this credit is available equally to all members of* the class of New Jersey resident taxpayers, there is no classification by the Legislature in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\"><em>[Jenkins v. Taxation Div. Dir., </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>402, 411-12, 4 <em>N.J. Tax </em>127, 136-37, 446 A.2d 217 (Tax Ct.1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Subsequent Equal Protection cases do not affect this conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Bush v. Gore, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>98, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>525, 148 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>388 (2000); <em>Williams v.
