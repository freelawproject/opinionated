In that appeal, we affirmed the Tax Court judgments reducing the assessments for the real property owned by the taxpayer, Brae Associates c/o Hertz Realty, for the years 1990 through 1995. The property is located at 225 Brae Boulevard in Park Ridge and consists of 14.56 acres of land and a 226,568 square-foot building occupied exclusively by Hertz.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In this appeal, the taxpayer challenges the Tax Court\u2019s denial of its motion for \u201cinterim\u201d Freeze Act relief from the 1996 and 1997 tax assessments levied by Park Ridge pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8 (the Freeze Act). In 1998, when the application was presented to the Tax Court, the Freeze Act provided that, after a successful appeal to the Tax Court, an assessment shall not be changed for the year in question and the two succeeding years after the Tax Court has rendered a final judgment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8. On June 2, 1998, Judge Kahn issued a written decision denying the taxpayer\u2019s application. That decision is published at 17 <em>N.J.Tax </em>391 (1998). The judge reasoned that because the 1995 tax year judgment was currently under review in the Appellate Division, plaintiff was not entitled to such relief. <em>Id. </em>at 396. Judge Kahn analyzed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8 and its legislative history, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-26, as well as this court\u2019s decision in <em>Tamburelli, Properties </em>Ass\u2019n <em>v. Borough of Cresskill, </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 705 A.2d 1270 (App.Div.1998), and determined that, until the appeal period for the base year 1995 judgment expires or has been exhausted, a taxpayer is not entitled to Freeze Act relief for the two subsequent years. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We agree and affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by Judge Kahn in his reported opinion. 17 <em>N.J. Tax </em>391 (1998). We add only this brief comment. Since the filing of the briefs in this appeal, the relevant statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8, was amended. It is now beyond dispute that a taxpayer is not entitled to Freeze Act relief unless the judgment reducing the assessment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>base year is not \u201csubject to further appeal.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8 (as amended effective September 17, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
