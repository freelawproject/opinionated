Eiszner, appeals from a judgment of the Tax Court entered on January 21, 2000, affirming the Director of the Division of Taxation\u2019s final determination of an assessment on plaintiffs 1992 non-resident gross income tax return. The Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Court concluded that the assessment was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations provided in <em>N.J.S.A-. </em>54A:9-4(a), and adjudicated as taxable income the disputed income from a New Jersey resident trust. The Director, upheld by the Tax Court, concluded that a sum of $1,069,213, described only as \u201ctrust, etc.\u201d income<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting in no income from New Jersey sources and no New Jersey tax, did not \u201cconstitute[ ] an employee death benefit which [would be] explicitly excluded from gross income by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-4b.\u201d <em>Eiszner v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>579, 593-98 (TaxCt.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">On this appeal, the taxpayer argues that \u201cthe Tax Court erroneously declined to follow the authorities interpreting former Internal Revenue Code section 101[(b)] in construing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-4(b)\u201d and that \u201cin construing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:9-4(d), the Tax Court erred in not following the authorities interpreting Internal Revenue Code section 6501(e).\u201d Plaintiff further argues that she \u201cis entitled to a refund of any 1992 gross income tax which she paid; with interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The stipulated facts are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">1. Joyce H. Eiszner (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) was a resident of Illinois during all of calendar year 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">2. Plaintiff is the widow of Dr. James R. Eiszner (\u201cDr. Eiszner\u201d), the former chief executive officer of CPC International, Inc. (\u201cCPC\"). Dr. Eiszner died on September 11,1990.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">3. At the <em>time of his </em>death, Dr. Eiszner was a resident of New Jersey, was employed by CPC International, Inc., in New Jersey, and was a participant in the CPC International, Inc. 1984 Stock and Performance Plan, [and] 1976 Slock Option and Performance Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d). ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">4. Under the Plan, shares of CPC stock and slock appreciation rights are contingently granted to participants. Amounts actually received from the Plan depend upon, among other things, CPC\u2019s performance during designated \u201cCycles\u201d, o. The Plan provides that a.participant must be an employee at the end of a Cycle in order to be entitled to a payment from the Plan. The Plan further provides that if a participant dies prior to the end of a Cycle, CPC\u2019s board of directors has absolute discretion as to whether or not a Plan payment will be made for such Cycle to the participant's estate or legal representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>6. On September 18, 1990 and subsequent to Dr. Eiszner\u2019s death, the CPC board of directors voted to authorize a payment to Dr. Eiszner\u2019s estate (the \u201cEstate\u201d) for the 1988 Cycle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">7. During 1992, the Plan paid $1,152,001 (the \u201c1992 Plan Payment\u201d) to the Estate for the 1988 Cycle, which ended on December 31, 1991, more than a year after Dr. Eiszner\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">8. According' to the Plan\u2019s terms, the CPC board of directors was under no obligation to make the 1992 Plan Payment, and the 1992 Plan Payment would not have been paid to the Estate absent board action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">9. According to the Plan\u2019s terms, Dr. Eiszner had no entitlement or right to the 1992 Plan Payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">10. The 1992 Plan Payment was made to the Estate and transferred to the Revocable Trust of Dr. James R. Eiszner (the \u201cTrust\u201d), which is a New' Jersey Resident Trust. The Trust then distributed the monies to Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-10\">11. Plaintiff filed a Gross Income Tax \u2014 Non-Resident Return, Form NJ-1040NR \u2014 1992 (the \u201cNonresident Return\u201d) on August 10, 1993. . Attached to the Non-Resident Return was Mrs. Eiszner\u2019s 1992 Illinois Individual Income Tax Return \u2014 Form IL-1040 (the \u201cIllinois Return\u201d) to w'hich was attached her \u201cSupplement to Illinois\u201d 1992 federal Form 1040 \u2014 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return (the \u201cSupplement to Illinois\u2019 Federal Return\u201d). Plaintiff did not attach the 1992 New Jersey Trust Fiduciary Return to her 1992 Gross Income Tax Non-Resident Return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">12. The Trust filed a Gross Income Tax Fiduciary Return, Form NJ-1041 \u2014 1992 on August 10, 1993 (the \u201cTrust Fiduciary Return\u201d), and the Estate filed a Gross Income Tax Fiduciary Return, Form NJ-1041 \u2014 1992 on June 9, 1993 (the \u201cEstate Return\u201d). .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">13. On the Nonresident Return, Plaintiff reported $1,069,213 on line 43 \u201cother\u201d under column A \u201cAmount of Gross Income Everywhere\u201d . The Nonresident Return reported no income from New' Jersey sources and no New Jersey tax due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-15\">14. The $1,069,213 refleeted on the Non-Resident Return is the 1992 Plan Payment less allocable expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-16\">15. Statement 1 attached to the Nonresident Return reported a gain recognized from the Trust .. in the amount of .$100. Plaintiff also reported $1,069,213 on the attached \u201cSupplement to Illinois\u201d Federal Return line 18 \u201cRents, royalties, partnerships, estates, trusts, etc.\u201d ... Statement 6 of the attached \u201cSupplement to Illinois\u201d Federal Return reported interest income from the Trust in the amount of $44,576 and $33,340 . ., and Statement 8 of the attached \u201cSupplement to Illinois\u201d Federal Return also listed income from the Trust in the amount of $10,795.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-17\">16. Statement 1 of the Trust Fiduciary Return . reports income from the Estate in the amount of $1,168,853, and the attached federal Schedule E . reports income from Estates and Trusts in the amount of $1,085,821. Statement 3 of the Trust Fiduciary Return .. reported a distribution to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,199,105 and sets forth Plaintiff\u2019s address, social security number, and her status as non-resident of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-18\">17. Statement 1 of the Estate Gross Income Tax Fiduciary Retain ... reported taxable income described as \u201cCPC International Inc Shares\u201d in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>$766,688 and \u201cCPC International Inc 1988 Performance Award\u201d in the amount of $385,313.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">18. The Defendant sent Plaintiff a Notice of Deficiency dated August 29,1997 (the \u201cNotice of Deficiency\u201d) which asserts that Plaintiff is liable for 1992 New Jersey Gross Income Tax in the amount of $78,647 plus $45,108 in accrued interest calculated to October 15,1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">19. Plaintiff Sled a Protest dated November 25, 1997 in which she contested the assessment proposed in the Notice of Deficiency. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">20. Defendant issued a Final Determination dated June 5, 1998 (the \u201cFinal Determination\u201d) in which it asserted liability for 1992 Gross Income tax due in the amount of $55,647, plus accrued interest of $39,353.07 calculated to July 15, 1998. .. The Final Determination reflected credit for a $23,000 estimated tax payment previously made by Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">21. If Defendant prevails in this matter, Defendant\u2019s computation of the proposed assessment in the Final Determination would be correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">During 1992, the CPC plan committee paid Dr. Eiszner\u2019s estate $1,152,001 which he would have received had he lived to the end of the 1988 cycle. The estate passed the payment on to the trust which distributed it to plaintiff in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The Tax Court held that the payment plaintiff received through the trust from her husband\u2019s employer should be included in the 1992 non-resident\u2019s gross income tax return. There is no dispute that if the payment is taxable at all, the entire amount would be taxable, even though it was paid to the estate and then into a trust. This is because the fiduciaries made a \u201cpass through\u201d distribution, and the payment retains the same character in the hands of the taxpayer as did the distribution to the estate and trust from a New Jersey source. Plaintiff, however, claims that the payment was a \u201cdeath benefit,\u201d which is excluded from New Jersey income pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:6-4(b) because it parallels the \u201cvirtually identical\u201d section 101(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, plaintiff contends that it was a payment by the CPC fund to the estate of plaintiffs husband of an amount to which he was not otherwise \u201centitled\u201d at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Plaintiff also argues that, even assuming that it was taxable, the Division was \u201cprecluded from making 'an assessment for 1992 by the statute of limitations\u201d embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:9-4. Specifically, the statute provides for a three-year statute of limitations, and the notice of deficiency was issued more than four years after the 1992 return was filed. Plaintiff again relies upon the \u201cvirtually identical\u201d IRS Code section 6501(e), and contends that we must interpret our tax code as the IRS provisions had been interpreted before our law was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We are asked to decide the substantive issue concerning the \u201cdeath benefit\u201d because a similar discretionary distribution was made by the fund after 1992 for the later cycle or cycles in which they would have vested had Dr. Eiszner survived. We address that issue first, and agree with the Tax Court\u2019s decision in that regard. <em>See </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 593-98. We add that, if plaintiff were correct, sophisticated business people could defer, and ultimately avoid, the payment of tax by plans which give trusted business associates the discretion to make substantial payments at the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Plaintiffs decedent or his estate had no right or entitlement to these funds at the time of, or by virtue of, his death. They simply were not \u201cdeath benefits\u201d within the meaning of New Jersey tax law. Plaintiff cannot take solace from interpretations of federal law, especially because federal tax law includes both income and estate taxation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> irrespective of source, residence or location of property, factors which are relevant to taxation by the State. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>54:33-1 through 54:38A-6; 54:34-1; 54:38-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-1, 2-1.1, 5-1, -7, -8.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We also agree with the Tax Court that in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:9-4(d), the six-year statute of limitations applies in this case. <em>See </em>18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 593. We recognize that the Director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>may well have ultimately made his assessment based on information he received from his review of the 1992 estate and trust returns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also acknowledge that it took the Director more than three years after the plaintiffs income tax return was filed, and her refund was requested, to find the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">However, the non-resident income tax return did not identify any \u201cnature [or] source\u201d of the trust income, and attached only a copy of the Illinois return. Attached to the Illinois return was a copy of the federal return which included a reference to \u201croyalties, rents and trusts, etc.\u201d without identification or particularization. As we understand the record, a federal schedule \u201cE\u201d (relating to trusts and estates) was not attached to the federal portion which was attached to the New Jersey return. Moreover and significantly, despite the specific column, the State return failed to identify any of plaintiffs income (in Part I \u201cTotal Income, lines 33-44\u201d) as being \u201cfrom New Jersey sources.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In these circumstances, we agree with the Tax Court that, even though <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54A:9-4(d) does not expressly include the word \u201csource,\u201d given the very essence of a State source based gross income tax, <em>(see, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>54A:2-1, 2-1.1; 54A:5-1, -7, -8), the statute must be read to require (directly or by attachment) an adequate identification of the source as part of the \u201cnature\u201d of the income reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> The sum of $1,069,213 was reflected as \u201ctrust, etc.\u201d income on plaintiffs federal tax return and attached to her Illinois income tax return. The Illinois return and the federal return were then attached to plaintiff\u2019s New Jersey return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-11\"> 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 101(b) was repealed on August 20, 1996.
