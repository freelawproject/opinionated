We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Harelay\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that its methodology in establishing \u201cfair rental value\u201d or \u201ceconomic rent/ineome\u201d is correct as a matter of law and, therefore, the Tax Court should have accepted it. The Tax Court found that Harclay failed to overcome the presumption of validity or correctness which attaches to the assessment. We agree with the Tax Court and affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Joseph Small in the opinion published at 18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>564 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
