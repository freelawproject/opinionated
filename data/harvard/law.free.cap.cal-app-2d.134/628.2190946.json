Guillory compensatory damages in the sum of $2,250 and punitive damages of $2,000. From the judgment entered on the verdict defendants Mildred Godfrey and Froy J. Tristany have taken this appeal. The action was dismissed as to defendant Edward Godfrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The complaint alleges that plaintiffs were owners and operators of a caf\u00e9 located at 715% South Main Street in Los Angeles; that defendant Froy J. Tristany was doing business under the name of Duke\u2019s Liquor Stores; that defendant Mildred Godfrey was an agent and employee of Tristany and acted within the scope of her employment and under the directions of Tristany; that on and after March 17, 1952, \u201cdefendants and each of them, \u2019 \u2019 with intention to destroy plaintiffs \u2019 business, maliciously and wantonly intimidated their customers in that, whenever customers were about to enter the caf\u00e9, defendants would ask them if they were \u201cNigger Lovers\u201d and make other intimidating remarks; that Mildred Godfrey on March 24, 1952 entered the caf\u00e9 and forcibly evicted a customer, causing a large crowd of people to collect ; that the customers were actually intimidated; that this course of conduct started when plaintiffs employed a colored cook in the caf\u00e9; that as a proximate result of defendants \u2019 malicious acts business dropped off more than 50 per cent; that regular customers withdrew their patronage; that plaintiffs became nervous and upset, and plaintiff Dorothy became ill and required medical care, all to the damage of plaintiffs in the sum of $10,000; that plaintiffs lost money in the business and profits amounting to $1,000; that, by reason of the malicious and wanton acts of defendants, the plaintiffs demand exemplary damages of $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The evidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to respondents, with every legitimate inference drawn in their favor. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Ablow, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 853, 858 [268 P.2d 80].) Thus arrayed it discloses the following situation,  Plaintiffs owned and operated a caf\u00e9 on Main Street in Los Angeles and defendant Tristany conducted a liquor store next door under the name Duke\u2019s Liquor Stores. Defendant Mildred Godfrey was Tristany\u2019s sister and active in the conduct of the store. On March 17, 1952, plaintiffs hired a Negro cook, William Murrell, who then started to work. From that day until plaintiffs closed the caf\u00e9, about April 28, 1952, defendants engaged in a course of conduct calculated and intended to intimidate plaintiffs\u2019 customers and drive away their trade. As patrons would enter defendants would ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>if they were \u201cNigger Lovers,\u201d make disparaging remarks about the caf\u00e9 and the food \u201ccooked by a nigger,\u201d perform antics in front of the place, make gestures, some of them obscene, yell at customers such things as \u201cDon\u2019t go in there. The place isn\u2019t fit to eat in. She has this nigger in there. Don\u2019t go in there.\u201d Most of these things were done by the sister Mildred, but Froy himself stood on the sidewalk joining in the gestures, laughing at Mildred\u2019s antics, made disparaging remarks and fully supported his sister\u2019s activities. She called plaintiffs \u201cdirty Mexicans,\u201d\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t go into the restaurant, can\u2019t you see this dirty Mexican people, can\u2019t you see that lady, the lady\u2019s hands, can\u2019t you see the lady don\u2019t\u2014go away from here. \u2019 \u2019 On March 24th Mildred had a fight in the caf\u00e9 with a man called Frenchie, calling him names that one witness, Miss Moreno, would not repeat. According to Murrell: \u201cShe came in, says, \u2018Get out of here, you nigger lover. You know I told you not to eat in here.\u2019 She drug him out by the ear, pulled him out, beat him up. He began to bleed at the mouth.\u201d On another occasion Tristany told plaintiff in the presence of customers \u201cyou have no business having that god-damn nigger working in here.\u201d When Mrs. Guillory protested to Mildred Godfrey about her conduct she replied: \u201cI\u2019m just not going to go for that,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not only not going to let you operate, but I\u2019m not even going to let you sell.\u201d Tristany told Mr. Guillory \u201cI know my sister did wrong, but, ... I\u2019m for it 100 per cent. I feel exactly the way she does.\u201d \u201cSo he said, \u2018Whatever my sister done,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m her brother and I\u2019ll back her a hundred per cent. You can go right now,\u2019 he says, \u2018load your gun,\u2019 he says, \u2018and fire, but make sure you don\u2019t miss.\u2019 \u201d This was a continuous course of conduct. The business of the caf\u00e9 dropped off to nothing and plaintiffs were unable to sell or to operate. The mental perturbation which this caused to plaintiff Dorothy Guillory aggravated an existing gall bladder trouble and brought on a complete nervous breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Appellants\u2019 brief does not comply with the rules in numerous respects but counsel has made his points sufficiently for us to be able to dispose of them. He argues first that no cause of action was alleged or proved. He quotes section 43 Civil Code as follows: \u201cBesides the personal rights mentioned or recognized in the Political Code, every person has, subject to the qualifications and restrictions provided by law, the right of protection from bodily restraint or harm, from personal insult, from defamation, and from injury to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>personal relations.\u201d Then argues that there was no false imprisonment, assault and battery, interference with right of privacy, defamation, or interference with contract between plaintiffs and Murrell. But counsel says nothing about the right of protection \u201cfrom personal insult\u201d and, more important, ignores the real theory of the complaint and the proof, which is wrongful and malicious interference with plaintiffs\u2019 going business.  It is said that \u201cwrongful or malicious interference with the formation of a contract or the right to pursue a lawful business, calling, trade, or occupation has been generally held to constitute a tort, . . (86 C.J.S. \u00a7 43, p. 956.) This rule prevails in California. <em>(Finney </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>35 Cal.2d 161 [217 P.2d 19] ; <em>Masoni </em>v. <em>Board of Trade of San Francisco, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 738, 741-742 [260 P.2d <em>205]; Remillard-Dandini Co. </em>v. <em>Dandini, </em>46 Cal.App.2d 678, 680 [116 P.2d 641]; <em>California Grape Control Board </em>v. <em>California Produce Corp., </em>4 Cal.App.2d 242, 244 [40 P.2d 846]; see also Restatement of Torts, \u00a7766, p. 49; 62 C.J. \u00a753, p. 1137.)  The evidence amply supports a finding of malicious disruption of plaintiffs\u2019 business by defendants and damage proximately flowing therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Appellants\u2019 counsel also argues that no cause of action was stated or proved against defendant Tristany, first, because \u201cthere is no allegation that this liquor store of Tristany has committed any act at all\u201d (a unique and refreshing argument) and, secondly, that Mildred was alleged to have acted as Tristany\u2019s agent and no proof to that effect was made; that plaintiffs forsook the agency theory during the trial and sought (successfully) te i old Tristany as an actor. The complaint not only alleged _ \u201dt it also averred that defendants and each of them cominmex* ____ \" acts. At best the shifting of ground by plaintiffs could amottmrto a variance (Code Civ. Proe., \u00a7\u00a7469-470). The evidence supports the implied finding that Tristany did personally act in concert with his codefendant in committing the tort, and the variance, if one there be, worked no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The next contention is that any damage suffered personally by plaintiff Dorothy was not proximately caused by the defendants\u2019 wrongful acts. This is based upon the fact that she was nervous, afflicted with gall bladder trouble and other ailments before the tort was committed.  It overlooks the principle that a tort-feasor must take his victim as he finds him. And when his wrong aggravates an existing disability he is liable for that exacerbation and the task of measuring it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>dollars is that of trial judge or jury. <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Transit Lines, </em>111 Cal.App.2d 593, 599 [245 P.2d 35].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">It is now well settled in this state that damages may be awarded for mental suffering caused by intentional and outrageous conduct. <em>(Emden </em>v. <em>Vitz, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 313, 318 [198 P.2d 696] ; <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Spiegel, Inc., </em>96 Cal.App.2d 793, 794-795 [216 P.2d 571]; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Pridmore, </em>97 Cal.App. 2d 124, 130 [217 P.2d 113, 17 A.L.R.2d 929] ; <em>State Rubbish Collectors Assn. </em>v. <em>Siliznof, </em>38 Cal.2d 330, 336 [240 P.2d 282] ; see also Restatement, Torts (1948 Supp.), \u00a746, p. 612; 15 A.L.R.2d 111, anno.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The further argument that Tristany is not liable for damages caused by Mildred Godfrey\u2019s misconduct is misplaced because the evidence shows they were acting in concert, and he was an active participant in some of her acts. This makes him liable for the full amount of the damage. <em>(Marriott </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>152 Cal. 705, 711 [93 P. 875. 125 Am.St.Rep. 87] ; <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Royal Realty Co., </em>35 Cal.2d 409, 433 [218 P.2d 17]; 11 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a749, p. 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The claim that the damages are excessive because of failure of proof as to loss of profits from the business cannot be sustained for the verdict for $2,250 general damages is sufficiently supported by the evidence of the injury inflicted upon Dorothy Guillory, regardless of what the showing may have been as to business losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Counsel argues that no punitive damages should have been awarded against either defendant.  Of course, actual malice is the basis for such an award in a ease of this kind. (14 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 176, p. 810.) That kind of malice was plainly proved here. Tristany\u2019s active participation in the tort and his wholehearted endorsement of his sister\u2019s conduct and objectives, as shown by above quotations, render him equally liable for a punitive award. Those things show actual malice on his part.  And it was for the jury to determine the proper proportion which the compensatory damages should bear to the punitive award. <em>(Finney </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>35 Cal.2d 161, 163 [217 P.2d 19].) It cannot be said, upon this record, that the punitive award is excessive as to either defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Appellants say there was error in permitting an amendment at the trial to add a claim for $1,333, medical expense to the complaint. The matter was within the discretion of the court <em>(McDougald </em>v. <em>Hulet, </em>132 Cal. 154, 162 [64 P. 278]; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, </em>112 Cal.App. 438, 441 [296 P. 891]), and, as no real showing of surprise was then made and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>no prejudice now appears to have resulted, the ruling cannot be held erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Counsel for appellants urges error in refusal to permit examination of William Murrell under section 2055 Code of Civil Procedure. No transcript reference guides us to the ruling but it has been found at page 596. No explanation other than desire was offered. And it appears that Murrell was the first witness in the ease and fully cross-examined. Counsel says the ruling was prejudicial but does not suggest any basis for that claim. It was a discretionary ruling (Wul<em>ferdinger </em>v. <em>Pickwick Stages System, </em>105 Cal.App. 509, 511 [288 P. 93]; <em>Litt </em>v. <em>Litt, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 242, 244 [170 P.2d 684]) in which there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Appellants further say that no cause of action was stated because the ease was not at issue at the time of trial.  It seems that a general demurrer to the complaint had been overruled with leave to defendants to answer, but they served -a special demurrer instead, and same was sustained; thereupon defendants answered the original complaint and plaintiffs did not amend. At the trial defendants\u2019 counsel claimed the cause was not at issue and the court ruled to the contrary. Thereupon the trial proceeded upon the complaint and answer thereto and no one suffered any prejudice. By answering the complaint after the ruling upon the special demurrer defendants waived all objections except the general ground of no cause of action. <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>96 Cal.App. 512, 516 [274 P.2d 584]; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Heffner, </em>29 Cal.App.2d 382, 383 [84 P.2d 540].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Other points are stated in appellants\u2019 brief without discussion or citation of supporting authority. They are entitled to no further comment for they are deemed to have been abandoned. <em>(Estate of Scott, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 21, 24 [202 P.2d 357] ; <em>Utz </em>v. <em>Aureguy, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 803, 807 [241 P.2d 639].)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The appeal from order denying a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is without merit, as shown by the foregoing discussion. The order denying motion for new trial is not appealable and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The judgment and order denying judgment notwithstanding the verdict are affirmed; the appeal from order denying new trial is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Shinn, P. J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-18\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
