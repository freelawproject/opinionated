In support of this motion plaintiffs filed three affidavits, one of Attorney Maury, which was \u201cmade entirely upon information and belief,\u201d and two others, one by Attorney Bertram and another by Walter Bacon. These affidavits were based upon hearsay statements. The purpose of these affidavits was to show that defendants had in fact not incurred any attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The court struck the affidavits as irrelevant, immaterial, founded upon hearsay and based upon information and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\"><em>Questions: </em>First: <em>Did the trial court err in striking the affidavits in support of the motion to tax costs?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\"><em>No. </em> An examination of the affidavits discloses that the statements therein were upon information and belief or hearsay evidence. Hence they were devoid of any evidentiary value. An affidavit made upon information and belief is hearsay and not proof of the facts stated therein. <em>(Kellett </em>v. <em>Kellett, </em>2 Cal.2d 45, 48 [1] [39 P.2d 203]; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Robert S. Odell &amp; Co., </em>63 Cal.App.2d 78, 82 [2] [146 P.2d 504] ; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>138 Cal. 23, 26 [70 P. 930].)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The rule is also established that the sufficiency of an affidavit must be tested by the same rules as those applicable to oral testimony. <em>(Bank of America </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>89 Cal.App.2d 21, 23 [2] [200 P.2d 151].)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">It is clear that the hearsay statements in the affidavits have no evidentiary value and the trial court correctly struck the affidavits from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Second: <em>Were defendants entitled to have taxed as costs $100 attorneys\u2019 fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\"><em>Yes. </em>If a libel action is dismissed or defendant recovers judgment he shall be allowed $100 to cover counsel fees in addition to other costs. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">In the present ease counsel filed verified cost bills in which they claimed $100 for each defendant as attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">A verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence that the costs claimed have been necessarily incurred. <em>(Fay </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>165 Cal. 469, 475 [132 P. 1040] ; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>San Diego, </em>132 Cal. 35, 36 [64 P. 124] ; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>F. D. Cornell Co., </em>110 Cal.App. 452, 454 [2] [294 P. 490].)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">It thus appears that defendants have made a prima facie case in support of their claim that they each incurred liability for attorneys\u2019 fees in the sum of $100, and that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>prima facie evidence was not overcome by competent evidence of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In view of this finding of the trial court, supported by competent evidence the requirements set forth in <em>Wheat-land </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>110 Cal.App. 288 [294 P. 499], that as a prerequisite to recovering attorneys\u2019 fees by a defendant in a libel action, two facts must be shown: (1) that he has employed an attorney to defend against the action filed, and (2) that he has paid or agreed to pay an amount in at least the sum of $100 for such services has been met in light of the record before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Moore, P. J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
