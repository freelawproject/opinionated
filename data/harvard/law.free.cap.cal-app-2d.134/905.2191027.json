J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auok\">A judgment having been entered against defendant in this action, an execution was issued and levied on his wages. He presented a claim for exemption of all these wages, under Code of Civil Procedure, section 690.11. The plaintiff conceded the exemption of half thereof, and on hearing of defendant\u2019s claim it was denied as to the remaining half. He appeals from the order of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Section 690.26, Code of Civil Procedure, provides for the procedure on such a claim. The judgment debtor must file an affidavit setting forth the nature of his claim and the facts necessary to support it. (Subd. (1).) The creditor may then file a counter affidavit contesting the claim. (Sub. (4).) There may then be a hearing before the court. (Subd. (6).) At this hearing the affidavits above mentioned \u201cshall constitute the pleadings\u201d and \u201cshall be received in evidence.\u201d (Subd. (10).) If no other evidence is received, the court may decide the case thereon \u201cif satisfied that sufficient facts are shown thereby\u201d; otherwise it may order the hearing continued for other evidence. (Subd. (10).)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>In support of their various arguments here, the parties refer to documents sent up in the clerk\u2019s transcript which appear to be marked as exhibits (though not on the date of the hearing), to other documents filed in the trial court but not marked as exhibits, and to some other documents not in the record at all, but on file in a superior court action. Whether any of these documents was presented at the hearing does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">There is in the record neither a reporter\u2019s transcript nor an agreed or settled statement to disclose what occurred at the hearing of the motion, the appeal being here solely on the clerk\u2019s transcript. In such a case the appellant, cannot obtain a review of exhibits and other matters on file in the trial court, the proceedings, if any, for the presentation of such matters to the trial court being a part of the oral proceedings, which can be brought up on appeal only by one of the forms of record above noted as being absent here. <em>(Estate of Larson </em>(1949), 92 Cal.App.2d 267, 269 [206 P.2d 852] ; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Plavsa </em>(1951), 103 Cal.App.2d 222, 224 [229 P.2d 482].)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The case must therefore be decided on the two affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Since they are to be regarded as pleadings, and the judgment debtor has the burden of proof (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 690.26, subd. (10)), his affidavit may be regarded as the complaint. The rule of section 462, Code of Civil Procedure, may properly be applied here, and the allegations of the debtor, not controverted by the creditor, must be taken as true, and the debtor is not required to prove them.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The affidavit of the debtor here states that all his earnings levied on are needed for the support of himself and his family and that they were earned within a period of time which makes them exempt if so needed. These allegations are not denied in the creditor\u2019s counteraffidavit, so they must be accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">The particular part of section 690.11, Code of Civil Procedure, here in question exempts all of the debtor\u2019s earnings for the prescribed time \u201cunless the debts are: (a) Incurred . . . for the common necessaries of life; or (b) incurred for personal services rendered by any employee, or former employee, of such debtor.\u201d The debtor\u2019s affidavit negatived both of these limitations. The creditor\u2019s affidavit said nothing of limitation (b), and the debtor\u2019s affidavit in regard to it must be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>The debtor added to his denial of limitation (a) a statement that the debt was \u201cfor monies owed under a property settlement agreement.\u2019\u2019 The creditor\u2019s affidavit said the claim was \u201cfor necessities of life, to wit, attorney\u2019s fees and court costs in a divorce action between the defendant and the plaintiff herein, his former wife.\u201d Since the creditor\u2019s affidavit coupled such denial as it attempted of the debtor\u2019s allegations regarding limitation (b) with a statement of the subject matter of the claim, we must, in the absence of any further record, assume the truth of this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">This leaves for determination only the question whether a wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs in a divorce case are \u201ccommon necessaries of life.\u201d The creditor did not, indeed, state that they were such, but only that they were \u201cnecessities of life,\u201d omitting the word \u201ccommon.\u201d However, since the affidavit for the creditor clearly stated the nature of the claim, it will not be ruled out by this omission, but we will decide the ease on the question just stated. That question we think is answered by the rules declared by this court in <em>Los Angeles Finance Co. </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1952), 110 Cal.App.2d Supp. 850 [243 P.2d 139], There we were required to construe the same provision of Code of Civil Procedure, section 609.11, subjecting half of the creditor\u2019s wages to levy for debts incurred for \u201cthe common necessaries of life.\u201d After reviewing various decisions holding articles exempt from levy because necessary, we said at page 854:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">\u201cThese decisions are in accordance with the general policy of the courts of this state to give a liberal construction to exemption statutes in favor of the debtor. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-6\">\u201cIt follows logically that this same policy requires a <em>strict </em>construction of any provisions which tend to limit the exemptions elsewhere in the statute extended to the debtor. In 25 Corpus Juris 10 (par. 8), the rule is thus stated: \u2018 Conversely to the rule of liberal construction of the' grant of an exemption, provisions which limit or take away the exemption are strictly construed, whether in provisos and exceptions or in amending statutes. \u2019 ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-7\">\u201c. . . common necessaries of life\u2019 as used in Code of Civil Procedure, section 690.11, second paragraph, means those things which are commonly required by persons for the sustenance of life regardless of their employment or status. . . . on the other hand, the decision of whether or not a certain article previously sold to a debtor is a common necessary of life so that <em>one-half of the debtor\u2019s earnings </em>of the past 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>days, elsewhere exempted by the statute for the support of his family, shall nevertheless be taken to pay for <em>it, </em>involves a determination of whether or not it is such an article that <em>in the hands of anyone </em>it is to be regarded universally, or substantially so, as necessary to sustain life. Obviously, the Legislature, cognizant of the fact that to the great majority of persons supporting a family the earnings of the past 30 days are required for such basic things as food, heat, shelter, etc <em>(common </em>to all) desired to make sure that these earnings shall not be taken to pay for something less basic.\u201d Accordingly, we reversed a decision of the trial court subjecting half the debtor\u2019s earnings to a levy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Under the construction here given to the section the plaintiff\u2019s claim does not justify the levy. Possibly, each wife in such a case may regard her expense money in a divorce suit as necessary to her; but divorces are not yet so common that the cost of them \u201cis to be regarded universally, or substantially so, as necessary to sustain life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The order appealed from is reversed, and the trial court is directed to allow defendant\u2019s claim of exemption in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Patrosso, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b931-9\">SWAIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACC_\">I dissent. In <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Tearle </em>(1936), 7 Cal. 2d 48, 57 [59 P.2d 953, 106 A.L.R 580], the Supreme Court held that a mere money judgment rendered in California, based on a New York decree awarding alimony to plaintiff in a divorce suit, was in legal effect a judgment for alimony (7 Cal.2d 55-56), and then went on to hold: \u201cOne of the characteristics of such a judgment is that as against said judgment the judgment debtor\u2019s earnings are not exempt from execution. (Citations.) Not only are the earnings of the judgment debtor under an alimony judgment liable for the payment thereof, but the means of enforcement of such a judgment are different and more effective than those applicable to the enforcement of an ordinary money judgment.\u201d The court referred to the power to punish for contempt as one of the differences between the two sorts of judgments. On pages 58 and 59 of 7 Cal.2d is further discussion of the reasons for the rule announced. The court said the trial there (not the court that originally ordered the alimony) could exercise its discretion and could allow the defendant some part of his wages as exempt, if deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">It is true, that case dealt with a judgment for alimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>and we have here a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and defendant argues that this is not alimony. But it appears to me that the reasons which led to the decision are equally applicable to both sorts of judgments. Money awarded a wife to pay her attorney fee in a divorce ease is as much for her support as money for a doctor\u2019s fee or a grocery bill. This was not a division of community property. Both may be enforced by contempt proceedings, and both are originally matters in the discretion of some court.
