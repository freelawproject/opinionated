The defendant was hired in 1963 by the plaintiff to perform the duties of a salesman for the plaintiff\u2019s products. There was no written contract of employment. During some of the time that the defendant worked for the plaintiff, the defendant also sold products of Skyline Industries, Inc. (Skyline), and, from 1972 through 1976, the defendant received $141,805 from Skyline as well as $138,408 from the plaintiff. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff alleged in its complaint that the terms of the defendant\u2019s employment obligated the defendant to work full time and exclusively for the plaintiff and that Skyline was the plaintiff\u2019s competitor at the time the defendant was selling the products of both the plaintiff and Skyline. The defendant, in submitting a motion for summary judgment, argued that he was not obligated to work exclusively for the plaintiff, that Skyline and the plaintiff were not competitors, and that the plaintiff\u2019s alleged damages were speculative. In support of his motion he submitted an affidavit and portions of the transcript of the deposition of the chairman of the board of the plaintiff, Peter Davidson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the issue of the defendant\u2019s terms of employment, the plaintiff submitted in response to the defendant\u2019s motion an affidavit by Peter Davidson. On the issues of Skyline\u2019s competition with the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s damages, the plaintiff made no response. The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment was allowed, and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The defendant alleged in his counterclaim, inter alla, that the plaintiff had represented its lawsuit to others in a way which interfered with the defendant\u2019s business reputation and job opportunities in violation of G. L. c. 93A. Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sequently, during the trial on the counterclaim, the defendant also alleged that the plaintiff had violated G. L. c. 93. The trial judge found for the plaintiff and dismissed the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>The summary judgment. </em>In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the motion judge made three rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">(1) Damages as measured by a portion of the defendant\u2019s salary from the plaintiff for the time he spent selling Skyline\u2019s products are speculative \u201csince there is no way of readily computing what portion of his hours were diverted or what additional profit the plaintiff would have earned but for the defendant\u2019s alleged breach\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">(2) Damages as measured by Skyline\u2019s payments to the defendant for the time during which the defendant worked for the plaintiff but was performing services for Skyline are unavailable because the defendant did not act in competition with the plaintiff; and</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">(3) Because these were the only damages specifically asked for by the plaintiff and they \u201cmay not properly be measured,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiff has no cognizable cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The last of these rulings will be examined first.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">If the plaintiff cannot show that it is entitled to any damages, the defendant would still be liable for nominal damages if the plaintiff can prove that the defendant committed a breach of an employment agreement. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 401 comment b (1957). Once a breach is established, the plaintiff is entitled \u201cto at least nominal damages in an action at law . . . regardless of his ability to prove substantial damages.\u201d <em>Rombola </em>v. <em>Cosindas, </em>351 Mass. 382, 384 (1966). See, e.g., <em>Damiano </em>v. <em>National Grange Mut. Liab. Co., </em>316 Mass. 626, 629 (1944); <em>King Features Syndicate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cape Cod Bdcst. Co., </em>317 Mass. 652, 655 (1945); <em>Nathan </em>v. <em>Tremont Storage Warehouse, Inc., </em>328 Mass. 168, 171 (1951); <em>Page </em>v. <em>New England Tel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>&amp; Tel. Co., </em>383 Mass. 250, 251 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the motion judge ruled that \u201c[t]he parties . . . dispute whether there was a contract by the defendant not to engage in any sales activity or other employment other than for the plaintiff during his period of employment, implied from the company\u2019s custom and practice with its salesmen,\u201d there was a factual issue to be resolved concerning the terms of the employment contract, and that factual issue precluded summary judgment. <em>Bedford Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Co. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 898 (1978). Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Since Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(d), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), permits partial summary judgment, it is necessary to reach the motion judge\u2019s rulings on the availability of damages. The motion judge ruled that the damages to which the plaintiff may be entitled depend in part on whether the defendant acted in competition with the plaintiff and found that the defendant\u2019s sales of Skyline products were of \u201citems that were not manufactured by (or in competition with items manufactured by) the plaintiff during this period.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lack of competition between the plaintiff and Skyline would not prevent the plaintiff from proving damages for breach of contract stemming from any failure of the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>work according to the terms of his employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the presence of such competition could have a bearing on the plaintiff\u2019s damages, so it is necessary to consider the motion judge\u2019s ruling on this particular issue of competition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In evaluating the materials presented to the motion judge, the inferences which may be drawn from the facts alleged are to be viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to . . . the parties opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Salem Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 365 (1980). The evidence submitted by the defendant in support of his allegation that he did not sell products in competition with the plaintiff consisted of portions of a deposition of the chairman of the board of the plaintiff, Peter Davidson. These deposition selections, when viewed as admissions by the plaintiff,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> do not show that there was no competition between the plaintiff and Skyline. Davidson\u2019s deposition is clear in stating that the plaintiff did not sell the same products as Skyline, but this does not settle the question whether it and Skyline competed for the same buyers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>or markets.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In portions of the deposition Davidson appears uncertain of Skyline\u2019s competitive status.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other portions, however, Davidson indicates that the defendant did cause the plaintiff to lose some business with its customers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead of showing no \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e), 365 Mass. 825 (1974), the deposition excerpts, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, indicated that there was a dispute about the nature of the competition between the plaintiff and Skyline. \u201c[Summary judgment is not a substitute for the trial of disputed fact issues.\u201d 10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2712, at 379 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Because \u201c[r]ule 56(e) provides that once a motion is made and supported by affidavits and other supplementary material the opposing party may not simply rest on his plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ings or general denials, he must \u2018set forth <em>specific facts\u2019 . . . </em>showing that there is a genuine, triable issue,\u201d <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976), the plaintiff followed an unwise path in not responding to the defendant\u2019s motion on the issues of competition and damages. See 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 56.23, at 56-1390 (2d ed. 1982). Nonetheless, \u201c[i]f the moving party fails to shoulder his burden his motion should be denied, even though the opposing party has presented no evidentiary materials in opposition, and has not presented any [rule] 56(f) affidavit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2739, at 717-719. Because the defendant\u2019s materials were insufficient to carry his burden of showing an absence of a factual dispute, the burden does not shift to the plaintiff so as to require the plaintiff to \u201cset forth specific facts\u201d in opposition to the motion. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e). See Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2727, at 535-536.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The defendant also failed to present any evidence to show that the plaintiff\u2019s damages are barred by the requirement of certainty. Although the plaintiff may indeed have difficulty in proving damages with sufficient certainty, \u201c[i]t is settled that mere uncertainty in assessing the amount of damages should not jeopardize an injured party\u2019s right to recover as long as those damages are the certain result of the wrongdoing.\u201d <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Begin, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 311 (1977). See <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Demos Bros. Gen. Contractors, Inc., </em>334 Mass. 377, 378-379 (1956); <em>BBF, Inc. </em>v. <em>Germanium Power Devices Corp., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 166, 177 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Thus, the motion judge erred in ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s damages are barred due to uncertainty, that there was no competition between the plaintiff and Skyline, and that lack of provable damages defeats the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\"><em>The counterclaim. </em>The trial judge, in dismissing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, found that the defendant did not meet his burden of proof to show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>a. The plaintiff caused the Internal Revenue Service to audit the defendant\u2019s tax returns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">b. The plaintiff was responsible for chilling the relationship between the defendant and Philipps Brothers Division of Englehard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">c. The plaintiff caused deprivation of job opportunities to the defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">d. The plaintiff caused damage to the defendant\u2019s \u201creputation and ability to function at arm\u2019s length with others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Since these findings were not erroneous, it is not necessary to rule whether contrary findings would have stated a cause of action under G. L. c. 93A or G. L. c. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">In reviewing the findings of a trial court in actions tried without a jury, an appellate court may not reverse \u201cunless the facts on which the conclusion was based are clearly erroneous\u201d or unless \u201cthe findings or conclusions are tainted by an error of law.\u201d <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 674 (1977). Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). See <em>Puma </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 490 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The defendant expresses disagreement with the trial judge\u2019s findings. But there is sufficient evidence in the record to support them. The trial judge is \u201cin the best position to determine weight and credibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Oberg </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>345 Mass. 596, 598 (1963). Mass.R.Civ.P. 52 (a). See <em>Puma </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. at 492 n.3. The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence probative of the defendant\u2019s damages. The record does not show that the trial judge excluded such evidence except where he properly sustained objections to questions which were leading or asked without proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed, as is the judgment entered thereon. The judgment dismissing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\"> These were the amounts determined by the trial judge in his findings on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, based on the defendant\u2019s income tax returns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\"> Peter Davidson is the son of Phillip Davidson, now deceased, who was chairman of the board of the plaintiff during the time of the defendant\u2019s employment by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> The cases cited by the defendant in support of a contrary view either did not speak to this issue or were suits in equity. \u201c[E]quity pays no attention to nominal damages.\u201d <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 150 (1974), S.C., 366 Mass. 751 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\"> Massachusetts cases have held that the relation of employer and employee, absent an agreement, gives rise to no fiduciary relationship, except insofar as the employee has a duty not to disclose confidential information obtained during the course of his employment. See, e.g., <em>American Stay Co. </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>211 Mass. 229 (1912); <em>Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crampton, </em>361 Mass. 835, 839-840 (1972). An employee, however, may be liable to an employer for damages resulting from breach of contract if the employee used time which should have been devoted to the employer to work for another. <em>American Stay Co., supra </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">There were no explicit allegations that a confidential relationship had been violated, although the plaintiffs complaint did allege that the defendant \u201chad been working in a manner directly contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\"> \u201cIf defective or partial performance is rendered, the loss in value caused by the breach is equal to the difference between the value that the performance would have had if there had been no breach and the value of such performance as was actually rendered.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 comment b (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\"> For a discussion of a different but related issue of covenants not to compete following employment, see 1974 Ann. Survey Mass. Law \u00a7 7.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b542-8\"> We shall assume here, without deciding, that the plaintiff would be bound by uncontradicted admissions made by Peter Davidson, who was not the chairman of the board during the defendant\u2019s employment. See <em>Brunswick Corp. </em>v. <em>Vineberg, </em>370 F.2d 605, 611 (5th Cir. 1967) (depositions of the plaintiff\u2019s corporate officers who apparently had no personal knowledge of the details of the suit do not support the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment). See also <em>Dome Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>290 Mass. 36, 39 (1935) (\u201cIt is the party offering the answers as evidence who is bound by them, and then only if they are uncontradicted by other evidence\u201d); <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>M &amp; D Builders, Inc., </em>360 Mass. 54, 61 (1971) (\u201cIf the [plaintiff\u2019s] answers [to interrogatories] are offered in evidence by the defendant, they may bind the defendant if they are uncontradicted, but they will not bind the [plaintiff]\u201d), though both of these cases were decided before Massachusetts adopted the current rule 56.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\"> The trial judge found in the trial on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim that Skyline\u2019s H piles (or beams) and the plaintiff\u2019s pipe piles served the same function, and that a buyer would use one or the other, but not both, for foundation piling. The plaintiff did not ask for reconsideration of the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment during or after this trial. Final judgments dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim were entered on the same day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> When asked, \u201cWould a potential buyer have an interest in buying Davidson Pipe products along with H pile and sheet pile?,\u201d Davidson responded, \u201cI\u2019m not really sure how to answer that question. I would assume that a potential purchaser of H pile and sheet pile would want to buy from whoever can give him the best deal. We don\u2019t happen to handle that product. We don\u2019t handle a lot of other things.\u201d When confronted with the question, \u201cSo that it wouldn\u2019t be a situation where Davidson Pipe had a product and he would be causing the sale of that product to be with a competitor?,\u201d Davidson responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily so. It might be and it might not be.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b543-8\"> When asked whether the defendant caused the plaintiff to lose any customers, Davidson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost any of the customers but we\u2019ve lost some business to these customers.\u201d When asked whether Skyline was a competitor at the time of the deposition, he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d In another response Davidson referred to Skyline as a \u201csemi-competitor.\u201d Although these answers possibly could be explained by the fact that Skyline began selling the same products as the plaintiff after the defendant was no longer employed by the plaintiff, they stand in the way of the defendant\u2019s attempt to carry his burden of proof. Any lack of clarity in these answers due to the fact that they were excerpts from surrounding material cannot help the defendant, who selected the excerpts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
