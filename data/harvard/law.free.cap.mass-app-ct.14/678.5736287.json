See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>Quincy, post </em>964 (1982). The town\u2019s motion to dismiss, filed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), was allowed, and the plaintiffs appealed from the ensuing judgment. For the reasons set out in a host of cases such as <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98, 104 (1977), and <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 1000 (1981), the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">Counsel for the defendant seeks to salvage his position by directing our attention to various documents which he has reproduced as addenda to his brief which (he says) were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>presented to the judge at the hearing on the motion and not excluded by him (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 12[b], 365 Mass. 755-756 [1974]) and which (it is urged) disclose that the defendant is entitled to a summary judgment under the provisions of Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b) and (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). There are several procedural obstacles in counsel\u2019s path.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">First, it does not appear from the face of any of the documents as reproduced, or from the docket entries, that the original of any of the documents was ever placed \u201con file\u201d within the meaning of rule 56(c) or within the meaning of Mass.R.A.P. 8(a), as appearing in 378 Mass. 932 (1979). Second, there is no statement of the proceedings prepared by the judge (contrast <em>White </em>v. <em>Peabody Constr. Co., </em>386 Mass. 121, 124, 126 [1982]) or approved by him under Mass.R.A.P. 8(c), as appearing in 378 Mass. 933 (1979), which tells us that he did consider any of the documents. Finally, it is clear from the form of the judgment, which was expressly approved by the judge (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 58[a][2], as amended, 371 Mass. 908 [1977]), that this case was not decided under rule 56(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\"> Accordingly, there is no occasion to consider whether the motions filed by the defendant in this court to enlarge the \u201crecord appendix\u201d should be construed as motions under Mass.R.A.P. 8(e), as appearing in 378 Mass. 934 (1979), to expand the record to include matters which have been omitted therefrom by error or accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
