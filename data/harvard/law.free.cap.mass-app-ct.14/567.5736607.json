L. c. 265, \u00a7 13) is without merit. There was evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">The decedent\u2019s girlfriend visited the apartment of the decedent Thomas Brown on the evening of March 20, 1979. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Brown was lying on the floor breathing erratically; his lips were turning blue. The defendant informed her that Brown \u201chad done some Dilaudid.\u201d The girlfriend could not wake Brown up, and she, the defendant and a third person moved him to his bed. After the third person left, she became concerned about Brown\u2019s condition and called her brother, a technician at a hospital. Following that conversation, she started to call an ambulance, but the defendant \u201cbodily shoved [her] away from the phone, took it from [her],\u201d and threatened to kill her if she attempted to obtain help. He stated that \u201che didn\u2019t want any police or anything because he had a long narcotics record and he had drugs on him and a syringe and he didn\u2019t want anyone around him.\u201d The defendant also stated that he would watch the decedent and take care of him. Brown\u2019s girlfriend left. When she returned the next morning, she found Brown dead. The medical examiner testified that the cause of death was \u201cabuse of alcohol and Dilaudid,\u201d and another medical expert testified that Brown could have \u201cbeen saved\u201d had he obtained medical help earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">While the law does not, except in special circumstances, impose a duty on bystanders to take action to preserve the life of another, see generally LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law 183-186 (1972), here the defendant by his conduct increased the danger of harm to Brown. Although medical assistance was urgently needed, he bodily prevented the decedent\u2019s girlfriend from procuring aid and threatened to kill her if she persisted in that endeavor. We have no doubt that such conduct is wanton and reckless as defined in our cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 397-401 (1944). See also <em>Flippo </em>v. <em>State, </em>258 Ark. 233, 238 (1975), upholding a conviction of manslaughter where the defendant\u2019s delay in obtaining help \u201ccaused the helpless victim to be secluded . . . awaiting the promised aid and prevented others from rendering timely aid\u201d; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 F.2d 307, 310 (D.C. Cir. 1962). Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 326 (1965) (\u201cOne who intentionally prevents a third person from giving to another aid nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>essary to prevent physical harm to him, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the other by the absence of the aid which he has prevented the third person from giving\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention that his statement that \u201che had a long narcotics record\u201d was inadmissible fails to recognize that the statement was relevant to the defendant\u2019s motive for not wanting persons who could render help to appear on the scene, and, hence, was admissible in the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chalifoux, </em>362 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 462-463 (1981). Having failed to request a limiting instruction \u201cto protect himself against any prejudice he perceived,\u201d the defendant cannot complain that the judge, on his own, failed to instruct the jury as to the purpose for which the evidence was offered. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 269-270 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-15\"> The defendant also appeals from his convictions of unlawful possession of a hypodermic needle and unlawful possession of a class B controlled substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
