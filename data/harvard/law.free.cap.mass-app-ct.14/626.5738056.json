(YDP), alleging that she was wrongfully discharged in that she was not afforded procedural due process as required under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution provides in part that \u201c[n]o State shall. . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The heart of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is that YDP, a private corporation, is associated with the Springfield Division of the Juvenile Court Department of the Trial Court (Juvenile Court) in such a close and continuing fashion that its action in discharging her is fairly attributable to the State, and therefore she is owed due process. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 299 (1966) (\u201c[C]onduct that is formally private may be so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character as to become subject to the constitutional limitations placed upon [S]tate action\u201d). See also <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 939-942 (1982); <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 839-843 (1982). The plaintiff seeks reinstatement to the position from which she was discharged, compensation for the time she was unemployed, reimbursement for health insurance payments, damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and attorney\u2019s fees. In reply, the defendant argues that YDP is an independent contractor and that its action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>firing the plaintiff was merely private conduct which is not subject to due process requirements. <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Kraemer, </em>334 U.S. 1, 13 (1948) (\u201c[T]he principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. The Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful\u201d). See also <em>Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3 (1883); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345 (1974); <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 839-843.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The case was tried before a judge, sitting without a jury, who ruled that the defendant\u2019s action in firing the plaintiff constituted State action, and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later the judge filed supplemental findings to the effect that the plaintiff\u2019s communications were constitutionally protected and which also established the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. An amended judgment was entered and the defendant appeals from that judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have before us a transcript of the evidence that accompanied the judge\u2019s findings of fact. We accept his findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>unless clearly erroneous. Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). We note that the trial judge, at the time he made his findings, did not have the benefit of the trilogy of recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court that involve the problem of State action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, it is necessary for us, at times, to make our own findings on certain points. Our findings, however, do not depend on the credibility of witnesses; they are based on documentary evidence, i.e., the articles of organization and the by-laws of YDP, and the written contract between YDP and the Commonwealth. We now summarize the relevant facts, including the history of YDP and its relationship with the Juvenile Court, as well as the events which culminated in the discharge of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">1. <em>History and function of YDP. </em>In 1971, the plaintiff was hired by the Juvenile Court as a social worker and was assigned to its intensive juvenile probation program. This program, not statutorily mandated, was financed by the Governor\u2019s Committee on Criminal Justice,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and was concerned with broadening the alternatives available to juveniles on probation. In 1972, in order to increase its financial flexibility, the program was incorporated as YDP under G. L. c. 180. The purposes of the corporation as detailed in its articles of organization were: (1) \u201c [t]o provide individual and group counseling, recreational and educational program^] for those children referred to it by the Springfield Juvenile Court and by duly organized and established organizations seeking its service[s]\u201d; and (2) \u201c[t]o help facilitate communication between various institutions dealing with youth, such as the police, courts, schools and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>social agencies, and to broaden the awareness and understanding of the general community regarding the unique problems of youth, and to do all things incidental or convenient to carry out these purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The various functions of the staff of YDP were substantially the same after incorporation as before. The sole institutional client was the Juvenile Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Juveniles were referred to YDP by Juvenile Court probation officers, who recommended the types of services they desired the juveniles to receive from the staff. Staff members would screen the referrals and determine whether a juvenile could benefit from YDP services. In addition to intensive individual and group counseling, the services consisted of an alternative classroom for junior high school juveniles, a volunteer program matching people in the community with probationers, and a recreational activities program.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">2. <em>The corporate organization of YDP. </em>Of the seven original incorporators of YDP, five were employees of the Juvenile Court. They included the judge, the clerk, and assistant clerk, as well as the chief probation officer and the assistant chief probation officer. Under the by-laws, the sole duty of the incorporators was to elect persons to the board of directors. At the time of the discharge of the plaintiff, there were nine directors, of which three were employees of the Juvenile Court, including the chief probation officer, her assistant, and the assistant clerk. The business of the corporation was managed by the board of directors. The by-laws provided that the \u201cIntensive Probation Program will be subject, in all phases, to the final approval of the presiding justice of the Springfield Juvenile Court[,] which will include policy, programming, and personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">3. <em>Financing of YDP. </em>In January, 1977, the Hampden County commissioners entered into a contract with YDP whereby the latter provided intensive juvenile probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>services to the Juvenile Court. The contract was terminated on June 30, 1979, because of the takeover of court costs by the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 29A, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 12. Until that date, YDP was funded solely by Hampden County, and during the covered period the employees of YDP received their paychecks and W-2 forms from the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In early 1979, the board of directors anticipated the takeover by the Commonwealth of court costs and started to negotiate a contract with the Commonwealth. They were successful, and financing for YDP\u2019s program was included as a line item in the Commonwealth\u2019s budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1979, which was signed by the Governor on July 19 of that year. After July 1, 1979, YDP was exclusively funded by the Commonwealth for each fiscal year. All salaries were disbursed from and administered through the office of the State Treasurer. Tax withholding forms for the staff of YDP were received from the State, but bore the notation \u201cnon-employee. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">4. <em>YDP\u2019s contract with the State. </em>Although State financing was secured in July, 1979, YDP\u2019s contract with the Commonwealth was not executed until October 11, 1979. The contract is of considerable significance because the judge relied on certain clauses of the contract in holding that there was State control.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge found that \u201c[t]he contract is replete with instances of domination by and requirements of cooperation with the [c]ourt.\u201d In order to show \u201cdomination\u201d of YDP by the State, the judge quoted clauses wherein YDP agreed to \u201ccooperate administratively with all other programs and entities that provide services to the [j]udicial [b]ranch\u201d and to \u201cbe available to meet with and work out schedules with the presiding justice [of the Juvenile Court]\u201d and \u201ccooperate with the [administrative [o]ffice and [j]ustices of the Trial Court.\u201d In addition, the judge noted that the contract required quarterly statistical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>and financial reports to the administrative office and that YDP had to establish a satisfactory accounting system.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The only finding of the judge concerning personnel matters was that under the contract YDP had to follow \u201c[certain hiring practices.\u201d Because the judge did not have the benefit of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830 (1982), <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922 (1982), and <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991 (1982), he did not make any further findings regarding the degree of control over YDP personnel that was granted to the Commonwealth by the contract. We note that the contract states that YDP must \u201cpublicly advertise any position which becomes available as a result of this [contract].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> YDP was responsible for the \u201cdaily supervision of the program\u201d and \u201cfor the competency of all personnel employed or assigned under\u201d the contract \u201cand [must] evaluate the background and experience of said personnel.\u201d YDP was required to \u201ckeep on file the names, addresses, and description of experience and background of members of its staff.\u201d Also YDP was required to \u201cprovide information of any change in personnel hired by or associated with [YDP]\u201d in connection with the contract. Finally, in two places in the agreement, YDP agreed \u201cto provide personnel and necessary supporting services in accordance with\u201d the contract. We note that nothing in the contract gave to the Commonwealth the right to hire or fire personnel. The contract was executed on October 11, 1979, by the Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court and Samuel A. Marsella, president of YDP, for that organization. Mr. Marsella is an attorney engaged in private practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">5. <em>The discharge of the plaintiff. </em>Following the incorporation of YDP in 1972, the plaintiff and all her immediate coworkers in the intensive juvenile probation program were transferred to the new corporation. At that time, the Juvenile Court judge gave the plaintiff and her coworkers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the oath as deputy probation officers of the Juvenile Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During her tenure as an employee of YDP until October, 1979, the plaintiff was never reprimanded or disciplined for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">During the spring of 1979, the board of directors entered into contract negotiations with the Commonwealth. Because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, the staff, including the plaintiff, was admonished not to engage in independent lobbying activities. The board of directors and the program director informed the staff on several occasions that they alone would participate in lobbying and negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Although financing for YDP\u2019s program was included as a line item in the Commonwealth\u2019s budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1979, the budget was not signed until July 19, 1979, and the contract was not executed until October 11, 1979. Consequently, no compensation checks from the Commonwealth were forthcoming by the end of July, 1979. To fill the void, the treasurer of YDP personally borrowed and advanced money to the staff for July salaries with the understanding that the money would be repaid upon receipt of the July salary checks. On August 20, 1979, the staff was informed that a contract still had not been signed and that the Commonwealth might not issue the checks until sometime in October.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The prospect of delayed payments caused the plaintiff to anticipate personal financial problems. She sought out one Burnett, president of a local bank, to discuss the possibility of a loan to cover her expenses while her salary payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>were interrupted. She explained to Burnett her financial problems and the cause of them. Burnett informed the plaintiff that he would have to investigate YDP\u2019s situation because he wanted to be assured that the plaintiff would be in a position to repay the loan if it was granted by the bank. He indicated that he knew State Senator Alan Sisitsky and that he would communicate with the Senator\u2019s office for the information. He also indicated his personal displeasure with a situation which forced someone like the plaintiff to borrow money while awaiting pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Burnett called Senator Sisitsky\u2019s office, but because he had few of the details which the Senator\u2019s aides needed in order to check on the funding question, he called the plaintiff and requested that she submit a memorandum to him outlining the situation in regard to the delay of YDP\u2019s contract. On August 24, 1979, the plaintiff responded with a memorandum that was factual, but which reflected her frustration and partisan concern. Burnett, in turn, sent the memorandum directly to the Senator, accompanied by a handwritten indignant note asking the Senator to look into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On September 18 or 19, 1979, as a result of a communication from the director of YDP, the plaintiff discovered for the first time that Burnett had written to Senator Sisitsky. On September 27, six of the nine directors met, and five voted to discharge the plaintiff. Two of those six directors were employees of the Juvenile Court, one of whom abstained from voting. On October 4, the plaintiff met with the director and Mr. Marsella and was informed by Mr. Marsella that she was being discharged because of insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The plaintiff returned that afternoon with her attorney, intending to meet with the board of directors. However, the five directors who met that afternoon did so as the personnel committee, not as the board of directors. At that meeting the plaintiff was informed that her involvement in \u201cfacilitating\u201d Burnett\u2019s letter to Sisitsky was deemed to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>stitute lobbying which was insubordinate behavior on her part and was in conflict with the board\u2019s stated policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Counsel for the plaintiff requested a hearing before the full board. Mr. Marsella indicated that he would not change his vote in favor of the plaintiff, but left the decision whether to attend a meeting of the full board to the plaintiff. The plaintiff opted not to pursue the matter further before the full board but brought this action instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Our inquiry is not directed in the first instance to whether the plaintiff was discharged because of speech or conduct protected by the Constitution, or without adequate due process, but rather to the question whether the challenged conduct of YDP, a private corporation, in discharging the plaintiff can fairly be seen as State action. If the conduct of YDP is not State action, our inquiry ends. <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The trial judge found that the discharge of the plaintiff by YDP constituted State action because (1) YDP performed a public function; (2) YDP\u2019s entire budget was obtained from the Commonwealth; and (3) YDP was subject to extensive control by the Commonwealth as a result of its contract. As stated before, the judge did not have the benefit, as we do, of the trilogy of cases decided by the United States Supreme Court after judgment was entered in this case. Based on the analysis found in those cases, and particularly in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830 (1982), we find there was no State action in the discharge of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The trial judge ruled that YDP performed a public function in that it provided services \u201cdirectly related to and dependent upon the Springfield Juvenile Court and its administration of justice.\u201d The relevant question, however, is not whether a private group is serving a \u201cpublic function\u201d but \u201cwhether the function performed has been \u2018traditionally the <em>exclusive </em>prerogative of the State\u2019\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 842 (quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. at 353). The services provided by YDP, i.e., individual and group counselling, and the furnishing of recreational and educational programs to juvenile probationers, have not traditionally been the exclusive province of the Commonwealth. Churches, private schools, civic groups, Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs, the YMCA and YWCA, and other private groups have been providing similar services to troubled youths for well over a century. The establishment and the maintenance of a juvenile probation system is undoubtedly a traditional function of government. There is, however, no statute or State regulation that requires a court to establish an intensive probation program or to provide the type of services that are rendered by YDP. See <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 842; <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. at 1011. The fact that YDP\u2019s clients are referred by the Juvenile Court does not make the discharge decision State action. See <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 832-833, 842 (maladjusted children referred to private schools under G. L. c. 71B by city or town school committees or State agency). The oath taken by the plaintiff and other employees of YDP as deputy probation officers does not make the discharge of the plaintiff State action. The plaintiff was not paid as a probation officer, nor did she, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the relevant statute, perform duties similar to those of regular Juvenile Court probation officers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The trial judge found that the entire budget of YDP was obtained from the Commonwealth, and this finding was an element in his determination that the decision to discharge the plaintiff was State action. In regard to this point, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that \u201cnear-complete governmental funding does not turn a private charitable and educational institution into a public entity so long as the private institution remains free, in fact, to control its own affairs.\u201d <em>Bello </em>v. <em>South Shore Hospital, </em>384 Mass. 770, 776 (1981), quoting with approval <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>641 F.2d 14, 25 (1st Cir. 1981). See also <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 841-842. The fact that the Juvenile Court was the sole source of referrals and that YDP received 100% financing from the Commonwealth does not by itself make the discharge of the plaintiff State action. <em>Ibid. </em>(\u201cThe school... is not fundamentally different from many private corporations whose business depends primarily on contracts to build roads, bridges, dams, ships, or submarines for the government. Acts of such private contractors do not become acts of the government by reason of their significant or even total engagement in performing public contracts\u201d) .</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The trial judge found that YDP was subject to extensive control by the Commonwealth as a result of its contract, and this finding was another element in his decision that State action was present in the decision to discharge the plaintiff. The United States Supreme Court, however, in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 841-842, and <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Yaretsky, supra </em>at 1010-1011, noted that the school in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and the nursing home in <em>Blum </em>were the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>jects of extensive regulations by the State but found no State action. In this case, it was not found, nor indeed alleged, that the decision to discharge the plaintiff was itself based on the contract or some rule of conduct or policy promulgated by the Commonwealth. <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 842-843. From reading the contract, it is readily apparent that the Commonwealth had little interest in YDP\u2019s personnel matters and left the decisions of hiring and firing personnel to YDP.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The decision to discharge the plaintiff was made by the board of directors. There was no finding by the trial judge, nor any evidence, that the Juvenile Court judge participated in any way in the decision to discharge the plaintiff. The requirement in the by-laws that \u201cthe Intensive Probation Program will be subject, in all phases, to the final approval of the presiding justice of the Springfield Juvenile Court[,] which will include . . . personnel\u201d refers to the hiring of personnel and not to discharge decisions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In sum, the plaintiff has failed to show that \u201cthere is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the [private corporation] so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. at 351. <em>Bello </em>v. <em>South Shore Hosp., </em>384 Mass, at 776. The contract with the Commonwealth did not require YDP to discharge the plaintiff, and where YDP retained control over personnel matters the decision by the board of directors to discharge was not State action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The plaintiff asserts that the relationship between YDP and the Commonwealth is mutually beneficial or \u201csymbiotic\u201d and, therefore, the Commonwealth must be \u201crecognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity.\u201d <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Wilmington Parking Authy., </em>365 U.S. 715, 725 (1961). Although YDP\u2019s funding and function show a relationship of close cooperation with the Commonwealth, the broad range of independent discretion which, under the contract, the board of directors appears to possess, especially in personnel matters, \u201cbeliefs] the notion of [S]tote domination.\u201d <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>641 F.2d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In the memorandum of law filed by the plaintiff after the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830 (1982), the plaintiff argued that if this court finds no State action, the case should be remanded to the trial judge because he made no findings as to count 3 of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. That count alleged the plaintiff\u2019s discharge constituted a breach of the implied condition of good faith and fair dealing contained in the plaintiff\u2019s employment contract. We note, however, that the plaintiff did not allege in her complaint, nor did she introduce any evidence to the effect, that she was discharged in order to prevent her from obtaining compensation that was related to her past service. Thus, this case does not fall within the line of cases illustrated by <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96, 104-105 (1977), <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., 385 </em>Mass. 300, 303 (1982), and <em>Maddaloni </em>v. <em>Western Mass. Bus Lines, </em>386 Mass. 877, 881 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The judgment is reversed and a new judgment is to enter dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-5\"> Plaintiff asserts in her brief that the action is brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1970), which prohibits interference with Federal rights \u201cunder color of\u201d State law. A person may bring an action under \u00a7 1983 in a State court, <em>Rzeznik </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Southampton, </em>374 Mass. 475, 484 (1978) (\u201cBecause neither \u00a7 1983 nor its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U.S.C. 1343 [1970], vests exclusive jurisdiction over civil rights cases in the Federal courts, a grant of concurrent jurisdiction in the State courts is presumed\u201d). However, the plaintiff failed to allege all of the necessary elements of a \u00a7 1983 claim in her complaint; nor did she specifically refer to the statute in her pleadings, as is the \u201cpreferable course.\u201d See <em>Rzeznik </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Southampton, </em>374 Mass. at 484 n.8. Nevertheless, to find the requisite \u201cState action\u201d at issue in this case, our analysis is identical under either the Fourteenth Amendment or \u00a7 1983. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>383 U.S. 787, 794 n.7 (1966); <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 930-932 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 111, inserted by St. 1979, c. 801, \u00a7 1, approved November 16, 1979, which provides a private right of action for a violation of constitutional rights, was not in effect at the time plaintiff was fired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> The judge found for the defendant on the count for intentional infliction of emotional distress. \u201cCompensatory\u201d damages were granted, however, for an alleged violation of the plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> On February 12, 1981, after the briefs had been filed in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit decided the case of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>641 F.2d 14 (1st Cir. 1981). Both parties recognized that <em>Rendell-Baker </em>was a key case with respect to State action and accordingly devoted a considerable portion of their oral arguments to discussing its effect on the decision in this case. While this opinion was being prepared, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in <em>Rendell-Baker. </em>It was the belief of the members of the panel that this decision should be postponed until the Supreme Court decided <em>Rendell-Baker </em>because that decision would clearly have significant bearing on the critical issue of State action in this case. Counsel for both parties were notified that the decision in this case would be late. The Supreme Court affirmed the First Circuit Court of Appeals on June 25, 1982. <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 830.

The facts showed that in recent years nearly all of the students had been referred to the school by city school committees under G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7\u00a7 3 &amp; 4, or by a State agency. At least ninety percent of the school budget was paid out of public funds. In order to be eligible for tuition funding under the statute, the school had to comply with a variety of State regulations.

There has been a significant trend in recent years towards cutting back on the direct provision of social services by the Commonwealth in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>of contracting out such services to private providers. The trend is an outgrowth of a widespread perception that direct governmental provision of services is apt to be cost-ineffective because of built-in rigidities in the State personnel system \u2014 tenure laws, civil service laws, due process requirements, and the like \u2014 which give private enterprise an advantage in flexibility of response to changing conditions. Whether that perception is valid or not, the Legislature has elected over the last decade to provide many social services on the contract-out model in the expectation that the services could in that manner be provided at lower cost, and to the extent that we find \u201cState action\u201d in the activities of the contracting providers we tend to defeat the realization of that goal by reintroducing the very inflexibilities in the hiring and firing of personnel that the Legislature sought to avoid. I doubt very much that the employees of the myriad private social-service providers think of themselves as being entitled to the various due process and tenure benefits of Commonwealth employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It is difficult to know precisely where the <em>Rendell-Baker </em>case, 457 U.S. 830 (1982), and its companion cases (see <em>infra) </em>have left this area of the law; none was unanimous, and there was a different spokesman for the majority in each. It is easy, however, to sense that the three cases mark a significant shift in the direction of shrinking the concept of State action and that it will no longer suffice merely to find a closeness or \u201cnexus\u201d between the State and the contracting corporation which will bring all the corporation\u2019s personnel decisions within the broad sweep of \u201cState action.\u201d Rather, as Justice Smith indicates, the relevant inquiry seems now to be whether the particular action complained of \u2014 in this case the discharge of the plaintiff \u2014 is the product of a State \u201crule of conduct or policy,\u201d <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 844 (1982) (White, J., concurring), or was made \u201cin concert with [SJtate actors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838 n.6 (majority opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">There is no suggestion in this case that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge resulted from some rule of conduct or policy pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>mulgated by the State. The aspect of the case that most gives one pause is the fact that three of the nine members of YDP\u2019s board of directors and one of the five who voted for the discharge were employees in the Springfield Juvenile Court. That fact is, in my opinion, not analytically relevant to the determination whether the discharge decision was \u201cState action,\u201d because there is no suggestion in the record that any of the three acted in his capacity as a State employee in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s discharge. Case illustrating the relevant analysis of cases involving State actors are discussed in note 6 (at 838) of the <em>Rendell-Baker </em>opinion. To carry the analysis beyond the scope of those cases would portend the possibility that the mere presence of State employees on a board of trustees of a charitable corporation having significant contracts with the State (such as the hospital in <em>Bello </em>v. <em>South Shore Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 770 [1981]) would bring the personnel actions of the board within the sphere of \u201cState action.\u201d Such would be to extend the concept of State action considerably beyond the outermost frontiers of the decided Federal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">It is worth mentioning that the very closeness of the relationship between the Springfield Juvenile Court and the board of YDP may be suspect under State law. The problem arises from the court\u2019s role in engaging the services of a provider whose board of directors includes employees of the court, those employees standing in a position, arguably, to influence the court\u2019s decision whether to utilize the services of YDP in particular cases. There is no suggestion here of possible violations other than technical in nature (the members of the board apparently receive no compensation from YDP), but the application of the Conflict of Interest Law does not necessarily turn on the presence of absence of a personal financial interest, direct or indirect. See, e.g., G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 <em>6(a), </em>inserted by St. 1962, c. 779, \u00a7 1 (\u201c[A]ny [S]tote employee who participates as such employee in a particular matter in which to his knowledge ... a business organization in which he is serving as . . . director . . . has a financial interest . . . shall be punished . . .\u201d). Cf. G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>c. 268A, \u00a7 4(c). State law favors (if it does not mandate) arm\u2019s-length dealings in the making of contracts between agencies of the Commonwealth and providers of services, suggesting that the safer course might be for employees of the Springfield Juvenile Court to sever their connection with the board of YDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Actions taken by a State officer may be \u201cState action\u201d notwithstanding that those actions violate State policy, see <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 933 (1982), but here it seems clear that the action of the court employee who voted as a member of the YDP board to discharge the plaintiff was not taken in his capacity as an employee of the Commonwealth and was not guided or encouraged by any rule, decision, or policy of the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the discharge decision was not action by the Commonwealth, and for that reason I concur in the opinion of Justice Smith.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b662-6\">Greaney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFj\">(dissenting). There is ample support for the conclusion that Ms. Phillips has been discharged in violation of her rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and arts. 12 and 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority hold, however, that the judgment must be reversed because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the defendant\u2019s decision to discharge Ms. Phillips cannot be attributed to the State. In my view, the defendant\u2019s performance of a public function and the substantial involvement of the State, through the Springfield Juvenile Court, in its affairs establish \u201ca sufficiently close nexus between the State and the [defendant\u2019s] challenged action ... so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351 (1974). See <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 299 (1966); <em>Moose Lodge No. 107 </em>v. <em>Irvis, </em>407 U.S. 163, 175 (1972); <em>Flagg Bros. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 157 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The critical facts merit restatement. Ms. Phillips was hired as an employee of the Springfield Juvenile Court and assigned to the court\u2019s \u201cintensive juvenile probation program\u201d (program), directed by the court\u2019s assistant chief probation officer. The defendant\u2019s incorporation in 1972, under G. L. c. 180, was expressly approved by the Juvenile Court judge and several court officials. The court had significant representation on the defendant\u2019s board of directors thereafter. After incorporation, Ms. Phillips and others were transferred to the defendant\u2019s staff and sworn, under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 89A, as deputy probation officers. The defendant\u2019s staff was permitted to use a letterhead bearing the Commonwealth\u2019s seal and the words \u201cSpringfield Juvenile Court \u2014 Intensive Probation Program.\u201d On its left side the letterhead listed the names of the Juvenile Court judge and other court officials; and on the right side the names of the defendant\u2019s supervisory staff. Staff members also carried business cards with the Commonwealth\u2019s seal, identifying the program as part of the \u201cTrial Court of the Commonwealth \u2014 Juvenile Court Department, Springfield Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Prior to July 1, 1979, the effective date of the Court Reorganization Act, the defendant was exclusively funded by the county of Hampden under a written agreement with the county commissioners. This agreement named the defendant the exclusive provider for the intensive juvenile probation needs of the Springfield Juvenile Court. During this period, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Ms. Phillips was paid by checks issued by the county treasurer\u2019s office, and she received annual wage and tax statements (W-2\u2019s) which identified her as a county employee. After the implementation of court reorganization, the defendant was exclusively funded by the Commonwealth. Ms. Phillips was thereafter paid by checks of the Commonwealth, issued by the State Treasurer\u2019s office. Deductions were made for insurance but not under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA). The W-2 statements identify the Commonwealth as Ms. Phillips\u2019 \u201cemployer,\u201d but also bear the notation \u201cnon-employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In a document depicting the court\u2019s activities and functions, the defendant\u2019s probation program is listed as acting under the direct aegis of the Juvenile Court judge; its internal policy documents are replete with references to the court. At all relevant times, the defendant supplied services to the court pursuant to a written contract with the office of the Chief Administrative Justice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That office required Ms. Phillips to complete an \u201cEmployee Position Evaluation Questionnaire\u201d for the \u201cTrial Court Department \u2014 Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The vote to discharge Ms. Phillips occurred at a meeting of six directors, two of whom were court employees. One of these officials voted to discharge her. (The other abstained from voting.) Under the defendant\u2019s by-laws, five votes were necessary to discharge an employee. The purported ground for termination was insubordination. At all rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>vont times, the by-laws contained a further provision that the activities of the \u201cIntensive Probation Program will be subject, in all phases, to the final approval of the presiding justice of the Springfield Juvenile Court[,] which will include policy, programming, and personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The majority appear to construe <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830 (1982), as requiring separate analysis of each indication of State action. That analysis fails to evaluate the <em>aggregate </em>of all the circumstances bearing on the question in light of established Federal precedents, none of which was changed by the <em>Rendell-Baker </em>decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\"><em>Rendell-Baker </em>enumerates four general principles. First, the receipt by a private enterprise of a large amount of public funding <em>alone </em>will not constitute a legally tenable basis for finding State action. <em>Id. </em>at 840-841. Second, extensive general regulation of that enterprise by the State similarly will not be sufficient by itself to make the State responsible for actions taken by the enterprise, especially where the particular transaction is of a type not heavily burdened by regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 841-842. Third, the enterprise\u2019s performance of a public function, i.e., a function which has been \u201ctraditionally exclusively reserved to the State,\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. at 352, continues to be a significant indication that the State has cloaked the enterprise with its authority. <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>at 842. Fourth, where a \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d exists between the State and the enterprise, so that the two may be engaged in a mutually beneficial combination, the actions of the enterprise may reasonably be attributed to the State. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>842-843. See <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Wilmington Parking Authy., </em>365 U.S. 715, 723-724 (1961).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Here the facts substantially support the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s probation program was designed to be, and at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal was, an integral part of the Springfield Juvenile Court, an admitted agency of the State. There is no assertion that any action taken by court officials contravened their authority. The program was established under the authority of the Juvenile Court judge, exclusively served the court, and employed staff who were hired by the judge and were paid directly from the State Treasurer\u2019s office. The staff used court materials which, on their face, conveyed the clear impression that the defendant\u2019s employees were acting as officers of the Juvenile Court. Supervisory court employees held three seats on the defendant\u2019s board of directors, while the Juvenile Court judge retained express approval power over matters of \u201cpolicy, programming and personnel.\u201d I can find no evidence that the program\u2019s public characteristics were dissipated by incorporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, I find a close, working partnership between the Juvenile Court and the defendant in which the latter\u2019s freedom of decision making was circumscribed by State officers of the Juvenile Court who possessed, and exercised, the power to approve its staffing, policies, and operating methodology.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The defendant\u2019s probation activities also meet the public function test stated in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. at 352, and reemphasized as a critical indicator of State action in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 842. The facts stressed by the majority on this issue \u2014 that other civic and charitable organizations provide help to troubled youths and that \u201cno statute or State regulation . . . requires a court to establish an intensive probation program\u201d \u2014 are of little relevance. There is no question, as the majority concede, that the maintenance of a juvenile probation system is a traditional and required function of State government. And the long standing view of probation in this area has always been that youthful offenders should be treated \u201cnot as criminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53. See <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 648, 651-652 (1959). The trial judge found that the defendant\u2019s \u201cservices when not identical to, complement the service[s] of the Juvenile Court Probation Department as . . . provided for in [G. L. c.] 119, [ \u00a7\u00a7] 57 to 59, 62, 67 and 68.\u201d If the defendant did not exist, the supervision it provided to youthful offenders on probation would be assumed by the Juvenile Court\u2019s probation officers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s program, viewed in light of the enumerated statutes, indicates that the defendant fulfilled obligations which are traditionally performed by the probation office of a Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It is in this factual context that the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s funding take on significance. As the <em>Rendell</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Baker </em>decision points out, the grant of funds by the State alone will not make an enterprise a State actor. Here, however, the State went considerably beyond the mere provision of funding. It provided for payment of the defendant\u2019s staff by the State Treasurer in a manner consistent with State employment (i.e. a deduction for insurance and no FIGA deduction). In the absence of the characteristics usually found in a relationship with an independent contractor,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s complete financial dependence on the State and the latter\u2019s disbursement of its funds buttresses the conclusion that the government had become more than superficially involved in the defendant\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s ruling that the decision to discharge was solely the decision of a private contractor. As previously noted, the defendant\u2019s personnel matters were subject to broad control by the Juvenile Court judge. The discharge was occasioned by publicity bearing on the defendant\u2019s providing probation services pending receipt of State funding, an issue of obvious and vital concern to both the Juvenile Court and the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The critical fifth vote necessary under the defendant\u2019s by-laws to discharge Ms. Phillips was supplied by a State officer. To the extent relevant, the \u201csymbiotic relationship\u201d between the two entities made the employment decision, for all practical purposes, one \u201cbased upon [a] rule of conduct. . . put forth by the State [i.e., the Juvenile Court].\u201d Furthermore, I see no reasonable support in the record for the majority\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>clusion that the Juvenile Court judge\u2019s reserved power over personnel decisions applied exclusively to hiring. The fact that Ms. Phillips did not seek the judge\u2019s intervention to reverse her discharge would not warrant such an inference in view of the esoteric nature of the by-laws, the peremptory manner in which the discharge took place, and the virtual absence of notice of her rights of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">I thus conclude that the defendant is quite unlike the private contractor who \u201cdepends primarily on contracts to build roads, bridges, dams, ships, or submarines for the government.\u201d <em>Rendell-Baker </em>v. <em>Kohn, </em>457 U.S. at 841. I see no reason to fear that finding State action here will expose the State to unjustified liability or hamper its operations. I suspect the present situation is quite peculiar and that the usual social-services contracts between the State and other private agencies are of the sort scrutinized in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and described in the concurrence of Justice Armstrong. In these contracts some funding and general regulation by the State typically will be involved, but the existence of a true, easily ascertainable independent contractor relationship will relieve the State from any liability for the agency\u2019s actions. In the absence of a finding that anything done here was unauthorized, the bonds tying the defendant and the Juvenile Court together for a mutually beneficial purpose warrant a conclusion that the requisite State action existed. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> Ms. Phillips would not have been discharged had she not complied with the banker\u2019s request. Compare <em>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 285-287 (1977). Although her written communication to the banker might have been critical of the defendant, her interest in free expression clearly outweighed the defendant\u2019s interest in maintaining the efficiency of its programs by avoiding employee comment on its budget. See <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968). Her communications were no less protected because they were intended for the ears of the banker alone. <em>Givhan </em>v. <em>Western Line Consol. Sch. Dist., </em>439 U.S. 410, 414 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The defendant also failed to provide due process in connection with the discharge. The proceedings were peremptory in nature and lacked any meaningful opportunity for Ms. Phillips to show that she had not been insubordinate. The procedure followed failed to comport with minimum due process standards. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 267-268 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> The contract required, among other things, that the defendant (a) cooperate with the office of the Chief Administrative Justice of the Trial Court and Trial Court judges and work out schedules with the presiding justice of the Springfield Juvenile Court; (b) maintain and provide specified information to the office of the Chief Administrative Justice concerning personnel; (c) file quarterly statistical reports with that office; (d) cooperate administratively with all other programs and entities providing services to the judicial branch of the government; and (e) provide personnel and supportive services in keeping with the budget incorporated in the contract. The Chief Administrative Justice had the right to terminate the contract and to suspend payments upon any failure by the defendant to comply with its obligations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\"> It should be noted that the facts in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>differ significantly from the facts here. The school which employed Ms. Rendell-Baker was a private institution managed by a board of directors, none of whom were public officials or chosen by public officials. The only substantial connection with the State was the receipt of public funds. Its educational services were not those traditionally provided by the State. Most of the indicia of State action present in this case and discussed <em>infra </em>were absent. There are similar fundamental factual differences in <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922 (1982), and <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991 (1982), the cases decided with the <em>Rendell-Baker </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-6\"> <em>Rendell-Baker </em>neither overruled any existing United States Supreme Court precedent, nor purported to limit the principles set out in cases such as <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Wilmington Parking Authy., supra, </em>and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Edison Co., supra. Rendell-Baker </em>essentially sought to restrict the trend which had developed in several of the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal to find State action by virtue of the private enterprise\u2019s receipt of public funding or to fasten liability on the State by misapplying the public function test. Significantly, it left these latter tests intact as standards for determining the presence of State action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\"> The evidence establishes, as the majority note, that the \u201cvarious functions of the staff of [the defendant] were substantially the same after incorporation as before,\u201d and it is uncontroverted that incorporation was a device to facilitate the receipt of contributions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> The Juvenile Court judge exercised this power by approving Ms. Phillips\u2019 hiring, participating in the defendant\u2019s incorporation, permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>court employees to serve on its board, approving its policies, appointing members of its staff to the post of deputy probation officers, and permitting the use of court letterheads and business cards.</p>\n<p id=\"AyL\">I give no special weight to the defendant\u2019s contract with the office of the Chief Administrative Justice.
