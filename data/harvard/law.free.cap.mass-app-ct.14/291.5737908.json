(Kalil), brought an action against Babb for damages arising out of its purchase of allegedly defective bakery machinery from Babb, which in turn, caused a complaint for indemnification to be served upon the manufacturer, A. M. Manufacturing Company (A.M.). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 14(a), 365 Mass. 760 (1974). A.M., a nonresident, moved to dismiss Babb\u2019s third-party complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). The motion was allowed, and judgment entered in accordance with Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974). Babb appeals and argues that Massachusetts has personal jurisdiction over A.M. because A.M. has transacted business and has contracted to supply services or things in Massachusetts. G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3(c) and <em>(b). </em>We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In moving to dismiss Babb\u2019s third-party complaint, A.M. submitted an affidavit signed by its president and sole shareholder, one Harold Atwood, who set out the following facts. At the time of the sale of the machinery to Kalil, A.M. \u201chad only one place of business, that being, Dolton, Illinois,\u201d it was not licensed to do business in Massachusetts, it had no salesmen or offices here, and it advertised in a nationally circulated bakery magazine. The sale in question was conducted in a manner consistent with A.M.\u2019s \u201cgeneral practice,\u201d that is, \u201cthe equipment was shipped directly to C.H Babb Co., Inc. by public carrier, F.O.B. Dolton, Illinois.\u201d Atwood further stated that Babb was \u201can independent jobber,\u201d that \u201c[a] 11 sales are consummated and shipped in Illinois,\u201d that Babb \u201cdid not function in a representative capacity for A.M.,\u201d and that Babb \u201cis an independent business, entirely separate and apart from A.M.\u201d In addition to these specific facts, Atwood made the conclusory statements that A.M. \u201ctransacts no business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d and that A.M. has no \u201cdirect business contact with Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u201cConfronted with a motion under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (2), . . ., a plaintiff \u2018has the burden of establishing the facts upon which the question of personal jurisdiction over a defendant is to be determined.\u2019\u201d <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149, 151 (1978), quoting from <em>Nichols Associates v. Starr, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 91, 93 (1976). In support of its claim that personal jurisdiction over A.M. exists, Babb presented an affidavit prepared by its president, one William For an. He asserted that Babb had done business with A.M. since 1964, that A.M. \u201chas actively and purposefully sought the acquisition of business in Massachusetts through\u201d Babb, that A.M. had \u201cencouraged\u201d Babb\u2019s agents and employees \u201cto solicit sales\u201d of A.M.\u2019s products in Massachusetts, that A.M., \u201con a regular basis,\u201d refers potential Massachusetts customers of A.M.\u2019s products to Babb, that A.M. \u201ctransmits by mail and telephone the names of potential customers for its products in Massachusetts to [Babb] with instructions to use its best efforts to conclude a sale,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and that A.M. \u201chas initiated numerous written and telephone communications with [Babb] for the purpose of obtaining new business in Massachusetts.\u201d Foran also represented that during the sixteen-year relationship between Babb and A.M., Babb had \u201cpurchased and distributed equipment valued at approximately $926,000,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and had paid A.M. by checks drawn on Massachusetts banks. According to Foran\u2019s affidavit, Babb \u201cperforms warranty servicing for A.M. . . . products in use in Massachusetts with the approval, support and assistance of A.M.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Foran attached to his affidavit various mailings from A.M. addressed to the \u201c[attention\u201d of \u201cAll Dealers, Distributors, Jobbers and Sales Agencies\u201d and announcing new A.M. products and price listings.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Babb has controverted A.M.\u2019s affidavit, contrast <em>Nichols Associates </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. at 94-95, and the question to be decided is whether Babb has presented uncontroverted jurisdictional facts sufficient \u201cto survive due process scrutiny\u201d and \u201cto satisfy at least one of the statutory prerequisites.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1, 6 (1979). Babb relies upon \u00a7 3(a), and thus \u201c[f]or the purpose of our examination here, these considerations coalesce around the following inquiry: whether there was some minimum contact with the Commonwealth which resulted from an affirmative, intentional act of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ant, such that it is fair and reasonable to require the defendant to come into the State to defend the action.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass, at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">While the parties have collected those cases which in their views are most similar to their respective positions, \u201c [e]ach case must turn on its own facts.\u201d <em>Carlson Corp. </em>v. <em>University of Vt., </em>380 Mass. 102, 105 (1980). For a discussion of those cases wherein it was concluded that the defendants did not have sufficient contacts see <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass, at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">A.M. places principal reliance upon <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>National Seating Co., </em>411 F.Supp. 564 (D. Mass. 1976), where the court rejected a claim that the defendant was transacting business in Massachusetts within the meaning of \u00a7 3(a). That case, however, is readily distinguishable on the basis of the following facts. There the plaintiff claimed that the defendant \u201cput its goods into the \u2018stream of commerce\u2019 when it knew or ought to have known that some of them would end up in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 569. In the instant case, the goods were sent directly to Babb. See <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980) (\u201c[T]he foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum State. Rather, it is that the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there\u201d). In <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>National Seating Co., </em>411 F.Supp. at 569-570, an independent manufacturer\u2019s representative who lived in New Jersey made only an \u201coccasional passage\u201d through Massachusetts. He \u201ccontacted potential bus purchasers in the Northeast, including Massachusetts, to suggest, without soliciting or accepting orders, that these purchasers specify National Seating in their orders to bus manufacturers. \u201d Finally, \u201cNational, on an occasional and irregular basis, mailed needed spare parts directly to Massachusetts parties, requesting them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We need not repeat the jurisdictional claims set out in the affidavit submitted by Babb. It is sufficient to state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>considering the nature, extent, and continuity of A.M.\u2019s acts, we conclude that A.M. has transacted business in Massachusetts. See <em>Whittaker Corp. </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corp., </em>482 F.2d 1079, 1083 (1st Cir. 1973); <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass, at 9-10. A.M.\u2019s \u201ccontacts with the forum were deliberate and not fortuitous, such that \u2018the possible need to invoke the benefits and protections of the forum\u2019s laws was reasonably foreseeable, if not foreseen, rather than a surprise.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, quoting from <em>Product Promotions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cousteau, </em>495 F.2d 483, 496 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We do not consider the doctrine of forum non conveniens in relation to the jurisdictional question before us, because A.M. has made no assertion that it \u201cwould be unduly burdened by being required to defend this suit in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Carlson Corp. </em>v. <em>University of Vt., </em>380 Mass, at 109. See G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 5. Since we conclude that Babb has presented jurisdictional facts sufficient to survive due process scrutiny and to satisfy \u00a7 3(a), we need not consider whether jurisdiction could also be found under \u00a7 <em>3(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"> Foran further detailed that of that amount, $107,554 worth of equipment was purchased in 1978, 1979, and 1980. How much of this equipment was distributed to Massachusetts purchasers is not expressly stated. We note, however, that Atwood described A.M.\u2019s shipping practice to be direct shipment to Babb in Massachusetts, F.O.B. Dolton, Illinois. Further, Foran states in his affidavit that Babb \u201cis the exclusive distributor of A.M. products in Massachusetts.\u201d While Atwood\u2019s description of Babb as an \u201cindependent jobber\u201d would appear to contradict a distributor status, the notion of exclusivity in Massachusetts is not refuted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> Foran also related that in 1978, Babb received some financial support from A.M., when it paid a portion of Babb\u2019s expenses from a trade show at which Babb, upon A.M.\u2019s request, displayed some of A.M.\u2019s products. Foran does not state, however, whether the show was held in Massachusetts or whether Babb displayed only A.M.\u2019s products.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
