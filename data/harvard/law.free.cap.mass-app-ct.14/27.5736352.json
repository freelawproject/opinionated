The landlord had served his tenants with conversion eviction notices on or about January 30, 1980, but he did not file copies with the board in a timely manner. In September of 1980, the landlord sought the board\u2019s permission to file the copies, but the board advised him that it had no discretion in the matter and that the notices were ineffective. The landlord then brought an action in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 231A, seeking a determination that \u00a7 7(A)(2)(c) could not be applied to the property in question. The action was transferred to the Boston Housing Court (see G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 20), where the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. There being no facts in dispute, the judge concluded, and entered a judgment declaring, that \u00a7 7(A) (2) was \u201cnot validly applicable\u201d to the landlord\u2019s property at issue. We modify the judgment to declare that \u00a7 7 (A) (2) (c) of the condominium conversion eviction regulation of the Boston Rent Control Board is invalid, and we affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">1. <em>The Enabling Ordinance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On December 27, 1979, the city council of Boston enacted c. 37 of the Ordinances of 1979 (the Ordinance), entitled \u201cRegulating Evictions for Condominium Conversions.\u201d Prior to the Ordinance, condominium conversion evictions had been regulated by c. 15 of the Ordinances of the City of Boston (1975), Boston\u2019s rent control law. While c. 15 regulates certain residential rents and evictions, it makes no procedural distinction between evictions in general and condominium conversion evictions in particular. See c. 15, \u00a7 8(a) (ix) and (x), \u00a7 8(b), and \u00a7 8(e). Cf. <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 561, 562 (1975). However, as noted in the preamble to the Ordinance, \u00a7 200, condominium conversion evictions result in suffering for those many tenants who are faced with imminent displacement and must quickly relocate but who have limited choices because of their finances and age. The stated purpose of the Ordinance is to avoid discouraging condominium conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>sions while at the same time protecting tenants from hardship by affording them more time than that provided under c. 15, \u00a7 8, to make new living arrangements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The intent of the Ordinance is given effect by \u00a7 204, which precludes a landlord from recovering possession of a housing accommodation for condominium conversion purposes until the expiration of the tenant\u2019s housing agreement or until one year after the date the tenant receives written notice of the termination of the tenancy, whichever is later. A two-year notice period is required for tenants who have attained the age of sixty-two years on or before the date of receipt of the notice or who are physically handicapped and economically limited, as specified in \u00a7 204. Additionally, the landlord must record a master deed under G. L. c. 183A prior to or within the notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The notice requirements established under \u00a7 204 are specific. The landlord must serve the tenant personally or by certified mail, and he \u201cshall advise the tenant of the rights and procedures available under this ordinance, including if applicable, a statement of such tenant rights and procedures available under the rules of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Upon the expiration of the notice period, the landlord must furnish the board with proof of compliance with all the provisions regulating condominium conversion evictions. If the board finds that the landlord\u2019s proof is valid and that he has complied with the provisions of the Ordinance, \u201ca certificate of eviction shall be issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">2. <em>The Landlord\u2019s Notices.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\"><em>A </em>master deed had been recorded for the premises on or about November 5, 1979, converting the housing accommodation, which was and continues to be subject to c. 15, into a condominium under G. L. c. 183A. Subsequent to the effective date of the Ordinance but prior to the promulgation of the regulation, the landlord sent the notices to his tenants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the landlord became aware of the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tian in August, 1980, which was beyond the time period established in \u00a7 7(A) (2) (b), he wrote to the board seeking permission to file copies of the notices, which he enclosed. He stated that these notices were in compliance with the Ordinance and the regulation and that his only misstep in the procedures had been his failure to comply with \u00a7 7(A) (2) (b) by filing copies with the board. The board advised the landlord in writing, with copies of its response to the landlord\u2019s tenants, that \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c) \u201cis mandatory, leaving the Board without any discretion in the matter,\u201d and that the notices were \u201cineffective and should not be relied upon for purposes of condominium conversion eviction.\u201d As of the date of argument before us, only one tenant has remained on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">3. <em>The Validity of the Regulation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In considering the validity of \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c), we look first to the scope of authority conferred upon the board by the Ordinance, keeping in mind that the board is limited to \u201conly those powers which are expressly conferred by statute or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>necessarily implied from those expressly conferred,\u201d <em>Church </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>370 Mass. 598, 601 (1976), but that a \u201cregulation may be authorized even where it cannot be traced to specific statutory language.\u201d <em>Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 75 (1979). Moreover, where an agency is given the responsibility \u201cto effectuate the purposes of an act \u2018the validity of a regulation promulgated thereunder will be sustained so long as it is \u201creasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 524 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The regulation in issue was promulgated under \u00a7 210 of the Ordinance, which states in pertinent part: \u201cNothing in this ordinance shall be construed as giving the board any additional powers other than those specifically set forth herein and those exercised by the board in accordance with section 205 and section 2(c) of Chapter 15 of the Ordinances of 1975, as amended, as they relate to the eviction of tenants for the purposes of condominium conversion.\u201d Section 205 gives the board \u201cthe power and duty to enforce\u201d the Ordinance, and c. 15, \u00a7 2(c), confers upon the board the power \u201cto promulgate such . . . regulations ... as will further the provisions of this ordinance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We do not view the scope of the board\u2019s authority as having the breadth of that found in such cases as: <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 847 (1977) (G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 128H, as amended by St. 1971, c. 373, authorized the department to establish \u201cby promulgation of regulations, such minimum standards relating to the rights of visitation ... as will ensure the adequate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tection of said rights\u201d); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass, at 524-525 (pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1975, c. 362, \u00a7 3, the board was empowered to \u201cadopt rules and regulations governing the practice of medicine in order to promote the public health, welfare, and safety and nothing in this section shall be construed to limit this general power\u201d); <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 766 (1980) (\u201c\u2018The attorney general may make rules and regulations interpreting the provisions of subsection 2[a] of this chapter,\u2019\u201d G. L. c. 93A, which have the force and effect of law). See also <em>Grocery Manufacturers of America </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass, at 75-77, for a comparison of authorities therein collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The board\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations is to be exercised in a manner consistent with the city council\u2019s policy, expressed in \u00a7 200 of the Ordinance, to \u201cencourage an increase in [home] ownership or at least [to] avoid discouraging it.\u201d See <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass, at 568-569. Compare <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 51-52 (1979); <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass. 152, 154 n.3 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Further, we are particularly mindful of that passage in \u00a7 200 of the Ordinance which states that \u201c[t]he untoward effects of condominium conversion evictions on tenants can be <em>adequately </em>dealt with by providing potentially displaced tenants with sufficient time to examine\u201d their available alternatives (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>While the board\u2019s intention in promulgating \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c) may be laudable, the invalidation of otherwise effective notices does nothing to \u201cfurther the provisions\u201d of the Ordinance, as required by c. 15, \u00a7 2(c). Rather, it extends to a tenant who may have been fully apprised of his rights and remedies by the landlord\u2019s notices twice the amount of time declared adequate by the city council to secure alternative housing accommodations. There is nothing in the regulation which requires the board to pass upon the sufficiency of the landlord\u2019s notices upon receiving copies of them pursuant to \u00a7 7(A) (2) (a) or (b), or prior to an application for a certificate of eviction. Nor does \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c) make any accommodation for the landlord who has fully complied with the Ordinance and the regulation except for the filing of the copies mandated by \u00a7 7(A)(2)(a) or (b). Compare \u00a7 7E; \u00a7 11(D) (failure of a landlord to make timely filing of affidavit of compliance in respect to vacancy decontrolled housing \u201cshall result in dismissal of the action <em>unless </em>the landlord proves that such failure did not result in substantial prejudice to those defending such action\u201d) (emphasis supplied). Section 204 of the Ordinance, however, states that if a landlord has complied with all the requirements of the Ordinance, then \u201ca certificate of eviction shall be issued\u201d at the expiration of the notice period. While the board may promulgate regulations concerning matters provided for in the Ordinance (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baronas, </em>285 Mass. 321, 323 [1934]; <em>John Donnelly &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Outdoor Advertising Bd., </em>369 Mass. 206, 212 [1975]), it may not do so in a manner which unnecessarily impedes the landlord and thereby frustrates, rather than furthers, the provisions of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">These considerations lead us to the conclusion that condominium conversion eviction notices which are in compliance with the provisions of the Ordinance and valid regulations promulgated thereunder cannot be invalidated solely for a failure to make a timely filing of copies of the notices with the board. The regulation gives the tenant a bonus at the landlord\u2019s expense, and that is not \u201ca proper accommoda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tian of the policies of the . . . [ordinance] with the policy of encouraging home ownership.\u201d <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass, at 569. Compare <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass, at 50-52; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>383 Mass, at 156-159.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In light of our conclusion that \u00a7 7(A)(2)(c) is invalid as beyond the board\u2019s authority, we need not consider the landlord\u2019s contentions concerning the \u201cretroactive\u201d aspects of \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c) when applied with \u00a7 7(A) (2) (b). Nor do we view it as necessary to determine the validity of \u00a7 7(A) (2) (a) and (b) apart from \u00a7 7(A)(2)(c). The latter regulation is severable from those provisions, and our holding is so confined. Additionally, nothing we have said should be taken as a suggestion or an intimation that the landlord\u2019s notices are such that he will be entitled to a certificate of eviction upon the expiration of the applicable notice period established under \u00a7 204 of the Ordinance. We hold only that the landlord\u2019s notices cannot be rendered ineffective because of noncompliance with \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The judgment is modified to declare that \u00a7 7(A) (2) (c) of the condominium conversion eviction regulation of the Boston Rent Control Board is invalid, and as so modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pATW\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"Ak4\">\u201c7.
