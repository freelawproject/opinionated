At his trial on complaints charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>him with operating a motor vehicle \u201cwhile under the influence of\u201d drugs (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[l][a]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) and with operating \u201ca [motor] vehicle negligently so that the lives or safety of the public might be endangered\u201d (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2] [a]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), the defendant was precluded, on objection by the Commonwealth, from introducing evidence that he had no knowledge of the effects of the medication and that he had not received warnings about using the drug before driving. The defendant was also unsuccessful in obtaining an instruction that the Commonwealth was required to prove that he knew or should have known that the drug might affect his ability to drive safely. The defendant was convicted of both charges. The trial judge imposed fines but stayed their payment pending appeal. We conclude that the excluded evidence was relevant and reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The applicable portion of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1) (o), is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends that the provision is to be read as a \u201cpublic welfare\u201d statute imposing strict liability notwithstanding \u201cinnocent intent.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 510 (1968). On this reading, it is irrelevant whether an accused knows or has reason to know that a drug prescribed by his physician may affect his driving ability. The act itself, i.e., driving under the influence of drugs, irrespective of fault, is the crime, and is punishable by imprisonment for up to two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>We note at the outset that, at least in some cases, the literal wording of the statute is not to apply. For example, it cannot seriously be contended that the Legislature made it a crime to be forced at gunpoint to take drugs and drive or to drive after having unknowingly been slipped a drug within the statutory definition. At best, the statute is expressed elliptically.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The main thrust of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1) <em>(a), </em>is directed at the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs whose consequences are known or should be known to the user. This construction is borne out by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>264 Mass. 535, 537 (1928). Writing at a time when \u00a7 24 referred only to intoxicating liquor, the court stated, \u201cThe Commonwealth had the burden of proving not only that the defendant was drunk, but also that this condition was caused by the <em>voluntary </em>use of intoxicating liquor\u201d (emphasis supplied). The <em>Dale </em>language is persuasive<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because \u201c[a] person should not be criminally liable for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs if his consumption of such liquor or drugs was not voluntary. The punishment for this crime is too severe to render it a general welfare offense with consequent \u2018strict liability\u2019 . . ..\u201d Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 555, at 363 (1976) (discussing Dale).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Although the circumstances of a person who drives after taking a prescription drug unaware of its possible effects differ significantly from those of a person forced to drive after having a potion rammed down his throat or after being tricked, such circumstances also differ substantially from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>those of a person who drives after voluntarily consuming alcohol or drugs whose effects are or should be known.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The law recognizes the differences, and authorities have characterized as \u201cinvoluntary intoxication by medicine\u201d the condition of a defendant who has taken prescribed drugs with severe unanticipated effects. See LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 45, at 348 (1972); Perkins, Criminal Law 897 (2d ed. 1969) (\u201csuch intoxication is involuntary, because the patient is entitled to assume that an intoxicating dose would not be prescribed\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>376 Mass. 765, 771 n.6 (1978), where the court noted that no evidence had been offered that the consumption in that case was involuntary, and pointed out that \u201c[d]ifferent considerations may well be appropriate in determining criminal responsibility where a defendant\u2019s conduct is affected by a forced, an unknowing, or a lawful consumption of drugs.\u201d Although there are few cases involving unanticipated effects of prescription drugs on a defendant\u2019s driving ability, and although each case depends on the specific statutory provision involved, the concept of \u201cinvoluntary intoxication\u201d has been applied to motor vehicle violations of the type under consideration in the present case. Authorities elsewhere indicate that such a nonvoluntary taking of a drug excuses certain motor vehicle offenses. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Koch, </em>250 A.D. 623, 624, 625 (N.Y. 1937); <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>284 S.W.2d 654, 658 (Ky. 1955); <em>Kaiser </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Suburban Transp. Sys., </em>65 Wash.2d 461, 466-468 (1965). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Altimus, </em>306 Minn. 462, 469-470 (1976). Gf. <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>416 A.2d 5, 8-9 (Me. 1980). Contra <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>397 P.2d 920, 923-924 (Okla. Crim. App. 1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>31 N.C. App. 733 (1976) (strict liability but cough syrup ingested was not a prescription drug).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The question remains, however, whether the Massachusetts Legislature in \u00a7 24(1) <em>(a) </em>intended to penalize driving after such consumption, even if characterized as nonvoluntary. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kraatz, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 200 (1974), we noted that the history of \u00a7 24<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is \u201ca patchwork of judicial decisions and legislative engraftments which beclouds any clear perception of legislative intent.\u201d Nevertheless, there is some indication, both in legislative material and in judicial decisions, that \u00a7 24 is not intended to impose criminal liability on unknowing defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Of particular significance is the Third Report of the Judicial Council of Massachusetts, 1927 Pub. Doc. No. 144, at 35-37 (Report). That Report was subsequent to the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pentz, </em>247 Mass. 500 (1924), one of the cases relied upon by the Commonwealth here. At the time of <em>Pentz, </em>the provision dealing with driving to endanger (now G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2] [a]) did not contain the word \u201cnegligently.\u201d The <em>Pentz </em>court held that \u201c[i]t is [the] act which is penalized. The intent with which the act is done is an immaterial factor. It is irrelevant whether the act is negligent, or not.\u201d 247 Mass, at 509. At the request of the Massachusetts Senate, the Judicial Council investigated a bill designed to negate the construction adopted by the <em>Pentz </em>court. Describing the bill as \u201cintended to avoid the liability of perfectly innocent and well-intentioned careful persons to criminal proceedings,\u201d the Council pointed out that the construction given to the statute in <em>Pentz </em>and other cases may make a person \u201ccriminally liable to imprisonment under circumstances which . . . would not subject him to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>liability for damages in a civil proceeding.\u201d Report, <em>supra </em>at 35, 36. The Council recommended passage of the bill, stating, \u201cWe do not think the [Legislature could have intended to subject a man to criminal liability for imprisonment if by accident a situation arises without fault on his part .... The tendency to create criminal liability in cases in which there is no criminal element or intent, express or implied, seems to us mistaken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. In 1928, St. 1928, c. 281, \u00a7 1, was enacted, adopting the Council\u2019s recommendation .<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">While the Council was addressing the provision now found in \u00a7 24(2)(a), its arguments apply with equal vigor to \u00a7 24(1)(a). We also think it significant that, as set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Legislature and recent judicial decisions have avoided a construction which would impose imprisonment without fault under other parts of \u00a7 24 and under other provisions of the motor vehicle laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Our conclusion is strengthened by a rule of construction, followed in Massachusetts, which requires particular clarity of language before finding a legislative intent to create a \u201cpublic welfare\u201d offense punishable by a severe penalty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Because traditionally, at common law, some element of intent or knowledge was required before punishment could be imposed, see <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 250-251 (1952),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and because due process considerations may, in some cases, require some degree of notice, see <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 228 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 235 &amp; n.6 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 916 (1976), courts are reluctant to infer a legislative intent to impose absolute liability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[I]n the absence of specific words saying so,\u201d it is not supposed \u201cthat the legislature intended to make accidents and mistakes crimes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>38 Kan. 390, 393 (1888). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>342 Mass. 393, 397 (1961), the Supreme Judicial Court stated, \u201cAn intention to create such an offence should appear in clear and unambiguous language.\u201d Where the offense permits the imposition of a severe penalty, here as much as two years\u2019 imprisonment, \u201cit would take unusually clear legislative language to lead us to the view that knowledge is not required for a conviction . . ..\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass, at 511-512. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass, at 234. Cf. <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. at 256. Compare <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 100-103 (1982). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Minicost Car Rental, Inc., </em>354 Mass. 746, 748-749 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>370 Mass. 630 (1976) (minor penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>No such clear language appears in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(a). Accordingly, we hold that it was error to preclude the defendant from introducing evidence that he did not know of the possible effects of the medication on his driving ability, that he did not receive warnings as to its use, and that he had no reason to anticipate the effects which the drug induced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> His failure to receive warnings from his physician and pharmacist, if there is evidence of such failure, is relevant both to the charge of driving under the influence of drugs (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[l][a]) and to the charge of negligence (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2][a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Since we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial, we need not consider whether the form of the requested instruction as to the defendant\u2019s knowledge was adequate to preserve this issue on appeal. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larmey, ante </em>281, 285 (1982), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 697 (1982). The defendant, on a new trial, will be entitled to an instruction that he may not be convicted under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(a), unless he knew or had reason to know of the possible effects of the drug on his driving abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We consider briefly the other instructions sought by the defendant which may be requested on a retrial. The defendant has not cited any authority or made any persuasive argument in support of his conclusion that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 22(a), and G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 21, require the broad warnings contained in his proposed instructions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To the contrary, \u201c[t]he obligation to give adequate information does not require the disclosure of all risks of a proposed therapy.\u201d <em>Harnish </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center, </em>387 Mass. 152, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>156 (1982). \u201cThe remotely possible risks of a proposed treatment may be almost without limit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. For that reason, if for no other, there was no error in the failure to give the defendant\u2019s proposed instructions 4 and 5. As to the judge\u2019s discretion on the relevance of evidence as to the negligence, if any, of the doctor or pharmacist, see Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 408-411 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-14\"> Commonly called Librium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\"> Unless otherwise indicated, citations to G.

That crime was defined as \u201cthe voluntary use of intoxicating liquor.\u201d See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 48, as in effect in 1927.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kraatz, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. at 200. This court, in <em>Kraatz, </em>at 201-202, required scienter for the making of false statements in a license application even though the term \u201cknowingly\u201d was not used for such applications and was used in another clause for the making of false statements in a registration application.
