He sustained a neck injury for which the insurer paid almost three weeks\u2019 compensation. The employee returned to work without restrictions on his activities, stopping on May 8, 1978. He has not worked since that date. A single member of the Industrial Accident Board, whose findings were affirmed and adopted by the reviewing board (board), found that on May 8, 1978, the employee was totally disabled \u201cas a direct result of degenerative changes set in motion by [the 1969] injury.\u201d The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ordered that the employee receive benefits at the rate in effect on May 8, 1978, in accordance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B, inserted by St. 1970, c. 667, \u00a7 1. That statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cAn employee who has been receiving compensation under this chapter and who has returned to work for a period of not less than two months shall, if he is subsequently injured and receives compensation, be paid such compensation at the rate in effect at the time of the subsequent injury whether or not such subsequent injury is determined to be a recurrence of the former injury.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision, and the insurer appeals, arguing that the employee\u2019s condition is neither a \u201csubsequent injury\u201d nor a \u201crecurrence of the former injury\u201d and that \u00a7 35B applies only to injuries occurring after February 1, 1971, the effective date of that provision. See St. 1970, c. 667, \u00a7 2. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The insurer does not dispute the facts found by the single member and adopted by the board. From 1947 to November, 1971, the employee worked in \u201cheavy construction,\u201d first as a laborer and then as an iron worker. When the employee returned to work after his 1969 injury, he experienced neck and back pain at various times, particularly when he was engaged in strenuous activity. In November, 1971, he was elected business agent for his union, and in this capacity the employee\u2019s duties were to assign iron workers to various jobs, to visit work sites, and to investigate grievances. This last responsibility entailed climbing ladders and steel structures. Throughout this period, 1971 to May, 1978, the employee was aware of a \u201cprogressive deterioration\u201d in his physical condition, particularly in respect to \u201cproblems\u201d with his neck and left arm. His complaints of pain \u201cprogressively\u201d increased, but the employee never made or filed an incident report. On occasion he would have to be driven home from work because he was unable to drive his own car due to neck pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The employee\u2019s medical expert testified that when he examined the employee in May, 1978, he noted that the employee suffered from \u201ctenderness and restricted motion\u201d in his neck and a \u201closs of sensation to pinprick and weakness in the left upper extremity and degenerative changes in the cervical spine at C5-6.\u201d A disc protrusion at \u201cC5-6\u201d was confirmed by a myelogram. The doctor related that the employee was suffering from \u201cpost-traumatic cervical arthritis in C5-6 with associated disc herniation.\u201d It was his opinion that the employee was totally disabled and that his disability was causally related to the 1969 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The employee\u2019s expert further testified that the employee has had \u201ccontinuous symptoms\u201d which, since 1969, became \u201cprogressively worse\u201d and that the 1969 injury \u201cset in motion the inevitable progression of changes in the employee\u2019s cervical spine that culminated\u201d in his total disability. He stated that the employee\u2019s \u201cdegenerative changes would have taken place whether or not the employee was working but that by working the disability occurred a little bit sooner.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">1. <em>Scope of </em>\u00a7 <em>35B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">There is no dispute that the employee is entitled to compensation, and the sole issue is whether the compensation is to be at the rate in effect on May 8, 1978, rather than on June 3, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The <em>question </em>arises in the following context. The right to compensation under our worker\u2019s compensation act, G. L. c. 152, as amended (the Act), originates in the injury, and the rate of compensation is fixed by statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which by gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>eral rule (later embodied in \u00a7 2A) must be prospectively applied. Accordingly, compensation benefits are to be paid at the rate in effect on the date of the injury. <em>Beausoleil\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 344 (1947), and cases therein cited. <em>Steuterman\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 454 (1948). See generally Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 177, at 191-194 (2d ed. 1981). As a corollary, where an employee is again unable to work because of a prior injury, compensation has been paid by the insurer of that original risk and, hence, at the rate in effect at the time it undertook that risk, the date of the prior injury. See <em>Gaglione\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 42, 43 (1922); <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 437 (1938); <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592 (1982). Thus arises the dispute, whether the worker\u2019s recent absence is due to the prior or a new injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The employee argues that he is entitled to the more recent rate because \u00a7 35B applies to any \u201csubsequent period of incapacity\u201d (see Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 302, at 352-353 [2d ed. 1981]) which is found to be either a recurrence of the former injury or a new injury. The insurer contends that as the employee\u2019s inability to work was found to be the result of a degenerative process set in motion by the 1969 injury rather than a new injury or the reappearance of the symptoms associated with the former injury, \u00a7 35B is inapplicable. But see <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass, at 596 &amp; n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In interpreting \u00a7 35B, the parties have failed to apply general principles of statutory construction. \u201c[I]t is established that the workmen\u2019s compensation act is to be construed broadly, rather than narrowly, in the light of its purpose and, so far as reasonably may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design. . . . But it is also settled that, in construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning according to the approved usage of language . . . and that the language of the statute is not to be enlarged or limited by construction unless its object and plain meaning require it.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 746-747 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The purpose of the Act is to replace wages lost by reason of an employee\u2019s inability to work because of an injury. \u201cThe compensation to be paid bears direct relation to the loss of earnings resulting from the injury. All compensation thus provided is by way of relief from inability to earn, or for deprivation of support flowing from, wages theretofore received by the employee.\u201d <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 183 (1932). See also <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 436 (1938). We note that under the general rule the employee sustaining a new injury, one independent of and totally unrelated to any prior injury, receives compensation commensurate with the wages lost. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34 &amp; 34A. However, under the corollary to that rule, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 35B, where the employee\u2019s absence from work was causally related to and the consequence of a prior compensable injury, the compensation bore no relationship to the wages being earned on the date the employee again became unable to work. Compensation based upon wages in effect at the time of the prior injury would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We turn to the language of \u00a7 35B, which, by the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used, has application only to employees who are injured not less than two months following the date of their return to work after being unemployed because of a compensable injury. (\u201cAn employee who has been receiving compensation under this chapter and who has returned to work for a period of not less than two months shall, if he is subsequently injured . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We give the word \u201cinjury\u201d its specialized rather than common meaning. That type of injury for which compensation is awarded under c. 152 \u201chas been broadly defined to include \u2018whatever lesion or <em>change </em>in any part of the system produces harm or pain <em>or </em>a lessened facility of the natural use of any bodily activity or capability\u2019\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 637 (1978), quoting from <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8, 12 (1914). Additionally, because the employer takes the employee as he finds him, an injury includes the aggravation of a preexist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ing condition. See, e.g., <em>Steuterman\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 454, 455 (1948). See generally Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 173, at 177-179 (2d ed. 1981). Further, the injury must be work related. As recently stated: \u201cTo be compensable, the harm must arise either from a specific incident or series of incidents at work, or from an identifiable condition that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations. The injury need not be unique to the trade, and need not, of course, result from the fault of the employer. But it must, in the sense we have described, be identified with the employment.\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass, at 594-595.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We construe the terms \u201csubsequently injured\u201d and \u201csubsequent injury\u201d to mean a change in the employee\u2019s physical or mental condition, see <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass, at 12; <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass, at 637-638, which occurs at least two months after his return to work. When such a change in the employee\u2019s condition occurs, it is of no consequence that the change may be found to be causally related to the injury for which he had been receiving compensation prior to his return to work. (Section 35B: \u201c[W]hether or not such subsequent injury is determined to be a recurrence of the former injury\u201d.) The employee is entitled to compensation at the rate in effect on the day he is again required to leave work. Cf. <em>Atamians Case, </em>265 Mass. 12, 16 (1928); <em>Trombetta\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 105 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">To read \u00a7 35B to be, as suggested by the employee, a \u201cremedial upgrading of compensation for subsequent periods of incapacity determined as a question of fact to be recurrence,\u201d is merely to shift focus away from the word \u201cinjury\u201d to \u201crecurrence\u201d without regard for the meaning of either. While the end result may be close to the mark that we have reached, the employee\u2019s reasoning is unnecessarily artificial and can produce results we think were not intended by the Legislature. See, e.g., <em>Calheta\u2019s Case, post </em>464 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>The insurer, on the other hand, would narrowly and literally construe \u00a7 35B. It would recognize a \u201crecurrence\u201d of the former injury, but it would do so only where the employee\u2019s condition was \u201creappearing\u201d and spasmodic rather than, as here, constant and degenerative. We see no significant distinction between periodic changes in one\u2019s condition resulting in lost wages and a steady process of deterioration of one\u2019s physical or mental abilities culminating in the inability to work. Cf. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass, at 638. The cause, a change in the employee\u2019s condition which is causally related to a prior injury, and the result, loss of wages, are identical in either event.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">We hold that \u00a7 35B is a legislative remedy for the disparity which would otherwise exist between wages lost and compensation received in those situations where an employee returns to work but, because of a prior compensable injury, his ability to perform his duties changes while his compensation benefits remain the same. Our construction of \u00a7 35B is consistent with the \u201cbeneficent design\u201d of the Act, <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass, at 746, and in furtherance of its purpose, <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass, at 183.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The board\u2019s findings show that the employee, subsequent to his reemployment, became unable to work because of his 1969 injury, and he therefore falls within the scope of \u00a7 35B.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">2. <em>Prospective Application of </em>\u00a7 <em>35B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 2A, inserted by St. 1946, c. 386, \u00a7 3, provides that any amendment which would increase the rate of compensation to be received by an employee shall \u201cbe deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act.\u201d In <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 154, 159 (1981), S.C., 385 Mass. 590 (1982), \u00a7 35B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>was construed as \u201c\u2018substantive in character.\u2019\u201d The insurer looks to the 1969 injury and argues that application of \u00a7 35B in this instance would be retrospective. Under \u00a7 35B, however, the employee\u2019s right to compensation at the increased rate and the insurer\u2019s burden to pay it originate in the change in the employee\u2019s condition subsequent to his return to work. Where, as here, the injury occurs after the effective date of \u00a7 35B, February 1, 1971, application of that amendment is not retrospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Costs to the employee are to be determined by a single justice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Section 35B also provides that \u201cif compensation for the old injury was paid in a lump sum, [the employee] shall not receive compensation unless the subsequent claim is determined to be a new injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-9\"> This case involves no suggestion that the employee\u2019s 1978 disability might be attributable to aggravation of the 1969 injury by the normal incidents of employment. The board found that the \u201c1969 injury was not aggravated by his continuing to work any more than it may have been by his normal daily activities, the only true aggravating factor being the passage of time.\u201d See <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 593-594 (1982), and cases therein cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> See G.
