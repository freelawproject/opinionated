The plan was attached to the complaint and appears to have been prepared to obtain an endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, as appearing in St. 1963, c. 363, \u00a7 1, that \u201capproval under the subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>sion control law [is] not required\u201d by the planning board of the town of Pepperell. So far as appears from the complaint, the plan was not ordered by the owners in contemplation of any physical alteration in the land, and, in particular, there is no suggestion that any roads, utilities or a change in topography was contemplated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The primary issue presented in this appeal is whether the defendant designed or planned \u201can improvement to real property\u201d so as to be protected by the six-year provision of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reverse as we hold that a survey and plan dividing property into lots, at least where the plan is unrelated to any proposed construction or changes in the topography of the land, is not the \u201cdesign\u201d or \u201cplanning\u201d of an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The statute does not define \u201cimprovement\u201d nor, unlike some statutes elsewhere, does it specifically include<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or exclude<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> surveys. Although G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, was recently reviewed in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701 (1982), neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>that case nor any other Massachusetts case has, as yet, construed the term \u201cimprovement\u201d as used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">New Jersey and Colorado, both of which have similar legislation, have considered the application of their statutes to surveyors\u2019 plans. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, although holding the statute inapplicable on other grounds, stated, \u201cThere is no reason why ... a surveyor whose professional work is functionally related to and integrated with a building plan or design, . . . should not fall within the statute.\u201d <em>E. </em>A. <em>Williams, Inc. </em>v. <em>Russo Dev. Corp., </em>82 N.J. 160, 169-170 (1980). In that case, the surveyor was hired \u201cto prepare a survey of the premises acquired for the business and to delineate the exact location where a building should be constructed in order that it would be placed in the center of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. In <em>Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Conklin Associates, </em>167 N.J. Super. 392, 394 (1979), affirming 152 N.J. Super. 1 (1977), the Appellate Division held<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that a survey to effect placement of houses, garages and driveways came within the statute as it relates to the design and planning of an improvement. The court declined to decide whether an original perimeter survey, which was not undertaken to locate a building or other improvement, but was performed in connection with the purchase of the tract, was within the statute\u2019s protection. See also <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 201 (1972). In summary, the courts in New Jersey have protected surveyors, but the decisions have all arisen in the context of surveys related to construction projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In <em>Ciando </em>v. <em>Serafini, </em>40 Colo. App. 168, 170 (1977), the Colorado Appeals Court refused to rule that a boundary survey alone can constitute an improvement and held that \u201ca survey which is not part of an improvement or building project\u201d is not within the statutory coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>out in that decision, mechanics\u2019 lien cases, although of limited application to statutes of repose, also generally hold that only those surveys which are part of a construction project fall within mechanics\u2019 lien statutes. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>266 Ala. 675, 681 (1957) (preparing maps and placing stakes to mark boundary lines not within lien statute). <em>Daugherty </em>v. <em>Gunther, </em>88 Wash. 378, 378-379 (1915) (survey unrelated to subsequent construction not within lien statute), compare <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dekraay, </em>217 Or. 436, 446 (1959) (cost of surveying for location of a building within the statute). But see <em>Nolte </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>189 Cal. App. 2d 140, 147 (1961) (permitting hen for subdivision survey, but California has a statute specifically covering surveys). We are in accord with these authorities and conclude that a survey and plan for the division of land does not constitute an improvement for purposes of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, at least in circumstances where it is not integrated with a building plan, or a design for construction or other change in the topography of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">This holding is in accord with the usual and natural meaning of the word \u201cimprovement\u201d. See <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass, at 705. See also <em>Kallas Millwork Corp. </em>v. <em>Square D Co., </em>66 Wis.2d 382, 386 (1975), adopting the following definition of improvement which appears in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1138 (1971): \u201ca permanent addition to or betterment of real property that enhances its capital value and that involves the expenditure of labor or money and is designed to make the property more useful or valuable as distinguished from ordinary repairs.\u201d See also <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>193 Mass. 179, 185 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The legislative history of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, also suggests this result. 1967 House Doc. No. 2603 (1968 Senate Doc. No. 339), the predecessor to St. 1968, c. 612, which inserted G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, extended protection to surveyors as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>as to architects and engineers. The report accompanying Bill No. 339<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> pointed out that \u201cthe scope of a land surveyor\u2019s duties is generally limited to fixing the form and boundaries of a site\u201d and therefore \u201cmuch of the content of the report\u201d has no application to that occupation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1968 Senate Doc. No. 339, at 13. The report raised a number of specific questions including, \u201c4. Should land surveyors be treated separately?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 29. As enacted, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, not only does not give surveyors separate treatment, it does not mention them. While consideration and rejection by the Legislature of the provision including surveyors does not \u201ccontrol our decision,\u201d the legislative history \u201clends support\u201d to our conclusion that surveyors\u2019 services unrelated to a building plan or design contemplating some physical change in the land do not constitute an improvement within the statute. <em>Superintendent of Schools of Leominster </em>v. <em>Mayor of Leominster, </em>386 Mass. 114, 118 &amp; n.ll (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We next examine the complaint to determine whether the judgment of dismissal may be upheld on other grounds. The applicable standard is that dismissal is not proper unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiffs \u201ccan prove no set of facts\u201d entitling them to relief, <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 39 &amp; n.4 (1981). The allegations that the error was not found until, July, 1979, allow the plaintiffs to present evidence that their claims for relief did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>not accrue until that time. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Peabody Constr. Co., </em>386 Mass. 121, 129 (1982). Thus, counts 1-4 alleging negligence and, also, breach of warranty, see <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass, at 719-720 &amp; n.19, withstand the motion to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). Counts 5 and 6, however, which allege damages on account of breach of warranties under the Uniform Commercial Code must be dismissed. The survey plan is not \u201cgoods\u201d within G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-105, inserted by St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. \u201cContracts whose predominant factor, thrust, or purpose is the rendition of services are not within the scope of art. 2.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Peabody Constr. Co., </em>386 Mass, at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The judgment as to counts 1-4 is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> The complaint does not allege any development by the Raff els. In 1977, an additional plan, also attached to the complaint, and also appearing to be prepared for purposes of endorsement under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81P, was made by another surveyor who relied on the perimeter boundaries shown on the defendant\u2019s plan. In 1979, a conveyance of certain parcels shown on the 1977 plan was made to the plaintiff Create and Construct, Inc. When that plaintiff attempted to clear a lot for development it discovered that the boundaries on the defendant\u2019s plan were incorrect and, as a result, was required to settle with several abutters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\"> General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, as amended by St. 1973, c. 777, \u00a7 2, reads: \u201cActions of tort for damages arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues; provided, however, that in no event shall such actions be commenced more than six years after the performance or furnishing of such design, planning, construction or general administration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> See, e.g., Ark.

No. 1050 and in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra, </em>for protecting architects and other design professionals do not apply to surveyors. E.g., architects and other design professions should be encouraged to experiment, <em>Klein, </em>at 717, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 339, at 19; design professionals (and probably not surveyors) deal in inexact sciences and are called upon to exercise judgment in order to anticipate factors incapable of precise measurement. <em>Klein, </em>at 718, 1968 Senate Doc.
