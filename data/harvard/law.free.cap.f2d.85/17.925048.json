The consent to the entry of the injunction waived any error of decision that might have been made. Swift &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 48 S.Ct. 311, 72 L.Ed. 587. Moreover, appellant stipulated that his books could be examined. The attack made upon the bill of complaint because it failed to allege the absence of an adequate remedy at law becomes immaterial, since the injunctive relief is provided for by the statute. Section 20 (b), Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77t (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">We have heretofore held that the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77a et seq.) is constitutional. Securities and Exchange Comm. v. Jones (C.C.A.) 79 F.(2d) 617. In a review of that case, the Supreme Court reversed upon other grounds. 298 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 654, 80 L.Ed. 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-17\">The denial of that part of the order asking the suppression of the evidence and return of papers we will not now consider, for that part of the relief refused is not appealable. Cogen v. United States, 278 U.S. 221, 49 S.Ct. 118, 73 L.Ed. 275; In re Bob, 76 F.(2d) 131 (C.C.A.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-18\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
