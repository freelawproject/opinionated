Brinson, 286 U.S. 254, 52 S.Ct. 516, 76 L.Ed. 1089, 82 A.L.R. 1288, is not applicable, but that the decree adjudging ownership of the bonds to be in the depositor should be affirmed on authority of McNair v. Davis, 68 F.(2d) 935 (C.C.A. 5), certiorari denied 292 U.S. 647, 54 S.Ct. 780, 78 L.Ed. 1497. Cf. Messick v. Rardin (D.C.Ill.) 6 F.Supp. 200, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-23\">Decree of District Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
