Pickford, plaintiff below, and against Walter Fletcher Smith, defendant below. The suit was for rent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-27\">The case made for Pickford was this: On April 30, 1919, Pickford leased the Hotel Lafayette, located at 16th and I Streets, N. W., in the District of Columbia, to the Hotel Lafayette Company, a Delaware corporation, for a term to commence May 1, following, and to expire April 30, 1931. On April 26, 1929, Pickford executed with the same lessee a further lease of the same premises for a term of eight years to commence on May 1, 1931; the rental under this lease was $2625 per month payable in advance on the first day of each month. On October 24, 1929, the Hotel Lafayette Company, with the consent of Pickford, assigned both leases to Smith. Smith went into possession and paid the rent as it came due to and including June 1, 1932. But for the months of July, August and September, 1932, the rent, totaling $7875, remained unpaid. This suit to recover that sum, together with interest, was commenced by the plaintiff September 26, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-28\">Smith in defense of this suit, asserted that on June 1, 1932, he had assigned the second of the leases above mentioned to the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., a Maryland corporation, this with Pickford\u2019s written consent given on August 9 following.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Hotel Lafayette, Inc., intervened, itself.set up the assignment of the lease and asserted that it, and not Smith, was liable for the rent in question. In support of the defense, the following was shown: The assignment in question was, so far as is here material, in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-29\">\u201cAgreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-30\">\u201cThis Agreement, made and entered into this 1st day of June, 1932, by and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tween Walter Fletcher Smith, of the City of Washington, D.

Lloyd, a certificate of incorporation of the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., as a Maryland corporation, and on the 27th of the same month, this certificate was received and .approved by the State Tax Commission of Maryland. The certificate authorized the corporation to lease or otherwise acquire hotels and to operate the same, and it also provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">\u201cThe Corporation shall have three directors and- Walter Fletcher- Smith, William G. Woodford, and Harry R.

C. Present were Smith and one Chester A. Bennett, who was not one of the incorporators and not one of the directors above named. The minutes of the meeting state that the meeting was called to order by Smith who announced that a charter of incorporation had been secured under the laws of Maryland; and the minutes recite that on motion duly seconded a board of directors consisting of Smith, Bennett and Elwood H. Seal was selected; the minutes state also the unanimous adoption of a constitution and by-laws submitted by Smith. At the same time and place there was held a purported meeting of this board of directors. The minutes of this meeting state the presence of Smith and Bennett, and recite the election for the ensuing year of Smith as president, Seal as vice-president, and Bennett as secretary, and recite further the issuance of stock in the amount of 998 shares to .Smith and 1 share each to Bennett and Seal. On September 21, 1932, there was held in Washington, D. C., q purported meeting of the stockholders. The minutes of this meeting show the presence of Smith, Bennett and Seal, but, according to Smith\u2019s testimony, there was actually present only Smith. The minutes recite the resignation of Bennett and Seal as members of the board of directors and the- surrender of their stock certificates of 1 share each, and recite that President Smith selected T. R. Van Horn and Henry B. Hodgkins as officers and directors to succeed Bennett and Seal, and recite that after Bennett and Seal (who, as above noted, were not actually present) had retired from the meeting, President Smith called a stockholders meeting at which Smith, Van Horn and Hodgkins were present, representing 998 shares and 1 share and. 1 share respectively. Apparently Van- Horn and Hodgkins were present. The minutes then recite the election as directors for the ensuing year of Smith, Van Horn and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Hodgkins, and as officers of Smith, president, T. R. Van Horn, vice-president, and Henry B. Hodgkins, secretary and treasurer, \u201cfor the unexpired term.\u201d The minutes further recite instructions to the secretary to make arrangements with the Riggs National Bank to handle the funds of the company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 22, 1932, there was a further purported meeting of the board of directors in Washington, D. C., at which were present, according to the minutes, Smith, Van Horn and Hodgkins. Smith and Hodgkins were actually present; whether Van Horn was is uncertain. The minutes show:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201cThe President states that consent for the transfer of the lease for the Hotel Lafayette from Walter Fletcher Smith, Proprietor, to the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., had been secured from the owner of Hotel Lafayette, Mr. T.

[Finding No. 3]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u201cThere was no attempt to accept any assignment from Smith to said corporation of 'the lease . . . until on or after September 22, 1932 , . . [Finding No. 1]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">\u201cImmediately upon the signing of this agreement [of October 7, 1932] Smith put Pickford in possession of the hotel and chattels therein. [Finding No. 5]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u201cPickford was lessor and Smith the lessee of the Lafayette Hotel property from a time prior to July 1, 1932, to October 7, 1932, under a lease calling for rental payments of $2,625 on the first day of each month, and the rental payments due July 1, August 1 and September 1, 1932, herein sued for are overdue and unpaid. [Finding No. 5]\u201d \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">The trial court concluded that judgment should be entered for Pickford against Smith for the amount of the rent in question and interest, and concluded also that the intervening petition of the Hotel Lafayette should be dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judgment was entered accordingly. This judgment is assigned as error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AaQD\">The findings of the trial court, to the effect that the assignment relied upon by Smith was not executed until September 9, 1932, and that there was no attempt to accept the assignment from Smith- until on or after September 22, 1932, and that Smith was lessee from before July 1, 1932 to October 7, 1932] and that on that latter date he gave up possession, if properly supported by&gt; evidence, necessitated a judgment in favor of Pickford against Smith as entered, and this regardless of the correctness of other findings made by the court which are the subject of the assignment of errors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the facts found the privity of estate between Pickford as lessor and Smith as lessee did not terminate until October 7, 1932. Smith\u2019s only defense was the assignment which he alleged became effective June 1, 1932. If it did not become so effective, he obviously was liable for the rent. Even if it had been executed upon the first of June, still it would have availed him nothing, because it is elementary that a lessee, if he continues in possession, cannot escape liability for rent upon the theory of an assignment of the term to a third party. Such an attempt to escape rent was considered in Sanders v. Partridge, 108 Mass. 556. There, premises had been demised to J. &amp; M., who in turn assigned the lease to the defendant. He defended a suit for rent for a quarter ending July 1st upon a showing that in the preceding May he had executed an assignment to N. But he had remained in possession. The court held the defense not tenable, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-17\">\u201cUpon the report, we must assume that the defendant\u2019s evidence went \u25a0 no farther than to show a formal instrument of assignment without change of possession. That would not be sufficient to relieve the defendant from his liability as assignee of the lessees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\" . . . An assignment without deed, as of a chattel interest only, requires some act of entry, or change of actual possession, to complete its operation and divest the assignor of responsibility which arises from the holding of the estate. Taylor Landl. &amp; Ten. \u00a7\u00a7 449-451. [108 Mass. 556, at page 560]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In Negley v. Morgan, 46 Pa. 281, there was a suit for rent which accrued while the defendant, assignee of a lease, was in possession. Three days before he went out of possession he had made an assignment; upon the basis of that he sought to defend. The court held that he could not. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cUndoubtedly an assignee of a term is liable only for such portion of the rent reserved as falls due during the continuance of his connection with the demised premises. He is liable at all, only by reason of privity as [of] estate, and therefore liable for no more than such breaches of the covenants running with the land as occur while the privity continues. Hence it is said his assignment of the term, even though to a pauper, terminates his liability for any subsequent breaches, for it breaks the privity of estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201cBut to work such an effect the privity must be absolutely destroyed. The assignee, .having entered under an assignment, and thus come into privity, that privity continues as long as his beneficial enjoyment of the demised property or right to it remains. This is manifest when it is considered what the privity of estate, out of which arises his personal liability, is. It is the actual or beneficial enjoyment of the premises, or the right of possession and' enjoyment . . . Something more, then, is required to terminate the privity of an assignee of premises subject to rent and his consequent liability, than an assignment which does not put an end to his actual or beneficial possession, and his right to possession. [46 Pa. 281, at pages 284, 285]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">See also: Century Holding Co. v. Ebling Brewing Co., 185 App.Div. 292, 173 N.Y.S. 49; Kalmus v. Ebling Brewing Co., 164 N.Y.S. 176 (Sup.).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">An examination of the record and consideration of the undisputed material facts as above set forth make clear that the findings of the trial court were warranted. The fact that the assignment said by Smith to have been executed on June 1, 1932, purports to have been signed on that date not only by Smith in his individual capacity but by Smith as president of the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., and by Bennett as secretary, when not even a purported election of those persons as such officers had been made until September 9th following, would alone support the finding of the court that the assignment was executed, not upon June 1st, but upon September 9th. Scrutiny of the minutes of the various purported corporate meetings makes clear that the finding of the court that there was no attempt to accept any assignment until on or after September 22, 1932, is correct. The agreement of October 7, 1932, supports the finding that Smith put Pickford in possession of the premises on that date, and supports an inference that before that date Smith was still in possession \u2014 and that date, it is to be noted, is subsequent to the purported acceptance by the corporation, on September 22, 1932, of the assignment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">There was no binding acceptance of the assignment at any time. The Maryland Code in effect at the time of the matters in suit provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">\u201cWhen such certificate of incorporation has been delivered to the State Tax Commission with the fees provided for in Section 6 of this Article and the bonus tax, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>any payable, and not before, the incorporators, their successors and assigns, shall according to the purposes, conditions and provisions in such certificate of incorporation contained, become and be a body corporate by the name therein stated. [Maryland Annotated Code 1924, Art. 23, \u00a7 <em>7]\u201d </em>Under this statute it may be \u2014 though we do not assume to pass upon the point \u2014 that the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., became a <em>de jure </em>corporation upon delivery of the certificate of incorporation to the Maryland State Tax Commission on December <em>27, </em>1929. But .the Code also provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201cThe business and property of every corporation subject to the provisions of this article shall be conducted and managed by a board of not less than three directors, managers or trustees. Until the first annual meeting and until their successors are duly chosen and qualified, the board, shall consist' of the persons named as such in the charter \u2014 subject,- however, to the right of increase, decrease and removal granted by this article. Subject to the provisions of Section 14 of this article, the members of succeeding boards shall be elected\u2019by the stockholders or members of the corporation at their annual meetings. A majority of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless the by-laws otherwise provide, but in no case shall less than one-third of the directors or less^ than two directors constitute a quorum \u2022 for the transaction of business. [Maryland Acts 1927, c. 581, \u00a7 10, Annotated Code of Maryland, 1935 Supplement, Art. 23, \u00a7 10]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">At the purported organization meeting of the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., on September 9, 1932, the only one of the directors named in the certificate of incorporation present was Smith. His attempt alone to select a new board of directors consisting of himself, Bennett and Seal was in direct defiance of the statutory provision last above quoted. Therefore the action taken by this purported board of directors and their successors and\u2019the stockholders to whom they issued stock, and the officers purported to have been selected by them and by the stockholders, was without legal effect, and in consequence the purported acceptance of the assignment was without legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">It may be commented that in case No. 6476, a paper asserted by Smith to be the foundation of a contract of December 1, 1932, for a lease of the Hotel Lafayette and for a sale of its furniture, fixtures and equipment contained the following statement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201cThere is now a balance due Mr. Pickford on the furniture and fixture account amounting to .$24,453.00 <em>and I owe back rent for the months of July, August and September 1932 </em>amounting to $8,000, making a total of $32,453.00. [Italics' supplied]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In Century Holding Co. v. Ebling Brewing Co., supra, the defendant sought to escape liability for rent on the theory of an assignment to one Sudbrink. In holding that he could not do so, the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, speaking through Merrell\u2019 J., used the following language, which, if for the word \u201cSud-brink\u201d is substituted the name \u201cHotel Lafayette, Inc.,\u201d is apropos in the instant case :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">\u201cIf, however, Sudbrink [Hotel Lafayette,. Inc.] was the mere agent or dummy of the defendant, and if the defendant intended to remain in possession, keeping control of the property . . . which assumptions are amply sustained by the evidence, it certainly cannot be said that there was any bona fide transfer of the lease to Sudbrink [Hotel Lafayette, Inc.], which would relieve defendant from its liability to pay rent to the plaintiff. [185 App.Div. 292, 173 N.Y.S. 49, at page 54]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court must be, and the same is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-21\"> This case was consolidated for trial below and for argument here with case No. 6476, Hotel Lafayette, Inc., et al. v. Thomas H. Pickford et al., 66 App.D.C. 211, 85 F.(2d) 710, decided this day. The record in each case was by all parties offered in evidence in the other, and was made a part of the bill of exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-22\"> There was some question as to whether this consent was delivered conditionally, but in the view we take of the case, this is immaterial. Also it was claimed that sometime prior to September 22, 1932, Pickford received back the written consent, and whether this constituted, legally, a withdrawal was also made a question in the case. But again in the view we take, this is immateriaL</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-13\"> A further purported meeting of the board of directors was held on the same day in Washington, D. C. The minutes of this meeting recite the presence of Smith, Van Horn and Hodgkins, the authorization of the president to open a bank account with the Riggs National Bank, the authorization of the president, secretary and treasurer to deposit all funds of the company with that bank; and the minutes set forth also the formalities adopted for the signature and endorsement of checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AmM\"> There were other findings of fact and conclusions of law, but in the view we take of the case, they are not material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b744-12\"> There were other assignments of error, but in the view we take, they also are not material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b744-13\">The trial court had found also that \u201cthere had been no lawful organization of the corporation and issue of stock . . .\u201d If by this the court meant that there was no legal selection of directors except those named in the certificate of incorporation and no .legal selection of officers and stockholders, the court was correct. If the court meant that there had been no <em>de jure </em>organization of the corporation by the delivery of the certificate to the Maryland Tax Commission, the court may have been in error, but that error did not affect the result in this case. The court also found that Pickford had no such, transactions with the Hotel Lafayette, Inc., as would estop him from questioning its existence as a corporation. Because of the view we take in the case that the assignment of June 1, 1932, was ineffective, the judgment of the court was correct regardless of the validity of this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">An assignment of error which had to. do with a contempt proceeding in the case was not argued in the briefs and we therefore treat it as abandoned. The judgment of the court in the contempt proceeding has no bearing upon the liability of Smith for rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\"> Pickford testified that . . when he entered into the agreement of October 7th, he took over pursuant to that agreement the entire hotel and its operations . . .\u201d Also in Smith\u2019s complaint in case No. 6476, he himself alleged that \u201cThe proposition contained in the said letter [of October 7] was by the said plaintiff [Smith] duly accepted in writing, and thereupon the said Thomas H. Piekford took possession of the Hotel Lafayette and continued in the conduct and operation of said business for a period of more than two months . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The leases upon the hotel, and the furnishings thereof, had been made the subject of certain trust deeds securing the payment of balance of purchase price of assignment of the leases and sale of the furnishings \u2014 all as more particularly described in the opinion of this court in case No. 6476. Apparently, from the record, possession of the hotel was turned over to these trustees by Smith on September 13, 1932, and by them restored to Smith on September 21. But no point is made of this in the briefs, and it could have had no effect upon the liability of Smith for rent due September 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
