The court sentenced him to serve one year in jail and to pay a fine of $1,000 on count two, and to serve six years in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>penitentiary and to pay a fine of $5,000 on count four, the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Petitioner contends that the court was without jurisdiction, to impose a judgment and a sentence on count four because the offense charged therein is the same as the offense charged in count three on which he was found not guilty; that count four and counts one, two and three charged the same offense; and that he has been put in jeopardy and is being punished more than once for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Petitioner was never in jeopardy on count one. It was dismissed before trial. The general rule is that a person is not in jeopardy until he has been arraigned on a valid indictment or information, has pleaded, and a jury has been impaneled and sworn;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and where a case is tried to a court without a jury, jeopardy begins after accused has been indicted and arraigned, has pleaded and the court has begun to hear evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACU\">It is clear from a reading of the indictment that count two charges an offense under section 241, supra, and that counts three and four charge separate and distinct offenses defined in section 242, supra. This court in Curtis v. U. S., 67 F.(2d) 943, at page 947 said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">\u201cThe test of the identity of offenses is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them (Moorehead v. United States [(C.C.A.) 270 F. 210], supra); or whether, if what is set out in the charge to which the plea is interposed, had been proven in support of the charge, acquittal of which is asserted as a bar, it would have sustained a conviction on the latter charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">See, also, Morgan v. Devine, 237 U.S. 632, 35 S.Ct. 712, 59 L.Ed. 1153; Brady v. U. S. (C.C.A.8). 24 F.(2d) 399; Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365, 22 S.Ct. 181, 46 L.Ed. 236; Burton v. U. S., 202 U.S. 344, 26 S.Ct. 688, 50 L.Ed. 1057, 6 Ann. Cas. 362; Gavieres v. U. S., 220 U.S. 338, 31 S.Ct. 421, 55 L.Ed. 489; Yep v. U. S. (C.C.A.10) 81 F.(2d) 637; Chrysler v. Zerbst (C.C.A.10) 81 F.(2d) 975, 976. In the latter case, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-11\">\u201cWhere the same transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied in determining whether there are two offenses, is whether each requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">In order to convict under count two, it was necessary to prove that the petitioner endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the administration of justice in a United States Court by threats or force. In order to convict under count three, it was necessary to prove that petitioner and his codefendant agreed together to deter by force, intimidation, or threats, a witness from testifying freely, fully and truthfully in a certain case pending in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. In order to convict under count four, it was necessary to prove that petitioner and his codefendant agreed together to injure a witness on account of his having testified before the grand jury, concerning a matter pending in said court. Under the test above stated, it is plain that each count charged a separate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">It is also contended that petitioner is being unlawfully detained under the judgment and sentence imposed under the second count. He was sentenced to one year in jail and to pay a fine on that count, but the commitment erroneously recited that he had been sentenced to serve one year in the penitentiary on that count. It is not now necessary to determine the effect of the error in the commitment. The petitioner is now lawfully imprisoned under the sentence of six years on the fourth count. \u201cWithout restraint which is unlawful, the writ may not be used.\u201d Newman v. Zerbst (C.C.A.10) 83 F.(2d) 973, 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> United States v.
