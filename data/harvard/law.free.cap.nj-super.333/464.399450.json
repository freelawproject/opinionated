We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Judge O\u2019Donnell, who tried the contested issues at the time of the divorce, including those relating to equitable distribution, expressed his findings and conclusions in letter opinions dated May 4 and May 26, 1981. In making his equitable distribution determination regarding the pension, the judge expressly relied on <em>Kikkert v. Kikkert, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 427 A.2d 76 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>4, 438 A.2d 317 (1981), and determined that that asset of the sixteen-year marriage should be distributed equally. After applying the coverture fraction, the judge calculated the marital value of the pension at the time the complaint was filed at $433.63 per month and, assuming defendant\u2019s retirement at age sixty-five, the judge made the following award in the June 30, 1981 judgment of divorce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>[U]pon defendant attaining the age of 65 years, plaintiff shall be awarded one-half of defendant\u2019s pension, at its value on August 1,1979 in the amount of $433.63, or $216.82 per inonth[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In 1987, after qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) were authorized by federal statute, a consent order was entered to satisfy the requirements of the pension administrator. The order provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiff was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">to begin receiving payments in the amount of $216.62 [sic I per month at the time the participant [defendant] reaches the age of 65 years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Defendant, however, retired on January 14, 1996, at the age of fifty-six and began collecting his pension. By letter dated February 8,1996, the pension administrator advised plaintiff of that fact and proposed to begin immediate payment to her of the dollar share fixed in the QDRO, $216.62 per month. On February 26, the pension administrator\u2019s position had changed to one of strict compliance with the terms of the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-9\">[Y]ou will commence your portion of the pension benefit payment of $216.62 ... when Mr. John Korbeil reaches age 65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">After commencement, your pension payments will be made over Mr. Korbeil\u2019s lifetime. If Mr. Korbeil predeceases you before you commence your benefit, no payments will be made to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">In September 1996, plaintiff filed a post-judgment motion seeking immediate payment of her share of defendant\u2019s pension and requiring defendant to pay plaintiff arrears that had accrued since defendant started receiving the pension. Defendant opposed the motion, claiming that, because he had retired early, plaintiff was not entitled to the full amount set forth in the judgment of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">On October 21, 1996, Judge Herr ordered the parties to \u201cretain an actuary to calculate the marital value of Defendant\u2019s AT &amp; T pension pursuant to the Final Judgment of Divorce dated June 30, 1981, and the amount that would be distributed to plaintiff if one-half that value were paid to her monthly beginning on January 13, 1996, defendant\u2019s retirement date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">In December 1997, plaintiff filed another motion seeking arrears and an order compelling payment of $216.41 [sic] per month from defendant\u2019s pension. Defendant presented the court with a report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>from actuary Otis Ray, which said plaintiff was entitled to a monthly pension of $93.23. However, the Ray calculation was made on the erroneous assumption that the payment at issue was on a deferred vested pension and not a service pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Judge Bernhard recognized this error when he ruled in a January 23, 1998 proceeding: \u201c[T]here\u2019s no question that Mr. Ray\u2019s computations are in error ... they don\u2019t deal with the computation of [this] service pension and he gives you several indications that his computations don\u2019t apply if we\u2019re talking about a service pension[.]\u201d Judge Bernhard denied plaintiffs motion without prejudice, however, on the basis that \u201cno one has really complied with ... the order of the 21st of October 1996[,]\u201d and because the information which had been supplied by both parties was not sufficient upon which to base a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In May 1998, plaintiff again filed a motion seeking monthly payment of her share of the pension, arrears and counsel fees. Defendant filed a cross-motion seeking denial of plaintiffs motion, imposition of monetary sanctions against plaintiff and her attorney for \u201cintentionally violating\u201d Judge Herr\u2019s October 21, 1996 order, and an award of counsel fees. Defendant presented another actuary\u2019s report, from Charles Stipelman, which found that \u201cthe value of [the interest provided in the judgment of divorce as of August 1, 1979] adjusted to the earlier payment commencement date\u201d for defendant came to $115.71 per month for plaintiff. Judge Bernhard reviewed Stipelman\u2019s report and stated as part of his June 19,1998 oral disposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">Plaintiff continues to erroneously assert that her share of defendant\u2019s pension at the present time is $216.82 despite the fact that defendant retired at 56 years, three months and not 65. The $216.82 is the appropriate pension benefit she is entitled to receive when the defendant reaches 65 years of age. If she were entitled to receive a portion of defendant\u2019s present pension as retirement date of January 13, 1996, it would not be $216.82 as the actuarial fund would not have received an amount to pay that sum. The appropriate sum, if the plaintiff was to receive benefits based upon defendant\u2019s retirement at age 56 years, three months is $115.71---- Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s application for the defendant to make payments [is] misplaced. Therefore, the relief she requests] is inappropriate and is denied. This Court assumes that the next application will be payment for a sum of money from defendant\u2019s actual retirement date of January 13th, 1996. Plaintiff ... would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>be entitled to receive her share of the pension benefit either when he reaches 65 or some earlier date. In other words, the question I cannot answer, will AT <em>&amp; </em>T pay plaintiff $115.71 now and into the future? That\u2019s not a question before me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The judge recognized, however, that \u201cshe\u2019s probably entitled to something more than $115 if it starts now as opposed to the date of retirement,\u201d and he told the parties, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s a determination you have to get from AT &amp; T.\u201d The judge entered an order on the same day denying all relief requested by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Plaintiffs appeal from that order was eventually dismissed, after a Civil Appeals Settlement Program conference, in an order noting that the matter had been settled. Judge Herr in her later bench opinion determined that plaintiff had \u201cvoluntarily!] dismissed her appeal with the understanding that the trial court should properly address the pension issue\u201d based upon a new actuarial analysis from William Troyan, Inc. prepared at plaintiffs behest, as well as the Stipelman report.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Following the dismissal of the appeal, plaintiff filed another post-judgment motion seeking the entry of a \u201ccorrect and accurate\u201d QDRO, <em>i.e., </em>in the amount of $692.18 per month as calculated in the Troyan report, and counsel fees. Defendant filed a cross-motion seeking denial of plaintiffs motion and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On February 5, 1999, Judge Herr heard oral argument and rendered an oral decision. She observed therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">Instead of reflecting that plaintiff was entitled to 50 percent of the coverture fraction of defendant\u2019s pension, as required by <em>Kikkert, </em>the [1987] order reflected that she was to begin receiving payments of $216.62 per month when defendant reached age 65 with such payments to cease upon the death of either party.[ ] Of course, that comment ... \u201cPayments to cease upon the death of either party\u201d was also not part of any previous judgment of divorce or part of the opinion of Judge O\u2019Donnell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">The basis of that decision, as I\u2019ve already noted, was the language used by Judge O\u2019Donnell on May 26 [, 1981], wherein he ruled that plaintiff was entitled to one half defendant\u2019s pension accrued during the marriage in accordance with <em>Kikkert v. Kikkert, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 427 A.2d 76. Of course, Kikkert directed that if the present value of a pension could not be distributed to the non-employed spouse in the form of other available marital assets at the time of a divorce, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>should resort to \u201ca form of deferred distribution based upon fixed percentages.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 478, 427 A.2d 76.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">[Plaintiffs 1997 motion] was denied ... without prejudice to allow her get [the necessary] actuarial report. And the ... order of June 19th, 1998 [denied the relief she sought] specifically on the grounds that she failed to provide a proper actuarial analysis using the <em>Kikkert </em>formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">Neither of [the] values [contained in the Stipleman or Ray reports] were adopted by Judge Bernhard and plaintiff appealed the Jdne 19th, 1998 ruling that she failed to provide a proper actuarial analysis using the <em>Kikkert </em>formula. She then, voluntarily, dismissed her appeal with the understanding that the trial court should properly address the pension issue. Plaintiff now submits an actuarial analysis from William Troyan Incorporated, which has valued plaintiffs one half share of the marital portion of defendant\u2019s monthly retirement benefit That amount is $692.18. Obviously, this figure is significantly greater than the $216.82 per month value established at the time of divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Years of experience with QDRO have passed since ... <em>Kikkert </em>and also ... Judge O\u2019Donnell\u2019s imperfect implementation of <em>Kikkert. </em>While use of a present dollar amount, and the use of a percentage in his ... order and his decisions are confusing, Judge O\u2019Donnell\u2019s decision did provide for a method of distribution that was not as a practical matter even available until the enactment of the 1984 Retirement Equity Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">Thereafter, a court was able to assign a pension of an employed spouse to the non-employed spouse. Over the years, confusion was created by the dual use of conflicting terms. That is the set dollar figure used by Judge O\u2019Donnell as well as the 50 percent of the coverture fraction also used by Judge O\u2019Donnell!,] which percent of coverture fraction was clearly the appropriate language under his cited authority, that is, <em>Kikkert.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Mr. Troyan explains, in his report, that putting a dollar figure on the pension at the time of the divorce was not consistent with <em>Kikkert. </em>He said, \u201cThe dollar figure would have been applicable to the immediate offset evaluation method, but not the deferred distribution method,\u201d which <em>Kikkert </em>said ... was to be distributed by use of percentages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">Defendant says that a re-determination of the value of the pension is precluded by the doctrine [of] res judicata and collateral estoppel since the amount of the pension to be paid has been finally determined. And the only issue that is now open is how those payments are to be allocated in light of defendant\u2019s early retirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that those doctrines do not apply since the confusion and the use of the dollar amount and percentages requires equity to correct the confusion. Clearly, the intent of Judge O\u2019Donnell was to apply <em>Kikkert. </em>There\u2019s no doubt what <em>Kikkert </em>requires and plaintiff should receive the full share she\u2019s entitled to under the law. That share is 50 percent of the marital percent of the pension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Mr. Troyan has made that calculation and I shall permit him to prepare the necessary forms of orders and I shall sign the orders consistent with his determination. Both parties\u2019 requests! for counsel fees are denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Judge Herr\u2019s resulting order, from which defendant appeals, provides, in major part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">1. ORDERED, that the parties cooperate as necessary for Troyan Assoc, to prepare and furnish the Court and counsel with Qualified Domestic Relations Order or orders in accordance with the October 13, 1998 pension evaluation prepared by William Troyan Associates and to enable plaintiff to receive her benefits accrued since 1-13-96.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">2. FURTHER ORDERED, that Plaintiff shall escrow all funds received with her attorney except for $200.00 per month provided defendant has timely filed an appeal and diligently pursues the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">On appeal, defendant contends that plaintiff was barred from the pension distribution relief which she had sought and which the trial court ordered because plaintiff had made no timely filing of either an appeal from the judgment of divorce, or a motion for a new trial, or a motion pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:50-1. Defendant also asserts that the \u201c \u2018law of the case\u2019 [rule], collateral estoppel, and <em>res judicata </em>bar relitigation of the amount of [the] pension benefit awarded to plaintiff in the judgment of divorce[,]\u201d that \u201cthe doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel bar reconsideration of the judgment of divorce,\u201d and that the \u201ctime of decision\u201d rule was also violated. Finally, defendant argues that Judge Bernhard\u2019s June 19, 1998 ruling was correct, <em>i e., </em>that plaintiff was entitled to a reduced monthly benefit over that provided in the judgment of divorce by reason of defendant\u2019s early retirement, and that relitigation of that question is barred by operation of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">In addition to oppugning defendant\u2019s arguments, plaintiff also contends that she was entitled to the award of counsel fees which Judge Herr denied. The latter issue will not be considered in the light of plaintiffs failure to file a notice of appeal or cross-appeal from that portion of the trial court\u2019s order which denied her application for counsel fees. <em>See Sikes v. Township of Rockaway, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 465-66, 635 A.2d 1004 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>41, 648 A.2d 482 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Judge Herr was manifestly correct in her understanding of <em>Kikkert, </em>and how it applies to this ease. She was also correct in her evaluation of Judge O\u2019Donnell\u2019s laudable but imperfect effort to apply the standards of that then-recently-decided case to the instant matter. None of defendant\u2019s arguments suggest the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Defendant also does not dispute the correctness of the Troyan report. That report posits a pension valu\u00e9 at the time of defendant\u2019s retirement far in excess of the valuation proffered at the time of the divorce trial, to which no objection was registered at the time. The trial court came to rely upon the valuation then before it in framing its judgment-of-divorce determination distributing the pension, a provision which was improperly specific in establishing a dollar amount to be paid to plaintiff at some future date. It is of no consequence whether the valuation disparity which eventually became evident came about because an error was made in the pension valuation submitted to the court at the time of the divorce trial, or whether it was the result of market forces that produced extraordinary growth in the value of the pension asset in the interim, a factor that obviously could not have been predicted at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Defendant, rather, raises procedural-type bars to consideration of the pension\u2019s real value at the time Judge Herr made her determination. We reject the arguments advanced as misapplied, both because they elevate form over substance and because they propose an inequitable result in an area of the law that is preeminently one of equitable applications and objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">When Judge O\u2019Donnell engaged in his effort to apply Kikkert\u2019s standards governing deferred distribution of an interest in a pension asset, he created an ambiguity in the judgment of divorce by defining plaintiffs interest as a fixed amount. Although the then-present value of the pension, and plaintiffs percentage share of that asset at the time by application of the coverture fraction, could well have been correctly determined, there was no way the judge or anyone else could have known what the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>pension, and therefore plaintiffs fractional interest, was to be some years in the future, whether defendant retired at age sixty-five as then anticipated or came to opt for an earlier retirement, as he actually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The problem created could have been avoided by a buy-out, at the time, of plaintiffs interest in the pension for the then-present value of her share. But, as in many such situations, sufficient assets with which to effect a buy-out were not available as a practical matter. <em>See, e.g., Kikkert, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 477-78, 427 A.2d 76. If a buy-out could have been accomplished, plaintiff would have had the opportunity to profit from the growth over the years of the assets received, much as she is entitled to the benefit of passive growth factors affecting the pension as a whole and her undistributed interest in it. <em>See Risoldi v. Risoldi, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 540-41, 727 A.2d 1038 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>335, 736 A.2d <em>528 (1999); Reinbold v. Reinbold, </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 470-72, 710 A.2d 556 (App.Div.1998); <em>Marx v. Marx, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 421-28, 627 A.2d 691 (Ch.Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The equities of the matter are the same even if considered with a focus on defendant\u2019s interest in the pension asset rather than plaintiffs. As Judge O\u2019Donnell calculated the value of the parties\u2019 respective <em>in futuro </em>interests in the marital portion of the pension asset, plaintiff would receive about $216 per month and defendant $312 monthly. But the record reveals that defendant\u2019s interest in that portion of the pension asset alone has grown to about $770 per month, apart from the $1,752.82 he receives from the portion of the pension that is not part of the marital estate. Defendant is entitled to receive about $460 a month more in respect of the marital portion than was anticipated at the time of divorce. Were he to receive an even greater payment from plaintiffs share of the marital asset, the windfall would amount to an inequity.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Given the circumstances presented, Judge Herr\u2019s determination was appropriate under <em>R. </em>4:50\u20141(f), permitting relief from a judgment for any justified reason not subsumed within subsections (a) through (e) of the rule. A motion under subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(f) is to be made within a reasonable time in the circumstances, <em>see R. </em>4:50-2, and the party requesting relief must show that enforcement of the judgment would be unjust, oppressive or inequitable. <em>Quagliato v. Bodner, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 138, 278 A.2d 500 (App.Div.1971).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">Such a motion under (f) is addressed to the discretion of the trial court. That discretion is a broad one to be exercised according to equitable principles, and the decision reached by the trial court will be accepted by an appellate tribunal in the absence of an abuse of its discretion. No categorization can be made of the situations which would warrant redress under subsection (f). As Justice Proctor noted in <em>Hodgson v. Applegate, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>29, 41, 155 A.2d 97 (1959), the very essence of (f) is its capacity for relief in exceptional situations. And in such exceptional cases its boundaries are as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\"><em>[Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>334, 341, 225 A.2d 352 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Obviously, plaintiff could not have anticipated the issues\u2014any more than defendant could\u2014in advance of being notified by the pension administrator that defendant had opted for an early retirement. Her motion for relief followed with adequate dispatch after she learned of that fact and its consequences. And, given all the special circumstances presented, the equities clearly favor the result Judge Herr reached. Plaintiffs motion for relief from the judgment of divorce was properly granted under <em>R. </em>4:50\u20141(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Defendant\u2019s argument based on \u201claw of the case\u201d called for an application of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See State v. Hale, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 410-11, 317 A.2d 731 (App.Div.1974). We discern no misapplication of that discretion in Judge Herr\u2019s rejection of the argument in the circumstances presented. Moreover, collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata </em>simply have no application in a situation where a party seeks to resolve an ambiguity in a judgment or order or otherwise seeks clarification, as distinguished from an instance in which the opportunity to relitigate an issue is sought. <em>Dunne v. City of Boston, </em>41 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>922, 671 N.E.2d 518, 519-20, <em>review denied, </em>423 <em>Mass. </em>1113, 674 N.E.2d 245 (1996); <em>Mead v. Park Place Properties, </em>37 <em>Wash.App. </em>403, 681 P.2d 256, 259, <em>review denied </em>(1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">As far as we can tell from the record before us, defendant\u2019s remaining arguments were not raised before the trial court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>should not be considered on appeal. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). We will, nevertheless, dispose of them briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">An argument based on the \u201ctime of decision\u201d rule presupposes a change in the law. Defendant has established no fundamental change since <em>Kikkert </em>with regard to its \u201cfixed percentages\u201d rule governing deferred distribution of pension rights. <em>Kikkert, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 478, 427 A.2d 76. All that has been shown as having occurred was a facial error in applying the rule of that case. The trial court at the time of the judgment of divorce was simply unwarranted in fixing a dollar amount payout for plaintiffs share of the deferred pension asset at such time in the future as it would come into pay status. All that was authorized under <em>Kikkert </em>was the award of a percentage allocation of the asset between the parties, to be applied whenever the pension came into pay status. The June 19, 1998 disposition, although based essentially on the lack of an evidentiary basis supporting plaintiffs position, had the effect of perpetuating the error; but that June 19, 1998 result was rendered ineffective in any event by the terms and understandings attending plaintiffs voluntary dismissal of her appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Defendant argues, finally, that plaintiffs contentions were barred by the doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel. It suffices to say that these tools of equity jurisprudence cannot validly be used to sponsor an inequitable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The trial court\u2019s order of February 5, 1999 is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
