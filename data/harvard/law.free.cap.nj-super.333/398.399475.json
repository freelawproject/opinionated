American Water also sells water for resale to various municipalities, authorities and public utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">On January 12, 1998, American Water filed a petition with the BPU for permission to increase its rates. The matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Law, and an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) conducted a lengthy evidentiary hearing in which testimony was presented by American Water, the Ratepayer Advocate and various other interested parties. One of the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s objections to the rate increase petition was that American Water should not be allowed to treat any portion of its charitable contributions as operating expenses. The ALJ concluded that \u201cthis is a policy decision that only the [BPU] can make\u201d and \u201ccommend[ed] to the [BPU] this issue as one deserving of further consideration on a generic basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">When the BPU reviewed American Water\u2019s petition, it decided to adhere to its policy of allowing public utilities to treat a portion of their charitable contributions as operating expenses. The BPU also concluded that American Water\u2019s overall revenue requirement was $242,013,783. Accordingly, it allowed the company to increase its total revenues by 5.71%. The $49,593 of charitable contributions American Water was allowed to include in its operating expenses represent slightly more than two hundredths of one percent of its overall revenue requirements (.0205%). Consequently, the average residential consumer of water pays approximately eight cents more per year as a result of the inclusion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>portion of American Water\u2019s charitable contributions in its operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">On appeal, the only part of the BPU\u2019s final decision the Ratepayer Advocate challenges is the allowance of fifty percent of American Water\u2019s charitable contributions as operating expenses. The Ratepayer Advocate argues that this ruling was incorrect because charitable contributions are not germane to the operation of a public utility. The Ratepayer Advocate also argues that the BPU violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution by allowing American Water to treat charitable contributions as operating expenses, because this compels ratepayers to indirectly finance charitable activities that some ratepayers may find objectionable. We reject both arguments and affirm the BPU\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The BPU has been vested with \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in the exercise of its rate making authority. <em>In re Public Serv. Coordinated Transp., </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>196, 214, 74 A.2d 580 (1950). Thus, the BPU\u2019s decisions \u201care entitled\u201d to \u201cpresumptive validity,\u201d <em>In re Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>520, 527, 428 A.2d 498 (1981), and will not be disturbed unless a utility or other interested party can show an abuse of discretion. <em>In re New Jersey Power &amp; Light Co., </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>498, 508, 89 A.2d 26 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In <em>New Jersey Bell Tel. Co. v. State Dep\u2019t of Pub. Utils., </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>568, 596-97, 97 A.2d 602 (1953), the Court held that the BPU is required to allow a public utility to include some charitable contributions in its operating expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">[I]t has been held that where utility corporations have inherent or statutory power to make charitable gifts and donations, the payment is properly allowed in a rate determination as an operating expense where it has an effect upon the creation of the service or product of the corporation and therefore may be considered as reasonably necessary in the rendition of service to the consumer. This appears to be a salutary legal premise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Subsequent to <em>New Jersey Bell Telephone, </em>the BPU adopted a policy of allowing public utilities to treat a portion of their charitable contributions as operating expenses. See <em>In re Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>59 <em>P.U.R. </em>4th 42 (1984). In <em>New Jersey Dep\u2019t of the Pub. Advocate v. New Jersey Bd. of Pub. Utils., </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 515, 460 A.2d 1057 (App.Div.1983), this court recognized that \u201c[t]he [BPU] has consistently permitted reasonable, nondiscriminatory charitable donations to qualify as operating expenses in a utility rate case[,]\u201d and rejected the Public Advocate\u2019s challenge to the BPU\u2019s allowance of a portion of a water company\u2019s charitable contributions as operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In <em>In re Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. Rate Application, </em>94 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(Vol.8) 49, 53 (Bd. of Regulatory Comm\u2019rs), the BPU concluded that the expense of charitable contributions should be shared between ratepayers and shareholders on a s%o basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">The Board recognizes that Company contributions to charitable organizations result in direct and indirect benefits to the Company\u2019s employees, customers and communities because donations are made to community service agencies which are used by JCP &amp; L ratepayers. Donations are also made to universities and colleges located within or near the Company\u2019s service area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">However, the Board also recognizes that ratepayers have no say as to whether to contribute, how much to contribute or to what agencies contributions should be made----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">The Board will continue to review this issue in future cases. In the meantime, the Board is convinced that a 5%o sharing between ratepayers and shareholders is a more appropriate allocation than the prior 75/25 policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In the present case, the BPU decided to adhere to its policy of allowing public utilities to treat fifty percent of their charitable contributions as operating expenses, but left open the possibility of changing that policy in future rate cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">This Board continues to believe that charitable contributions by a public utility benefit ratepayers sufficiently to warrant some degree of rate recognition as an expense related to a utility\u2019s business operations. Indeed, a <em>5%o </em>sharing recognizes that a utility\u2019s customer benefit, either directly or indirectly, by virtue of contributions made to community funds, educational campaigns, and the like. Charitable contributions also enhance a utility\u2019s standing and good will in a community and therefore benefit shareholders. A \u2022'So sharing policy properly balances ratepayer and stockholder interests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>In the present case, the Advocate has not demonstrated abuse on the part of the Company with respect to the amount of its charitable contribution expenses.... While this Board has determined that a sharing of the Company\u2019s charitable contributions expense is reasonable, it remains committed, as stated in <em>JCP &amp; L Rates, </em>to the continuing review of Board policy in this area. Towards that end, Staff is to monitor the rate treatment accorded utility charitable contribution expenses in other jurisdictions and advise the Board accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">We perceive no abuse of discretion in the BPU\u2019s decision, consistent with prior agency policy, to allow American Water to include fifty percent of its charitable contributions in its operating expenses in calculating the rates charged consumers for water and sewer services. The allocation of fifty percent of those contributions to operating expenses has no appreciable impact on the rates American Water charges consumers. Moreover, the Ratepayer Advocate acknowledges that recipients of American Water\u2019s contributions are \u201cimportant contributors to the overall well being of the many communities served by the utility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Although a majority of other states do not allow public utilities to treat charitable contributions as operating expenses, a minority do allow public utilities to include at least a portion of their charitable contributions in operating expenses. <em>See, e.g., In re Diamond State Tel. Co., </em>149 A.2d 324, 331 (Del.1959); <em>Providence Gas Co. v. Burman, </em>119 <em>R.I. </em>78, 376 A.2d 687, 698-99 (1977); <em>see also Denver Union Stock Yard Co. v. United States, </em>304 <em>U.S. </em>470, 482-83, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>990, 997-98, 82 <em>L.Ed. </em>1469, 1479-80 (1938). Furthermore, the states that prohibit public utilities from claiming charitable contributions as operating expenses generally consider the issue to be within the discretionary authority of the state\u2019s public utility commission. <em>See, e.g., Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Florida Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 443 So.2d 92, 96 </em>(Fla.1983) (\u201cThe Commission has the authority to determine, as a policy issue, whether charitable contributions are to be included in operating expenses.\u201d); <em>South Cent. Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>702 S.W.2d 447, 452 (Ky.Ct.App.1985). Thus, the case law from other states relied upon by the Ratepayer Advocate simply shows that other state public utility commissions have made a different policy choice than the BPU concerning this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The Ratepayer Advocate does not argue that American Water\u2019s total charitable contributions are excessive or that any particular contributions are inappropriate or unreasonable. Instead, it contends that \u201c[t]he nature of the recipients or the amount of the donations is ... immaterially,]\u201d and that \u201call charitable contributions [should be] charged to the shareholders of the [utility].\u201d We reject this argument and conclude, essentially for the reasons set forth in the BPU\u2019s decision, that there is a reasonable basis for allowing a public utility to include a portion of its charitable contributions as operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The Ratepayer Advocate also argues that the BPU violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution by allowing American Water to treat a portion of its charitable contributions as operating expenses. The Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s theory is that the additional eight cents per year the average residential customer must pay for water service as a result of the allowance of this expense constitutes a \u201ccoerced\u201d contribution to \u201ccharitable organizations whose principles and activities some ratepayers may find objectionable,\u201d and thus violates rights of \u201cfree speech\u201d and \u201cexpressive association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Before considering this argument, we note that the BPU questions whether the approval of American Water\u2019s rate application, which allowed a portion of the utility\u2019s charitable contributions to be included in operating expenses, constituted \u201cstate action\u201d subject to the restrictions of First Amendment. <em>See Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>345, 350, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>449, 453, 42 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>477, 483-84 (1974) (indicating that the \u201cmere fact\u201d that a public utility is subject to \u201cextensive and detailed\u201d regulation \u201cdoes not by itself convert its action into that of the State\u201d); see <em>also American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 <em>U.S. </em>40, 52, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>977, 986, 143 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>130, 145 (1999) (\u201cAction taken by private entities with mere approval or acquiescence of the State is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>not state action.\u201d). However, the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s claim is predicated not only on the First Amendment but also the New Jersey Constitution, which grants \u201cfree speech rights ... that unlike the First Amendment, ... [are] not limited to protection from government interference.\u201d <em>New Jersey Coalition Against War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corp., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>326, 353, 650 A.2d 757 (1994), <em>cert, denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>812, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>62, 133 L.Ed.2d 25 (1995); <em>see also State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535, 560, 423 A.2d 615 (1980), <em>appeal dismissed sub nom., Princeton University v. Schmid, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>100, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>867, 70 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982). Moreover, the BPU\u2019s discussion of this point is limited to a brief footnote, which only asserts that there is \u201csome doubt\u201d whether the BPU\u2019s role in approving American Water\u2019s rate application provides the \u201crequisite state action\u201d to support a First Amendment claim. Therefore, we assume, without deciding, that a sufficient showing of \u201cstate action\u201d has been made, and proceed to the merits of the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s claim that the inclusion of a portion of a public utility\u2019s charitable contributions in its operating expenses violates ratepayers\u2019 free speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Although the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s argument rests on both the First Amendment and the New Jersey Constitution, with the exception of the \u201cstate action\u201d requirement, our courts \u201crely on federal constitutional principles in interpreting the free speech clause of the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d <em>Karins v. City of Atlantic City, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>532, 547, 706 A.2d 706 (1998); <em>see also Shelton College v. State Bd. of Educ., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>501, 518, 226 A.2d 612 (1967). Thus, the analysis of the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s claim under the First Amendment also encompasses its claim under the free speech guarantee of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s argument relies primarily upon a series of decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, <em>Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>209, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977); <em>Ellis v. Railway Clerks, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>435, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883, 80 L.Ed.2d 428 (1984) and <em>Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>292, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1066, 89 L.Ed.2d 232 (1986), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>hold that a nonmember of a union required to pay dues under the \u201cunion shop\u201d provisions of federal and state labor laws may not be compelled to contribute to the union\u2019s political and ideological activities. In <em>Abood, </em>the Court recognized that \u201ca union [may] constitutionally spend funds for the expression of political views, on behalf of political candidates, or towards the advancement of other ideological causes not germane to its duties as collective bargaining representative.\u201d 431 <em>U.S. </em>at 235, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d at 284-85. However, the Court held that \u201cthe Constitution requires ... that such expenditures be financed from charges, dues, or assessments paid by employees who do not object to advancing those ideas and who are not coerced into doing so against their will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235-36, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d at 285. Despite holding that nonmembers of a union may not be compelled to contribute to expressive activities with which they disagree, the Court denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for a blanket injunction preventing the union from collecting dues used for political or ideological activities from any nonmember, thereby imposing the responsibility on each individual nonmember to communicate his or her objections to the union. <em>Id. </em>at 237-42, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1800-03, 52 L.Ed.2d at 285-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In <em>Keller v. State Bar of Cal., </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>1, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2228, <em>110 </em>L.Ed.2d 1 (1990), the Court held that an attorney who is compelled to join an integrated state bar association in order to engage in the practice of law occupies a position similar to a worker compelled to pay union dues under a union shop provision and must be afforded the same right not to contribute to political and ideological activities with which the attorney disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">However, the Supreme Court has recently indicated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\"><em>Abood, </em>and the cases that follow it, did not announce a broad First Amendment right not to be compelled to provide financial support for any organization that conducts expressive activities. Rather, <em>Abood </em>merely recognized a First Amendment interest in not being compelled to contribute to an organization whose expressive activities conflict with one\u2019s \u201cfreedom of belief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>[Glickman v.

The Court observed that compelling contributions for such a purpose \u201ccannot be said to engender any crisis of conscience\u201d or to involve \u201cany political or ideological disagreement with the content of the message.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2139-40, 138 L.Ed.2d at 601-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wisc. Sys. v. Southworth, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1346, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>193 (2000), the Court declined to extend the reasoning of <em>Abood </em>and <em>Keller </em>to mandatory student fees that fund ideological student activities at a public university. The Court observed that the standard applied in <em>Abood </em>and <em>Keller, </em>under which dissenting union and bar association members may be required to contribute only \u201cto speech germane to the purposes of the union or bar association[,]\u201d is \u201cdifficult to define ... with ease or precision,\u201d and \u201cbecomes all the more unmanageable in the public university setting ... where the State undertakes to stimulate the whole universe of speech and ideas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1355, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 207. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201c[t]he First Amendment permits a public university to charge its students an activity fee used to fund extracurricular student speech if the program is viewpoint neutral.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1350, 146 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 200-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">In a concurring opinion, Justice Souter noted that a student who is compelled to contribute to a student activity fee that is distributed to numerous organizations engaged in a variety of expressive activities has a more attenuated relationship to expressive activity with which the student disagrees than a person who is compelled to pay dues that a union or bar association directly uses to promote its political or ideological agenda:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In the union and bar association cases, an individual was required to join or at least drop money in the coffers of the very organization promoting messages subject to objection. The connection between the forced contributor and the ultimate message was as direct as the unmediated contribution to the organization doing the speaking. The student contributor, however, has to fund only a distributing agency having itself no social, political, or ideological character and itself engaging (as all parties agree) in no expression of any distinct message.... Thus, the clear connection between fee payer and offensive speech that loomed largo in our decisions in the union and bar cases is simply not evident here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at -, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1360, 146 L.Ed.2d at 212 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Two significant limiting principles emerge from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions dealing with compelled contributions for expressive activities. First, the First Amendment only precludes compelled contributions to an organization which engages in expressive activities that are \u201cpolitical or ideological\u201d in nature. <em>Glickman, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 473, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2140, 138 L.Ed.2d at 602. Second, the First Amendment restrictions on compelled contributions apply only to individuals who have personal objections to an organization\u2019s expressive activities. <em>See Abood, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 237-42, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1800-03, 52 L.Ed.2d at 285-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s broad claim that the BPU violates the First Amendment by allowing a public utility to include a portion of its charitable contributions in operating expenses cannot be reconciled within these principles. The Ratepayer Advocate candidly acknowledges that most of American Water\u2019s charitable contributions are made to \u201cnonsectarian, apolitical institutions.\u201d The recipients of those contributions include educational institutions, medical research programs, hospitals, volunteer fire companies, first aid squads and the United Way. Although these charities undoubtedly engage in some expressive activities, such as fundraising, there is no indication those activities are political or ideological in nature. Consequently, as in <em>Glickman, </em>there is no danger that compelled contributions to such charities will \u201cengender any crisis of conscience.\u201d 521 <em>U.S. </em>at 472, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2139, 138 L.Ed.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">In its reply brief, the Ratepayer Advocate argues for the first time that some recipients of American Water\u2019s charitable contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>tions are \u201corganizations which some customers could find offensive to their personal beliefs.\u201d The Ratepayer Advocate identifies Morristown Memorial Hospital as an example of such a recipient, because it allegedly allows abortions to be performed in its facilities. However, there is no indication American Water\u2019s contributions to Morristown Memorial Hospital \u00e1re used to fund abortions. The Ratepayer Advocate also notes that American Water made three fifty dollar contributions to churches. However, the record does not indicate whether those contributions were made to the churches\u2019 general funds or for nonsectarian activities such as providing Thanksgiving dinners for the needy. Consequently, the relationship between American Water\u2019s contributions to these charities and the ideological views of any of its ratepayers is highly speculative. Moreover, the relationship between the inclusion in ratepayers\u2019 bills of the minuscule additional amounts represented by these contributions and any ideological objections ratepayers may have to some recipients is even more attenuated than the relationship between student activity fees and the expressive activities of some ultimate recipients of those fees discussed in Justice Souter\u2019s concurrence in <em>Southworth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In any event, if the Ratepayer Advocate had legitimate objections to some of the specific charitable contributions American Water claimed as operating expenses, it should have raised those objections before the BPU, thereby affording American Water an opportunity to respond. But insofar as the record before us indicates, the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s reply brief represents the first time it has objected to any of American Water\u2019s individual charitable contributions. Therefore, those objections are untimely and must be deemed to have been waived. <em>See Abbott v. Burke, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>287, 390, 575 A.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s First Amendment claim also must be rejected because it fails to identify any individual ratepayer whose free speech rights have been violated. The Ratepayer Advocate is a state agency which represents the financial interests of customers in matters relating to utility rates and policy. See Reorgani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>zation Plan No. 001-1994, set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1D-1. The Ratepayer Advocate does not allege that it is one of American Water\u2019s customers, nor does the Ratepayer Advocate seek to advance its own First Amendment claim. Instead, the Ratepayer Advocate asserts that the BPU\u2019s policy of allowing public utilities to treat a portion of their charitable contributions as operating expenses violates the First Amendment rights of hypothetical ratepayers who the Ratepayer Advocate presumes would object to the activities of some recipients of American Water\u2019s charitable contributions. Thus, the Ratepayer Advocate\u2019s First Amendment claim is a legal abstraction, without any connection to the personal beliefs of any identifiable American Water customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions dealing with compelled contributions for expressive activities do not support such a claim. The First Amendment right recognized in those decisions is purely an individual right. An individual who is required to pay dues to a union or bar association may not be compelled to contribute to non-germane political or ideological activities with which that individual disagrees. <em>See Abood, supra, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>at 235-36, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d at 285. However, such an individual may not prevent the organization from engaging in political and ideological activities with funds obtained from other persons who do not object to those activities. <em>See id. </em>at 235-36, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d at 284-85; <em>see also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>601, 610, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830, 839 (1973) (\u201c[C]onstitutional rights are personal and may not be asserted vicariously\u201d). Therefore, the Ratepayer Advocate may not rely upon presumed ideological objections to American Water\u2019s charitable contributions by unidentified, hypothetical ratepayers to prevent American Water from treating its charitable contributions as operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The Ratepayer Advocate relies upon <em>Cahill v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>76 <em>N.Y.2d </em>102, 556 N.Y.S.2d 840, 556 N.E.2d 133, cerf. <em>denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>939, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>344, 112 L.Ed.2d 309 (1990), which upheld a First Amendment challenge to the inclusion of charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>contributions in a utility\u2019s operating expenses. However, <em>Cahill </em>was decided prior to <em>Glickman </em>and <em>Southworth, </em>which limit the scope of First Amendment restrictions upon compelled contributions for expressive activities. Furthermore, one of the parties advancing the First Amendment claim in <em>Cahill </em>was an actual ratepayer who alleged that the defendant utility had contributed to organizations which engaged in activities that conflicted with his personal beliefs, rather than a public agency raising hypothetical First Amendment objections to any ratepayer being required to bear responsibility for the payment of any portion of a utility\u2019s charitable contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Finally, we emphasize that the BPU has not given public utilities carte blanche authority to include a portion of any and all charitable contributions in their operating expenses. A public utility is prohibited by statute from making contributions to candidates for public office and from \u201caid[ing] or promot[ing] the interests, success or defeat of any political party.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:34-45. We assume that the BPU also would prohibit a public utility from making contributions to charities with ideological missions that are likely to be offensive to a significant segment of the utility\u2019s ratepayers. Moreover, the Ratepayer Advocate could object to specific charitable contributions on this basis. However, the mere specter that the management of some utility could make contributions to inappropriate charitable recipients should not foreclose the BPU from allowing utilities to treat a portion of their contributions to non-ideological charitable organizations that perform vital public services as operating expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
