The loans were secured by real estate mortgages. Summit filed a foreclosure suit and Grove asserted a lender-liability counterclaim. Summit moved for summary judgment. Its motion relied in part on a mortgage modification agreement, allegedly duly signed and delivered, which contained Grove\u2019s release of any claims. The controversy which now confronts us arose from a discovery dispute engendered by the unexpected appearance among the documents in Summit\u2019s \u201cworking file\u201d of a photocopy of that mortgage modification agreement signed by one of Grove\u2019s partners. Summit\u2019s attorneys, respondents Gerald A. Liloia and Anthony J. Sylvester, subsequently admitted that they had caused the copy of the agreement to be placed in the file. It was apparently put there to corroborate Summit\u2019s claim that it had received a fax of the signed copy from Grove, but was unable to locate the document bearing the signature in ink of a Grove partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The matter before us is an appeal from an order of the Chancery Division which granted the Baxts\u2019 <em>R. </em>4:50-1(f) motion to reopen the judgment in the foreclosure suit, but denied sanctions on the ground that the attorneys had not violated any specific procedural rule upon which sanctions could be predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>The hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and his conclusions of law were entered after a hearing conducted at the direction of our Supreme Court. These findings are binding on us because they are amply supported by the evidence presented at the hearing. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors, Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). But we disagree with the judge's conclusions of law. Before we relate his findings and explain the basis of our disagreement with the conclusion which he drew from them, we need to describe the unusual procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">During the course of the foreclosure action between Grove and Summit, Grove\u2019s attorneys moved to dismiss Summit\u2019s complaint, to expunge the mortgage and for sanctions because of the conduct of Summit\u2019s attorneys during discovery. Before that motion had been disposed of, the Baxts commenced a separate lawsuit against Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester. In that separate lawsuit, the Baxts sought damages from Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester for the same conduct which was the subject of the sanctions motion. The Baxts alleged that that conduct violated the Rules of Professional Responsibility and constituted spoliation of evidence. The foreclosure action was then settled and the foreclosure case was dismissed, but the settlement agreement preserved the Baxts\u2019 right to pursue their damage claims in their separate lawsuit (which we will refer to as the \u201cdamage suit\u201d) against Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">That damage suit was eventually dismissed on Summit\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This court affirmed, with one judge dissenting from the majority\u2019s holding that no private cause of action could be based directly on a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Baxt v. Liloia, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>221, 664 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1995), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>190, 714 A.2d 271 (1998). The ease came before our Supreme Court by reason of the dissent, and the Court affirmed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but it castigated Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The record before this Court presents an object lesson in unprofessional behavior by experienced and knowledgeable trial lawyers. For a period spanning the course of at least one month, ... defendants Liloia and Sylvester knowingly and deliberately obstructed the discovery process in the Summit foreclosure action by misleading plaintiffs about the source of the signed modification agreement and by refusing to respond candidly to specific requests for direct and accurate information. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">The inference that may be drawn from this pattern of behavior is that defendants were stonewalling and that they intended to conceal from Grove\u2019s attorney the source of the signed copy of the agreement even after repeated clear requests for that information. That defendants placed the copy of the signed agreement in the bank\u2019s files prior to producing them for inspection as the bank\u2019s \u201coriginal\u201d files is particularly disturbing and suggests purposeful misrepresentation. Such conduct appears on its face to violate the New Jersey Rules Governing Civil Practice and the Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\"><em>[Baxt v. Liloia, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 206-09, 714 A.2d 271.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The Court then ordered the following redress for Mr. Liloia\u2019s and Mr. Sylvester\u2019s misconduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">But for the settlement of the foreclosure litigation, plaintiffs could have sought attorney\u2019s fees based on defendants\u2019 conduct in that lawsuit. Instead, the Baxts reserved the right to seek attorney\u2019s fees against defendants in this action. Because the dismissal of this action leaves plaintiffs without a remedy for defendants\u2019 discovery violations, and because the settlement agreement put defendants on notice that the issue of attorney\u2019s fees remained to be litigated, in the unique circumstances of this case[,] we will permit plaintiffs to go forward with then-reserved right to seek counsel fees by way of a motion pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:50-1(f).... They may within 30 days seek to reopen the order of dismissal in <em>Summit Trust Company v. Grove Mercantile Center </em>[the foreclosure suit] for the limited purpose of seeking recovery of reasonable expenses from Gerald Liloia and Anthony Sylvester for violations of the discovery rules. <em>See R. </em>4:23-3, -4. If plaintiffs pursue their ease in that forum, the trial court should determine the scope of defendants\u2019 misconduct and the appropriate amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to be assessed against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 210-211, 714 A.2d 271.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">In response to Mr. Liloia\u2019s and Mr. Sylvester\u2019s motion to the Supreme Court for reconsideration, the Court added the following footnote to its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">Our decision is based on the record before us on motion for summary judgment below. The trial court, if plaintiffs seek sanctions for discovery rule violations, and the OAE shall make their determinations <em>de novo on </em>the record as appropriately supplemented pursuant to this decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">[Id. at 211-12 n. 9, 714 A.2d 271.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The Baxts made a timely motion to reopen the foreclosure suit in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. The Chancery Division granted the motion. In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate, there is no merit to the argument that the Baxts\u2019 motion to open the judgment in the foreclosure suit should not have been granted. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">After considering the evidence submitted by the parties, the hearing judge ruled that no proof had been presented showing that Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester had violated any discovery rule. He therefore declined to impose sanctions. The Baxts have appealed from that ruling. They argue to us that sanctions should have been imposed in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate and because Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester violated <em>R. </em>4:18-1, <em>R. </em>4:23-2(b), and the spirit of the discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The following is a summary of the facts as found by the hearing judge. During discovery, Grove\u2019s attorneys produced their client\u2019s documents for Summit\u2019s attorneys\u2019 inspection. Significantly, those documents included a copy of the mortgage modification agreement signed in ink by Paul Hartman as a general partner of Grove. Summit requested copies of the documents which it had inspected, and the copies it received included a copy of the mortgage modification agreement signed by Mr. Hartman. Summit\u2019s own file contained a copy of that agreement signed only by its assistant vice-president, Jennifer Calenda-Cole, but not by Mr. Hartman.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Summit moved for summary judgment on the basis of the release language of the mortgage modification agreement. The motion was adjourned to permit discovery relevant to its enforceability. A court-appointed discovery master issued a written directive dated November 25, 1991, requiring Summit to produce three representatives for depositions to be taken by the Baxts. On November 27, one of the attorneys for the Baxts wrote Mr. Sylvester, asking to have Summit\u2019s original credit file available at the forthcoming deposition of Scott Witherspoon, a Summit officer. Mr. Sylvester refused, but Grove\u2019s attorneys proceeded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Mr. Witherspoon\u2019s deposition. On December 1, apparently after the conclusion of that deposition, Helen Chaitman, Esq., representing Grove, wrote to Mr. Sylvester listing documents she wanted produced for the forthcoming depositions of Elwood Bowman, III and Ms. Calenda-Cole. The list included a demand for \u201cthe entire original files in response to our document request.\u201d The hearing judge could not determine what \u201cdocument request\u201d the Grove attorney was referring to, but he speculated that the reference was to the November 27th letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Mr. Sylvester obtained Summit\u2019s \u201cworking loan file\u201d in preparation for the deposition the following day. Because Summit treated the file as an open, active file, more than 130 documents had been added to it since it was previously produced for inspection. Mr. Sylvester and Mr. Liloia met with Ms. Calenda-Cole immediately before her deposition commenced. Mr. Liloia advised putting the copy of the modification agreement with Mr. Hartman\u2019s signature into Summit\u2019s \u201cworking loan file.\u201d Ms. Calenda-Cole did so. The hearing judge determined the following about Mr. Liloia\u2019s advice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW4\">One can reasonably draw an inference that this discussion between the attorneys and Ms. [Calenda-Cole] was designed to in effect salt the bank\u2019s file with the document that had been obtained from Grove\u2019s file in order to mislead counsel. Thus when the loan file was presented to Ms. Chaitman on December four, it contained at least two copies of the modification agreement obtained from Grove\u2019s files. She was not told of this[,] but she had no reason to believe also that the loan file produced that morning was in precisely the same form as when she had inspected it six months earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">During the eourse of her deposition, Ms. Calenda-Cole testified that she did not remember receiving the signed copy of the mortgage modification agreement with Mr. Hartman\u2019s ink signature on it. Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester knew that Summit, did not have the original of the agreement, that is, the copy signed in ink by Mr. Hartman, because the copy in the file that they produced at the deposition was a copy of the document from Grove\u2019s files which Summit\u2019s attorneys had found there and which Grove had copied for them. Ms. Chaitman asked Ms. CalendaCole or Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester-the record is unclear to whom the question was directed-\u201cDo you have an original because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>I haven\u2019t seen one?\u201d Mr. Liloia answered, \u2018Whatever is in the files or in our attorney\u2019s office.\u201d Ms. Chaitman asked, \u201cThe only thing we have is the one that\u2019s unsigned completely[,] but I believe you submitted one that had a signature[,] <em>but is that just a fax? \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Despite having told Ms. Calenda-Cole just a few minutes earlier that the copy of the mortgage modification agreement copied from Grove\u2019s copy during document inspection should be put into Summit\u2019s \u201cworking loan file\u201d to be produced for inspection at the deposition, Mr, Libia\u2019s answer to Ms. Chaitman\u2019s question was, \u201cI don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to check.\u201d Mr. Sylvester added, \u201cI\u2019ll check the files.\u201d Ms. Chaitman then added, \u201cBecause I never saw one. That was the only one you ever produced in your papers that was assumed to have Paul Hartman\u2019s signature on it but I don\u2019t\u2014 whether you have the original or a faxed copy or what.\u201d Mr. Sylvester responded, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll have to check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The hearing judge commented about this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">Considering that the two attorneys and Ms. [Calenda-Cole] had only moments before had a conversation about the placement of the modification agreement in the file, their answers were disingenuous. There can be no doubt that Mr. [Liloia] and Mr. Sylvester were very much aware that the bank file contained no document bearing Hartman\u2019s original signature. And that the bank had no faxed copy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The attorneys gathered again a few days later for the continued deposition of Mr. Witherspoon. Ms. Chaitman said to Mr. Sylvester, \u201c[N]ow I would like to see the faxed copy which Jennifer [Calenda-Cole] received. Obviously, I\u2019m entitled to see that document since you are moving for summary judgment based on it.\u201d Mr. Sylvester told her, in effect, to \u201cstart asking questions of the witness\u201d because he was not there to be interrogated. A few minutes later, Ms. Chaitman asked Mr. Sylvester directly, \u201cThe copy annexed to the motion for summary judgment, was that taken from the bank\u2019s file?\u201d He answered, \u201cI\u2019m not here to answer questions. <em>I don\u2019t know. </em>You know I\u2019m not going to answer the questions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To Ms. Chaitman\u2019s repeated inquiries about the provenance of the document, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Sylvester answered that he would take her request under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">When the deposition of Ms. Calenda-Cole resumed, Ms. Chaitman asked her about the source of Summit\u2019s copy of the mortgage modification agreement with Mr. Hartman\u2019s signature on it. She answered that she did not know where The faxed copy that she believed existed came from. She was next asked the source of the copy of the agreement annexed to her affidavit. She answered that she did not know.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Mr. Liloia then interjected, \u201cI can tell you where it came from.\u201d He then told Ms. Chaitman that it came from her client\u2019s file, that it had been obtained during the inspection of that file during the lawsuit, and that it had been given to Summit by its attorneys to put in Summit\u2019s files.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">At this point, Ms. Chaitman interrupted the depositions and moved for sanctions. We emphasize that all of this discovery activity took place in the foreclosure action. We reiterate that before there was any disposition of the sanction motion, the foreclosure action had been settled. Summit was released from all claims. Although the Baxts specifically reserved their right to proceed against Mr. Liloia and Mr. Sylvester by a separate action, that separate damage action was dismissed by an order for summary judgment which was affirmed by our court and by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Commenting on the procedural path which had brought the matter before him despite the settlement of the foreclosure action and the affirmance of the dismissal of the damage action on summary judgment, the hearing judge\u2019s opinion declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">The Supreme Court opinion says that Grove\u2019s sanctions motion was not decided before the foreclosure action settled and that the Baxts did not specifically preserve as part of that settlement the right to seek sanctions against [Liloia] and Sylvester. One would think that should have been the end of it. Baxt[s], represented by competent counsel, traded away their right to seek sanctions against the attorneys in that action for the overall benefits to them of the settlement agreement and for the additional right to pursue a separate and[,] as it turns out, meritless lawsuit against [Liloia] and Sylvester.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Nonetheless, the Supreme Court saw fit apparently out of some sense of outrage at the egregious conduct of the attorneys, to permit the Baxts to reopen this foreclosure matter and seek counsel fees. The Supreme Court left to this court to determine, \u201cthe scope of the defendant\u2019s misconduct and the appropriate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to be assessed against them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The hearing judge then noted that the remedy which the Supreme Court granted to the Baxts \u201cis predicated on [Liloia] and Sylvester having violated discovery rules\u201d and that the Court had cited <em>R. </em>4:23-3 and -4. However, he concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">[I]n this case demands were not properly made and while the attorneys may be criticized for failure to comply with emerging but as yet imprecise standards of professionalism, and perhaps for violating the rules of professional conduct with respect to the requirement of candor toward an adversary, they violated no discovery rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">This conclusion is inconsistent with what is the Supreme Court\u2019s, at least tentative, conclusion and directive that discovery sanctions are available and warranted, and that they should be imposed. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">We observe that <em>Rule </em>4:23-3 provides for reasonable expenses where the opposing party \u201cfails to admit ... the truth of any matter as requested under <em>R. </em>4:22,\u201d should the party requesting the admission thereafter prove the truth of the matter, and that <em>Rule </em>4:23-4 provides for costs where a party \u201cfails to comply with a demand for a copy of a document made pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:18-2.\u201d The relief sought here-attorne/s fees and costs-would have been available under those rules... By placing the signed agreement in Summit\u2019s files and by misleading plaintiffs as to its source, defendants violated the mandate of our Court Rules that fair dealing with opposing parties is an absolute requirement even in an adversary system such as ours....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">... [T]he trial court should determine the scope of defendants\u2019 misconduct and the appropriate amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to be assessed against them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-12\"><em>[Baxt v. Liloia, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 714 A.2d 271 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">We conclude that the hearing judge was obligated to comply with this clear mandate of the Supreme Court. <em>In re Plainfield-Union Water Co., </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>296, 303, 102 A.2d 1 (1954); <em>Brown v. Township of Old Bridge, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 494, 725 A.2d 1154 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>131, 741 A.2d 99 (1999); <em>Maxfield v. Board of Educ. of Ridgewood, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>267, 270, 525 A.2d 727 (App.Div.1986); <em>Hellstern v. Smelowitz, </em>17 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 370-71, 86 A.2d 265 (App.Div.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Furthermore, we hold that <em>R. </em>4:23-2(b) provides explicit authority to impose an attorney\u2019s fee as a sanction for the discovery misconduct at issue here. A judge had ordered \u201cthat certain limited discovery be conducted in connection with the issue of the enforceability and scope of Paragraph 4 [the release provision] of the Note Modification Agreement executed by The Grove Mercantile Center.\u201d Pursuant to that order, the court-appointed discovery master directed Summit to produce Ms. Calenda-Cole, Mr. Bowman and Mr. Witherspoon for depositions. The hearing judge found that Summit\u2019s attorneys and Ms. Calenda-Cole had formed a \u201cdesign[ ] to in effect salt the bank\u2019s file with the document that had been obtained from Grove\u2019s file in order to mislead counsel.\u201d The attorneys, but also Ms. Calenda-Cole, conducted themselves in accordance with that design. That sort of intentional frustration of a deposition by clearly unethical conduct directed at obstructing the accomplishment of the specific purpose of a court-ordered deposition-investigating \u201cthe enforceability and scope of [the release provision] of the Note Modification Agreement\u201dconstitutes non-compliance with the order to conduct discovery on that issue. <em>Cf. R. </em>4:23-1 (b) (\u201cFor the purposes of this subdivision,\u201d <em>ie., R. </em>4:23-1, \u201can evasive or incomplete answer is to be treated as a failure to answer.\u201d); <em>Kernan v. One Washington Park Urban Renewal Assocs., </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>437, 466, 713 A.2d 411 (1998) (Pollock, J., concurring). <em>R. </em>4:23-2(b) states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">If a party or an officer, director, or managing or authorized agent of a party ... fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery ... the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following: ... [T]he court shall require the party failing to obey the order to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, caused by the failure____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In the light of the facts of this case, this provision of the rules authorized the imposition of the attorney\u2019s fee sanction according to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Moreover, we need not base our conclusion on the happenstance that a witness who was a managing or authorized agent of Summit participated with Summit\u2019s attorneys in the obstruction of discovery. The Supreme Court declared in the present case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201c[b]y placing the signed agreement in Summit\u2019s files and by misleading plaintiffs as to its source, defendants violated the mandate of our Court Rules that fair dealing with opposing parties is an absolute requirement even in an adversary system such as ours.\u201d <em>Baxt v. Liloia, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 714 A.2d 271.
