The property is in the R-2 zone, permitting only single-family dwellings. In their complaint they allege that defendants Dan Smith and Ralph Catrambone, real estate brokers, failed to obtain a Certificate of Land Use before transferring title, as required by the City\u2019s land-use ordinance, and represented at closing that the Certificate of Occupancy produced by the seller satisfied the City ordinance requirement. Plaintiffs\u2019 seven-count complaint against Smith, Catrambone and the seller, Alec Palmer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> also alleges violations of the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to \u201448, negligence, breach of contract, breach of implied warranty and breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Plaintiffs now appeal the entry of summary judgment in favor of Smith, and from a judgment of involuntary dismissal in favor of Catrambone entered during a bench trial at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 ease. We affirm the summary judgment in favor of Smith and reverse the judgment of involuntary dismissal in favor of Catrambone. We conclude that Catrambone\u2019s statement to plaintiffs that the Certificate of Occupancy satisfied the Certificate of Land Use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>requirement established a prima facie case under the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2. We therefore remand for further proceedings as to the consumer fraud claim against Catrambone.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In 1989, plaintiff Sung Ji (Ji), noticed a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign in front of a four-unit property on South Kingston Avenue, Atlantic City. He contacted Catrambone, a real estate broker with whom he had previously dealt and who knew that he was looking for investment property. It is undisputed that the property is in the R-2 zone, permitting only single-family residential use.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Ji and Catrambone inspected the four-unit property. Together they evaluated the income and expense records of the property. Catrambone drafted a contract of sale dated June 1, 1989, with a purchase price of $175,000. Catrambone added to the preprinted contract several clauses, including paragraph 23, which stated, \u201cThe Seller will pay for and provide Buyers with Certificates of Occupancy and Certificate of Land Use from the City of Atlantic City and that said certificates shall reflect no violations.\u201d Smith, the listing broker, produced a Certificate of Occupancy issued by the City\u2019s Code Enforcement Administrator. The Certificate of Occupancy stated that the property had been inspected in accordance with the City\u2019s adopted BOCA Codes and was \u201cnot in violation of currently effective Municipal Property Maintenance Code.\u201d However, no Certificate of Land Use was produced by Palmer or Smith at the time of closing. Plaintiffs nevertheless closed title to the property on September 15, 1989.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In February 1993, plaintiffs were charged with violating the Atlantic City Zoning Ordinance for failing to receive an approved Certificate of Land Use for the four units.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the complaint against Smith was dismissed in its entirety. The trial court denied Catrambone\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 consumer fraud claim, but dismissed the remaining counts, including the count alleging negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">During the bench trial, plaintiffs called Catrambone as their witness. Catrambone explained that he had no knowledge of the zoning restrictions affecting the property, and never stated to plaintiffs that there might be a problem operating the property as a four-unit complex. He stated that a representative of Dan Smith Realty had advised him that the property had been used as a four-unit complex since the 1960s. Catrambone conceded that he reviewed with Ji the rental income and expense history of the units, obtained from Multiple Listing and Dan Smith Realty, because Ji \u201cwanted to know if [the property] made a profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The June 1, 1989 contract prepared by Catrambone contained an attorney\u2019s review clause. <em>See New Jersey Bar Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Realtor Boards, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>470, 479-80, 461 A.2d 1112 .(1983). Catrambone advised Ji that he intended to send the contract to Ji\u2019s real estate lawyer, but Ji told him that he did not want an attorney. Catrambone testified that he placed several additional clauses in the contract for plaintiffs\u2019 protection, including paragraph 23, requiring the seller to produce Certificates of Occupancy and a Certificate of Land Use. He acknowledged that the certificates are separate and distinct documents, the Certificate of Occupancy certifying the habitability of a structure, and the Certificate of Land Use certifying that the present use of a property is permitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He had obtained Certificates of Land Use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>from the City of Ventnor, but did not know whether such certificates were necessary in Atlantic City. He nevertheless included paragraph 28 in the event such a certificate was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Catrambone explained that at closing Dan Smith Realty advised him that \u201cthey couldn\u2019t get a Certificate of Land Use, and that the City was issuing something else instead.\u201d The representative said to him, \u201cRalph, don\u2019t worry, the property has been four apartments for at least back to sometime in the \u201960s.\u201d Catrambone testified, \u201c[W]e were told that the Certificate of Occupancy took the place of the Certificate of Land Use,\u201d and explained, \u201cHow was I not to believe that this [Certificate of Occupancy] was not acceptable?\u201d Catrambone further testified, \u201cI looked at [the Certificate of Occupancy] and handed it to [Ji] and said ..., \u2018This is what they\u2019re giving us. This looks acceptable to me.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Ji testified that he did not recall seeing the Certificate of Land Use, explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what is a land use certificate, honestly.\u201d He also testified that Catrambone did not suggest that the closing be suspended to permit Ji to consult an attorney, nor did he disclose that there might be a problem with the documents submitted by the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs, the trial court entered a judgment of involuntary dismissal in favor of Catrambone. <em>See R. </em>4:37-2(b). The court identified the single issue to be decided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">whether Catrambone engaged in affirmative acts so as to induce plaintiffs into believing that the premises in question could be legally used as a four-family building or by remaining silent when he knew that it could not be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The court concluded that no rational factfinder could find that Catrambone knew that the property was subject to zoning constraints because the testimony was uncontradicted that he was under the impression \u201cas was everyone else involved in this deal, that it could be used for four units.\u201d It rejected plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>argument that a review of income and expense figures relating to the rental units constituted an \u201caffirmative misrepresentation.\u201d It stated that \u201c[Catrambone] went over figures that were provided by others; that\u2019s what he did,\u201d conduct which, the court remarked, \u201ccould not possibly be what is intended to be covered by the Consumer Fraud Act as a misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Plaintiffs first argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their negligence count against Catrambone by summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">During the summary judgment motion, plaintiffs pressed their claim of negligence against Catrambone, arguing that he was negligent in failing to determine and disclose that present zoning restrictions prohibited the subject property\u2019s use as a four-unit dwelling. At the close of the arguments, the trial court denied in its entirety Catrambone\u2019s motion for summary judgment, but granted Smith\u2019s motion dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and Catrambone\u2019s cross-claim against him. Catrambone\u2019s counsel then reminded the court that if the negligence claim against Catrambone remained, then Catrambone\u2019s cross-claim against Smith seeking contribution based on Smith\u2019s own negligence should remain as well. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Let\u2019s make it clear, then. The two issues in the case that are going to require trial are the consumer fraud aspect of Catrambone\u2019s \u201csitting down and talking to Ji about the facts and figures and going over with it\u2014going over that with him and leading him to the conclusion that he could buy this property as a four-family property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">And secondly, that Catrambone knew that this was a four\u2014a single-family area\u2014zoned area\u2014and that he failed to reveal that to Ji.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">MR. HUNDERTMARK [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">THE COURT: And that can go to both negligence\u2014well, that\u2019s not negligence. That\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">MR. WOOD [Catrambone\u2019s counsel]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-13\">THE COURT: That\u2019s consumer fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">MR. HUNDERTMARK: <em>That\u2019s consumer fraud. I mean, I can live with that, </em>Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>THE COURT: Okay. Okay. So, that he knew that it was a single-family zoned area and that he failed to tell Mr. Ji about that and that would be an act of consumer fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">So, that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try the case on, then. Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">MR. WOOD: <em>As long as we\u2019re clear there is no longer a negligence claim in this case. The only thing that\u2019s left is Mr. Catrambone\u2019s knowing omission and Mr. Catrambone </em>h <em>fact that he sat down with Mr. Ji, 1 have no objection to having Mr. Smith dismissedfrom the case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">As a result, a partial summary judgment order was entered dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint against Smith and Catrambone\u2019s cross-claim against Smith. The order further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">4. Any and all claims by plaintiffs against defendants Ralph Catrambone and Shenkman and Catrambone Realty, except for the alleged violation of the Consumer Fraud Act, be and hereby are dismissed, with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-11\">5. The only issues for trial in this matter are whether defendant Ralph Catrambone violated the Consumer Fraud Act by engaging in affirmative acts so as to induce plaintiffs into believing that the premises in question could be legally used as a four family building, or by remaining silent when he knew that it could not be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">We are satisfied that the concession by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on the motion for summary judgment forecloses their contrary argument on appeal. <em>See Misani v. Ortho. Pharm. Corp., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>552, 555-56, 210 A.2d 609, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>382 <em>U.S. </em>203, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>398, 15 L.Ed.2d 270 (1965); <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Vision Mortgage Corp., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 143, 689 A.2d 154 (App.Div.1997). During the motion, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated, \u201cI can live with that,\u201d when the trial court narrowed the issues to plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Consumer Fraud Act. Catrambone specifically dismissed his cross-claim against Smith, couched in negligence, in reliance on counsel\u2019s statement. Moreover, the dismissal rendered unnecessary additional discovery and no doubt use of experts to address whether Catrambone and Smith had a duty to investigate the zoning status of the subject property, and whether they had breached that duty. Because of the concession by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the trial court concluded that it was unnecessary to decide those issues. Plaintiffs cannot now resurrect their negligence claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in granting Catrambone an involuntary dismissal of their consumer fraud claim. Specifically, they argue that the evidence, taken with the legitimate inferences therefrom, could sustain a judgment in their favor, <em>see Rule </em>4:37\u20142(b), based on Catrambone\u2019s: (1) \u201comission\u201d in failing to tell them that the property was zoned for single-family residential use only; (2) \u201caffirmative misrepresentation\u201d that the property was a permitted four-unit dwelling by reviewing with plaintiffs the income and expense history of the rental units; and (3) affirmative misrepresentation at closing that the Certificate of Occupancy satisfied the City\u2019s requirement that a Certificate of Land Use be obtained upon transfer of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">On a motion for involuntary dismissal under <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b), the judicial function \u201cis quite a mechanical one. The trial court is not concerned with the worth, nature, or extent (beyond a scintilla) of the evidence, but only with its existence, viewed most favorably to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). Even where the matter is tried without a jury, as here, the motion must be denied if plaintiff has demonstrated a prima facie case, that is, \u201cany evidence including any favorable inferences to be drawn therefrom which could sustain a judgment in plaintiffs favor.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 2 on <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b) (2000); <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 535, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">N.J.S.A 56:8-2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">The act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate, or with the subsequent performance of such person as aforesaid, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The Consumer Fraud Act is intended to protect consumers from deception and fraud, \u201ceven when committed in good faith.\u201d <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 604, 691 A.2d 350 (1997); <em>see also Cox v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>2, 16, 647 A.2d 454 (1994). \u201cAn intent to deceive is not a prerequisite to the imposition of liability.\u201d <em>Gennari, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 691 A.2d 350 (citing <em>Strawn v. Canuso, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>43, 60, 657 A.2d 420 (1995)). Consumer fraud may consist of affirmative acts or acts of omission. <em>Strawn, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 657 A.2d 420. In contrast to a claim of an actionable \u201comission,\u201d which requires a finding that the defendant acted \u201cknowingly,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>\u201c[o]ne who makes an affirmative misrepresentation is liable even in the absence of knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentation, negligence, or the intent to deceive.\u201d <em>Gennari, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 691 A.2d 350; <em>Strawn, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 657 A.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">During Catrambone\u2019s motion for involuntary dismissal, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded that he could not demonstrate that Catrambone \u201cknowingly\u201d concealed the fact that the subject property was zoned only for single-family residential use. Indeed, the concession was firmly grounded on the facts. Catrambone\u2019s testimony that he did not know about the zoning restriction was uncontroverted. Thus, plaintiffs claim based on a knowing omission was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Plaintiffs next argue that Catrambone\u2019s act of \u201csitting down and going over profit and loss figures with [Ji],\u201d constituted an affirmative misrepresentation because it reinforced the seller\u2019s misrepresentation that the subject property could legally be used as a four-unit complex. We do not agree. Reviewing the net cash flow generated by the units was hardly a misrepresentation regarding the zoning regulation of the property. At best, it merely confirmed the earning capacity of the units, not that the complex was a permitted use. Further, the rental figures, while material to the transaction, were not false in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">More troubling are Catrambone\u2019s statements during the closing. Catrambone himself had added paragraph 23 to the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>requiring the seller to produce Certificates of Occupancy and a Certificate of Land Use. He testified that he knew the conceptual difference between the two, and that he expected the seller to produce the Certificate of Land Use. When the seller did not do so, Catrambone gave the Certificate of Occupancy to Ji and stated to him, \u201cThis is what they\u2019re giving us. This looks acceptable to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In order to establish an affirmative misrepresentation violative of the Consumer Fraud Act, plaintiffs were not required to show Catrambone\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of his statement or an intent to deceive. <em>Strawn, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 60, 657 A.2d 420. An affirmative misrepresentation in the context of the Act is \u201cone which is material to the transaction and which is a statement of fact, found to be false, made to induce the buyer to make the purchase.\u201d <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 535, 672 A.2d 1190 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>148 N.J. 582, 691 A.2d 350 (1997). A statement or matter is material if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">(a) a reasonable person would attach importance to its existence in determining a choice of action ...; or (b) the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important in determining his choice of action, although a reasonable man would not so regard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\"><em>[Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 538(2) (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\"><em>See also Strawn, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 64 n. 4, 657 A.2d 420. Whether or not Catrambone\u2019s statement was material is a fact issue left unresolved by the trial court. Ji may or may not have attached importance to the statement in determining whether to close title, or Catrambone may or may not have known that Ji regarded or was likely to regard the statement as important in deciding his choice of action. Because Ji candidly acknowledged during his testimony that he did not recall any conversation regarding the Certificate of Land Use, a factfinder may reasonably conclude that Catrambone\u2019s statement was inconsequential. But the entirety of the testimony and proofs must be considered in resolving that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Catrambone\u2019s statement that the Certificate of Occupancy was \u201cacceptable\u201d was, in our view, a statement of fact that the doeu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ment satisfied the requirement that a Certificate of Land Use be obtained upon closing of title. The fact that plaintiffs were cited by the City for operating the four-unit complex without the certificate established the falsity of Catrambone\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The question whether the statement \u201cinduced\u201d Ji to follow through with the purchase was also left unanswered by the trial court. We note in that regard that Catrambone never put forward his proofs concerning the issues of the materiality of the statement or whether the statement induced plaintiffs to close title.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the involuntary dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 consumer fraud claim against Catrambone and remand for further proceedings. Because the case was tried without a jury, the matter should be returned to the trial court which entered the order for the purpose of receiving the testimony and proofs of Catrambone, if any. Upon completion of the case, the trial court should make findings of fact and conclusions of law on the affirmative misrepresentation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Plaintiffs also argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Smith, dismissing their complaint in its entirety against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The Consumer Fraud Act prohibits the unlawful conduct <em>\u201cby any person </em>... in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise or real estate....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-2 (emphasis added). Accordingly, plaintiffs may pursue a consumer fraud claim against Smith, despite the fact that he was not acting in a representative capacity as their broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">However, the problem with plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that it is based on the trial testimony of Catrambone concerning alleged misrepresentations by a representative of Dan Smith Realty concerning the acceptability of a Certificate of Occupancy in lieu of a Certificate of Land Use. In reviewing a summary judgment, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>can \u201cconsider the case only as it had been unfolded to that point\u201d and the evidential material submitted on that motion. <em>Bilotti v. Accurate Forming Corp., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>184, 188, 188 A.2d 24 (1963); <em>Scott v.

According to the summary judgment record before us, nothing supports a prima facie case of consumer fraud or negligence against Smith.
