We conclude that even though a teacher has no right to an adjudicatory hearing to challenge such a finding unless DYFS concludes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the teacher\u2019s conduct constitutes \u201csubstantiated\u201d child abuse, the teacher may challenge the wording of the finding on the ground that it is misleading and unfairly damaging to his reputation. We also conclude that DYFS inaccurately and unfairly conveyed the impression that its finding was based on an adjudicatory hearing by stating in a letter to the teacher\u2019s employer that the finding was based on \u201cthe preponderance of the credible evidence.\u201d Accordingly, we require DYFS to send a corrected finding to the teacher\u2019s employer which clearly states that the finding was investigatory only.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On November 18, 1998, DYFS received a referral from the principal of an elementary school in Kearney who reported that the father of a first grader alleged that a teacher in the school, M.I.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had grabbed his daughter, R.P., by the back of the neck. DYFS assigned an investigator to the matter, who interviewed R.P., her mother, father and sister, and various students, teachers and school administrators. R.P. stated that she had been engaged in \u201chorseplay\u201d with another student on the playground. M.I. started yelling at her, while holding onto her neck, which caused her to cry. R.P. said that M.I.\u2019s \u201cgrasp was hard and it hurt.\u201d R.P.\u2019s allegations were corroborated by her older sister, who stated that she saw M.I. holding R.P.\u2019s neck, and that she yelled at M.I. to get his hands off of her sister. In addition, R.P.\u2019s father told the investigator that when R.P. came home from school, he noticed what appeared to be an adult handprint on the back of her neck. R.P.\u2019s mother told the investigator that she did not see any redness on R.P.\u2019s neck when she returned home from work, but that her daughter was upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">M.I. told the investigator that one of his responsibilities was to be a \u201cpatrol adviser.\u201d A \u201cpatrol\u201d student reported that he had seen R.P. run off the school property just before the beginning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>school, and that he had also seen her kick another student. M.I. tried to question R.P. about her behavior, but she was crying so hard he could not question her. Consequently, he escorted R.P. back to her classroom and described what had happened to R.P.\u2019s teacher. According to the DYFS investigator, M.I. \u201cemphatically denied that he had any physical contact with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">R.P.\u2019s teacher and a teacher\u2019s aide assigned to the classroom told the DYFS investigator that R.P. did not complain of any pain or discomfort after M.I. brought her back to the classroom, and that they did not notice any mark on her neck. Several of the students interviewed by the DYFS investigator stated that they had seen M.I. yelling at R.P., but none of them saw him grab her by the back of the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Based solely on the information obtained in the investigator\u2019s interviews, DYFS sent a letter to the Kearney Superintendent of Schools, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">On November 18, 1998, the Division\u2019s Northern Regional Investigation Unit received an allegation of physical abuse at the above named facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">An investigation was conducted. <em>Physical abuse was not substantiated, in accordance with the child abuse/neglect statutes of the State of New Jersey. However, there were concerns relative to the actions of School Teacher [M.I.]. </em>The child sustained superficial injuries, red linear marks to her neck, as a result of this incident. Medical attention was not required. Physical intervention was determined to be unjustified and inappropriate, placing the child at some unnecessary and undue risk of harm. Specifically, the preponderance of the credible evidence indicated that [M.I.] grabbed [R.P.] by the back of her neck. [R.P.] was neither a danger to herself or others. Physical contact was not necessary as well as being contrary to district policy. Excessive force was not utilized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Appropriate remedial/corrective action was taken at the onset of this investigation. [M.I.] was administratively counseled relative to the district\u2019s \u201chands off\u2019 policy. He was directed to have no contact with the child pending the outcome of this investigation. Finally, he was being closely supervised by the building principal. Please confirm, in writing, within thirty days, action taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Similar letters were sent to M.I. and R.P.\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">The Superintendent of Schools subsequently sent a letter to M.I., which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">As you are aware, the Division of Youth and Family Services conducted an investigation relative to the above matter. They concluded that the allegation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>physical abuse was not substantiated. However, they expressed concerns regarding your actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">The District has a responsibility to take the appropriate precautions to protect the student body when safety concerns arise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">This letter is to document that the appropriate precautionary actions have been taken. That is, you have been administratively counseled relative to the District\u2019s \u201chands off\u2019 policy and the building principal will continue to supervise you and all staff in an effort to avoid any future incidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">The District feels that based on the above, no further disciplinary or remedial action is required. This letter will become a part of your personnel file.... You should be aware that the District adheres to a progressive discipline system and that future incidents may result in more severe actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">In <em>In re Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning L.R., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 449-50, 729 <em>A.2d </em>463 (App.Div.1999), we held that DYFS has statutory authority to find that child abuse allegations against a teacher were \u201cnot substantiated,\u201d but that it has \u201cconcerns\u201d the teacher\u2019s conduct may pose a risk of harm to his or her students.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also concluded that although DYFS has the authority to report its concerns and recommendations to the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>district that employs a teacher, it does not have the statutory authority to order a district to take corrective action or submit a remedial plan. <em>Id. </em>at 452-56, 729 A.2d 468. Finally, we concluded that DYFS may transmit an investigatory finding that child abuse allegations against a teacher were \u201cnot substantiated,\u201d but that \u201cavailable information ... provides some indication that [a] child was harmed or placed at risk of harm,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-3.3(a)(2), to the school district that employs the teacher and to the child\u2019s parents, without affording the teacher an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 456-61, 729 A.2d 463. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that DYFS\u2019 findings were \u201cpurely investigatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 729 A.2d 463 (quoting <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 182, 698 A.2d 1275).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">M.I. does not challenge any of the holdings of our opinion in <em>L.R. </em>However, M.I. argues that DYFS\u2019 finding that <em>\u201cthe preponderance of the credible evidence </em>indicated that [M.I.] grabbed R.P. by the back of her neck\u201d (emphasis added) constituted an \u201cadjudication,\u201d and not simply an \u201cinvestigatory finding.\u201d M.I. expresses concern that such an \u201cadjudication\u201d could be introduced into evidence at a \u201ctenure charge\u201d or other administrative proceeding brought against him. M.I. also alleges that this adjudication will be damaging to his professional reputation. Consequently, M.I. argues that he is entitled to judicial review of DYFS\u2019 findings or, in the alternative, that DYFS\u2019 findings should be modified to delete any reference to the \u201cpreponderance of the credible evidence\u201d standard, thereby avoiding the implication that those findings are \u201cadjudicatory\u201d rather than \u201cinvestigatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Under Article I, paragraph 1, of the New Jersey Constitution, a person has a constitutional interest in protecting his or her \u201cgood name or reputation ... because of what the government is doing to that person....\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 105, 662 A.2d 367 (1995). A person\u2019s reputation may be entitled to constitutional protection even if he cannot show \u201cany other tangible loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 662 A.2d 367. Although a person\u2019s interest in protecting his reputation \u201ctrigger[s] the right to due process[,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>[d]ue process is not a fixed concept, ... but a flexible one that depends on the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106, 662 A.2d 367. \u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 481, 92 <em>S.Ct </em>2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, 494 (1972). Thus, even if a person has a constitutionally protected interest, it does not automatically follow that the person must be afforded an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing. <em>See High Horizons Dev. Co. v. State of New Jersey, Dept. of Transp., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>40, 48-54, 575 A.2d 1360 (1990); <em>New Jersey State Parole Bd. v. Byrne, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>192, 211, 460 A.2d 103 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In <em>In re Allegations of Sexual Abuse at East Park High Sch., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 714 A.2d 339 (App.Div.1998), and <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.R., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 715 A.2d 308 (App.Div.1998), we held that if DYFS finds that a child abuse charge against a teacher has been \u201csubstantiated,\u201d which results in the inclusion of his name in DYFS\u2019 Central Registry of child abusers, the teacher is entitled to an administrative hearing to contest the finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We concluded in <em>East Park </em>that \u201c[t]he loss of [a teacher\u2019s] good reputation, when the Central Registry information is shared with even a few private citizens, will irrevocably injure [the teacher\u2019s] previous good name[,]\u201d and that \u201c[a]ceording to <em>Doe, </em>this injury to good name and reputation, standing alone, is a protectible private interest under the New Jersey Constitution.\u201d 314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 162-63, 714 A.2d 339. We noted that a finding of substantiated child abuse would not only damage a teacher\u2019s reputation but also, by statute, bar his or her employment by a \u201cchild care employer! ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 714 A.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In <em>L.R., supra, </em>we distinguished <em>East Park </em>and <em>M.R., </em>and held that a teacher is not entitled to a hearing to contest a finding that child abuse allegations have not been substantiated but that DYFS has expressed concerns about the teacher\u2019s conduct, because such a finding \u201cis not included in the \u2018Central Registry,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cis intrinsically less damaging to reputation than a finding that child abuse charges have been \u2018substantiated\u2019....\u201d 321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 460, 729 A.2d 463. However, we did not say that such a finding has no adverse effect upon a teacher\u2019s professional or personal reputation, or that a teacher has no right to challenge the form of such a finding. We only concluded that \u201can investigative finding that child abuse allegations were \u2018not substantiated\u2019 does not have a sufficiently direct and substantial impact upon employment or familial relationships to \u2018entitle appellants to the due process protections required in adjudicatory proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 729 A.2d 463 (quoting <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 183, 698 A.2d 1275). Therefore, this case provides the first occasion for us to consider whether the dissemination to a teacher\u2019s employer of DYFS\u2019 finding that child abuse allegations against the teacher were \u201cnot substantiated,\u201d but that there is \u201csome indication that a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-3.3(a)(2), poses a sufficient risk of damage to a teacher\u2019s reputation to entitle the teacher to assert a claim that the wording of the finding is unfair and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Although a finding that child abuse charges \u201chave not been substantiated\u201d is less damaging to a teacher\u2019s reputation than a finding that such charges have been \u201csubstantiated,\u201d such a determination inevitably will have an adverse impact upon the teacher\u2019s reputation if it is accompanied by what appears to be an affirmative finding that the teacher has had improper physical contact with a student. For example, DYFS\u2019 finding in this case was placed in M.I.\u2019s personnel file, and the Superintendent of Schools sent a letter to M.I. which indicates that the school district views that finding as a determination by DYFS that M.I. had improper physical contact with R.P. Thus, it appears likely that the presence of this finding in M.I.\u2019s personnel file would be a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>impediment to him being considered for any future promotion in the district. In addition, the letter indicates that M.I. would be subject to \u201cmore severe [disciplinary] action\u201d if there were \u201cfuture incidents.\u201d The finding against M.I. also was sent to R.P.\u2019s parents, with no restriction upon further dissemination, and thus it is likely other persons in the school system and community learned of its contents as well. Consequently, the dissemination of DYFS\u2019 finding poses a genuine risk of significant damage to M.I.\u2019s professional and personal reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We have previously held in <em>East Park </em>and <em>M.R. </em>that the dissemination of DYFS\u2019 investigatory findings to a teacher\u2019s employer and others in the school and community poses a sufficient risk of damage to reputation to warrant due process protections. These decisions recognize that the damage to a teacher\u2019s reputation from a finding that a child abuse charge has been \u201csubstantiated\u201d is so significant that a teacher is entitled to an adjudicatory hearing. Although a finding by DYFS that child abuse allegations have not been substantiated, but that DYFS has expressed concerns about a teacher\u2019s conduct, does not entitle the teacher to an evidentiary hearing, <em>L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 456-61, 729 A.2d 463, we believe that the risk of damage to a teacher\u2019s reputation from such a finding is sufficient to warrant some due process protection. <em>See East Park, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 162-63, 714 A.2d 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">What due process requires depends in part on \u201cthe private interest at stake\u201d and on \u201cthe fiscal and administrative burdens ... additional procedural safeguards would entail.\u201d <em>J.E. on Behalf of G.E. v. Department of Human Services, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>552, 566-67, 622 A.2d 227 (1993). The impact upon a teacher\u2019s reputation of a finding by DYFS expressing concern about the teacher\u2019s conduct may be significant, especially if it is accompanied by what appears to be an affirmative finding by DYFS that a teacher has had improper physical contact with a student. Moreover, the \u201cfiscal and administrative burden\u201d involved in reviewing the form of such a finding to assure that it is not misleading and unfairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>damaging to a teacher\u2019s reputation is minimal. Therefore, we conclude that a teacher against whom such a finding is made has a due process right to challenge the wording of such a finding on the ground that it is misleading and unfairly damaging to his reputation. <em>Cf. Pelullo v. State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 349-50, 683 A.2d 558 (App.Div.1996) (indicating that even though the subject of a derogatory report by the State Commission of Investigation has no right to an adjudicatory hearing to challenge the report, he is entitled to \u201creasonable protection against false and reckless information by means of. procedural safeguards ....\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>35, 692 A.2d 48 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">DYFS\u2019 finding against M.I. is also subject to challenge on another basis. In addition to enforcement of procedural due process requirements, this State\u2019s courts have broad authority and responsibility under our prerogative writ jurisdiction, <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. VI, \u00a7 5, \u00b6 4, \u201cto insure procedural fairness in the administrative process and to curb administrative abuses.\u201d <em>Monks v. New Jersey State Parole Bd., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>238, 249, 277 A.2d 193 (1971). In <em>Donaldson v. Board of Educ. of N. Wildwood, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>236, 320 A.2d 857 (1974), the Court relied upon this authority to require a local board of education to provide a statement of reasons for not renewing the contract of an untenured teacher as a safeguard against the arbitrary or abusive exercise of administrative power. Similarly, we conclude that the wording of DYFS\u2019 disseminated investigatory findings is subject to judicial review and correction \u201cto curb administrative abuses.\u201d <em>Monks, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 277 A.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">DYFS\u2019 letters to the Superintendent of Schools and to R.P.\u2019s parents inaccurately implied that DYFS had conducted an adjudicatory proceeding, resulting in a finding which credited R.P.\u2019s version of the incident and discredited M.I.\u2019s version. There is a fundamental distinction between investigatory and adjudicatory findings. An investigator simply interviews witnesses and examines other available evidence, reviews and analyzes this information and makes a recommendation as to whether any action should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>be taken against the subject of the investigation. Although an investigator should strive to be objective in gathering and evaluating evidence, the target of an investigation has no means of assuring its impartiality and has no effective recourse if an investigator is biased. In contrast, in an adjudicatory proceeding, the party against whom the action has been brought is afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the investigator and other witnesses and to present evidence to rebut the charge. In addition, the trier of fact who makes adjudicatory findings is not an individual who has been personally involved in the investigation and decision to bring the charges, but rather an ALJ or other person whose sole responsibility is to fairly and impartially judge the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A finding by DYFS that child abuse charges have not been substantiated, but that there is some indication a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm, is purely investigatory in nature, see <em>L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452, 729 A.2d 463, with none of the procedural protections of an adjudicatory proceeding. However, by stating that \u201cthe preponderance of the credible evidence\u201d supported its finding that M.I. had improper physical contact with R.P., DYFS inaccurately and unfairly conveyed the impression that its finding was based on an adjudicatory hearing. Therefore, M.I. is entitled to have this language corrected so that it simply states, in accordance with DYFS\u2019 own regulation, that DYFS\u2019 investigation revealed some evidence of harm or risk of harm to R.P., but that there has been no determination of the accuracy of R.P.\u2019s allegations. Although this correction will not totally eliminate the potential harm to M.I.\u2019s reputation from DYFS\u2019 investigatory finding, it will reduce the harm by clearly informing the school district, and other parties to whom the finding is disseminated, that there has not been any adjudication of those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">DYFS\u2019 communications of its findings and recommendations to the Kearney School District must be corrected in another respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>as well. DYFS\u2019 letter to the Kearney Superintendent of Schools concerning the investigation of M.I. concluded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Please confirm, in writing, within thirty days, action taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">When the Superintendent did not respond, DYFS sent him another letter, dated February 25, 1999, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">Our records indicate that the corrective action response requested in our 01/21/99 report sent to you concerning the above investigation has not been received. Recommendations are made in our investigation reports to remedy concerns that have been identified and to prevent future incidents from occurring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">Please send me documentation of your corrective action so we can close this file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Shortly thereafter, the Superintendent sent M.I. the previously quoted reprimand letter dated March 5,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In <em>L.R. </em>we held that DYFS does not have statutory authority to order a school district to take remedial action in response to DYFS\u2019 investigatory findings. 321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452-56, 729 A.2d 463. Instead, once DYFS completes an investigation of a child abuse complaint against a teacher and makes whatever recommendation it may have to the school district, DYFS has fully discharged its responsibilities and may close its file. <em>Id. </em>at 453, 729 A.2d 463. We also indicated that \u201cDYFS\u2019 directive to [a] School District to \u2018confirm\u2019 its corrective action \u2018in writing\u2019 at least implied that the district was required to act in accordance with DYFS\u2019 recommendations, rather than to exercise its own independent judgment in deciding what action, if any, to take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 729 A.2d 463. Accordingly, we directed DYFS \u201cto notify the ... school district that DYFS\u2019 reports concerning the child abuse allegations against appellants did not require the district to take any disciplinary or other personnel actions but were investigatory findings and recommendations only, and that the district has the responsibility to make an independent judgment as to whether to accept DYFS\u2019 findings and recommendations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 729 A.2d 463. Similarly, DYFS\u2019 demand for a \u201ccorrective action response\u201d from the Kearney School District incorrectly indicated that DYFS had the authority to direct the school district to take remedial action, rather than to exercise its own independent judgment in deciding what action, if any, to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>For these reasons, DYFS must send a corrected letter to the Kearney Superintendent of Schools and any other person to whom its final decision in this matter was disseminated, which clearly states that its finding was purely investigatory and that it made no adjudication of R.P.\u2019s allegations against M.I. The corrected letter to the Superintendent must also clearly indicate that the school district is not required to take any remedial action. DYFS should confer with M.I.\u2019s counsel regarding the corrected form of the disseminated reports of its investigatory findings. If the parties are unable to reach agreement, an appropriate application may be made to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The case is remanded to DYFS for the correction of its disseminated investigatory findings in conformity with this opinion.
