A jury found to the contrary, and plaintiff appeals from the judgment based upon that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The sole issue on appeal assigns error to the trial judge\u2019s charge and the single liability interrogatory submitted to the jury. Plaintiff contends that they reflected a misapplication of governing law, therefore depriving him of a fair and just trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Our review of the record with the benefit of the written and oral arguments advanced by the parties, in the light of governing principles of law, discloses no such error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Plaintiff, forty-seven years of age, worked as a full-time night-crew stock clerk at a supermarket owned by defendant. He had been so employed for seventeen years and was earning $16.66 per hour for an annual wage of about $41,000, with full benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">On July 17, 1995, plaintiff was accused of violating defendant\u2019s \u201cassociate purchase policy\u201d (policy) by taking, opening and drinking from a soft drink bottle without first paying for it. The circumstantial details were established in the proofs. It will suffice for our purposes to note that plaintiff did not dispute the assertion that he had taken the bottle and partially consumed its contents; but he offered a cogent explanation why he had not paid for it before drinking from it, along with a contention that the policy was not as strictly or uniformly applied as defendant presented it to be. Plaintiff argued that defendant\u2019s application of the policy to him was a pretext for discharging him and replacing him with a younger person at a much lower salary. In support of this position, plaintiff also showed, <em>inter alia, </em>that defendant had experienced financial difficulties leading to a bankruptcy filing and that only eleven days after plaintiffs discharge defendant offered a retirement incentive to its more senior employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The gravamen of plaintiffs argument on appeal is that he was entitled to the benefit of certain jury guidance, both in the judge\u2019s charge and on the form of interrogatories to be answered, which he did not receive. He contends that the jury should have been told that if it disbelieved the reason defendant gave for plaintiffs discharge, <em>i.e., </em>violation of the \u201cassociate purchase policy\u201d, it could find for plaintiff solely on the basis of the <em>prima facie </em>case for discrimination which plaintiff had concededly made, without addressing the totality of the proofs to determine whether they permitted a conclusion that plaintiff had, on the whole, met his burden of proof to establish unlawful (age-based) discrimination as the motivation for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Our review of the jury charge taken as a whole, <em>see Fischer v. Canario, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>235, 254, 670 A.2d 516 (1996), discloses that the jury received adequate guidance regarding its function in this employment discrimination case. In adjudicating state-law discrimination cases, New Jersey normatively follows federal case law analyses and approaches. <em>See generally Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 549-51, 569 A.2d 793 (1990); <em>Peper v. Princeton University, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 82-83, 389 A.2d 465 (1978); <em>Kelly v. Bally\u2019s Grand, Inc., </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 428-30, 667 A.2d 355 (App.Div.1995). We have, in particular, adopted the burden-shifting analysis of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>792, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), as an appropriate starting point in cases arising under our Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42. <em>See Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 492-93, 446 A.2d 486 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">As recently as a few months ago, in <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>- <em>U.S. </em>-, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), the United States Supreme Court reminded us that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\"><em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and subsequent decisions have \u201cestablished an allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in ... discriminatory-treatment cases \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at-, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2106, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 116 (quoting <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>502, 506, 113 <em>S.Ct </em>2742, 2746, 125 L.Ed.2d 407, 415 (1993)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\"><em>Reeves </em>further instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">although the presumption of discrimination [which arises when the four-part <em>-prima facie </em>showing of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>has been made] \u201cdrops out of the picture\u201d once the defendant meets its burden of production ... the trier of fact <em>may </em>still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiffs prima facie case \u201cand inferences properly drawn therefrom ... on the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s explanation is pretextual\u201d[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 120 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2106, 147 L.Ed.2d at 117 (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied) (quoting <em>Hicks, supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 511, 113 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2749, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 418 and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>248, 255 n. 10, <em>101 </em>S.Ct. 1089, 1095 n. 10, 67 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>207, 216 n. 10 (1981)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The Supreme Court went on to note an established principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-12\">[T]he factfinder\u2019s rejection of the employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for its action does not compel judgment for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-13\"><em>[Id </em>at-, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2108,147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 119.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">and to observe further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-15\">The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated, and proof that \u201cthe employer\u2019s proffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that plaintiffs proffered reason ... is correct.\u201d * * * In other words, \u201cit is not enough ... to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiffs explanation of intentional discrimination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-16\"><em>[Id </em>at-, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2108, 147 L.Ed.2d at 119 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Hicks, supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 519, 524, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2754, 2756, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 424, 427).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-18\">Emphasizing the significance of this perception, the Supreme Court discussed the various ways in which a plaintiff might succeed in discharging his burden of proof on the ultimate issue, and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-19\">This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to sustain a jury\u2019s finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant\u2019s explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-20\"><em>[Id </em>at-, 120 <em>S.ct </em>at 2109, <em>147 L.Ed.2d </em>at 120.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-21\">This recent elucidation of the ways in which the complexities of this subject matter area work in a litigation framework helps us to understand that the jury in this case.was properly guided by the trial judge\u2019s instructions and his framing of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>question on the liability feature of the ease. The most pertinent portion of the jury charge was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">Plaintiff may prevail on his claim if it is determined that the reasons given by the employer for plaintiffs discharge was simply a pretext that it was not an honest reason and that it was simply a pretext to cover up the fact that he was discharged because of age. To prove pretext, plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant\u2019s reason is not worthy of belief or that more likely than not, it is not a true reason or the only true reason for defendant\u2019s actions and that plaintiffs age was a determinative motivating factor for defendant\u2019s actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">In other words, in order to prevail on his claim, plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his age was a determinative factor in his discharge. A plaintiff need not prove that the employer\u2019s sole or exclusive consideration was his age, but that it made a difference in deciding to terminate the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">If you find that plaintiff has satisfied this burden of proof of proving that defendant\u2019s reason is a pretext, then you may return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. If you find that plaintiff has not satisfied his burden of proving that defendant\u2019s reason is a pretext, then you must return a verdict in favor of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The trial judge was quite correct. Irrespective of the fact that plaintiff had made the required <em>prima facie </em>showing (conceded by defendant), the burden of proof on the ultimate issue never shifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The primary difference between the parties on the issue before us bears upon the established understanding that, in order for defendant to overcome plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>showing, defendant must come forward with a non-pretextual, non-discriminatory reason for discharge, and that plaintiff has a right to place that express reason in doubt either by independent proofs or by convincing the jury that defendant\u2019s proffer is not believable. Plaintiff contends that the jury must be told to find for the plaintiff if it disbelieves the express reason.' Defendant argues that this would relieve plaintiff of its burden of proving a discriminatory basis, <em>ie., </em>that the burden of proof never shifts and that plaintiff must always be held to be required to prove a discriminatory basis; and that the <em>prima facie </em>showing is not a surrogate for satisfying the burden of proof. Defendant argues that the jury must be told that it must be persuaded by a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>evidence that the reason for defendant\u2019s discharge was unlawfully discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We hold that the jury in a case such as this needs to be told with adequate clarity that it is to assess whether plaintiff has made a persuasive showing of unlawful discrimination and that it may use its disbelief of defendant\u2019s explanation in making that determination, <em>ie., </em>that in essence the jury is to make a considered judgment on the ultimate question based on all the evidence before it without the assistance of a presumption. This comports with the understanding that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>rule of approach exists only to order the proofs and is not necessarily to be used by the jury in deciding the ultimate factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Plaintiff here was not limited in making every reasonable effort to persuade the jury that defendant\u2019s proffered non-diseriminatory reason for discharge was pretextual, either by introducing countervailing proofs or by arguing that the reason given was inherently unbelievable or, conceivably, in other ways. But the burden of persuading the jury that an unlawful discrimination had occurred remained with the plaintiff. As we understand the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the guidance furnished by the framing of the single liability interrogatory, this is essentially what the jury was told, however sparingly the pertinent concepts were conveyed. Given the state of the law governing the issues and their presentation, plaintiff was entitled to nothing more. A party has a right to jury instructions which fairly elucidate the law to be applied and furnish the jury with adequate guidance; no party is entitled to the instructions he requests <em>in haec verba. See State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 411, 283 A.2d 513 (1971); <em>Gaido v. Weiser, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 199-200, 545 A.2d 1350 (App.Div.1988), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>310, 558 A.2d 845 (1989); <em>Plant v. River Road Serv. Co., </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 294, 68 A.2d 876 (App.Div.1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
