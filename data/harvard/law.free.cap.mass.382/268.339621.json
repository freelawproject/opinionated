In due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>course the plaintiff moved for summary judgment in his favor upon the pleadings and a statement of agreed facts, and the matter was then, upon joint motion, reserved and reported by the single justice, without decision, to the full bench. Argument was heard on September 11, 1980, and, as it was represented that time was short to print and distribute ballots and make other preparations for the election, the court, after consideration, entered its order on September 18 in favor of the plaintiff enjoining the defendant as prayed, with opinion or opinions to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">1. <em>The case. </em>We outline the record made on summary judgment, first giving the statutory background.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For many years before 1979, the Commonwealth recognized and made provision, in terms, for Independent candidates, and for Independent voters as well. Independent candidates were those not nominated by a \u201cpolitical party,\u201d as defined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In seeking a place on the ballot for an office such as State senator, an Independent candidate had to obtain the signatures on his nomination papers of voters in number not less than 2% of the votes cast in that district for Governor at the previous gubernatorial election. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 6. The nomination papers would carry the candidate\u2019s political designation, chosen by him, in not more than three words. The words could not consist of the name of a \u201cpolitical party,\u201d that designation being reserved for the party candidate, but otherwise any word or words could be used; the single word Independent could be used. G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The same rule held for the designation of an Inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>pendent candidate on the ballot, if he qualified to appear there. G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Statute 1979, c. 745, approved November 14,1979, by its \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 7 amended respectively G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 8, and G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 41, above cited, to impose the following important further restrictions: the word Independent was forbidden as any part of the designation on nominating petitions or on the ballot, and \u201c[fjailure to make a political designation shall result in the term \u2018Unenrolled\u2019 being used\u201d on the ballot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By additional provisions of the 1979 legislation the word Unenrolled was substituted for Independent at other places in the election statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">To turn now to the particular facts, the plaintiff Bachrach before 1979 considered himself a Democrat. When he started his campaign in early 1980, he described himself variously as a Democrat, Independent Democrat, and Independent. But about February, 1980, he left the Democratic party, formally changed his voter enrollment from Demo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>cratic to Unenrolled,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and chose not to be a candidate in the Democratic party primary. He felt he did not share the political or ideological views of the incumbent Democratic President, Governor, or State senator for his district. Accordingly, in his campaign literature and public statements he consistently described himself as Independent, the designation which to him best expressed his political views and \u201cdirected] voters\u2019 attention to a progressive need for competence and effectiveness in government, uninfluenced by party or ideological constraint.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">When he forwarded his nomination papers, including certified signatures, to the defendant with a letter dated April 23, 1980, the plaintiff insisted that he be designated Independent on the election ballot. In reply, the defendant called attention to St. 1979, c. 745, and said that the plaintiff was thereby forbidden the designation Independent on his nomination papers and on the ballot, and that Unenrolled would appear as the plaintiff s designation on the ballot if he declined to adopt a designation acceptable under the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">It was this response of the defendant that finally provoked the present litigation; and it is necessary to add that the parties in their agreed facts sought to aid the court with certain propositions about political usage or understanding of which we mention the following in paraphrase. Independent had no consistent or uniform meaning except a customary meaning as referring to persons who do not formally affiliate with any political party. Many voters assumed individuals designated Independent had generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>liberal political or ideological beliefs, but many thought such individuals had generally conservative, generally moderate, or generally progressive beliefs. Independent had a generally positive connotation. \u201cCitizens Party,\u201d which was to appear as a designation of a candidate on the 1980 ballot, had no consistent or uniform meaning. The designations \u201cAgainst Politician\u2019s Raise\u201d and \u201cThe Anderson Coalition,\u201d also to appear as designations on that ballot, did not connote associations with established organizations having structures or traditions of political beliefs. The terms Democratic and Republican did connote such associations. Finally (here we draw on the defendant\u2019s pleading), as of February, 1980, of the registered voters in the Commonwealth, 45.9% were enrolled in the Democratic party, 14.2% in the Republican party, and 39.9% were Unenrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We state the grounds of our decision which in effect obliged the defendant Secretary to give the plaintiff Bachrach the designation Independent on the 1980 election ballot, despite the contrary provision of the 1979 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-22\">(a) <em>Rights of expression and association; equal protection. </em>An election ballot is a State-devised form through which candidates and voters are required to express themselves at the climactic moment of choice. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>375 U.S. 399, 402 (1964) .<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether inscribed on a piece o\u00ed paper or set out in connection with the levers of a machine, the ballot is necessarily short; it cannot usually permit of discursive statements by candidates, and must call for responses by the electors simple enough to be counted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Within these natural limitations, a State has discretion in prescribing the particular makeup of the ballot for its various elections (see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 819, 821 [1975]), and in fact the customs and practices as to these arrangements have varied from State to State. Inescapably, however, the discretion must in the end be exercised in subordination to relevant constitutional guaranties. See <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 140-141 (1972); <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Grubb, </em>14 Cal. 3d 661, 669 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"ADQ\">With respect to the political designations of the candidates on nomination papers or on the ballot, it is quite possible that a State could go some distance in washing its hands of the business and leaving it to the educational efforts of the candidates themselves, or their sponsors, during the campaigns. See <em>Libertarian Party </em>v. <em>Eu, </em>102 Cal. App. 3d 446, 455 (1980).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is certainly much useful information about parties and candidates that a State is free not to mention or elicit on the ballot, even if physical limitations do not prevent. See <em>New York State Democratic Party </em>v. <em>Lomenzo, </em>460 F.2d 250, 251-252 (2d Cir. 1972) (in primary election of delegates to national convention, State need not permit statements on ballot of candidates\u2019 presidential preferences). But as soon as the State admits a particular subject to the ballot, and commences to manipulate the content, to legislate what shall and shall not appear, it must take account of the provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions regarding freedom of speech and association, together with the provisions assuring equal protection of the laws. See <em>Riddell </em>v. <em>National Democratic Party, </em>508 F.2d 770, 775-779 (5th Cir. 1975). Cf. <em>Minnesota Fifth Congressional Dist. Independent-Republican Party </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Spannaus, </em>295 N.W.2d 650, 652-655 (Minn. 1980).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>In the present case the State did admit subject matter to the ballot and then sought to manipulate it, and the regulation of content that was imposed seems to us repugnant to constitutional principles. We may accept that the candidates of political parties (see n.2) appear on the ballot by their party names, while others, not having an affiliation with such a party, are permitted designations of their choosing of not more than three words.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But then the 1979 legislation went on to proscribe the term Independent whether offered as a sole designation or as one of a two- or three-word designation. Nominally the outlawing of the word applied across the board to all candidates. Viewed that way, the prohibition would be unlawful on much the same basis as a statute which might undertake to forbid political candidates in their campaigning to discuss a given subject, e.g., religion or nuclear power (cf. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>447 U.S. 530, 544 [1980]), or, indeed, to forbid the use during the campaign of some one-word political characterization. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 22-26 (1971).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The constitutional vice was deepened, however, because in practical effect an element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>of invidious discrimination was added. Cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>375 U.S. 399, 403-404 (1964).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whereas any other candidate was allowed to use a designation on the ballot conforming to the rubric he used during the campaign, the candidate who chose, quite legitimately, to campaign under the label Independent, was singled out and denied that expression on the ballot. (The coincidence or \u201cintersection\u201d of a violation of First Amendment rights with a breach of equal protection, is very familiar; see <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 94-95 [1972].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The deprivation was not inconsiderable, for Independent is a customary title long availed of in American politics, having a \u201cpositive connotation\u201d despite an equivocal meaning, as the agreed facts indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">If freedom of expression was impaired, so also would damage be done to associational rights, and thus to the right to vote. For example: Voters who during the campaign might have been favorably impressed with the candidate as an Independent would be confronted on the ballot with a candidate who was called Unenrolled. Unenrolled is hardly a rallying cry: the Commonwealth in its brief appears to grant the possibility that the word would have a negative connotation for voters.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Voters, among the many in the Commonwealth considering themselves without party affil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>iation, who searched the ballot for a candidate under an Independent banner, would find none, although the fact was otherwise. Ultimately the 1979 regulation might be expected to discourage from the beginning an appeal to voters on grounds of the candidate\u2019s independence from established parties and thus to protect those parties from a conventional style of criticism and attack. We agree with the Court in <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>in refusing to \u201cindulge the facile assumption that one can forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process. Indeed, governments might soon seize upon the censorship of particular words as a convenient guise for banning the expression of unpopular views.\u201d 403 U.S. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As a substantial restriction of political expression and association, and a discriminatory one at that, the legislation at bar should attract \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d and, in our opinion, must fail such inspection. See <em>Riddell </em>v. <em>National Democratic Party, supra, </em>508 F.2d at 776; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>14 Cal. 3d at 669-671; <em>Libertarian Party </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>102 Cal. App. 3d at 454-458, and authorities cited in these cases. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Pub. Interest Research Group </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 85, 95 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>368 Mass. 92, 99 (1975).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commonwealth has argued that this entire analysis is inapposite, citing cases which hold that particular places or occasions are not appropriate for given kinds of communication which accordingly may be excluded: <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Shaker Heights, </em>418 U.S. 298 (1974), is an example, where it was held that the municipality need not open its buses to political advertisements when it had over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>long period of time allowed only ordinary commercial and service-oriented advertising there. We think that and related cases<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> are inapplicable to the voting booth where political expression in the form of political designations was allowed on the ballot, save the one particular designation. Again the Commonwealth has said that the legislation is at most a regulation of the \u201ctime, place, or manner\u201d of expression like an ordinance that might accommodate the time for speechmaking in a public place to traffic requirements or the like. But here the regulation was in terms of the very content of the communication and so was inherently suspect. See <em>First Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 785-786 (1978); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1976). Assuming a regulation of content, the Commonwealth still contended that the Legislature might eliminate the one term Independent from political discourse, at least on the ballot, on the one hand because it was ambiguous or confusing,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and on the other hand because it had a positive aura and hence might give a candidate using the designation an unmerited advantage. It is hard to take the argument seriously when one looks at the agreed facts and considers what soubriquets unaffiliated candidates were permitted to adopt under the statute, apart from the word Independent. Nor might the Commonwealth take the position that the legislation was merely underinclusive in its prohibition and the Legislature was entitled to proceed step by step to eliminate ambiguity: as the Court indicated in <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 215 (1975), that approach can be rarely if ever permissible when the basis of regulation is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>content of expression. Cf. Black, J., concurring and dissenting in <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 575, 580-581 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">(b) <em>Particular cases. </em>We have dealt with the present case on the usual basis of principle and analogy, as no decided case has been found \u201con all fours.\u201d Cases of varying pertinence to the present have received attention in the briefs and argument, and we add some remarks to sort them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\"><em>Tsongas </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>362 Mass. 708 (1972), considered a claim that a statute giving first place on the ballot in an ordinary partisan election to the incumbent running for reelection (party candidates and other candidates following, respectively, in alphabetical order) was so unequal as to violate art. 9 of our Declaration of Rights (see n.12). The State\u2019s interest in some scheme of organization of the ballot contended with a risk of unbalanced treatment of candidates and thus of voters. The case ended inconclusively, as the record, while indicating that first place gave some advantage, had provided no basis for evaluating alternative schemes of placement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The plaintiff had waived any contention based on the fact that the incumbent was designated as such on the ballot. <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Guzzi, </em>416 F. Supp. 1057 (D. Mass. 1976) (three-judge court), considered the same ballot arrangement, with the record indicating that the designation of incumbency gave the substantial part of such advantage as there was, first place being a relatively minor factor. Considering the practical effect on the right to vote, and applying, apparently, a \u201crational relation\u201d test, and noting the possible disadvantages of alternative patterns of placement of candidates on the ballot, the court upheld the statute as a matter of equal protection. There was no discussion of possible First Amendment contentions deriving from the conferral on the incumbent of the right to be designated as such. In all events a statement on the ballot of the indisputable fact of incumbency is far removed in a constitutional sense from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the cloture involved in the case at bar. It is fair to add that the Clough result would probably not be accepted by a number of other courts. See, e.g., <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>14 Cal. 3d 661 (1975) (Tobriner, J.); <em>McLain </em>v. <em>Meier, </em>F.2d (8th Cir. 1980).<footnotemark>a</footnotemark> See also Note, Position of Candidates\u2019 Names and Special Designations on Ballots: Equal Protection Problems with the Massachusetts Election Law, 9 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 694 (1975); Mass. Legislative Research Council, Report Relative to Order of Names on the Ballot, 1974 House Doc. No. 5312.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><em>Riddell </em>v. <em>National Democratic Party, supra, </em>508 F.2d 770 (5th Cir. 1975) (Tuttle, J.), did go to the First Amendment associational right and has a closer bearing on the instant case. A Mississippi statute provided that no political party should use any name or part thereof which had been previously registered by any other political party. In 1950 the \u201cDemocratic Party of the State of Mississippi\u201d was registered. In later years these \u201cregulars\u201d did political battle for leadership of Democratic ranks with \u201cloyalists\u201d banded together as the \u201cFreedom Democratic Party.\u201d Considering that for effective competition with the older organization the later one needed the reference to \u201cDemocratic\u201d as a designation, the court held that the local statute must fall pro tanto. Rigorous scrutiny was called for and the State could justify the censorship only by showing a compelling interest, and that was not possible; evidently a design to avoid confusion was not enough (indeed the total exclusion of the loyalists from \u201cDemocratic\u201d might itself engender confusion). The \u201cconfusion\u201d justification is no more plausible in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Under a California law a candidate of an established party appeared on the ballot with the party name, but any candidate qualifying through a petition process was designated \u201cIndependent\u201d without an option to use any other political designation. Thus a designation was forced on a candidate which he might not desire, while in our case a candidate was barred from using a designation that he did desire. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the practice, reasoning that Independent in the context of that kind of ballot merely signified the means \u2014 petition \u2014 by which the candidate got access to the ballot. <em>Socialist Workers Party </em>v. <em>Eu, </em>591 F.2d 1252 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 946 (1979). When the same problem reached a California State court, it said the opinion of the Federal court was \u201cflawed.\u201d It came to a contrary conclusion. It rejected the reading of Independent as merely indicative of the route of arrival at the ballot: on that theory the party candidates should have appeared merely under the caption \u201cPrimary\u201d or the like. The statutory scheme invoked strict scrutiny. Its ultimate effect was seen as burdening the associational rights of voters and discouraging the growth of new political organizations. <em>Libertarian Party </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>102 Cal. App. 3d 446 (1980) (two to one decision).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In the recent case of <em>Minnesota Fifth Congressional Dist. Independent-Republican Party </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Spannaus, supra, </em>295 N.W.2d 650 (Minn. 1980), the court struck down a statute requiring any candidate filing as an Independent for partisan municipal office to make affidavit that he would not seek or accept any party\u2019s support for the candidacy. This, under strict scrutiny, was an undue invasion of rights of expression and association with, it seems, a concomitant breach of equal protection, since political parties, in distinction from Independents, were free to seek support in any quarter. The State could take some limited measures to help assure that Independents were such (e.g., to discourage defeated primary candidates from continuing the struggle in another form, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 819 [1975]), but the condemned statute was not such a measure.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The foregoing cases seem to us consistent with or supportive of the views we have taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">(c) <em>Conclusion. </em>We suggest that the following quoted remarks may serve as epigraphs for the present case. \u201cThe first amendment bars government from censoring pure speech or speakers in order to \u2018improve the quality\u2019 or \u2018increase the fairness\u2019 of public debate.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cConstitutional review of election and campaign regulation amounts, in large part, to accommodating the fear of a temporary majority entrenching itself with the necessity of making the election a readable barometer of the electorate\u2019s preferences. It is not surprising, therefore, that the vigor of judicial review of election laws has been roughly proportioned to their potential for immunizing the current leadership from successful attack.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201c In short, I see grave risks in legislation, enacted by incumbents of the major political parties, which distinctly disadvantages minor parties or independent candidates.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> A good deal of statutory detail is overlooked in the brief account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> By G.

The injunction in this case was issued on short notice, without adequate time for consideration, and on the basis of \u201cagreed facts\u201d of dubious reliability, hastily thrown together by counsel. In a case of first impression, the result was to give constitutional status to the linguistic preferences of the Justices, and to exempt the plaintiff from a rule adopted by the elected representatives of the people. Thus the case stands as an example of premature, unnecessary, and mischievous judicial interference with democratic procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">On reflection, moreover, I am convinced that constitutional principles have been misapplied. The court seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>recognize that reasonable regulation of the form and content of the ballot is essential to the conduct of an election; there is no need to treat control of misleading ballot designations like censorship of works of art. The Legislature could rationally conclude that \u201cIndependent\u201d is an \u201cambiguous designation.\u201d See <em>Libertarian Party </em>v. <em>Eu, </em>102 Cal. App. 3d 446, 457 (1980). Cf. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>311 Minn. 237, 240 (1976), where, in the absence of statute, the court found no danger of confusion between \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201c Independent-Republican. \u201d The Legislature could further conclude that use of the label \u201c Independent\u201d tended to foster misrepresentation andt confusion. Remedies to assure that \u201cindependent\u201d candidates are \u201ctruly independent\u201d have had mixed success. See <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 746 (1974); <em>Minnesota Fifth Congressional Dist. Independent-Republican Party </em>v. <em>State ex rel. Spannaus, </em>295 N.W. 2d 650, 653 (Minn. 1980). If the Legislature determined that prohibition of use of the label on the ballot would not impose a serious disadvantage on the candidate, I think it could impose the prohibition. Rational determinations of the Legislature are not to be overthrown merely by findings that they are contrary to fact, much less by \u201cagreed facts\u201d or judicial omniscience. Certainly the fact that candidates were permitted to use imaginative \u201csoubriquets\u201d does not warrant a refusal to take the legislative determination seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The cases cited by the court deal with a variety of subjects: access to the ballot, limitation of campaign expenditures or tactics, a schism in a regular party organization, preferential ballot position, compulsory ballot designations, and others. The present decision involves none of these. It is truly unprecedented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
