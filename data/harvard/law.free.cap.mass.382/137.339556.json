L. c. 265, \u00a7 17), and one indictment charging armed assault with intent to rob (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18), and was sentenced to concurrent terms of from fifteen to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A - 33G. On appeal, Cundriff raises three issues: (1) the denial of a motion to suppress evidence based on a claim that the police entered Cundriff s apartment without an announcement of their identity and purpose; (2) the denial of a motion to grant a mistrial because a statement made to police by the defendant was not disclosed prior to trial; and (3) an erroneous instruction to the jury. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">We summarize the facts. About two o\u2019clock on the afternoon of August 23, 1978, four men wearing stocking masks and carrying guns entered the Casa de Hombre hairdressing salon at 1222 Blue Hill Avenue in Boston\u2019s Mattapan neighborhood. The nine customers and employees present in the shop at the time were ordered to lie on the floor, then were tied up or bound and robbed of money and jewelry. The robbers also took a telephone, a telephone answering machine, and a backgammon set. Three of the men remained masked throughout the robbery, but the fourth man raised his mask momentarily, allowing one of the victims to see part of his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-29\">About 2:30 p.m. that day, two Boston police detectives, who had not yet learned of the robbery, saw four men running across a street not far from the Casa de Hombre. When the four split into two groups, the police followed one pair, later identified as Jamie and Cedric Cundriff, and stopped them. Cedric, who was carrying a telephone and a telephone answering machine, was placed under arrest for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>receiving stolen property. Jamie, who was carrying a backgammon set, was not arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">As the police were taking Cedric to the police station, they received a radio dispatch telling them of the holdup at the Casa de Hombre, and they drove to the scene. Upon their arrival, several persons identified Cedric as one of the participants in the robbery, and the proprietor of the hairdressing salon identified the telephone answering machine as the one taken from the shop. A search of Cedric revealed several black nylon stocking caps and a number of pieces of jewelry taken in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"A-S\"><em>The forcible entry of Cundriff\u2019s apartment. </em>On October 13, 1978, at approximately 6:45 a.m., a group of police officers went to Jamie Cundriff s apartment with an arrest warrant. It was still dark when the police arrived and knocked at the door. When a woman inside the apartment asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d one officer answered, \u201cSchool bus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-F\">A woman opened the door, and several officers rushed into the apartment with their weapons drawn. One officer remained outside while the other officers entered rooms throughout the apartment. Several officers went into a bedroom, where Jamie Cundriff, only partially clothed, was lying on the bed, next to a young child. Cundriff was placed under arrest. One of the officers, who had been present when the two Cundriff brothers were stopped on the street the day of the robbery, saw a backgammon set in Jamie Cundriff s apartment, recognized it as the one Jamie Cundriff had been carrying that day, and seized it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZ1\">Cundriff claims that the judge erred by failing to suppress the backgammon set seized as a result of an unlawful entry into the apartment. He argues that the entry of the police into his apartment was unlawful, since the police failed to identify themselves and did not state their purpose, in violation of our common law rule that officers cannot make an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>unannounced entry into a dwelling house<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> except in limited circumstances not here present. The judge assumed that the knock and announce rule was a part of our common law, ordered a hearing, and then ruled that making such an announcement would have endangered the lives of the officers or other persons, and hence, the failure of the officers to knock and announce their identity and purpose was justified. We conclude that the judge was correct both in recognizing the rule as a part of our common law and in recognizing that the failure of the police to make an announcement may sometimes be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Our examination of the history of this rule must begin with the English common law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Three reasons appear as the basis for the development of the rule in England. In medieval England private persons often used self-help to recover stolen chattels. At that time possession was protected since \u201cto allow men to make forcible entries on land or to seize goods without form of law, <em>is </em>to invite violence.\u201d 2 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, The History of the English Law, 41 (2d ed. 1899). In addition to using the announcement requirement as a means of decreasing potential violence, the requirement of an announcement also served to protect the peace, tranquility, and privacy of an owner. \u201cThe possessor\u2019s possession is protected, not indeed because he has any sort of right in the thing, but because in general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>one can not disturb his possession without being guilty, or almost guilty, of some injury to his person, some act which, if it does not amount to an assault, still comes so danger-near to an assault that it can be regarded as an invasion of that sphere of peace and quiet which the law should guarantee to every one of its subjects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42. Lastly, the requirement of a statement of identity and purpose gave the property owner an opportunity to permit peaceable entry and thereby protect the home from physical destruction. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Gansel, </em>98 Eng. Rep. 935, 938 (K.B. 1774), where Lord Mansfield set forth the need to prevent those executing warrants from breaking doors or windows, for \u201cotherwise the consequences would be fatal: for it would leave the family within, naked and exposed to thieves and robbers.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AH-\">The first case applying a knock and announce requirement on public officers is <em>Semayne\u2019s Case, </em>77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195 (K.B. 1603), which contains the following dictum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201cIn all cases when the King is party, the sheriff (if the doors be not open) may break the party\u2019s house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K[ing]\u2019s process, if otherwise he cannot enter. But before he breaks it, he ought to signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors . . . .\u201d The requirement that royal officers first identify themselves and announce their purpose before entering rested in part on the notion that the \u201chouse of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his repose . . . <em>\"Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Following <em>Semayne\u2019s Case, </em>the English courts, in <em>Curtis's Case, </em>168 Eng. Rep. 67 (Grown 1756), dealt directly with the knock and announce requirement in a criminal case. The court held that \u201cpeace-officers, having a legal warrant to arrest for a breach of the peace, may break open doors after having demanded admittance and given due notice of their warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. The majority also held that \u201cno precise form of words is required\u201d to constitute adequate notice, as long as the announcement suffices to inform the occupant that the person demanding entry is not a trespasser but someone who \u201cclaim[s] to act under a proper authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In <em>Launock </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>106 Eng. Rep. 482, 483 (K.B. 1819), the judge stated that while he did not know if the announcement rule should apply to felony cases, \u201cin the case of a misdemeanour, such previous demand is requisite.\u201d The judge reasoned that the rule was required in such a case because if no demand is made, \u201chow is it possible for a party to know what the object of the person breaking open the door may be? He has a right to consider it as an aggression on his private property, which he will be justified in resisting to the outmost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The early English authorities are in accord. Sir Matthew Hale wrote, \u201cA man, that arrests upon suspicion of felony, may break open doors, if the party refuse upon demand to open them . . . .\u201d1 Hale, Pleas of the Crown 583 (1800). See 2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown c. 14, \u00a7 1 (6th ed. 1787); Foster, crown Law 320-321 (1762). See also <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 47-48 n.l (1963) (Brennan, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>dissenting) (\u201cthe leading commentators upon the English criminal law affirmed the continuing vitality of <em>[Semayne\u2019s Case]\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">British search policies generally are acknowledged to have spurred on revolutionary sentiment in colonial Massachusetts. Opposition to the search policies centered upon the use by British customs house officers of the writs of assistance, general warrants which allowed officers of the crown to search, at their will, wherever they suspected untaxed goods to be, and granted the officials the right of forcible entry. See generally O.M. Dickerson, The Navigation Acts and the American Revolution (1974); N.B. Lasson, The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1970); H.H. Miller, The Case for Liberty 121-144 (1965).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">It is not clear how often forcible entries were preceded by a knock and announcement of purpose. The colonists did not list the failure of the king\u2019s officers to announce their identity and purpose among their complaints about the writs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Nevertheless the colonists\u2019 memory of the use and abuse of the writs was one of the reasons for the adoption, by several colonies, of constitutional safeguards regulating searches.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1780 Massachusetts enacted art. 14<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, specifically condemning \u201cunreasonable searches, and seizures.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> J.W. Landynski, Search and Seizure and the Supreme Court 38 (1966); N.R. Lasson, The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 82 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">The antipathy of Massachusetts colonists to the writs of assistance was forcefully expressed by James Otis in the Massachusetts Superior Court in 1761. See Quincy, Reports (Appendix) 469-482 (1865); 2 Legal Papers of John Adams 106-147 (L. Wroth &amp; H. Zobel eds. 1965). Otis is said to have stated in his argument that the writ of assistance was \u201cthe worst instrument of arbitrary power, the <em>most </em>destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of the constitution, that ever was found in an English law-book. ... It is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer. . . . Custom house officers may enter our houses when they please \u2014 we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>commanded to permit their entry . . . .\u201d 2 Legal Papers of John Adams, <em>supra </em>at 140-142. See 2 C. Adams, The Works of John Adams 524 (1850); Landynski, <em>supra </em>at 35-37. The fact that Otis limited his stinging criticism to general warrants may be said to suggest that the customs officers complied with the knock and announce rule. See Note, Announcement in Police Entries, 80 Yale L.J. 139, 145 n.26 (1970). See also note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Our early cases reflect acceptance of the announcement rule. <em>Oystead </em>v. <em>Shed, </em>13 Mass. 520, 523 (1816), though turning on a procedural point, emphasized the right of a lodger to be free from forcible entry into his dwelling house in the case of civil arrest. In <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>10 Cush. 501, 503 (1852), we stated that a police officer attempting to serve a criminal arrest warrant could forcibly enter a suspect\u2019s house \u201cafter a proper notification of the purpose of the entry, and a demand upon the inmates to open the house, and a refusal by them to do so.\u201d A similar statement was made in <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Measures, </em>13 Gray 74, 75 (1859) (\u201cAn officer, in the execution of valid criminal process, is justifiable in breaking the outer door of a dwellinghouse, after demanding admittance and being refused\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>120 Mass. 190 (1876), we applied this principle to a case where the police broke into one person\u2019s house with a misdemeanor warrant for the ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>rest of another person: \u201cEven in a case of a misdemeanor, while it has been held in some cases that, before breaking open the outer door, the officer should demand admission, it is fully recognized in all the cases, that, after such demand and its refusal, the officer may lawfully enter by force and serve his process, even if it be against the occupant of the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">History teaches that the announcement requirement is a part of our common law. We add that the policies underlying the announcement rule at common law, i.e., decreasing the potential for violence, protection of privacy, and the prevention of unnecessary damage to homes, are as valid today as they were in the past. The judge below recognized that the rule was an integral part of our common law and held a hearing to determine whether there was reason to excuse the failure of the police to identify themselves and state their purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">American law early developed an exception to the announcement rule if there was reason to believe that \u201c[i]mminent danger to human life, resulting from the threats and intended violence of the principal [defendant] ...\u201d would result from compliance with the rule. <em>Read </em>v. Case, 4 Conn. 166, 170 (1822).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The California Supreme Court also has held that the knock and announce rule is \u201climited by the common law rules that compliance is not required if the officer\u2019s peril would have been increased or the arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>frustrated\u201d had the announcement been made. <em>People </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>46 Cal. 2d 301, 306 (1956). See Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 798, 802 (1924) (an exception to the general rule has evolved in cases where \u201cthe peril would be increased\u201d). The California court in <em>Maddox </em>noted that \u201c[wjithout the benefit of hindsight and ordinarily on the spur of the moment, the officer must decide these questions in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>520 F.2d 697 (9th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1056 (1976); <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>United States, </em>366 F.2d 923, 932 (9th Cir. 1966),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> cert. denied, 388 U.S. 922 (1967), 393 U.S. 985 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In the present case the judge found that there was a strong possibility that an announcement by the police of their identity and purpose would have endangered themselves or others. That finding is amply supported by the evidence that the defendant was suspected of participating in an armed robbery in which both handguns and a sawed-off shotgun had been used.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the police testified that they considered the defendant armed and dangerous. Thus, the judge was warranted in finding that the police had reason to fear for their own safety as well as the safety of persons in the defendant\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In such cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>cumstances the failure of the police to identify themselves and announce their purpose is justified as a matter of our common law. We conclude there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Delayed disclosure of inculpatory evidence. </em>During a recess on the fourth day of trial, a police officer informed the assistant district attorney, for the first time, of a statement allegedly made to him by the defendant at Boston police headquarters within a few hours of his arrest. When the officer inquired as to the whereabouts of codefendant Gregory Wilson, the defendant said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re looking for Greg for [sic]. He wasn\u2019t involved in this holdup with us.\u201d The prosecutor immediately informed counsel for all defendants of the statement, and a voir dire was conducted to determine its admissibility. The officer testified that he had never written down the statement and had not previously brought it to the attention of the district attorney\u2019s office because he believed the defendant was lying and the statement was unimportant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">Although the assistant district attorney stated several times that he did not intend to use the defendant\u2019s statement at trial, counsel for codefendant Gregory Wilson announced his intention to introduce it. When the trial resumed following the voir dire, the defendant\u2019s statement was elicited by the Commonwealth on direct examination of the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-27\">The defendant made a motion to exclude certain statements or for a mistrial, and to suppress the statement on voluntariness grounds; all were denied. He based these mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tions in part on a pretrial discovery agreement he had entered into with the assistant district attorney by which the Commonwealth promised to provide statements pursuant to a \u201cMotion for Statements of Defendant\u201d no later than one week prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The defendant argues that the belated disclosure of the statement, which he characterizes as an implied admission,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> denied him a fair trial. He claims that the trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude the statement or for a mistrial sanctioned the violation of the discovery agreement he entered into with the Commonwealth. . <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaikie, </em>375 Mass. 601, 607-608 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lewinski, 367 Mass. 889, 900-903 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The judge below found, and the defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledged, that the delay in disclosing the defendant\u2019s statement was not caused by the malice or negligence of the police. The prosecutor, who immediately turned over the statement to all defense counsel, was acknowledged by all parties to be equally blameless. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 660 (1980) (judge properly unwilling to exclude surprise statement of witness where it is made in \u201cgood faith\u201d), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>511 F.2d 798, 800-801 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (trial judge found to have erred by failing to suppress defendant\u2019s incriminating statement where government had known about it and had agreed not to use any such statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">However, the defendant\u2019s counsel asserts that had he known earlier of his client\u2019s statement, his decision on the advisability of entering into a plea agreement with the Commonwealth might have been different. He claims that he was therefore prejudiced by the late disclosure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>statement. This assertion rests on unsupported speculation about both what he would have done and what the Commonwealth\u2019s response would have been. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>377 Mass. 887, 895 (1979), where a similar argument was raised, we noted that, while the late disclosure of incriminating evidence may influence a defendant to be more willing to enter into a plea agreement, it may have exactly the opposite effect on the prosecutor. Furthermore, as was the case in <em>Gilbert, </em>the defense was not prevented from negotiating with the Commonwealth after the existence of the defendant\u2019s statement came to light. <em>Id. </em>This could have been accomplished during the continuance<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> granted by the judge after the defendant\u2019s statement was revealed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The defendant also claims that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaikie, </em>375 Mass. 601 (1978), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. 889 (1975), required the judge to grant a new trial, and that the failure to do so denied him a fair trial. Again Cundriff s claim rests on sheer speculation. There is no showing that the defendant was significantly prejudiced at trial by the late disclosure of the statement or how a new trial would substantially cure any error. Defense counsel was given the better part of one day to make his own investigation into the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. When the trial resumed, defense counsel did not seek any additional time for investigative purposes. He did not lodge any objection to resuming the trial based on lack of time to investigate properly the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>While the defendant asserts that his defense was materially hurt by having to meet unexpected testimony in the midst of trial, the officer was cross-examined about the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s statement, both at the voir dire and at the trial. Therefore, he has not demonstrated that his defense was hurt by the late disclosure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>377 Mass. 887, 895 (1979). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>511 F.2d 798 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (trial judge found to have committed error by not excluding incriminating statement elicited on cross-examination of defendant); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Padrone, </em>406 F.2d 560, 561 (2d Cir. 1969) (new trial granted where inadvertently nondisclosed statement first revealed on cross-examination of defendant). The defendant argues that the judge was wrong in focusing on the prejudice to the defendant which might result from the admission of the statement. We think, however, the judge was correct in focusing on prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaikie, supra </em>at 606 (second trial granted where previously undisclosed material was \u201cso different from the language in any pretrial information disclosed to the defendant as to be prejudicial\u201d). Without a showing of prejudice by the late disclosure of the defendant\u2019s statement<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and of how the granting of a new trial would substantially remedy such prejudice, we cannot conclude that a second trial would promote, as the defendant asserts, a fairer and more efficient system of justice. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Charge to the jury. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s charge denied him due process of law because it stated a one-sided view of the interests at stake in the case, and presented the jurors with a distorted picture of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At the outset of his charge to the jury, the judge characterized the interests of the parties to the case. After stating that the defendants had a \u201cpersonal, real interest\u201d in the outcome, the judge said that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest, although it \u201cmay not be quite so apparent ... it is, nonetheless, real and vital.\u201d The fundamental purpose of society, the judge said, was to \u201cprotect people found within its boundaries.\u201d He then told the jurors that when they returned with the verdict, their voices would \u201cin that instant . . . [be] the voice of this Commonwealth.\u201d He then urged them to decide the case on the evidence, cautioning them that \u201c[s]ympathy is not synonymous with justice,\u201d and \u201c[c]ompassion is not the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">On appeal, the defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s characterization of society\u2019s interest as that of protecting the public,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> while ignoring any interest in avoiding convictions based on insufficient proof, conveyed a view of society\u2019s interests that was partial to the prosecution. The defendant argues that this was compounded when the judge appeared to equate the interests of the jurors with that of the Commonwealth, and when he admonished the jurors not to be swayed by sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-27\">The judge\u2019s remarks dealing with sympathy and comp\u00e1ssion were proper in that they directed the jury to consider solely the evidence presented at trial. While it would have been preferable if the judge had not appeared to equate the interests of the jurors and the interests of the Commonwealth, since the two are not synonymous, that alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>does not invalidate the entire charge to the jury. Error in a charge is determined by reading the charge as a whole, and not by scrutinizing bits and pieces removed from their context. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>377 Mass. 385, 388, cert. denied, 442 U.S. 932 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>368 Mass. 518, 527-528 (1975). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whooley, </em>362 Mass. 313, 319 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>330 Mass. 453, 457 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The passage to which the defendant objects accounts for less than one page out of twenty pages of jury instructions. Viewed in its entirety, the judge\u2019s charge was fair and well-balanced and did not mislead the jury as to their duties, functions and obligations. As a whole, the charge to the jury was well within constitutional limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-36\"> Cundriffs codefendants, Darryl E.

Thus, we do not consider police entries into other types of structures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-31\"> Commentators suggest there were ancient sources for the English knock and announce rule. One commentator points to a rule in ancient Rome where a person searching for stolen goods had to have a public crier proclaim the theft of the goods and describe the goods before being able to search the house where it was thought the goods were located. See N.B. Lasson, The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, 17-18 (1970). Another commentator finds support for the origin of the English law in biblical law. See <em>Deuteronomy </em>24:10 (which prohibits a creditor from entering his debtor\u2019s house to obtain security for his debt). See Note, Announcement in Police Entries, 80 Yale L.J. 139, 140 n.5 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Au4\"> The United States Supreme Court has, for many of the same policy reasons set forth by the English courts, held that the knock and announce rule is required for Federal officers in all but exceptional circumstances. \u201cEvery householder, the good and the bad, the guilty and the innocent, is entitled to the protection designed to secure the common interest against unlawful invasion of the house.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 301, 313 (1958). The Court also recognized that the knock and announce rule may serve to protect the safety of policemen, \u201cwho might be mistaken for prowlers and be shot down by a fearful householder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">In addition, Mr. Justice Brennan noted that today there is a \u201cvery real\u201d possibility that police may be misinformed as to the name or address of a suspect, or as to other material allegations. \u201cThat possibility is itself a good reason for holding a tight rein against judicial approval of unannounced police entries into private homes.\u201d <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 57 (1963) (Brennan, J., dissenting). See generally Blakey, The Rule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry: <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United </em>States and Ker v. <em>California, </em>112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 499 (1964); Sonnenreich and Ebner, No-Knock and Nonsense, An Alleged Constitutional Problem, 44 St. John\u2019s L. Rev. 626 (1970); Note, Announcement in Police Entries, 80 Yale L.J. 139 (1970), which marshal arguments for and against the knock and announce rule.</p>\n<p id=\"AyW\">At least forty jurisdictions have some form of knock and announce rule for searches or arrests, based either on statute or on common law. See generally 44 St. John\u2019s L. Rev., <em>supra </em>at 654-659.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> While the early English law was unclear on the issue of the application of the announcement rule to the execution of search warrants, see Blakey, The Rule of Announcement and Unlawful Entry: <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States </em>and <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 499, 503-504 (1964), the requirement of a prior announcement in cases of arrests appears never seriously to have been disputed. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 301, 308 (1958) (\u201cWhatever the circumstances under which breaking a door to arrest for felony might be lawful, however, the breaking was unlawful where the officer failed first to state his authority and purpose demanding admission\u201d); <em>Accarino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>179 F.2d 456, 462 (D.C.

Lasson, The History and Development of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 54 n.16 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A74\"> This has led some to believe that these searches were accompanied by notice and announcement of purpose. The act which created the writs of assistance appears to include a knock and announce requirement because it provided that the officer could \u201cin <em>case of resistance, . . . </em>break open doors, chests, trunks and other packages, there to seize and from thence to bring, any kind of goods or merchandise whatsoever, prohibited and un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>customed\u201d (emphasis added). 13-14 Car. 2, c.

The court stated that the authority of a police officer to break into a house or shop and make an arrest without a warrant was limited to cases involving felonies, treason, or breaches of the peace committed in the presence of a police officer, and held that the offense with which the defendant in <em>McLennon </em>was charged did not fall within that limited class of cases. <em>Id. </em>at 77. Even if it had, the court reasoned, the officer could not break open the door without first \u201cdemanding entrance.\u201d Id. at 78. The McLennon court found that there was no proof that \u201cany such demand was made as to give the plaintiff notice that the defendant, as an officer of the law, sought an entrance into his premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Early New Hampshire and Connecticut cases reached conclusions similar to those of the Massachusetts cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 N.H. 346 (1818); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>1 Root 134 (Conn. 1789); <em>Read </em>v. <em>Case, </em>4 Conn. 166 (1822).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b158-25\"> Few recent Massachusetts cases have dealt with the knock and announce issue. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rossetti, </em>349 Mass. 626 (1965), the defendant moved to suppress evidence seized during a search of the premises of an alleged bookmaker both on the grounds that the warrant was issued without probable cause, and that the police had entered the premises with force and without announcing the existence of the warrants and the purpose of the search. Because the court found for the defendant on the issue of probable cause, it did not reach the question of the officers\u2019 entry into the premises, either as a matter of Massachusetts common law, or under the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b158-35\"> It is not clear what exceptions to the announcement rule were developed by English common law.

App. Ct. 820 (1974), and cases cited, and where making an announcement would facilitate a suspect\u2019s escape or the destruction of evidence, see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 301, 309 (1958) (dictum) (citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>46 Cal. 2d 301 [1956]); <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>at 47 (Brennan, J., dissenting); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cisneros, </em>448 F.2d 298, 304 (9th Cir.
