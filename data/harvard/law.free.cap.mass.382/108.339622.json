Sefranka was convicted in the Superior Court in the county of Plymouth for being a \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious person in speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>or behavior\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals on the ground that the words on which the conviction was based are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The statute is also challenged as unconstitutionally vague. We reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The facts are not in dispute. As detailed in the police report, which formed the statement of agreed facts both at trial and on appeal, three plainclothes police officers went in separate unmarked cars to a public rest area on Route 24. They did so after receiving \u201ccomplaints\u201d about the rest area; the nature of the complaints is not specified in the police report. When the police arrived, they saw several parked cars with male occupants. The police noted that the men would flash their parking lights at each other, whereupon one would get out of his car, approach the other car whose lights had been flashing, and get inside the other car; the two men would \u201cdisappear\u201d for a few minutes. The police officers saw the defendant approach two cars, but there is no evidence of his having participated in any sexual activity while at the rest area, and the Commonwealth does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The police officers decided that one of them should pull into the line of cars that were flashing lights and \u201ctry [his] luck.\u201d A while later, the defendant pulled behind the unmarked cruiser and flashed his parking lights. After several minutes, the police officer flashed his lights back at the defendant. The defendant then approached the cruiser, conversed with the officer, and invited the officer to return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>with him to his home and engage in oral copulation. The officer responded that he did not want to leave the rest area and indicated that he preferred the sexual activity to take place at the rest area. Replying that it was not safe at the rest area, the defendant said, \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d got into his parked car, and drove away. He was arrested a few minutes later and charged with being a disorderly person and a lewd, wanton, and lascivious person, both in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. He was convicted of the latter charge only,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and appealed to the Appeals Court. The case was transferred to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We hold that the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision of c. 272, \u00a7 53, unless aided by appropriate judicial construction, is unconstitutionally vague. Under the construction we shall establish in this opinion, the provision prohibits only the solicitation or commission of a public sexual touching, in the presence of persons who may be offended by the act. As so construed, the provision is neither vague nor overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">An essential principle of due process is that a statute may not proscribe conduct \u201cin terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\u201d <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926). <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108 n.3 (1972). In addition to its failure to give fair warning, a vague statute offends by its lack of reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement and its consequent encouragement of arbitrary and erratic arrests and prosecutions. <em>Papachristou v. Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 162, 171 (1972) (striking down as \u201cplainly unconstitutional\u201d Jacksonville\u2019s equivalent of \u00a7 53, before the Supreme Court on vagrancy provisions); <em>Groyned v. Rockford, supra </em>at 108-109. Further, when a statute is capable of affecting First Amendment interests, as is true of \u00a7 53\u2019s punishment of spoken words, the vagueness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>doctrine demands even greater precision than in other contexts. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 573 (1974). <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, supra </em>at 109 &amp; n.5 (noting that \u201ca precise statute . . . assures us that the legislature has focused on the First Amendment interests and determined that other governmental policies compel regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On the other hand, a law is not vague if its meaning is ascertainable by reference to similar or related statutes, or if the questioned terms have a commonly understood meaning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 12-13 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971). Further, even a vague statute may be made constitutionally definite by giving it a reasonable construction. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, 368 </em>Mass. 580, 595-598 (1975); <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 303-304 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Having in mind the above principles, we turn first to the language of the challenged provision punishing \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior.\u201d This language, standing alone, fails to inform a person of ordinary intelligence what conduct is proscribed, as there is no commonly accepted understanding of the quoted terms. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 12 (1974) (\u201cprostitute\u201d conveys a specific, commonly understood meaning). In ordinary usage, terms such as \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cwanton\u201d \u201cdo not imply a definite and specific referent, but apply broadly to conduct which the speaker considers beyond the bounds of propriety.\u201d <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial Dist., </em>25 Cal. 3d 238, 246-247 (1979) (attempting to define \u201clewd or dissolute conduct\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>v. <em>Kueny, </em>215 N.W.2d 215, 218 (Iowa 1974) (noting such terms are effectively meaningless today and unacceptable in criminal statutes absent an attendant definition of the specific conduct proscribed).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In our search for a clear meaning of the challenged provision, we next examine its history and its function in light of other provisions of \u00a7 53. \u201cLewd, wanton and lascivious\u201d persons, along with the \u201cidle\u201d and the \u201cdisorderly,\u201d have been punishable in this Commonwealth since at least 1699. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 535 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>248 Mass. 511, 514-H15 (1924). After adoption of the Massachusetts Constitution, the early provincial laws punishing the lewd, idle and disorderly were gathered together into St. 1787, c. 54, entitled, \u201cAn Act for suppressing and punishing of rogues, vagabonds, common beggars, and other idle, disorderly and lewd persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From its inception, the statute was aimed at punishing these people for their status. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, supra </em>at 516. The gravamen of the various offenses was \u201cbeing a person of the character and behavior described,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, 4 </em>Allen 313, 314 (1862), rather than \u201cdoing a certain overt act,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>179 Mass. 533, 534 (1901). Legislative revisions since 1943 have struck from \u00a7 53 provisions punishing \u201crogues,\u201d \u201cvagabonds,\u201d and \u201ccommon drunkards,\u201d and in 1959 \u201cprostitution\u201d was added to the statute as a separate offense. See <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 303 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-28\">Most of the provisions in \u00a7 53 have been attacked for vagueness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 535 (1978), for a complete list of cases. This court has saved many of the challenged provisions by examining stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>utory and case law concerning each provision to determine with specificity the elements of the charged crime. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 12-13 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 596-597 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brasher, </em>359 Mass. 550, 555 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The cases construing the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision, however, provide no greater degree of specificity than do the terms of the provision standing alone. Before the 1978 case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533 (1978), this court had dealt with charged violations of the provision in only two cases, neither of which spelled out the elements necessary to sustain a conviction or specified the exact nature of the criminal speech or conduct engaged in by the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>4 Allen 313 (1862). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>179 Mass. 533 (1901). Apparently, before the separate offense of \u201cprostitution\u201d was added to \u00a7 53, prostitutes were punish-as lewd, wanton and lascivious persons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 11-12 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>248 Mass. 511, 512, 517 (1924). In <em>King, </em>this court noted that the Legislature failed to define the lewd, wanton and lascivious conduct it reclassified in 1959 as prostitution. 374 Mass, at 12. Nor did the Legislature define what lewd, wanton and lascivious conduct, if any, it <em>declined </em>to reclassify as prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"A9_\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, supra, </em>we limited the reach of the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision in certain material respects. We said that the provision can be applied only to public, not private, conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 537. This conclusion was in line with our reasoning in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 302 (1974), in which we held the statutory proscription against \u201cunnatural and lascivious acts,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, inapplicable to the private, consensual conduct of adults,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and in <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Scagliotti, </em>373 Mass. 626 (1977), which involved, as does the present case, a defendant\u2019s offer to perform fellatio on an undercover policeman. In <em>Scagliotti </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions for soliciting another to perform an unnatural act and remanded for a new trial, because the trial judge improperly had removed from the jury the crucial issue of \u201cwhether the defendant had offered to commit the act in a public place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition to our requirement in <em>Templeman </em>that any sexual conduct punishable as \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious\u201d must be public conduct, we concluded that the provision cannot be applied to speech or expressive conduct or to activities involving the lawful exercise of First Amendment rights, and that it can be used to punish defined conduct only, and not to punish status. <em>Id. </em>at 536-537. These limitations, deemed constitutionally required, were derived from our cases construing other \u00a7 53 provisions so as to avoid the defects of over-breadth and vagueness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 592, 597 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5,15 n.9 (1977). Nowhere in <em>Templeman </em>did we define in positive terms the public conduct that <em>could </em>be punished as lewd, wanton and lascivious.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, supra </em>at 539 (Kaplan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We thus conclude that Massachusetts decisions do not provide a clear and definite content for the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious\u201d provision. As written and construed, the provision fails to provide fair warning of what conduct is forbidden and hence is unconstitutionally vague, rendering the defendant\u2019s conviction invalid.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For like reasons, decisions in other jurisdictions have found statutes with wording similar to the \u00a7 53 provision unconstitutionally vague. See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Detroit, </em>389 F. Supp. 922 (E.D. Mich. 1975); <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial Dist., </em>25 Cal. 3d 238 (1979); <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>319 A.2d 332 (D.C.), appeal dismissed for want of a properly presented Federal question and cert, denied, 419 U.S. 1065 (1974).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Our conclusion that the \u00a7 53 provision is unconstitutionally vague as construed by past decisions does not require us to invalidate the provision. As noted earlier, if a reasonable narrowing construction to a vague statute can be supplied, this court has done so in order to sustain its validity. We have encountered great difficulty in attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>define specifically the conduct proscribed by the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision. Given the history of the provision and its apparent initial application primarily to prostitution, now punishable as a separate offense, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 11-12 (1977), we are hard put to find sufficient legislative indication of what distinct function the provision serves today. See <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>319 A.2d 332, 336 (D.C. 1974), in which the court pronounced the statutory provision against \u201clewd, obscene, or indecent act[s]\u201d as \u201cso lacking in coordinates, other than its apparent application to sexual matters, that inadequate guidance has been given us for <em>our </em>development of a remedial formula for a saving construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We have examined other sex-related criminal offenses established in our statutes. Separate proscriptions already exist in Massachusetts against indecent exposure, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53; lewd and lascivious cohabitation by a man and woman not married to each other, c. 272, \u00a7 16; \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behaviour,\u201d c. 272, \u00a7 16; fornication, c. 272, \u00a7 18; crimes against nature, c. 272, \u00a7 34; and unnatural and lascivious acts, c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 35A. The \u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d provision has been said to be \u201cclosely similar\u201d to the offense of indecent exposure, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, </em>315 Mass. 20, 22 (1943), and has been applied primarily to indecent exposure in front of, and sexual conduct with, children. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 538 (1978), and cases cited. The \u201cunnatural and lascivious acts\u201d statute has been held to include public fellatio and oral-anal contact. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 299, 302 (1974) (holding the statute inapplicable to the private, consensual conduct of adults). After examining all of the above statutes, and proceeding under the reasonable assumption that the Legislature intended a comprehensive and integrated approach, we can perceive for the challenged provision a function in the penal law which appears to be consistent with legislative intent. None of the above statutes, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>possible exception of \u201copen and gross lewdness,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, deals with a public sexual touching that does not rise to the level of a completed sexual act. Nor do these statutes encompass public solicitations of such conduct. The \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision of \u00a7 53 thus may serve the function of filling this gap in the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The California Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial Dist., </em>25 Cal. 3d 238 (1979), provides some assistance in our attempt to specify the sexually motivated public conduct punishable under the \u00a7 53 provision. The California statute at issue in <em>Pryor </em>punished any person \u201c[w]ho solicits anyone to engage in or who engages in lewd or dissolute conduct in any public place or in any place open to the public or exposed to public view\u201d (emphasis deleted). <em>Id. </em>at 243-244. The court held the statute vague as construed by past cases, which had been decided at a time, no longer prevailing, when many forms of private consensual sexual acts were illegal in California. <em>Id. </em>at 253-254. The court then adopted a limited construction of the statute to prohibit only the commission of conduct in public \u201cwhich involves the touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breast, for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, annoyance or offense, by a person who knows or should know of the presence of persons who may be offended by the conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 256-257. Under the court\u2019s construction, the statute could lawfully prohibit the solicitation of such conduct only if the solicitation occurred in public and only if the conduct itself was to be performed in public. <em>Id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In order to satisfy constitutional standards of specificity, we think a similarly definite construction is appropriate here. We therefore construe the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision to prohibit only the commission of conduct in a public place, or the public solicitation of conduct to be performed in a public place, when the conduct committed or solicited involves the touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breasts, for purposes of sexual arousal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>gratification, or offense, by a person who knows or should know of the presence of a person or persons who may be offended by the conduct. As so construed, the provision does not impose generalized, indefinite behavioral standards under which the criminality of conduct depends on the personal predilections of the judge or the jury; nor does it invite discriminatory enforcement by police and prosecutors. Further by limiting the speech proscribed to the solicitation of particular public sexual conduct which is itself criminal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the construed provision does not reach speech protected by the First Amendment, and hence avoids any problems of overbreadth. See <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 520 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 586 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In summary, we hold that the \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision was unconstitutionally vague as construed by our past decisions in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Thus the conviction must be reversed, and a finding of not guilty entered. Under the construction established in this opinion, the statutory provision complies with constitutional standards.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1073, \u00a7 20, in its entirety, reads as follows: \u201cCommon night walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers, persons who with offensive and disorderly act or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior, idle and disorderly persons, prostitutes, disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such f\u00edne and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> It is unclear from the record at what point the disorderly person charge was dropped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> As the Supreme Court of California noted in <em>Pryor, </em>\u201cSome jurors would find that acts of extramarital intercourse fall within [the challenged terms]; some would draw the line between intercourse and other sexual acts; others would distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual acts.

The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Garcia </em>is hence misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\"> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 10, 12 (1977) (defining prostitution as including both the performance of indiscriminate sexual acts for hire and the solicitation or agreement to perform such acts). The case before us addresses <em>noncommercial </em>sexual solicitation and activity only, and does not limit the offense of prostitution, punishable under a separate provision of \u00a7 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\"> We note that even when judged under the narrowing construction adopted in this opinion, the defendant\u2019s speech and conduct falls outside the statutory prohibition. No public sexual conduct took place; nor did the defendant solicit any such conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
