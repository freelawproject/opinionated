L. c. 83, \u00a7 10, to require a property owner to connect a building to a common sewer. A judge of the Superior Court ruled that G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 11, gives that power to the local board of health, and that the board of sewer commissioners does not have the same power. He also ordered the town clerk to transmit to the Attorney General as a \u201cby-law\u201d subject to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32, a vote of the town meeting on the subject of sewer connections. We affirm the judgments entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The plaintiffs are homeowners and a corporate property owner in the town of Hardwick. In May, 1979, the board of selectmen, acting as the board of sewer commissioners, directed them to make arrangements to connect their sewage drains to a public sewer. In June, 1979, at a special town meeting, the voters of the town passed a vote that \u201cproperty will not be required to connect to the public sewer system\u201d if the owner obtains from the board of health a certificate of adequacy of his private disposal system. In July and August, 1979, the plaintiffs filed three complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the board of sewer commissioners, the board of health, the town, and the town clerk. The cases were heard on statements of agreed facts showing that the board of health has not required the sewer connections in issue, and judgments were entered awarding the plaintiffs the relief sought. The defendants appealed, and we allowed their application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The board of sewer commissioners acted pursuant to regulations adopted by them in April, 1975, on the supposed authority of G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 10,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> providing for \u201crules and reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ulations . . . for the connection of . . . buildings with sewers.\u201d Under G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 11, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the board of health \u201cmay require\u201d the owner of a building on land abutting a way in which there is a common sewer \u201cto connect the same therewith by a sufficient drain.\u201d If the town has appropriated money for connections with common sewers, the board or officer in charge of repair and maintenance of sewers \u201cshall make such connection\u201d upon an order of the board of health or on the application of the owner. G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 3. \u201cShall\u201d in \u00a7 3 is not to be construed as \u201cmay\u201d: upon a showing of reasonable sewer capacity to serve the buildings in question, the owners have \u201ca right to the connections.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Water &amp; Sewer Comm\u2019rs of Norwood, </em>353 Mass. 708, 710-711 (1968). See <em>P &amp; D Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dedham, </em>359 Mass. 96, 103 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Local boards of health \u201cmay make and enforce regulations for the public health and safety relative to house drainage and connection with common sewers, if such a sewer abuts the estate to be drained.\u201d G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 127, as amended through St. 1963, c. 148, \u00a7 2. We have reviewed the reasonableness of such regulations, <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Holden Suburban Supply Co., </em>343 Mass. 187, 190-191 (1961). The board cannot authorize a violation of a valid ordinance or by-law. See <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Peabody, </em>248 Mass. 165, 169 (1924). We have upheld a zoning ordinance requiring sewer connections for certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>commercial uses on the ground that the health statutes did not preclude \u201cappropriate, more specific and stringent health protection measures in a zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to G. L. c. 40A.\u201d <em>Decoulos </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>360 Mass. 428, 429 (1971). In the absence of an appropriate health and safety measure requiring a sewer connection, however, we seem to have assumed that the use of the common sewer is a matter for decision by the owner. See <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Sewerage Comm\u2019rs of Brockton, </em>175 Mass. 242, 244 (1900), affd, 182 U.S. 398 (1901); <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>172 Mass. 348, 354-355 (1899); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>9 Cush. 233, 237 (1852).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">We think the public health and safety are fully protected by the explicit power granted to the board of health by G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 11. The power of the sewer commissioners under \u00a7 10 is naturally read as relating to the manner of connecting rather than the requirement of connection, and \u00a7 3 seems to confirm that reading. Extension of that power by implication would produce an unnecessary overlap with the power of the board of health, with attendant possibilities of confusion and conflict. Cf. <em>Board of Pub. Works of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Wellesley, </em>377 Mass. 620, 627-629 (1979) (retention of separate counsel). Thus we conclude that the sewer commissioners did not have the authority claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The agreed facts disclose that the town constructed its waste water treatment facility under the compulsion of a court order, and suggest that charges and assessments for construction, maintenance, and use of the facility precipitated the dispute between the parties. No question is presented, however, with respect to such charges and assessments. See, e.g., <em>Stepan Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilmington, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 880 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The vote of the town in June, 1979, with reference to sewer connections does not in terms amend the by-laws of the town or otherwise refer to those by-laws, and the town clerk has refused to submit the vote to the Attorney General pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32. The judge ruled that the vote is a \u201cby-law,\u201d and one of the judgments appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>orders the town clerk to comply with that statute. The defendants deny the validity of the vote on the ground that it conflicts with the statutory authority of the sewer commissioners. Since we hold that the sewer commissioners do not have the authority claimed, the judgment directing compliance with G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b27-7\"> General Laws c. 83, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1964, c. 736, \u00a7 3, states: \u201cA city, town or sewer district may, from time to time, prescribe rules and regulations regarding the use of common sewers to prevent the entrance or discharge therein of any substance which may tend to interfere with the flow of sewage or the proper operation of the sewerage system and the treatment and disposal works, for the connection of estates and buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>with sewers, for the construction, alteration, and use of all connections entering into such sewers, and for the inspection of all materials used therein; and may prescribe penalties, not exceeding twenty dollars, for each violation of any such rule or regulation.
