Kelley, M.D., commenced this action in the Probate Court seeking instructions interpreting a provision in the trust. The disputed provision requires that if any of the beneficiaries (the donor\u2019s children) is indebted to the donor at the time of distribution of the trust principal, such indebtedness must be deducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>from that child\u2019s distributive share.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A <em>son, </em>Kevin, had borrowed $25,000 from the donor, of which $20,000 was unpaid at the time of the father\u2019s death. The trustees seek a determination whether this provision requires the deduction of the $20,000 debt which was discharged in bankruptcy prior to Dr. Kelley\u2019s death. The defendant beneficiaries disagree as to the effect of this provision. Kevin Kelley and his sister Judith Kelley Nelligan claim the debt should not be deducted from his share. Kevin\u2019s brothers, Vincent J. Kelley, Jr., and Stephen E. Kelley, claim the debt should be deducted. The Probate Court judge ruled that the debt should be deducted. Kevin Kelley appeals from that ruling. Having granted his application for direct appellate review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The Probate Court judge found the facts as follows. On November 20,1953, Dr. Kelley created a revocable trust for the benefit of his wife during her life which gave her a general power of appointment. The trust further provided in the event Mrs. Kelley failed to exercise the power, which failure occurred, that the trust principal should be distributed equally to their four children.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In 1969 Dr. Kelley loaned his son Kevin $25,000. Kevin repaid $5,000 of this loan in 1970. However, the circumstances of Kevin\u2019s financial affairs led to an estrangement between him and his father. On April 24, 1970, Dr. Kelley amended the trust to include the provision which is the subject of this dispute, as well as a provision entirely excluding Kevin from receiving any benefit under the trust. On August 22, 1972, Dr. Kelley deleted the provision excluding Kevin from receiving any benefits. On October 21, 1974, Kevin filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in Federal court. The $20,000 unpaid portion of Kevin\u2019s debt to Dr. Kelley was discharged by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Dr. Kelley died on August <em>4, </em>1975, leaving a will that was probated and which contained pour-over provisions to the November 20, 1953, trust. Mrs. Kelley died on August 8, 1977, leaving a will that was probated and which also contained pour-over provisions to the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">At the hearing of this matter, testimony of John F. Groden, a friend of Dr. Kelley, as well as his attorney and one of the trustees, was admitted, de bene. Mr. Groden testified Dr. Kelley told him subsequent to the execution of the trust and its amendments that he knew Kevin\u2019s debt of $20,000 was discharged by Kevin\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy and the discharge ended the matter. Mr. Groden interpreted these statements as a statement of Dr. Kelley\u2019s intention that Kevin\u2019s discharged indebtedness was not to be deducted from Kevin\u2019s distributive share under the trust. There was also testimony by Vincent Kelley, Jr., and Stephen Kelley that at the time of the discharge in bankruptcy and continuously thereafter, Dr. Kelley was in a nursing home as a result of a stroke and that his ability to communicate was very much impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We turn now to consider the merits of this appeal. It is fundamental that a trust instrument must be construed to give effect to the intention of the donor as ascertained from the language of the whole instrument considered in the light of circumstances known to the donor at the time of its execution. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Gring, </em>374 Mass. 109, 117 (1977), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The trust instrument directs the trustee upon the death of Dr. Kelley or his wife, whichever occurs later, to divide any remaining trust principal as well as any accumulated but undistributed income \u201cinto such number of shares as shall provide one equal share for each of the Donor\u2019s children then living . . . .\u201d The trust instrument should be read as expressing Dr. Kelley\u2019s intention to treat all of his children equally with regard to the distribution of his estate. We view the April 24, 1970, amendment as intended to maintain and preserve the equality of treatment of Dr. Kelley\u2019s children. It should therefore be read to require a deduction of any of the children\u2019s unpaid debts to Dr. Kelley, regardless of their technical legal enforceability. Cf. <em>Cummings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>v. <em>Bramhall, </em>120 Mass. 552, 561-562 (1876) (similarly construing will with regard to notes barred by the statute of limitations) ,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The testimony of Mr. Groden, admitted de bene, requires no contrary conclusion. Dr. Kelley\u2019s statements are at best equivocal as expressions of his intentions regarding the trust. In any event these statements, made after the execution of the trust and its amendments, were inadmissible as direct proof of Dr. Kelley\u2019s intention in using the language in the trust instrument.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Prindle, </em>290 Mass. 577, 581-582 (1935). <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>256 Mass. 107, 110 (1926). Cf. <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Svenson, </em>373 Mass. 273 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The appellant argues that the term \u201cindebtedness\u201d as used in the trust instrument should be given its normal and well-understood meaning and that in common parlance a debt ceases to be a debt when it is either no longer due or no longer collectible. We disagree. It is established that a \u201cdischarge [in bankruptcy] destroys the remedy but not the indebtedness.\u201d <em>Zavelo </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>227 U.S. 625, 629 (1913). In <em>Canton Lumber &amp; Supplies, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacNevin, </em>354 Mass. 563 (1968), the court held that discharge in bankruptcy does not extinguish the debt but is merely a bar to its enforcement. See <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Warwick Stores, Inc., </em>329 Mass. 406, 408 (1952); <em>Zwick </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>373 F.2d 110, 115-116 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 835 (1967); <em>Helms </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>129 F.2d 263, 266 (4th Cir. 1942). A moral obligation to pay the debt survives the discharge. <em>Zavelo </em>v. <em>Reeves, supra. Girardier </em>v. <em>Webster College, </em>563 F.2d 1267, 1271 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The appellant concedes that by using specific language, a donor may provide for the deduction of debts discharged in bankruptcy. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>136 Mass. 138 (1883) (recognizing rule with regard to a debt barred by statute of limitations).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Allen </em>and <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>297 Mass. 320 (1937), the appellant contends that the language in the April 24,1970, amendment is not sufficiently specific to require deduction of a discharged indebtedness. This misperceives the import of those cases. <em>Allen </em>and <em>Underwood </em>both turned on the absence of any language whatever in the instrument requiring the deduction of unpaid debts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The appellant next relies upon the construction in <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>309 Mass. 282 (1941), of a will which provided for the deduction of \u201cany indebtedness . . ., whenever incurred.\u201d The quoted language was considered determinative of the testator\u2019s intent and held to require deduction of debts barred by the statute of limitations. The appellant argues that the emphasis in <em>Stebbins </em>on the quoted language suggests that in the absence of such qualifying language no deduction of outlawed indebtedness is required. We disagree. <em>Stebbins </em>does not establish a rule of general applicability. The court in <em>Stebbins </em>was persuaded by clear and unambiguous language indicating a particular testator\u2019s intent. That decision does not absolve us of our responsibility in this case to look to the entire instrument to determine this donor\u2019s \u2014 albeit less clearly expressed \u2014 intent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Finally, the appellant argues that by virtue of the supremacy clause of the Federal Constitution, the Federal Bankruptcy Act, as in effect at the time of his discharge in bankruptcy, precludes the Probate Court from ordering that the discharged debt be deducted. The appellant takes the position that the plaintiffs\u2019 petition to the Probate Court for instructions construing the trust instrument requires the Probate Court to adjudicate the appellant\u2019s liability to an estate for a debt discharged in bankruptcy, and therefore constitutes the institution of an action or employment of a process to \u201ccollect such debts as personal liabilities of the bankrupt\u201d in contravention of \u00a7 14 (f) (2) of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The appellant argues further that by determining that the appellant\u2019s discharged indebtedness should be deducted, the Probate Court has improperly placed its imprimatur upon an action or process enabling a creditor to collect a discharged debt as a personal liability of the bankrupt. The appellant places primary reliance for this position on the Supreme Court decision in <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>402 U.S. 637 (1971). In <em>Perez </em>the Court struck down an Arizona statute which required the revocation of a driver\u2019s license for failure of the driver to pay a motor vehicle tort judgment, notwithstanding the subsequent discharge in bankruptcy of the judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We do not believe that the plaintiffs\u2019 petition or the judge\u2019s ruling in this case contravenes either the letter or the spirit of the Bankruptcy Act. The 1970 amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Bankruptcy Act relied upon by the appellant was enacted to curtail the prior widespread practice of creditors instituting State court actions on discharged debts in the hope that the debtor would fail to plead affirmatively the discharge, thus, under prior law, enabling the creditor to obtain a judgment. See <em>Girardier </em>v. <em>Webster College, </em>563 F.2d 1267, 1271-1273 (8th Cir. 1977). Section 14 (f) (2) has been uniformly construed by the Federal courts to prevent creditors only from taking judicial actions (such as an action on the debt, garnishment or attachment) to collect on discharged debts, and not to prevent informal, nonlegal methods. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Ohio Edison Co., </em>611 F.2d 1170, 1172-1173 (6th Cir. 1979), and cases cited. The keystone to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Perez </em>was the State statute\u2019s effect as \u201ca powerful weapon for collection of a debt\u201d that has been released by operation of Federal law. <em>Girardier </em>v. <em>Webster College, supra </em>at 1273, quoting from <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 650. Courts applying the rule of <em>Perez </em>have limited that holding to apply to State action only, and not to private action to collect discharged debts. <em>Girardier </em>v. <em>Webster College, supra </em>at 1273-1274. In any event, the Probate Court judge has not made \u201ca determination of the personal liability of the bankrupt\u201d in this case. Rather, the judge has construed the donor\u2019s intention as to how the principal of the trust should be distributed among his heirs. In a similar context a Missouri Court of Appeals aptly observed: \u201cThe issue in this case does not involve the question of enforcement of obligation, moral or otherwise. The issue herein involves equality of . . . inheritance among the heirs.\u201d <em>Leach v. Armstrong, </em>236 Mo. App. 382, 388 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In view of our conclusion we need not consider the argument of the appellees, Vincent J. Kelley, Jr., and Stephen E. Kelley, that the doctrine of \u201cequitable retainer\u201d is applicable in this case and requires deduction of the appellant\u2019s debt from his distributive share.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\"> The pertinent language of the trust provides: \u201cIf any of the Donor\u2019s children are indebted to him and/or his wife, NATHALIE M. KELLEY, at the time of distribution of the principal, such indebtedness shall be considered as part of said principal, but shall be deducted from the share of such child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> The requirement to construe the instrument to give effect to the intention of the donor is essentially identical in the case of both trusts and wills. Compare <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Gring, </em>374 Mass. 109, 117 (1977) (trusts), and cases cited, with <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Svenson, </em>373 Mass. 273, 275 (1977) (wills), and cases cited. See <em>Second Bank-State St. Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Wasserman, </em>337 Mass. 195, 200 (1958), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> We note that no motion to strike appears in the record as to this evidence. Had such a motion been made, it would have been proper to allow it. The probate judge apparently properly disregarded such evidence in reaching his findings and conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> The appellant assumes, and we agree, that for purposes of this rule, a debt barred by the statute of limitations is analogous to a debt barred by a discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> In <em>Allen </em>the court construed the statutory predecessor of G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 25, as requiring the deduction from a legatee\u2019s distributive share of only legal debts in the face of a testator\u2019s silence with regard to deduction of indebtedness. <em>Underwood </em>likewise recognized this rule. Thus, these cases rejected as the law of Massachusetts the common law doctrine of \u201cequitable retainer\u201d which requires the deduction of a beneficiary\u2019s debt, whether legal or barred, despite the testator\u2019s or donor\u2019s silence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> In rejecting the appellant\u2019s suggested rule, we observe that in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Daniell, </em>8 Allen 343 (1864), the phrase \u201clegal debts\u201d was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>dispositive of the testator\u2019s intent that a legally unenforceable debt should not be deducted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> Section 14 (f) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32 [f] [1970]), in effect at the time of the appellant\u2019s discharge, provided: \u201cAn order of discharge shall \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u201c(1) declare that any judgment theretofore or thereafter obtained in any other court is null and void as a determination of the personal liability of the bankrupt with respect to any [discharged debts]; and</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u201c(2) enjoin all creditors whose debts are discharged from thereafter instituting or continuing any action or employing any process to collect such debts as personal liabilities of the bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">This section was added by Pub.
