(Parker), appeals from the decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) rendered on October 19, 1979. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. The decision of the board upheld a Department of Revenue (Department) assessment of an additional corporate excise for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>We summarize the pertinent facts as stipulated. Parker was the parent corporation of Parker Industries, Inc., owning eighty per cent of the outstanding shares of the subsidiary (Parker Industries). During the fiscal years ended January 31, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, Parker filed consolidated Federal and State income tax returns, deducting the allowable share of operating losses as were sustained by its subsidiary. For losses aggregating $1,937,212 Parker took current Federal and State deductions amounting to $1,322,959. The difference not deducted amounted to $614,253. During the years 1970, 1971, and 1972, Parker adjusted the basis of its investment in Parker Industries to reflect the deducted losses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">On March 30, 1972, Parker sold its entire interest in Parker Industries, realizing a long-term capital gain for Federal income tax purposes of $1,545,770. Parker reached this figure on its Federal return by adjusting its basis in Parker Industries. The adjustment was computed by entering on its Federal return the $614,253 carry-over loss, not allowable on earlier returns, and, following the formula of Treas. Reg. 26 C.F.R. 1.1502-32 (b) (2) (ii) (1980), adjusting its Federal basis downward by eighty per cent of the carry-over loss to reach a figure of $491,403.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reporting its net taxable income on the Massachusetts corporate excise return, however, Parker did not similarly reduce its basis in Parker Industries. The result was that Parker calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Federal gain against a basis of $1,201,900, while it measured its State gain against a basis of $1,694,116.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">After reviewing Parker\u2019s excise return for the tax year ended January 31,1973, the Department issued, on December 12, 1973, a notice of intention to assess income in excess of that reported. The Department found an unreported difference in net income amounting to $491,403,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assessed an increased excise of $42,084.47. This assessment was subsequently reduced to $23,024.26, reflecting a fifty per cent abatement in the assessment and interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The sum at issue in this appeal is $491,403, by which Parker adjusted its Federal basis. Parker reasons that, because G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b) (ii), </em>forbids prior loss carryover,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there is no need to make the pro rata adjustment to basis required by the Federal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The board agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the Department that the amount of capital gains reported to the Federal government determined the net income taxable under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(\u00e1) </em>(2),.as in effect on January 31, 1973.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We affirm the Board\u2019s decision on the basis of the statutory language then in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Parker urges a flexible construction of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2), to conform with the \u201cpractical reality\u201d of its situation. It suggests that we review the meaning of \u201cgain\u201d in light of several earlier decisions of this court. Parker also implies that a literal rather than a liberal reading of the statute raises serious constitutional problems under art. 44 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution and as an improper delegation of legislative taxing authority. The Department counters that a corporate excise is outside the limitations placed on income taxation by art. 44.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It argues that Parker is actually seeking a deduction and must therefore point to a specific statutory grant of that deduction. Moreover, the Department warns that administrative chaos would ensue upon departure from the present scheme of incorporating Federal tax law. We do not address the last two contentions because we accept the Department\u2019s reasoning that the plain meaning of the relevant statutes requires affirmation of the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">I. <em>Statutory Construction of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a730 and 38 (a) (2), During the Applicable Period.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The means by which Massachusetts taxed the gain from Parker\u2019s sale was spelled out in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2), as appearing in St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 58.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 38 starts with net income as defined in G. L. c. 63, <em>\u00a7 </em>30 (5) <em>(b), </em>enacted contemporaneously, St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 46,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and incorporates Federal definitions of gross and net income. The net income factor in the \u00a7 38 formula was thus \u201cgross income less the deductions . . . allowable under provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect for the taxable year.\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b). </em>The net income figure so derived was then adjusted under \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2), to include one-half of the amount of long-term capital gains realized \u201cas defined under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code . . . for the taxable year, ... to the extent includible in taxable net income reported to the federal government.\u201d General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2), as in use then.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The consistent inclusion of a Federal tax benchmark has not restrained a Legislature from carving out peculiar variations to further the State\u2019s tax policies. See <em>Central Me. Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>382 A.2d 302, 320 (Me. 1978); <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Connelly, </em>142 Conn. 483, 493 (1955). See generally 42 A.L.R.2d 797, \u00a7 2. Section 30 (5) <em>(b) (ii), </em>in effect during the taxable year at issue, forbade deductions from corporate net income based on \u201closses sustained in other taxable years.\u201d The plain meaning of this provision is to bar State use of the loss carryover to which Parker had recourse on its Federal return. See <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, 288 (1945) (statutory language is principal source of insight into legislative purpose); cf. Dane, Taxation of Corporations and Banks \u2014 1966 Legislation, 52 Mass. L.Q. 41, 52-55 (1967). The ban on prior year loss carry-over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>evinces a deliberate legislative choice to differentiate State from Federal practice in this area. Had the Legislature intended otherwise in 1966, it had ample subsequent opportunity to alter the law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, the Legislature took action to crystallize the divergence, delimiting specific instances when such carry-overs are permissible. St. 1973, c. 752, \u00a7 I-<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Parker contends that \u00a7 38 read narrowly conflicts with the specific ban on carry-over loss in \u00a7 30 because the \u00a7 30 exclusion vitiates the advantages of the Federal scheme: viz., carry-over of past losses with pro rata adjustment to basis. Although Parker urges that we interject the entire Federal symbiosis into the derivation of \u201cgains\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 38, we see no disharmony on the face of the two provisions. See <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Middlesex County </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>371 Mass. 456, 460 (1976) (statutes which do not necessarily conflict should be construed to have consistent directives so that both may be given effect); <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1975) (two or more statutes relating to same subject matter should be construed together so as to achieve a harmonious whole).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Examining the language of c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2), as it had effect during the tax years in question, we discern an intent to use the Federal figure for gains or losses as the starting point for a net income formula unique to Massachusetts. This formula cut in half the capital gains or loss figure reported to the Federal government. Without looking behind the gains figure reported to the Federal government, the Department simply plugged in half that amount in accordance with the statutory terms. Thus, in Parker\u2019s case, only half the gains reported were includible in the State calcula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tion. The determination to forbid the Federal treatment of loss is clearly within the taxing power and prerogative of the Legislature. See <em>Brown-Forman Co. </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>217 U.S. 563, 567 (1910) (power to tax is fundamental; State power subject only to restrictions of due process and equal protection); <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 478, 490-491 (1977), aff'd, 437 U.S. 255 (1978) (legislative classification for tax purposes given wide respect).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">For purposes of the Massachusetts formulation then in effect, only the capital gains figure reported had import; the method of deriving that figure did not, because the State policy was to use the literal Federal gains figure as a base for its own calculations. See <em>B.W. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 18 (1976) (gain which was not literally part of gross income as defined in Federal law could not be part of State gross income). In other jurisdictions without a saving clause such as that described in <em>Denniston </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>287 Or. 719 (1979), the results match our conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Champion Int\u2019l Corp. </em>v. <em>Bureau of Revenue, </em>88 N.M. 411, 416 (1975) (taxpayer electing to report cut timber as Federal capital gains bound by that figure on State return, even though he had not yet realized gain); <em>Production Credit Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, </em>404 Mich. 301, 303 (1978) (incorporation of Federal yardstick requires that income subject to State tax be same as Federal taxable income); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Theatres, Inc., </em>345 Pa. 270, 272 (1942) (State does not examine how Federal authorities fixed net income figure but simply uses that figure as an unvarying base for State taxation). The board correctly interpreted the statutory lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>guage that added capital gain to State net income \u201cto the extent includible in taxable net income <em>reported </em>to the federal government\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">II. <em>Constitutional Considerations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Parker appears to argue that under the Board\u2019s interpretation of State tax law, the gain involved is \u201cfictional\u201d because no corresponding tax loss benefit was provided to it, in contrast to the provisions of Federal law. In this context it also invokes art. 44 as prohibiting a tax on \u201cfictional\u201d income or gain. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>242 Mass. 242 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">a. <em>Was There a Taxable </em>Gain?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-15\">In advocating a flexible statutory construction, Parker suggests that the $491,403, which represents its downward adjustment of basis for Federal tax purposes, cannot be considered \u201cgain\u201d for purposes of measuring taxable Massachusetts net income under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2). To buttress its theory that the additional assessment taxes capital rather than profit, Parker expounds a judicial definition of gain which it claims \u00a7 38 <em>(a) </em>(2) embraces. We have no quarrel with the definition Parker proffers, that gain means an actual increase in wealth and not a mere paper profit, <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>291 Mass. 498, 501 (19T5); but we do not view the decision of the board as inconsistent with that definition. With the application of the criteria Parker advances, the difference between Parker\u2019s sale price and its capital investment represents a real dollar gain for Parker.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>First Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>274 Mass. 583, 586 (1931) (ordinary method of measuring gain is difference between sale price and cost of investment). From the figures presented, there appears no doubt that Parker did recoup its capital investment upon selling Parker Industries. See <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>States, </em>253 F. Supp. 116, 118 (S.D. Ill. 1966) (recoupment of cost must precede any need to report a gain). Nor do the instant facts make out an impermissible tax on the augmented value of intangible property still in the taxpayer\u2019s possession, as in <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Fopiano, </em>324 Mass. 304, 308 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">How the State or Federal authorities choose to tax Parker\u2019s gain does not alter its basic nature. The $491,403 which Parker defends is merely an intermediate figure in the ultimate Federal calculation of gain. It plays no part in the Massachusetts formula. Our holding that the Department\u2019s assessment reached Parker\u2019s income and not its capital forecloses Parker\u2019s first constitutional challenge under art. 44 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">b. <em>The Delegation Question.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Parker also challenges the Board\u2019s apparent reliance on the fact that the Legislature knew of the provisions of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-32(b) (2) (ii) when it enacted \u00a7 \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b) (ii) </em>and 38 <em>(a) </em>(2) in 1966. Parker argues persuasively that the regulation was not in effect when these statutes were enacted. Parker argues that an interpretation of the statutes which would give effect to subsequent Federal regulatory enactments would be to attribute to the Legislature an improper intent to delegate legislative power in violation of the Massachusetts Constitution, Part II, c. 1, \u00a7 1, art. 4. We believe that the knowledge presumed does not go to specific future regulations but to the general premise which underlies the incorporation by reference of a portion of Federal tax law: that the Federal definitions may vary from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>one taxable year to the next. See our discussion, <em>supra, </em>of the incorporation of Federal definitions of gross and net income for the \u201capplicable period.\u201d See also <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 478, 491 (1977) (action of Federal authorities \u201cmay influence the amount of the [State] tax payable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Even if the board erroneously deduced legislative prescience of Federal law, the prospective incorporation of Federal tax law does not constitute impermissible delegation of legislative authority. In <em>First Fed. Sav., supra </em>at 491, this court stated with clarity the distinction which adheres to federalizing our tax law: \u201c[Federal] action may influence the amount of the tax payable, but the taxing power has not been delegated to [the Federal government].\u201d Cases cited by Parker fail to persuade us that there has been an impermissible delegation. We note moreover that the overwhelming body of decisional law on this question negates Parker\u2019s nondelegation thesis. See <em>City Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>251 Iowa 603, 616 (1960) (though State Constitution forbids ref\u00e9rence to other law to determine tax, no violation for Legislature to define State net income as adjusted gross income reported on Federal tax return); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Tiemann, </em>182 Neb. 393, 398 (1967) (upholding State laws incorporating future United States income tax law); <em>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>142 Conn. 483, 490 (1955) (corporate income tax statute may use Federal definition of gross income with certain exceptions); accord, <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 502-503 (1972); <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>Mahin, 43 Ill. </em>2d 36, 49 (1969); <em>Katzenberg </em>v. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>263 Md. 189, 204 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The case of <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Taxation, </em>289 Minn. 220 (1971), which Parker advances, supports the Department\u2019s premise that if the Legislature had wished to achieve the total incorporation Parker advocates, it knew exactly how to go about it. In <em>Wallace, </em>as in the case at bar, the court reconciled a general provision incorporating Federal tax law with a specific State enactment which negated a Federal exclusion. The same phenomenon has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>occurred in Parker\u2019s case: the general allusion to the Federal definitions of income in \u00a7\u00a7 30 (5) and 38 <em>(a) </em>(2) cannot be read to supersede the specific formulations and exclusions of those sections. Specific statutory provisions preempt general ones. <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em>364 Mass. 109, 118 (1973). <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>288 Mass. 557, 564 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-5\"> Treas.

Parker appears to have reduced its basis by eighty per cent of the losses claimed and deducted. For example, Parker deducted current losses of $243,625 for the tax year ended January 31, 1970.

See St. 1919, c. 355, \u00a7 3 (\u201cnet income\u201d as defined in Federal Revenue Act of 1918); St. 1922, c. 302 (adding reference to Federal Revenue Act of 1921); St. 1925, c. 265, \u00a7 1 (specific year of Federal act replaced by phrase \u201cfor the applicable period\u201d); St. 1925, c. 343, \u00a7 1A; St. 1930, c. 220, \u00a7 3; St. 1933, c. 327, \u00a7 3 (\u201capplicable period\u201d remained through successive modifications of section not affecting Federal incorporation). Section 38\u2019s incorporation of Federal figures, however, was more recent. Compare St. 1920, c. 415, \u00a7 2 (listing classes of income allocable to Commonwealth under \u00a7 38 without mention of Federal law), with St. 1966, c. 698, \u00a7 58 (incorporating reference to Internal Revenue Code into definition of gains and losses for allocation of State taxable net income). See also <em>Dow Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>378 Mass. 254, 264-265 (1979); <em>B.W. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 18, 22-23 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a), </em>was amended by St. 1967, c. 755, \u00a7 3, but the treatment of prior losses remained intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"> Statute 1973, c. 752, \u00a7 1, carved out an exception to carry-over losses, allowing their use for the first five consecutive taxable years of a corporation. The fifty per cent ownership rule, as well as the five-year eligibility period, would have precluded its applicability to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> Parker urges this court to follow the Oregon court which, in <em>Denniston </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>287 Or. 719, 733-734 (1979), resolved discrepancies between State and Federal tax law in the taxpayer\u2019s favor. Although the <em>Denniston </em>opinion addressed the question of the hardship which may result from the interplay of Federal and State tax laws, we think the facts of <em>Denniston </em>and, more particularly the pertinent statutes, are sufficiently different from those at bar to produce a contrary result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b276-36\"> If we ignore any of the tax allowances for loss, the simple figures show that Parker invested $1,504,000 in Parker Industries, then sold it for $2,747,670, with a resultant dollar gain of $1,243,670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> We note at this juncture that the distinction which the Department raises between an income tax and a corporate excise does not obviate the constitutional question if the excise is unreasonable. Art. 44 of the Amendments (excises must be \u201creasonable\u201d). P. Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts 122 (3d ed. 1938) (excise need not be proportional but must be reasonable). To the extent that Parker asserts that the excise is unreasonable because it is not levied against a measurable gain, our discussion in the body of the opinion negates this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
