(Clinic). The plaintiffs consist of a trustee of the S.M.I. Coach Trust, a Massachusetts trust which owns the locus, and the Clinic, which leases it. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. The sole issue presented is whether, on the basis of the materials submitted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to him pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974), the judge correctly determined that no genuine issue of material fact was presented under the zoning bylaw of Framingham (by-law) as to the Clinic\u2019s right to use the locus for its contemplated purposes. We hold that he did, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The facility proposed by the Clinic would provide gynecological services, including first trimester abortions. It would be staffed by nurses and trained counselors as well as medical doctors. Although a final floor plan does not appear on the record, the facility evidently would consist of about six rooms, including office space, a laboratory, a \u201ctreatment room\u201d where abortions could be performed, and \u201crecovery rooms\u201d for immediate postoperative care. We assume, in the absence of any sworn statement or allegation to the contrary, that this facility would in all respects satisfy applicable State licensing and regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The Clinic has for some time sought a suitable location for such a facility in the suburbs west of Boston.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At some time prior to November, 1978, the officers of the Clinic became interested in the suite of offices here in question. It is undisputed that these offices lie in an area of Framingham classified by the town\u2019s zoning by-law as a \u201cbusiness district.\u201d The Clinic\u2019s president accordingly sought from the building commissioner a preliminary determination as to whether the proposed facility would be a use allowable in such a district. With its request for this determination, the Clinic submitted a copy of each of the following documents: (a) its 1976 \u201cDetermination of Need Application\u201d which was required to be filed for licensing by the Department of Public Health pursuant to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 25B - 25H, and (b) a copy of \u201cProposed Clinic Policies and Procedures,\u201d which summarized the Clinic\u2019s program, focusing particularly on abortion services. By letter dated November 20, 1978, the building commissioner stated that based upon the materials submitted, as well as his conversation with the Clinic\u2019s president, he considered the Clinic\u2019s proposed use to be a \u201c[b]usiness or professional office,\u201d a use permitted as of right by the applicable provisions of the by-law. His opinion was conditioned on the Clinic\u2019s \u201cassurance that there will be no significant difference in staffing or operational format in any current application which you may submit.\u201d The building commissioner further emphasized the necessity of submitting a formal application for a building permit, as well as an off-street parking plan, and of obtaining certificates of inspection and use prior to occupation of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>On the strength of the building commissioner\u2019s preliminary opinion, the plaintiffs proceeded with the purchase and lease of the locus, applied to the commissioner for a building permit, and sought approval of a parking plan by the town\u2019s planning board. On December 18, 1978, the Clinic submitted a preliminary floor plan of the proposed facility. The building commissioner requested revisions to bring the plans into compliance with the building code and altered plans were submitted on January 26,1979. Further revisions were requested on February 20, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">During this interim, the Clinic\u2019s plans became known to the public, and opposition to the proposed facility became apparent. On February 27, 1979, a special town meeting was convened to consider an amendment to the by-law, one effect of which would have been to require a special permit from the board of appeals prior to locating any clinic in a business district. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 14. This change was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Following this town meeting, and before the Clinic had submitted final floor plans, the building commissioner indicated that he had reconsidered his initial opinion as to the appropriate classification of the Clinic\u2019s proposed use. On March 5, 1979, he wrote to the board of selectmen of Framingham stating the view that \u201cfurther investigation\u201d would be required prior to taking final action on the Clinic\u2019s application for a building permit. This letter noted the inclusion in the Clinic\u2019s floor plans of \u201cfunctional areas not normal to a [pjhysician\u2019s [ojffice,\u201d and queried whether the facility would be consistent with the purposes of the by-law, stated in \u00a7 IB as \u201cto establish such regulations for the uses of premises, as will protect and promote life, health, safety, morals, convenience and general welfare of the Townspeople.\u201d For the first time, the building commissioner raised the question whether the Clinic\u2019s use would require the granting of a special permit by the board of appeals. On March 12, 1979, the building commissioner notified the board of selectmen of his determination that such a permit would be required. The following day, he informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>plaintiffs that they would have to obtain the special approval of the board of appeals before a building permit could be issued. In support of his ultimate conclusion that the clinic was not a \u201cprofessional office\u201d within the meaning of the by-law, he noted the \u201cclose \u2018kinship\u2019 . . . between hospitals and health care clinics\u201d under certain state regulatory statutes, the proposed new by-law (rejected at the town meeting of February 27) distinguishing \u201cclinics\u201d from \u201cprofessional offices,\u201d and his view that an abortion could not \u201cpromote life,\u201d an express purpose of the by-law as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 V D 3 of the by-law and G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 15, the Clinic sought an order from the board of appeals reversing the decision of the building commissioner. On June 22, 1979, after a hearing, the board of appeals voted two to one \u201cto support the interpretation of the bylaw given by the Building Official.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As allowed by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, the plaintiffs appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. In their complaint the plaintiffs requested various forms of relief, including the following: (a) that the decision of the board of appeals be annulled; (b) that the proposed use be declared permissible; (c) that the building commissioner be ordered \u201cto issue a building permit to the Plaintiffs subject to the approval of the Plaintiffs parking plan and subject to a determination by the Building Commissioner that the Plaintiffs proposed modifications comply with the State Building Code\u201d; and (d) that the Superior Court \u201cretain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure that the relief granted herein is not frustrated by further arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory conduct on the part of the defendants.\u201d After filing affidavits attesting to the existence of other similar uses in Framingham\u2019s business districts, the plaintiffs moved, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, for summary judgment. The defendants submitted counter affidavits. On September 25, 1979, the motion was granted, the judge ruling as follows: \u201cIn this case the scope and extent of this proposed abortion clinic\u2019s business is set forth in Exhibit \u2018B\u2019. The proposed locus is within an area zoned as \u2018Business District\u2019. The intended use is a permitted use within Section III F of the Framingham Zoning By-Law. The contention of the defendants that the plaintiff must apply for a special permit is invalid.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Judgment was entered accordingly on November 29, 1979, granting the four measures of relief requested by the plaintiffs and specified above, and the defendants seasonably appealed therefrom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">It is useful at this point to review briefly the provisions of the by-law in so far as they may be applicable to the locus. As originally adopted in 1939 and as amended from time to time thereafter, under the authority of The Zoning Act, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-17, and its predecessor statutes, the Framingham by-law comprehensively regulates the use of land within the town. The by-law divides the town into six classes of districts, the first two of which are \u201cresidence districts\u201d and \u201cbusiness districts.\u201d \u00a7 II A (1) and (2). Uses permitted in a residence district include, among others, a \u201c[professional office . . . within the principal residence of a physician . . . provided that not more than two other persons are regularly employed therein,\u201d and subject to certain space restrictions, \u00a7 III A (l)(c), and \u201cprivate and public hospitals and dormitories accessory thereto,\u201d \u00a7 III A (l)(d). Section III F of the by-law sets forth the uses permitted in business districts. Section III F (l)(a) permits \u201c[a]ll uses that are permitted in General Residence Districts but subject to any of the conditions and restrictions set forth relative thereto.\u201d Use of a property for \u201c[bjusiness or professional offices\u201d is permitted by \u00a7 III F (l)(c). The following section, \u00a7 III F (l)(d), lists specifically thirty-nine permitted uses, ranging from \u201cbaker\u201d to \u201cwheelwright,\u201d then authorizes \u201csuch other uses as the Board of Appeals may grant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The defendants challenge the judgment of the Superior Court on two grounds, the first legal, the second procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>and factual. First, they argue as a matter of statutory construction that the facility proposed by the Clinic is neither a \u201cprofessional office\u201d nor a \u201chospital\u201d as those terms are used in the applicable sections of the by-law. They thus conclude that the Clinic\u2019s use falls into the residual category of uses under \u00a7 III F (l)(d) of the by-law requiring special approval of the board of appeals before a building permit can be issued. Because we agree with the judge that the proposed facility is not genetically distinguishable from the uses allowed as of right by the by-law, we reach the defendants\u2019 second contention. They assert that sufficient questions of material fact as to the permissibility of the Clinic\u2019s use were raised in the Superior Court to preclude a grant of summary judgment on that issue. The defendants thus argue that even if their interpretation of the by-law is rejected, this case must be remanded for trial as to the permissibility of the Clinic\u2019s use under a correct interpretation of the by-law. In the circumstances of this case, we are persuaded that the grant of summary judgment was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">1. <em>Interpretation of the by-law. </em>The by-law does not specifically define either the term \u201cprofessional office\u201d or the term \u201chospital.\u201d In the absence of an express definition, the meaning of a word or phrase used in a local zoning enactment is a question of law, <em>Kurz </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of N. Reading, </em>341 Mass. 110 (1960), and is to be determined by the ordinary principles of statutory construction. Specific provisions of a zoning enactment are to be read in the context of the law as a whole, giving the language its common and approved meaning \u201cwithout regard to . . . [the court\u2019s] own conceptions of expediency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>S.S. Kresge Co., </em>267 Mass. 145, 148 (1929). <em>Shuman </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Newton, </em>361 Mass. 758, 766 (1972). <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Brockton, </em>351 Mass. 472, 475 (1966), and cases cited. \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the [by-law\u2019s] enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The term \u201cclinic\u201d is used in a medical context to denote an institution offering medical services on an outpatient basis. Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 503 (2d ed. 1959). At the time of the board\u2019s action in this case, G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 52, as appearing in St. 1967, c. 891, \u00a7 2, defined a \u201cclinic\u201d for licensing purposes as \u201cany institution or place however named, conducted for charity or profit, which is advertised, announced, established or maintained under the name of a clinic for the purpose of providing medical, surgical, dental, restorative or mental hygiene services to persons not residing therein. Clinic shall include such places as \u2018medical associates\u2019, \u2018dispensary\u2019, \u2018medical center\u2019, \u2018medical institute\u2019, \u2018rehabilitation center\u2019, \u2018rehabilitation institute\u2019, \u2018memorial\u2019, \u2018association\u2019, or such other designation of like import but not necessarily limited to the above mentioned,\u201d with certain exceptions not here relevant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a case holding void for vagueness a licensing statute applicable to \u201cclinics,\u201d the Court of Appeals of the State of New York observed that the term is \u201cinclusive of many kinds of individual, partnership, and group medical practice, which concededly are not subject to or intended to be subject to [the statute in question].\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Dobbs Ferry Medical Pavillion, Inc., </em>33 N.Y.2d 584, 585, affirming 40 App. Div. 2d 324 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">At a minimum, we think it clear from the breadth of these definitions that the absence of any mention of a \u201cclinic\u201d as a use permitted by the by-law is not determinative of this case. Cf. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Falmouth, </em>352 Mass. 307, 309 (1967). Further, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>disagree with the defendants\u2019 observation that not every facility which could properly be described as a \u201cclinic\u201d would fall within the uses permitted by the by-law. \u201c[I]t is the use to which the premises are put rather than the external indicia of use which is controlling under the by-law.\u201d <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>352 Mass. 54, 59 (1967). In this case, we deal with an office suite of approximately six rooms devoted exclusively to the practice of a recognized medical specialty. Such a facility, however labeled, seems plainly to be within the range of uses allowed in Framingham\u2019s business districts. While the term \u201cprofessional office\u201d has been the source of some controversy in zoning cases,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the instant case hardly places us at the periphery of its meaning. Section III A (1) (c) of the bylaw expressly recognizes a physician\u2019s office as a professional use. Other relevant authorities are in accord. The dictionary defines a \u201cprofession\u201d as \u201ca calling in which one professes to have acquired some special knowledge used by way either of instructing, guiding, or advising others, or of serving them in some art,\u201d and cites medicine, together with law and theology, as the paradigms. Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1975 (2d ed. 1959). Substantially identical definitions of the word are given by the United States Supreme Court and a leading treatise on the law of zoning. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Laws, </em>163 U.S. 258, 266 (1896). 3 R.M. Anderson, American Law of Zoning, \u00a7 16.11, at 69 (2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">That the facility contemplated by the Clinic will employ nurses and trained counselors to assist in the delivery of medical services, and will include physical areas devoted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>their use, does not alter its character for zoning purposes. Section III A (1) (c) of the by-law authorizes the employment of as many as two assisting personnel in a professional office located in a \u201csingle residence\u201d district, a classification more restrictive than the \u201cbusiness district\u201d in which the Clinic would be located. A construction of the by-law which did not allow greater latitude to employ assistants in the less restrictive zone would be unreasonable, and is to be avoided. Cf. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Norwood, </em>358 Mass. 253, 258-259 (1970). More fundamentally, we think that absent some express limitation, the right to employ personnel and facilities reasonably necessary to a particular professional use is implicit in the authorization to establish a professional office. Any other construction would \u201c[destroy] the privilege given in that it would permit [the professional] to have an office but deny him, for all practical purposes, the privilege of using it.\u201d <em>Red Acres Improvement Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burkhalter, </em>193 Tenn. 79, 87 (1951). See 2 A.H. Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning \u00a7 23.02 (4th ed. &amp; Supp. 1980) (\u201cIt has been decided that [where the professional use is one which is specifically listed in the ordinance] such use includes the use of all equipment, facilities, and assisting personnel reasonably necessary for the practice of the profession involved\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In denying the Clinic a building permit, the defendants relied in part on the \u201ckinship\u201d between hospitals and clinics, asserting that the similarity was sufficient to differentiate the proposed facility from other uses allowed as \u201cprofessional offices.\u201d We draw the opposite conclusion. While we think it clear that the clinic here at issue would qualify as a professional office under any fair reading of the by-law, we need not rest our decision in this case on that ground alone. Framingham permits both professional offices and private hospitals to operate in its business districts. When a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>municipality allows as of right uses which lie at both ends of the spectrum in terms of a particular category of uses \u2014 here, the delivery of medical services \u2014 less importance need be attached to fixing precisely where on that spectrum a specific use lies. Cf. <em>N.R. Fairbanks Co. </em>v. <em>Blaine, </em>308 Minn. 315, 317-318 (1976) (\u201cIf both [of the plaintiffs contemplated uses] are individually permissible . . . we conclude that the combination of these uses must also be found permissible, absent a showing by the city that the hybrid use is in some way injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the neighboring landowners or the community at large\u201d); <em>Crain </em>v. <em>Louisville, </em>298 Ky. 421, 425 (1944) (nursing home permitted by ordinance allowing both hospitals and boarding houses; \u201c[w]hile perhaps it could not be characterized as either exclusively, it is certainly something in between the two establishments and, as the ordinance permits use for either purpose, it must be construed as permitting use of an institution that is between the two in character, for the extremes include the mean\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Nothing in the authorities cited by the defendants persuades us that the proposed facility will have an impact on the community significantly different from uses which the defendants concede are presently allowed. The defendants point first to the definitions of \u201cclinic\u201d and \u201chospital\u201d contained in G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 52, and correctly observe that, as noted previously, clinics are there differentiated from hospitals primarily by the fact that they provide outpatient rather than residential care. The defendants fail, however, to explain how this difference can justify the denial of a permit to build in an area where both outpatient (doctors\u2019 offices) and inpatient (hospital) institutions are permitted. To the extent that the definitions set forth in \u00a7 52 suggest a generic similarity between clinics and hospitals, they support our conclusion that the proposed use is one permitted as of right. Beyond that, we think these statutory definitions, written for the purpose of regulating and licensing health care facilities, \u201c[relate] \u2018only vaguely, if at all, to . . . [the interpretation of a zoning by-law. The statute\u2019s] concern is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>with matters other than zoning.\u201d\u2019 <em>Selectmen of Hatfield </em>v. <em>Garvey, </em>362 Mass. 821, 825-826 (1973), quoting from <em>Manchester </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>343 Mass. 591, 593 n.3 (1962). The defendants\u2019 reliance on cases from other jurisdictions distinguishing between \u201cclinics\u201d and \u201cprofessional offices\u201d is similarly misplaced. Two of these cases deal with zoning enactments which permitted \u201cprofessional offices\u201d but not \u201chospitals,\u201d and turn on the similarity between the \u201cclinic\u201d facilities in question and hospitals. See <em>Long </em>v. <em>Elk Grove Village, </em>64 Ill. App. 3d 1006, 1010 (1978) (reversing trial court determination that an abortion clinic was a use allowed as of right in a zone permitting business and professional offices; remanding for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the clinic in question is \u201ca business or professional office under the ordinance or whether in fact it is more like a hospital\u201d). <em>People ex rel. D\u2019Iorio </em>v. <em>Alfa Realty Co., </em>69 Misc. 2d 475 (N.Y. City Ct. 1972) (methadone clinic is a \u201chospital\u201d related facility, not a use permitted as a \u201cprofessional office\u201d). A third case, <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>66 Misc. 2d 514 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1971), holds that an abortion clinic must meet statutory licensing requirements applicable to hospitals, and rejects a claim of exemption based on the similarity of the facility to a doctor\u2019s office. We think it adequate to repeat that we do not deal here with the application of a licensing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The remaining grounds cited for the administrative denial of the Clinic\u2019s application are not argued in the defendants\u2019 brief, and are in any event without merit. The rejected proposed by-law amendment, which would have required special permits for clinical facilities, has no bearing on the proper interpretation of the existing by-law, nor could it expand the building commissioner\u2019s powers under it. <em>Ouellette </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Quincy, </em>362 Mass. 272, 279-280 (1972). See <em>Fellsway Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Medford, </em>332 Mass. 471 (1955). Where a zoning by-law allows a particular use, the personal opinion of a local zoning administrator as to whether that use promotes \u201clife\u201d or any other of the by-law\u2019s stated purposes is irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>vant. Such recitations of legislative purpose \u201csuggest standards for the exercise of discretion where such discretion is otherwise provided. They are not themselves a source of discretion.\u201d <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Ipswich, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 109, 112 (1976). See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Framingham, </em>353 Mass. 141, 145 (1967); <em>Daley Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Randolph, </em>340 Mass. 149, 155 (1959). If the town of Framingham had wished or intended to distinguish between clinics and other medical facilities for zoning purposes, it could have done so by the use of precise language in the by-law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Selvetti </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Revere, </em>356 Mass. 720 (1969). It may not now accomplish that result by a patently unreasonable interpretation of the by-law as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">2. <em>Appropriate relief. </em>We have concluded that the defendants interpreted the by-law incorrectly, and that the grounds on which they relied in denying the Clinic\u2019s application, whether taken singly or cumulatively, are inadequate to support the action taken. The defendants argue, however, that in the Superior Court they demonstrated sufficient issues of material fact as to the ultimate permissibility of the proposed use to preclude summary judgment on that question. Specifically, they contend that the judgment ordering the issuance of a permit should be vacated and this case remanded for trial to settle whether abortions are \u201cnormally and appropriately\u201d performed in physicians\u2019 offices and whether the extent of the activities included in the Clinic\u2019s intended use distinguishes it from other uses allowed in Framingham\u2019s business districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>A holding that a board of appeals erred in its interpretation of a zoning by-law or ordinance, standing alone, will not ordinarily suffice to support an order that a permit issue. <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Sharon, </em>351 Mass. 561, 567-568 (1967). The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate in the Superior Court an entitlement to a building permit. <em>Id. </em>Upon such a showing, the issuance of a permit is a matter of duty, not discretion, and relief in the form of an order that a permit issue is appropriate. See <em>Fellsway Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Medford, supra </em>at 492; <em>Caputo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Somerville, </em>330 Mass. 107, 110 (1953); Ford, Judicial Review in Zoning Variance Cases and Related Matters, 61 Mass. L.Q. 24, 27-28 (1976). We have repeatedly approved of such relief in appropriate cases. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Ashland, </em>354 Mass. 660 (1968); <em>Deutschmann </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>325 Mass. 297 (1950); <em>D\u2019Ambra </em>v. Zoning <em>Board of Appeal of Attleboro, </em>324 Mass. 61 (1949); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Inspector of Bldgs. of Quincy, </em>323 Mass. 552 (1949). \u201cThese cases usually arise when the [board of appeals] has misinterpreted the relevant by-law or ordinance.\u201d <em>Ferrante </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Northampton, </em>345 Mass. 158, 162 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">In this case, the pleadings, coupled with the affidavits and exhibits submitted with the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, were sufficient to demonstrate that the Clinic\u2019s entitlement to a building permit turned solely on a correct interpretation of the by-law. Recause this was a question of law, the judge\u2019s disposition of it by summary judgment was entirely proper. Neither of the points raised by the defendants on this appeal stands in the way of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">First, as the trial judge correctly noted, the authority to regulate specific requirements for health facilities has been delegated to the Department of Public Health. See generally, G. L. c. 111. See also <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Southborough, </em>373 Mass. 279, 289 (1977) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring, with whom Quirico, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>joined). No allegation is made that the facility here in question does not meet those requirements as they pertain to the performance of first trimester abortions. For that reason, the only question relevant to zoning classification is whether the specific facility through which those services will be delivered comes within the scope of the uses permitted by the by-law, a question we have already settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">As to the intensity of the Clinic\u2019s use, we agree with the defendants that the extent of a particular use may in some instances distinguish it sufficiently from other genetically similar uses permitted by a zoning enactment to support the denial of a building permit. Here, however, it is undisputed that the Clinic\u2019s use will be confined to a single suite of some six offices. The defendants by affidavit indicated that the denial of the Clinic\u2019s application was based \u201csolely\u201d on the plans submitted. The plaintiffs explicitly alleged in their complaint that numerous substantially identical uses had been and were allowed in Framingham\u2019s business districts. With their motion for summary judgment, they submitted affidavits attesting to the existence of such uses. These affidavits showed not only that the defendants had previously permitted uses sharing the purportedly distinctive features of the instant facility, but also that there was nothing unusual about a suite of six rooms which would tend to distinguish it from other professional uses already permitted. We think these affidavits were sufficient to require the defendants to meet the allegations of fact contained therein by setting forth specific facts, by affidavit or otherwise, showing some issue or issues of fact requiring trial. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). \u201cIf the movant presents credible evidence that would entitle him to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial, this evidence must be accepted as true on a motion for summary judgment when the party opposing the motion does not offer counter-affidavits or other evidentiary material supporting his contention that an issue of fact remains, or does not show a good reason, in accordance with rule 56 (f), why he is unable to present facts justifying his opposition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>motion.\u201d 10 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2727, at 532-534 (1973 &amp; Supp. 1980). See <em>O\u2019Brion, Russell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>LeMay, </em>370 Mass. 243, 245 (1976). While the defendants attempted by counter-affidavit to distinguish two of the facilities cited by the Clinic, we are left with the overwhelming impression that the bulk of them are indistinguishable from the Clinic\u2019s contemplated use. We recognize that summary judgment will in many instances be an inappropriate vehicle for disposing of zoning cases due to the often complex and fairly disputable nature of the underlying facts. Nevertheless, in this area as elsewhere, we adhere to \u201cthe principle that well pleaded cases and motions for summary judgment supported by affidavits and other materials serve a \u2018salutary purpose\u2019 which should not be \u2018set at naught\u2019 where the opposing party merely raises \u2018vague and general allegations of expected proof.\u2019\u201d <em>Community Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 555-556 (1976), quoting from <em>Albre Marble </em>&amp; <em>Tile Co. </em>v. <em>John Bowen Co., </em>338 Mass. 394, 397 (1959). See <em>Cape Ann Land Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>374 Mass. 825 (1978) (approving order granting zoning variance issued on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment). The Superior Court judge\u2019s order in the instant case is carefully fashioned to require the plaintiffs\u2019 compliance with any other applicable provisions of the zoning by-law prior to their occupation and use of the locus. Such compliance is ensured by the lower court judge\u2019s retention of jurisdiction in this matter. In these circumstances, we perceive no legitimate purpose to be served by further trial proceedings, and thus we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court judge in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\"> The materials consisted of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, their motion for summary judgment, three affidavits with attached exhibits in support of the motion, and five affidavits (three of which were by the building commissioner and the remaining two by members of the town\u2019s board of selectmen) in opposition to the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\"> A prior decision of this court deals with the Clinic\u2019s attempt to establish a similar facility in Southborough. See <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Southborough, </em>373 Mass. 279 (1977). In that case, we invalidated an amendment to Southborough\u2019s zoning by-law which effectively prohibited the operation of an abortion clinic in that town. According to materials submitted with the present appeal, the delay caused by the litigation resulted in the Clinic\u2019s losing its lease to the South-borough premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-4\"> The full text of the March 13 letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cI have completed the zoning investigation referred to in my 3/5/79 letter to the Framingham Board of Selectmen, a copy of which was mailed to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cI have concluded that the Building Permit for which you have applied may not be issued until this particular use has been granted by the Framingham Zoning Board of Appeals as required by Section III.F.l.d. of the Framingham Zoning By-Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201cThis conclusion was reached after careful study of the definitions of Professional Offices, which are an allowable use under Sec. III. F.l.c. of the Zoning By-Law, and Climes, which are not included in a listing of specific allowable uses in Sec. III.F.l.d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201cChapter 111 of Mass. Gen.

The plaintiffs have therefore not pressed their appeal from the denial of their motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\"> By St. 1979, c. 674, \u00a7 1, this definition was rewritten to exclude certain doctors\u2019 offices and clinics established for. the sole use of the employees or students of a nonprofit organization or institution. This change, coming long after the by-law was written, and after the commencement of the Superior Court action in this case, has no direct bearing on our interpretation of the by-law. Both parties have correctly cited and discussed in their briefs the definition of \u201cclinic\u201d set forth by \u00a7 52 prior.to the 1979 amendment. To the extent that the amendment influences our analysis at all, it reinforces our belief that the term \u201cclinic\u201d is commonly understood to encompass at least some doctors\u2019 offices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\"> While this court has held that certain uses are not \u201cprofessional\u201d for zoning purposes, we have never undertaken a comprehensive definition of the term. See <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Holliston, </em>340 Mass. 488 (1960) (real estate brokerage held not to be a professional use); <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Brookline </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>263 Mass. 270 (1928) (undertaker\u2019s business held not to be a professional use). See also Annot., Construction and Effect of Zoning Provision Permitting Accessory Use for \u201cProfessional Office,\" 24 A.L.R.3d 1128 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b305-6\"> We note that a for-profit corporation organized to deliver specialized medical services might equally well be characterized as a business office, also a use allowed by the by-law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> We int\u00edmate here no view as to the validity of the zoning enactment singling out clinical facilities for special treatment. In his memorandum, the Superior Court judge cited our decision in <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Southborough, </em>373 Mass. 279 (1977), and there is language in the memorandum suggesting that, as enforced by the defendants, the Framingham by-law might amount to an effective local ban on abortion clinics of the sort held invalid in that decision. Because we do not believe that the by-law here at issue, properly construed, has any such effect, we need not comment on that part of the trial judge\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
