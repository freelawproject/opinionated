The board of review (board) denied unemployment benefits to the claimant (Conlon) because she restricted her availability for work to a daytime shift which was consistent with her fulfilment of responsibilities to her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">A District Court judge reversed the board\u2019s determination and ordered the payment of benefits. We agree that the board erred in its decision but conclude that the proceeding must be remanded to the Division of Employment Security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>(division) for findings in light of principles we set forth in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The board, adopting the decision of the review examiner, found that Conlon worked as a nurses\u2019 aide in a nursing home from 1975 until April, 1979, when the employer terminated operations. Conlon sought and received unemployment benefits, but those benefits were terminated when Conlon indicated that she was available for work only on the 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift. At the hearing, Conlon explained that she had six children whose ages ranged from seven to seventeen and that her husband was a fireman who was required to work nights. She was not willing to leave the children without parental supervision at night, and, therefore, restricted her availability to the day shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The board affirmed the decision of the review examiner and ruled that to meet the availability requirements of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 24(6), \u201cthe person claiming benefits must be willing and able to work full time on any shift normally operated in the occupation for which she is suited by training and experience.\u201d The board denied Conlon benefits, concluding that, by her unwillingness to work all shifts other than the day shift, she had eliminated a major portion of her employment opportunities and had failed to meet the availability requirements of \u00a7 24(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">On Conlon\u2019s appeal, the District Court judge reversed the board\u2019s decision. He concluded that the board\u2019s focus solely on the availability standard of \u00a7 24 (6) was improper because it failed to recognize that a person must be available only for employment that is \u201csuitable employment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 25 (c). He ruled, as a matter of law, that Conlon was entitled to benefits from the date those benefits were terminated until August 27, 1979, when she secured employment (incidentally, within hours acceptable to her). The director of the division appeals from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The question whether a person who refuses work at certain hours because of domestic responsibilities is entitled to unemployment compensation has not been answered in this State. It has been answered variously in other jurisdictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>See Annot., 35 A.L.R.3d 1129, 1137-1145 (1971 &amp; Supp. 1980), where cases are collected. The tendency in earlier opinions was to focus on the general requirement that a person must be \u201cavailable\u201d for work in order to be eligible for compensation. These opinions held that restricting one\u2019s employability to certain times of day because of child care duties rendered the individual unavailable for work. The theory was that the individual \u201cmust be exposed unequivocally to the labor market,\u201d <em>Leclerc </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>137 Conn. 438, 439 (1951), and willing to work during all hours \u201cas are customary in the type of employment to which he is suited,\u201d <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., </em>240 Minn. 449, 456 (1953). See, e.g., <em>York </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>16 Or. App. 76 (1973); <em>Judson Mills </em>v. <em>South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n, </em>204 S.C. 37 (1944); <em>Aladdin Indus. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>219 Tenn. 71 (1966). Cf. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Comm\u2019n, </em>316 Mich. 468, 472 (1947), where the statute required the unemployed person to be available for appropriate work \u201cfull-time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">More recent opinions have focused less exclusively on availability and have broadened the inquiry to include consideration of statutory language that requires the individual to be available only for \u201csuitable\u201d employment which he has no \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse. The issue with respect to domestic responsibilities has been whether domestic responsibilities could constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d Since the Massachusetts Employment Security Law has language of this type,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the analysis in these cases is useful here.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Some jurisdictions have adopted a narrow definition of good cause. The Supreme Court of Minnesota has limited good cause to reasons which are of a <em>\u201ctemporary </em>and <em>emergency </em>character\u201d (emphasis in original), and to justifiable reasons pertaining to the particular job. <em>Swanson </em>v. <em>Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., </em>240 Minn. 449, 457-458 (1953). Vermont has maintained a narrow view of the meaning of \u201cgood cause,\u201d by reading into \u201cgood cause\u201d in the applicable statute the qualifying words found in the separate statutory disqualification of a person who leaves his employment \u201cwithout good cause attributable to [the employer].\u201d <em>In re Prouty, </em>131 Vt. 504 (1973), relying on <em>Nurmi </em>v. <em>Vermont Employment Security Bd.., </em>124 Vt. 42, 47-48 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Numerous courts, certainly the majority that have dealt with the question in recent years, have concluded that the refusal to seek or accept work at certain times because of family responsibilities may constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d to decline suitable employment and does not necessarily make the employee unavailable for work. See <em>Arndt </em>v. <em>State, </em>583 P.2d 799, 802-803 (Alaska 1978); <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., </em>20 Cal.3d 55, 69-70 (1977); <em>Yordamlis </em>v. <em>Florida Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>158 So.2d 791 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1963); <em>Tung-Sol Elec. Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Review, </em>35 N.J. Super. 397, 401-402 (1955); <em>In re Watson, </em>273 N.C. 629, 635 (1968); <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Department of Employment Security, </em>R.I. , - (1979) (397 A.2d 902, 905-906 [R.I. 1979]). See also <em>Trexler v. Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>27 Pa. Commw. Ct. 180, 183-188 (1976), which has a statutory basis for the definition of \u201cgood cause\u201d adopted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Although \u201cgood cause\u201d in \u00a7 25 (c) has not been interpreted in Massachusetts, the words \u201cgood cause\u201d appear elsewhere in c. 151A and may, in those contexts, include personal reasons of the employee. Section 25 (e) provides, in part, that benefits are to be denied in certain circumstances if the employee \u201chas left his work (1) voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employing unit.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e), </em>as appearing in St. 1975, c. 684, \u00a7 78. In this form, good cause must relate to the employer and thus personal reasons for leaving employment cannot constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d For a period from 1958 (see St. 1958, c. 677) to 1969 (see St. 1969, c. 614, \u00a7 2), \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>denied benefits to one who left work \u201cvoluntarily without good cause.\u201d During this period \u201cgood cause\u201d was not limited to \u201cgood cause attributable to the employing unit,\u201d and certain personal reasons for quitting work could constitute good cause. See <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>346 Mass. 733, 735-736 (1964); <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>344 Mass. 369, 373-374 (1962). For other provisions in G. L. c. 151A, referring to \u201cgood cause,\u201d which in the context may include personal reasons, see \u00a7\u00a725 <em>(a), </em>39 (\u00a3&gt;).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">We see no reason not to give the words \u201cgood cause\u201d their usual meaning and thus to recognize that, in certain circumstances, \u201cgood cause\u201d may include personal reasons. In doing so, we follow the recent trend in those other jurisdictions, discussed earlier, that have dealt with the same general issue. Moreover, this conclusion recognizes that, when the Legislature intended to limit \u201cgood cause\u201d to matters relating to the employment, it did so by explicit, additional language. See <em>In re Watson, </em>273 N.C. 629, 635 (1968); <em>Trexler v. Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>27 Pa. Commw. Ct. 180, 187-188 (1976). Although this court has not been confronted previously with a case involving a question of \u201cgood cause\u201d under \u00a7 25 (c), we have noted an employee\u2019s right to refuse suitable employment if he has good cause to do so. See <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>324 Mass. 45, 49 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>It is apparent from what we have said that the board erred in concluding that \u201cthe person claiming benefits must be willing and able to work full time on any shift normally operated in the occupation for which she is suited by training and experience.\u201d The ruling that, as a matter of law, Conlon was unavailable for work cannot stand. The question whether Conlon so limited her employability as in fact to make herself unavailable for work is a question for the board to consider on the record on remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Although we reject the board\u2019s conclusion, we do not accept the judge\u2019s implied conclusion that, as a matter of law, work at other than times acceptable to Conlon was not \u201csuitable employment.\u201d This is a factual question in the first instance on which the board should act and as to which, in reviewing an administrative decision, a judge may not make findings of fact. See <em>Pacific Mills </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>322 Mass. 345, 350 (1948). Identical work at a time not acceptable to Conlon could well be suitable employment, although \u00a7 25 <em>(c) </em>requires \u201cconsideration whether the employment is detrimental to the health, safety or morals of an employee.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>judge was correct in recognizing that \u00a7 25 (c) bears on the question whether domestic responsibilities may justify a refusal to seek or to accept work at certain times of day. But it is the language in \u00a7 25 <em>(c) </em>concerning \u201cgood cause\u201d rather than \u201csuitable employment\u201d which must be addressed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On remand, the board should first consider whether Conlon was \u201cwithout good cause\u201d in declining to seek or accept employment at any other time of the day than she did. If she did not have good cause for so limiting her availability, benefits were rightly denied. Finally, if Conlon did have good cause to decline suitable employment, the board must consider whether she still was available for work within the meaning of \u00a7 24 <em>(b). </em>If she limited her availability so that she effectively removed herself from the labor force, benefits must be denied even if she had a valid personal reason for doing so. <em>Keough </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>370 Mass. 1, 4 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The judgment is reversed.

(b) Be capable of and available for work and unable to obtain work in his usual occupation or any other occupation for which he is reasonably fitted.\u201d General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (c), as appearing in St. 1976, c. 473, \u00a7 19, provides further in pertinent part that: \u201cNo waiting period shall be allowed and no benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter for \u2014 (c) Any week in which an otherwise eligible individual fails, without good cause, to apply for suitable employment whenever notified so to do by the employment of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>fice, or to accept suitable employment whenever offered to him . . . .\u201d We have said that \u00a7 25 explains, amplifies, and qualifies \u00a7 24, <em>Pacific Mills </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>322 Mass. 345, 351 (1948), and that if the work offered is not suitable under \u00a7 25, it must be deemed not to be work for which the employee is reasonably fitted under \u00a7 24. <em>Id. </em>It is clear from reading these two sections together that in order to be eligible for benefits an individual need only be available for suitable employment which he has no good cause to refuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-5\"> For cases in which a finding of \u201cunavailability\u201d was warranted, see, e.g., <em>Keough </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>370 Mass. 1, 4 (1976) (employee\u2019s availability to work only within walking distance of her home or where a ride was available \u201cso restricted her employability as to remove herself from the labor force\u201d); <em>Screnci v.
