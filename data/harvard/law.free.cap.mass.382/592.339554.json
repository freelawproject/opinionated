In November, 1975, the registrar revoked the license of Douglas Kirk for four years because he found Kirk to be an habitual traffic offender under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22F. Kirk appealed the revocation of his license to the board under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>1976, the board ordered Kirk\u2019s license restored for daytime operation. The registrar restored Kirk\u2019s partial right to operate shortly after the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, <em>\u00a7 </em>14, the registrar sought review of the board\u2019s decision in the Superior Court. The judge affirmed the board\u2019s decision to modify the registrar\u2019s revocation order. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 22F, as amended through St. 1977, c. 560, provides that \u201c[a] person shall be deemed an habitual traffic offender when records maintained by the registrar show that such person has accumulated\u201d three convictions of any of a series of motor vehicle offenses which are enumerated in \u00a7 22F. The statute is applicable as long as the convictions have occurred within a five-year period. \u201cWhen the records of the registrar on any person contain reports of such convictions as will constitute such person an habitual traffic offender\u201d the registrar shall hold a show cause hearing as to why such person should not be designated an habitual traffic offender. The statute provides a procedure whereby the registrar can refer to the court by which the conviction was reported any claim by the licensee that the convictions attributable to him in the registrar\u2019s records did not occur, and the court can conduct a hearing as to the existence of the conviction. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22F.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Section 22F further provides that if the registrar finds that the licensee is not the same person named in the records of conviction or that he is otherwise not an habitual traffic offender under \u00a7 22F, no action shall be taken; but if the registrar finds that the licensee is the same person named in the record of conviction and is an habitual offender, the registrar shall immediately revoke his license and shall not rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>state it for four years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One year after revocation the licensee may petition the registrar for reinstatement on hardship grounds and the registrar may reinstate the license on such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate and necessary. Finally, the statute provides that a licensee may appeal any order of the registrar under \u00a7 22F to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The registrar argues that because \u00a7 22F requires mandatory revocation of the license of an individual deemed to be an habitual traffic offender, the board has only a limited power of review over that revocation. This argument has been answered by our decision today in <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, ante </em>580 (1981). There we held that, upon appeal, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28, allows the board in its discretion to affirm, modify or annul any actions taken by the registrar pursuant to the mandatory revocation provisions of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2). We hold that the same principle applies to mandatory revocations under \u00a7 22F.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The registrar further argues that the \u201chabitual offender\u201d statute, enacted in 1971, subsequent to the most recent amendment to the appeals statute, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28, as appearing in St. 1950, c. 536, evidences a legislative intent that the board may not modify license revocations mandated by \u00a7 22F unless the registrar was factually or legally incorrect in his application of the statute. The argument assumes that the later enacted statute impliedly narrows the power of review granted to the board in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28. We observe that the assumption is inconsistent with the language of the \u201chabitual offender\u201d statute as enacted. Statute 1971, c. 1033, which enacted G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22F, provided further in \u00a7 3 thereof: \u201cNothing in this act shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>construed as amending, modifying or repealing any existing law of the commonwealth or any existing ordinance of any political subdivision thereof relating to the operation of motor vehicles, the licensing of persons to operate motor vehicles or providing penalties for the violation thereof; nor shall it be construed so as to preclude the exercise of the regulatory power of any division, agency, department or political subdivision of the commonwealth having the statutory authority to regulate such operation and licensing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In this case, as in <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>the registrar raised before us two issues not raised in the Superi- or Court. Therefore our disposition is the same as in that case, and we remand the case to the Superior Court with instructions to enter a new judgment affirming the decision of the board twenty (20) days after this remand, unless within said twenty days the registrar moves in the Superior Court to reopen the case and have the board file a statement of reasons and a further record. The further record should be sufficient to allow the court to determine whether the board\u2019s decision meets the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). Should the case be reopened, Kirk shall have the right to intervene. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-16\"> The registrar had previously revoked Kirk\u2019s license because, on the basis of Kirk\u2019s convictions for motor vehicle offenses enumerated in G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>c. 90, \u00a7 22F, he deemed Kirk to be an habitual traffic offender. Upon Kirk\u2019s appeal to the board, the board ordered Kirk\u2019s license restored, stating that the length of time between the last conviction and the revocation \u2014 one and a half years \u2014 was too long. Kirk was subsequently convicted of additional motor vehicle offenses, giving rise to the revocation at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\"> In addition, the licensee, prior to reinstatement, must complete a driver training course and pass an examination. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22F.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> In the instant case, the licensee chose to appeal to the board under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 28. The registrar does not argue that an appeal directly to the Superior Court under \u00a7 22F is the exclusive method of review of the registrar\u2019s action and concedes for purposes of this appeal that an appeal can be taken either to the Superior Court or the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
