The primary issue raised is whether the proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>dure set forth in G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, for the issuance of a criminal complaint applies to complaints issued by the Housing Court. We conclude that the statutory procedure does apply. Absent the exigent circumstances described in G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, therefore, the person accused in a complaint received by the Housing Court must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the issuance of any process based on the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The complainant Charlotte Gordon is a tenant in a residential apartment in Boston. On October 30, 1979, she brought a criminal complaint on behalf of the Commonwealth against the defendants in the Housing Court of the City of Boston. The complaint alleges that from September 15, 1979, through October 30, 1979, the defendants wilfully or intentionally interfered with the complainant\u2019s quiet enjoyment by failing to comply with G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, based on the failure to provide heat and the presence of cockroaches in the apartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Process issued immediately, requiring the defendants to appear in court to answer the complaint. At no time prior to the issuance of process were the defendants notified of the complaint or afforded an opportunity to appear at a hearing in opposition to the issuance of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Following an unsuccessful attempt at mediation, the case was scheduled for trial on November 9,1979. On that date, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to afford them the hearing required by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A. Although initially disposed to deny the motion to dismiss, the trial judge concluded instead that \u201ca question of law has arisen which ... is so important as to require the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court thereon before trial,\u201d and hence reported certain questions to this court pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A. The text of the reported questions is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of recent changes in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>interlocutory report procedure, discussed immediately below, the questions were reported first to the Appeals Court and later transferred to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">1. <em>Jurisdictional issue. </em>Although this threshold issue has not been addressed by either party, we should decide initially whether the reported questions are properly before this court. The Housing Court judge characterized the interlocutory report as pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 30A, was repealed, however, by St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 51, effective July 1, 1979. The reporting of questions of law in criminal cases is now governed by Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979), which, like its predecessor, does not specifically authorize reports by the Housing Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In earlier cases involving questions re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ported by the Housing Court under since-repealed c. 278, \u00a7\u00a730 and 30A, we have allowed the reports, based on our belief that by conferring on the Housing Court concurrent jurisdiction over certain actions and by according the Housing Court \u201call the powers of the superior court\u201d over those actions, see G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3, the Legislature had \u201csufficiently indicated its intention that appellate review of decisions of the Housing Court [was] to be had directly by this court, and that the judge of the Housing Court [was] to exercise the powers of a Superior Court judge to that end.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>369 Mass. 62, 65-66 (1975), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>364 Mass. 795, 797 (1974). For these same reasons, we believe Mass. R. Crim. P. 34 also applies to the Housing Court. Accordingly, we hold that judges of the Housing Court may report important or doubtful questions of law to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">2. <em>Questions 1,1 A, and IB: Commencement of criminal proceedings in the Housing Court. </em>The first three reported questions (questions 1,1A, and IB)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concern the commencement of criminal proceedings in the Housing Court and the extent to which the Housing Court must conform its procedure in criminal cases to that of the District Court. With a view to answering the questions reported, we begin by setting forth the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The Housing Court of the City of Boston has jurisdiction, concurrent with the District Courts and the Superior Court, of certain crimes, including crimes arising under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, and under so much of any other law or regulation \u201cas is concerned directly or indirectly with the health, safety, or welfare of any occupant of any place ... of human habitation.\u201d G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1979, c. 72, \u00a7 3. Criminal proceedings are commenced \u201cby complaint in like manner as in the district court department.\u201d G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>The procedure for the commencement of criminal complaints for misdemeanors in the District Court is governed by G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That statute requires the court, absent certain exigent circumstances, to give to the person against whom a complaint is made written notice of the complaint. The exigent circumstances that remove the need for written notice are those involving \u201can imminent threat of bodily injury, of the commission of a crime or of flight from the commonwealth\u201d by the accused person. The accused person must also be given \u201can opportunity to be heard ... in opposition to the issuance of any process based on such complaint.\u201d Neither notice nor a hearing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>required if the accused person is already under arrest for the offense on which the complaint is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We have been offered no good reason why the \u201cin like manner\u201d language of c. 185C, \u00a7 19, should be construed to mean anything other than the plain import of the term: i.e., that the Housing Court, in commencing a criminal proceeding, should follow essentially the same procedure as that outlined for the District Courts in G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A. From the history of G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, it is apparent that the Legislature intended, in most cases involving misdemeanors, for defendants to be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before process issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such a system seems particularly appropriate for cases in the Housing Court involving allegations of unsafe or unhealthy living conditions, because \u201c[t]he primary purpose of the [sanitary] code is to prevent violations rather than to punish past violations as criminal offences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>364 Mass. 795, 799 (1974). Many criminal cases filed in the Housing Court result in dismissals following the defendant\u2019s elimination of the violations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Snyder, Crime and Community Mediation \u2014 The Boston Experience: A Preliminary Report on the Dorchester Urban Court Program, 1978 Wis. L. Rev. 737, 746-747 (noting that \u201c[t]he implicit purpose of the 35A hearings is to enable the court clerk to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>screen a variety of minor criminal or potentially criminal matters out of the criminal justice system through a combination of counseling, discussion, or threat of prosecution . . .\u201d). Informal dispute settlement processes available to the parties, such as referral to a housing specialist for mediation (as was done in this case after process had issued), are likely to be more successful if entered into before the issuance of a summons against the defendant. See <em>Dulin </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>Cr. No. 29466 (Boston Division of the Housing Court Dept., October 19, 1979). A further reason to hold c. 218, \u00a7 35A, applicable to the Housing Court stems from our recognition of the risk of abuse of statutory provisions allowing tenants and other private citizens to bring criminal complaints against landlords. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddad, supra. </em>In <em>Haddad, </em>we observed that \u201c[t]he danger of harassment is mitigated by [the \u00a7 35A requirement] that the person against whom a complaint is made may oppose the issuance of process based on the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">We conclude, therefore, that G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, as amended, is applicable to the Housing Court. The Housing Court need not \u201cexactly duplicate\u201d the procedure followed in the District Court, however, and hence we answer reported question 1 with a qualified \u201cYes.\u201d An example of permissible deviation from District Court procedure, offered by the Commonwealth in its brief, is that a complainant in the Housing Court swears out a complaint, while the District Court requires an application for a complaint to issue. See also G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 7 (mandating that the administrative justice of the Housing Court \u201cshall from time to time make general rules and forms of procedure,\u201d to be approved by this court). Any such minor differences in the complaint procedure between the Housing Court and the District Court are allowable. Such minor differences aside, the Housing Court must adhere to the notice and hearing procedure set forth in G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, and thus we answer \u201cYes\u201d to reported question 1A, and \u201cNo\u201d to reported question IB.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>3. <em>Questions 2, 3, 3A, and 3B: Continuing violations of the State Sanitary Code. </em>The remaining questions (questions 2, 3, 3A and 3B)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> all concern the notice and hearing requirements when complaints allege continuing violations of the State Sanitary Code. The Commonwealth concedes that the Housing Court is required to follow c. 218, \u00a7 35A, as a general rule, but asserts that when a complaint alleges a continuing violation of the State Sanitary Code, such as the failure to provide heat in the present case, there is no requirement for notice and a hearing. To support this assertion, the Commonwealth offers three arguments. First, the Commonwealth contends that to afford a hearing when continuing code violations are alleged would undercut the policy of providing expeditious relief and \u201cprejudice\u201d the complainant because of the possible delay in securing relief. The extent to which delay occurs as a result of \u00a7 35A hearings, however, is not apparent. Undoubtedly any hardships suffered from the statutory procedure may be ameliorated by granting priority to such cases in the Housing Court. Beyond that, efforts at changing the procedure should be addressed to the Legislature.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7\">Two additional arguments against requiring a preliminary hearing in this and similar cases involve interpretation of the exceptions clause of \u00a7 35A. The Commonwealth contends that this case falls within two of the three listed exceptions: there exists (1) \u201can imminent threat of bodily injury\u201d and (2) \u201can imminent threat... of the commission of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">We consider the latter exception first. The Commonwealth contends that the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to provide heat for a six-week period violated G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, providing criminal penalties for a breach of the tenant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>right to quiet enjoyment of his property. The Commonwealth then argues that because the date on which the heat was provided is not clear, the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted an imminent threat of a commission of a crime. This argument is nothing more than an attempt to bootstrap the violation alleged in the complaint into the \u201ccommission of a crime\u201d exception. Adoption of such circuitous reasoning would virtually nullify the hearing requirement whenever State Sanitary Code violations are alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Similarly untenable is the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the failure to supply heat constitutes \u201can imminent threat of bodily injury.\u201d Although both the failure to supply heat of at least 64\u00b0 and the failure to maintain the premises free of cockroaches are deemed State Sanitary Code violations that \u201cmay endanger or impair the [occupant\u2019s] health or safety, and well-being,\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.750 (F), (O), they are not conditions that, as a matter of law, so threaten bodily injury as to come within the c. 218, \u00a7 35A, exception. The three \u00a7 35A exceptions (bodily injury, commission of a crime, and flight from the jurisdiction) are aimed at preventing various forms of retaliation by the defendant upon his receipt of notice; their purpose is to avert intentional acts of criminality by the accused person <em>in addition </em>to the acts which form the basis of the complaint against him. Any other conclusion presumes the existence of a criminal violation by the defendant and hence presumes the very fact that the criminal process, including the preliminary hearing, is designed to ascertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We conclude, therefore, that G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, as amended, applies to the Housing Court, regardless of whether a continuing State Sanitary Code violation is alleged. A defendant who fits within the terms of \u00a7 35A must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard even if he is accused of continuing code violations, and thus we answer \u201cYes\u201d to reported question 2. We conclude further that the complaint received by the Housing Court in the case at bar does not, on its face, fall within any exception to the notice and hearing requirements of G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A. We thus answer \u201cNo\u201d to reported questions 3, 3A, and 3B.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>4. In summary, with the qualifications elaborated above, we answer questions 1 and 1A, \u201cYes\u201d and question IB, \u201cNo\u201d; question 2, \u201cYes\u201d; and questions 3, 3A and 3B, \u201cNo.\u201d The case is remanded to the Housing Court of the City of Boston for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> If true, the factual allegations would constitute a breach of the State Sanitary Code adopted pursuant to G.
