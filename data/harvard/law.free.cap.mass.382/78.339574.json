Swift stands convicted of murder in the second degree, by virtue of his plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>of guilty. Swift now seeks to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that it was involuntary because he was not informed that malice aforethought is an element of the offense to which he pleaded. See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403 (1980); <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 104 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338 (1978), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 1120 (1979). See also <em>McGuirk </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>622 F.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Swift was indicted for murder in the first degree in 1969. On July 13,1970, Swift\u2019s guilty plea to murder in the second degree was accepted, and he was sentenced to a life term at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole. On January 29, 1979, the defendant moved for a new trial, which motion was denied after an evidentiary hearing on the issue of voluntariness. The defendant appealed under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. We affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We summarize the facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the hearing on. Swift\u2019s plea, a police officer who had investigated the homicide testified that early on the morning of September 11, 1969, he was called to 57 Warren Avenue, Boston, where he found the body of a man later identified as Leslie Weiland lying face down in the rear alley. Traces of blood led the officers to the door of the cellar apartment at 57 Warren Avenue. More blood was found inside the apartment, and two window weights with blood on them were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The apartment was rented by the defendant and one Sussann Sennett. Sennett was arrested that evening, and the defendant later that same night. Upon arrest, Swift said, \u201cThank God you got me.\u201d On the way to the police vehicle, he stated, \u201cI did not mean to do it,\u201d and, later, \u201cI didn\u2019t pick up the fag. He picked me up.\u201d While being booked at the police station, the defendant saw Sennett and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>said, \u201cWhat have you got her for? She didn\u2019t do anything. I killed the fag.\u201d A man\u2019s gold onyx ring was found in Swift\u2019s boot, and traces of blood were found on his clothing. A copy of the death certificate was produced certifying that death was caused by multiple blows to the head with massive hemorrhage.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Following the officer\u2019s testimony, the judge interrogated the defendant and established that he had the equivalent of a high school level education, had no problem speaking or understanding English, and had no history of mental illness. The defendant answered affirmatively when the judge asked if he knew he was charged with first degree murder and was pleading guilty to murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The judge further interrogated the defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and informed him of the compulsory life sentence that would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>imposed if the plea were accepted, and asked if the defendant was aware that he was waiving his right to a jury trial by pleading guilty. Upon receiving an affirmative answer, the judge asked, \u201cDo you understand that by pleading guilty you admit the facts as they have been stated to you?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYes, I do, sir,\u201d and gave the same answer when asked, \u201cDo you plead guilty willingly, freely and voluntarily?\u201d The judge again informed Swift of the compulsory life sentence and the fact that Swift would not be eligible for parole for fifteen years. The judge then established that no one was forcing Swift to enter the plea and that he had not been induced by threats or promises. The judge accepted the plea, and the defendant was sentenced. A hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea was held before a judge of the Superior Court on November 1, 1979. The defendant at this time was represented by different counsel, who presented as evidence only the transcript of the plea proceeding. The challenge to the voluntariness of the plea was based solely on the record. The Commonwealth then called prior defense counsel as a witness and he was permitted to testify that he explained all the elements of second degree murder to the defendant. He said that the defendant understood the discussions and asked intelligent questions, and that they discussed evidence against Swift that made the guilty plea a reasonable course of action. When asked whether he specifically told the defendant that malice was one of the elements of murder in the second degree, defense counsel replied, \u201cYes. I used the term \u2018malice,\u2019 and I equated it with the facts when I said, \u2018You intended to do him harm.\u2019\u201d Defense counsel then said that he believed the defendant understood this point.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab3\">The judge questioned the witness as to whether he had discussed the issue of manslaughter with the defendant. The answer was \u201cyes\u201d; that he had discussed why he believed that murder in the first degree could be proved; why murder in the second degree could be proved with no difficulty; and why, in his opinion, the evidence made manslaughter \u201cout oil the question.\u201d When asked if he explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>exactly what manslaughter was, the attorney answered, \u201cnot any more than outlining the area of negligence or accidents or unintentional homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Swift also took the stand and testified that he did not remember the actual crime; that he had been told he must admit to the facts as they were related to him at the plea hearing in order to have his plea accepted; and that, at the time of the plea, he thought second degree murder was similar to manslaughter and did not know that the distinguishing element between the two offenses was malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The judge ruled that the Commonwealth had met its burden of proof and had shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s plea was made \u201cvoluntarily, intelligently and with knowledge of its consequences and with an understanding of the nature of the charge.\u201d His ruling was based on two grounds. First, he found that the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea proceeding, considered alone, indicated that the defendant was informed of the element of malice aforethought, and also showed that the defendant had admitted to facts constituting the element of malice aforethought. Second, the testimony of the defendant\u2019s former attorney was sufficient representation that counsel had explained to the defendant the elements admitted by the plea. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338, 343-344 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The motion judge found, as a fact, that \u201c[t]he transcript of the plea hearing indicates that the defendant understood the meaning of the indictment and the substance of the charge against him.\u201d On appeal, the defendant challenges this finding under <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637 (1976), alleging that he did not receive adequate notice of the offense to which he pleaded guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>claims that \u201cthe contemporaneous and supplemental records fail to affirmatively demonstrate that he received notice that \u2018malice aforethought\u2019 was a necessary element of second degree murder,\u201d or that malice distinguished second degree murder from manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We agree with the judge that the record of the plea proceedings supports a finding that the defendant understood the substance of the charge against him and . that he had \u201creal notice\u201d of the offense as required by <em>Henderson </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, supra; McGuirk </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>622 F.2d 597, 598 (1980), because he admitted to facts constituting the unexplained elements of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Malice aforethought, the element on which Swift focuses his attack, encompasses any intent to inflict injury without legal excuse or palliation; actual intent to kill is not necessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>356 Mass. 442, 444-445 (1969), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bedrosian, </em>247 Mass. 573, 576 (1929). In Massachusetts, intent to inflict injury is sufficient to permit a factfinder to infer malice aforethought because \u201cit is possible to commit murder without any actual intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm\u201d for \u201cmalice in murder means knowledge of such circumstances that according to common experience there is a plain and strong likelihood that death will follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>174 Mass. 245, 252 (1899). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 171-172 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>373 Mass. 11, 18 (1977). Cf. <em>Henderson, </em>where, under New York law at the time Henderson was convicted, <em>intent to kill </em>was a necessary statutory element of murder in the second degree. The judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s admissions that he caused the victim\u2019s death by inflicting \u201cmultiple blows to the head\u201d and by \u201cbeating him over the head with window weights\u201d were sufficient to show that Swift had the necessary intent to inflict injury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403, 408, 410 (1980); <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 104, 108 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 442 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, supra </em>at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Moreover, Swift listened to the facts of the crime as described by the investigating officer and as summarized by the judge and answered affirmatively when asked if he admitted the facts as they had been stated to him. \u201cAn affirmative response to the facts as stated by another, if those facts include the necessary elements of the crime to which the defendant ultimately pleads guilty, is sufficient to satisfy the <em>Henderson </em>rationale.\u201d <em>Soffen, supra </em>at 442. The record adequately supports the judge\u2019s conclusion that Swift\u2019s plea was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">At the motion hearing the defendant objected to the introduction of new evidence by the Commonwealth. He relied on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100 (1975), which he interpreted as compelling the judge to decide the voluntariness issue solely on the basis of the record of the plea proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion judge acted properly in admitting the testimony of Swift\u2019s prior counsel. The judge interpreted <em>Foster, supra, </em>as allowing the State to introduce evidence when the record made at the time of acceptance of the plea indicates that the plea was voluntary, but the defendant later asserts that it was made involuntarily for reasons outside the record. The motion judge read <em>Foster </em>as holding that where the contemporaneous record shows no effort by the judge to ensure the voluntariness of a plea, that inadequacy in the record cannot be cured by retroactive reconstruction of the record. We agree. In <em>Foster </em>we clearly stated that where \u201cthe contemporaneous record is sufficient on its face, but the defendant claims that his plea was nevertheless involuntary or unknowing for reasons not appearing of record, not only may the defendant introduce relevant evidence, but the Commonwealth may respond with evidence to the contrary from outside the original record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">After hearing from Swift and his prior counsel, the judge found credible counsel\u2019s testimony that \u201che discussed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the defendant the elements of the various degrees of murder, including the lesser contained crime of manslaughter; that he used the term \u2018malice\u2019 when he discussed the elements in order to distinguish the different degrees of homicide; and that he discussed a possible mitigation of the charge of first degree murder, based on intoxication or insanity.\u201d The judge also credited counsel\u2019s testimony that the defendant understood the explanation. These findings make this case quite different from <em>Henderson, </em>which the Supreme Court characterized as \u201cunique because the trial judge found as a fact that the element of intent was not explained to respondent.\u201d <em>Henderson, supra </em>at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The defendant asserts that counsel\u2019s failure to discuss the elements of voluntary manslaughter with him renders his plea of guilty to second degree murder involuntary. The judge found that the defendant was informed of all elements of second degree murder, the offense to which he was pleading.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since Swift was informed as to all the essential elements of murder in the second degree, his plea was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The order denying Swift\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and for a new trial, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\"> The record consists of the transcripts of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, and motion for new trial, and comprehensive findings by the judge on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The motion judge was not the judge who accepted the plea originally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> The following questions and answers appear in the transcript:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The judge: \u201cHave you heard the testimony of the officers?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I have, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The judge: \u201cAnd that in essence you are accused with killing one Leslie Weiland, by beating him over the head with window weights, dragging his body out of your apartment at 57 Warren Avenue, Boston, on September 11, 1969.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I am, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">The judge: \u201cAnd leaving the body in the alley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">The defendant: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The judge: \u201cDid you in fact commit the acts as I have stated them?\u201d The defendant: \u201cYes, I have, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">The judge: \u201cDo you wish to plead guilty to the offense of murder in the second degree?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I do, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">Later, the judge asked the defendant Swift about his discussions with his attorney:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">The judge: \u201cHave you discussed this matter fully with your attorney</p>\n<p id=\"ALc\">The defendant: \u201cI have, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">The judge: \u201cAnd are you confused in any way by the questions I have asked you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">The defendant: \u201cNo, I am not, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">The judge: \u201cAre you fully satisfied that [your attorney] has fairly represented you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I am, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-23\">The judge: \u201cAnd that he has acted in your best interests?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-24\">The defendant: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-25\">The judge: \u201cI accept the plea.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> The Commonwealth argues that the <em>Henderson </em>policies should not apply in this case because the challenged guilty plea was entered six years before the <em>Henderson </em>decision. The trial judge declined to reach this issue because he found that there was ample evidence that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary. Since we also conclude that the record reflects tiie fact that Swift\u2019s plea was voluntary, we do not reach the issue of the retroactivity of <em>Henderson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> On appeal, the defendant has waived all objections to the evidence introduced at the motion hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\"> Defense counsel briefly discussed involuntary manslaughter with the defendant. Nothing in the record of the plea proceedings indicates that voluntary manslaughter was a realistic possibility or that counsel\u2019s assessment of the evidence amounted to ineffective assistance. Counsel is expected to \u201cexplain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.\u201d <em>Henderson, supra </em>at 647. Unlike the facts in <em>Henderson, </em>here counsel did just that.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
