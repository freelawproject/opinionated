The trial judge denied the motion in July, 1977, and dismissed the appeal in December, 1977, for failure to file an assignment of errors (see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33F, repealed by St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 3). The defendant, however, acting'pro se, in January, 1978-, filed a second motion for a new trial. Appointed counsel improved the motion by amendment. It was denied by the trial judge in November, 1979, with memorandum dated in April, 1980. This denial is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The motion contended that the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges in jury selection was racially biased, and also attacked several parts of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury: his instructions on the jury\u2019s role in determining the degree of murder, on premeditated murder, on reasonable doubt, and on the burden of proof (in general, and as to \u201cduress\u201d). After describing the facts, we consider these points, and conclude by affirming the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">1. <em>Narrative. </em>We state briefly the core facts. The defendant and one Ronald Ellis<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> approached the Peking House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>restaurant in the Roxbury section of Boston about 12:45 a.m., December 16, 1975, and asked Shung Li, who was locking the front door, for an order of rice.. Shung Li allowed the men to enter and walked with them to the rear kitchen area of the restaurant where Yip Ming, Yung Kam Tai, and Sheung Lee were cleaning up. Ellis drew a sawed-off shotgun from under his jacket and ordered the four employees to get down on the floor. He told the defendant to search for money. Although Sheung Lee quickly rendered Ellis\u2019s order to the employees into Chinese, Shung Li, who had little English, may have remained standing. Ellis fired his shotgun, wounding Shung Li in the chest. Ellis and the defendant left the restaurant with some $300 the defendant had found in a kitchen cabinet drawer. Shung Li died of the wound next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s testimony about the events of the evening in which he sought to picture himself as acting under supervening pressure from Ellis. The defendant said he met Ellis for the first time at a \u201cshooting gallery\u201d in Roxbury between 8 and 9 p.m., December 15. Ellis had taken cocaine or heroin; the defendant took heroin. While waiting for the shots to take effect, Ellis spoke of an encounter with an acquaintance at a bar earlier that evening which had ended with the man pulling a pistol on him. He solicited the defendant\u2019s help in fetching his own gun and going back to the bar to confront the man. The defendant undertook to drive Ellis to Ellis\u2019s house in Dorchester and they drove off in the defendant\u2019s automobile, a green Buick borrowed, as it happened, from the defendant\u2019s girl friend Janice Bacon.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Arriving at Ellis\u2019s house, the defendant waited in the car while Ellis went in and then emerged with a green Army duffel bag containing, as the defendant assumed, a gun (in fact a sawed-off shotgun). The defendant drove to the indicated bar near the Dudley subway station in the Roxbury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>section of Boston and again waited as Ellis entered and returned, saying that the man was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The defendant and Ellis drove about for two hours talking and drinking wine. Ellis spoke of \u201ctaking off some joint\u201d but the defendant, so he testified, disclaimed any interest in such a venture. Finally they returned to Roxbury. Coming out of a bar where they had used the rest room, Ellis proposed robbing a Merit gas station across the street. The defendant declined to take part, and drove off alone. But as the defendant waited a red light at a near corner, Ellis reentered the car taking the front passenger seat. At that point Ellis\u2019s shotgun discharged into the adjacent door. The blast, said the defendant, \u201cpanicked\u201d him. Ellis said it was an accident, but the defendant testified he \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand\u201d how that could be.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The defendant asked Ellis where he wanted to be left off and Ellis directed him, but en route Ellis ordered the defendant to stop by the Peking House restaurant so they could rob it. The defendant said he didn\u2019t want to do it and pointed out some hazards in the robbery as a means of discouraging Ellis. But ultimately he did as Ellis wished because he was \u201cafraid\u201d of Ellis and his shotgun and \u201ccouldn\u2019t see anything else to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">As to his conduct while in the restaurant, the defendant testified that he alternated between acting as lookout from a position in the doorway between the kitchen and the front serving area, and responding to Ellis\u2019s command to search for money by rummaging in a kitchen cabinet. At one point he blocked Ellis from pushing one of the employees into the serving area; he explained that he feared the police would see the robbery in progress and shoot him as they entered. He said he tried to persuade Ellis to leave the restaurant, but Ellis merely directed him to look for more money. Regarding the shooting of Shung Li, the defendant testified he was on lookout when he heard the shot. He ran to the store front to see if anything stirred, and returned to the kitchen area. He did not notice that Shung Li had been wounded. On Ellis\u2019s order he resumed looking for money in the kitchen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>cabinet. Some minutes later, when Sheung Lee reached across him for the phone to call a doctor, he turned and saw Shung Li bleeding on the floor. He and Ellis then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">There was possible confirmation of part of the defendant\u2019s story in the testimony of Janice Bacon, called by the defense. She said she found a hole in the front passenger door of her Buick automobile that was not there, she thought, when she lent the car to the defendant on December 15. But she said she first observed the hole sometime in January. James E. Higgins, a Boston police ballistician, called by the prosecution, testified that the hole in the door was consistent with a blast from a shotgun, but that it could also have been made by ramming an iron rod through the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Without getting into the detail of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, we say a word about its evidence bearing on the claim of duress. Ellis was not called. The defendant\u2019s taped statement, given to Detective Peter O\u2019Malley on January 8, 1976, was played to the jury. Here the defendant indicates that the robbery was Ellis\u2019s idea, but there is not more than a hint of duress. On the tape the defendant says that he and Ellis were broke that night and were driving about looking for a \u201cplace to hit.\u201d The tape has nothing about a shotgun blast in the car. (In testimony the defendant said he was \u201cconfused\u201d the day he talked to Detective O\u2019Malley, and O\u2019Malley had cut off his statement at various points. Neither claim is evident from hearing the tape. It appears to run continuously during the defendant\u2019s statement.) On the tape the defendant says that after stopping the car two doors down from the restaurant in front of a smoke shop, he moved the car some distance to avoid bright illumination of the license plate by the shop\u2019s neon lights. (In testimony the defendant explained the move as intended to allow the customers to leave the restaurant and the door to be closed so that the robbery would be thwarted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Donna Horner, a prosecution witness, said the defendant told her that he and another fellow had robbed a Chinese restaurant; that as they were leaving the place he told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>other guy to \u201c[sjhoot the motherf-----\u201d and to his surprise the fellow did shoot. He also told her that he carried a pistol during the episode, and the other fellow a shotgun. The defendant\u2019s avowal to Horner came on January 2, 1976; she said they were in bed together, the defendant (but not Horner) having taken heroin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (It may be noted that the restaurant employees did not observe a weapon in the defendant\u2019s hands.)</p>\n<p id=\"A7l\">After the robbery, the defendant accompanied Ellis to Ellis\u2019s girl friend\u2019s place. As against testimony by the defendant suggesting that he continued in fear of Ellis, the girl friend, Diana Dozier, called by the Commonwealth in rebuttal, described the two as counting out and dividing the money and saying they could have gotten more, and mentioning an \u201caccidental\u201d shotgun burst in the car in what she took to be a friendly or joking manner. She said the defendant came by two days later asking for Ellis. He asked for Ellis again when she ran into him at Dudley station three days after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">With respect to chances of escape, the defendant said on the tape that he was alone in the car when he moved it down from the smoke shop. (He put Ellis still in the car in his testimony.) In testimony the defendant admitted that Ellis stopped to put on the defendant\u2019s coat before the two entered the restaurant (the shotgun could be concealed under the coat), but he claimed nevertheless that the shotgun never left Ellis\u2019s possession. He knew a bar across the street from the parked car which he \u201cimaginefdj\u201d would be open late, but he did not try to run to it. Just after Shung Li was shot he was alone at the store front, but did not try to leave because, he said, he was not sure the door would open.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-25\">2. <em>Peremptory challenges. </em>The defendant is black. He argues that the prosecution denied him rights under art. 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, as laid out in our opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 488, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), by using peremptory challenges to exclude \u201call persons of color\u201d from the jury that tried him. The jury were all white. Objection was taken the day after empanelment and made the basis of a motion to empanel a new jury, which the judge denied. As to the circumstances of jury selection, we have only the statement of the defense attorney as he recorded his objection: the prospective jurors examined included three blacks and one Puerto Rican; one of the blacks was excluded for cause, the other three were challenged peremptorily by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Soares </em>applies retroactively to defendants in cases \u201cpending on direct appeal [at the time of decision, March 8,1979] where the record is adequate to raise the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493 n. 38. But the appeal of the present defendant had been dismissed a year earlier, on December 1, 1977. In <em>Reddick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 398, 399 (1980), we reasserted the limit on retroactive application at least where, as here, racial tension appeared not to have been a factor at trial. The present record would be a poor candidate to command a reversal of the convictions under <em>Soares </em>in any event.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to <em>Soares </em>a presumption continues that peremptory challenges were properly used, which can be overcome on a showing sufficient to support the inference that the challenges were so exercised as to exclude individuals on the basis of their group affiliation. <em>Id. </em>at 490. Factors in the assessment include not only the numbers and percentage of group members excluded, but also common group membership of the defendant and the jurors excluded, and of the victim and the remaining jurors. <em>Id. </em>Compare the figures given above with those in <em>Soares: </em>twelve of thirteen blacks were excluded there. While the defendant here was black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>as were three of the four excluded jurors, the victim of the crime was Oriental and none of the final jury was such. We doubt that a trial judge on this showing would have had a basis for finding that the peremptory challenges were used improperly. We would sustain a finding that the presumption of proper use was not rebutted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>379 Mass. 297, 300-301 (1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">3. <em>Jury\u2019s role as to the degree of murder. </em>The trial judge instructed on two kinds of murder in the first degree, felony-murder and premeditated murder, and charged further that \u201c[mjurder which does not appear to be murder in the first degree is murder in the second degree.\u201d He omitted, however, to read the jury the last sentence of the murder statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1: \u201cThe degree of murder shall be found by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>372 Mass. 783 (1977), we held that it was proper for the judge in a case with facts like those at bar to submit the question of murder in the second degree to the jury, and to inform them of their authority under the statute to find the degree of murder. This was held correct even where arguably the facts would support only a finding of murder in the first degree, for the jury \u201cwithin their power to appraise evidence selectively, might have accepted as credible enough evidence to establish a conviction of murder in the second degree, but might have declined to accept such further evidence as tended to prove a case of murder in the first degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795-796 (footnote omitted). We went on to outline a proper charge on murder and the degree of murder which comprised a reading of the murder statute, including the last sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 797-798 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">In the present case counsel for the defendant excepted to the failure to charge on manslaughter, and on larceny in relation to the armed robbery charge (exceptions not argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>on this appeal). There was no objection or exception to the judge\u2019s omission to refer in terms to the jury\u2019s power to find murder in the second degree. We held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>375 Mass. 284, 290-292 (1978), that an inadequate instruction on murder in the second degree did not amount to reversible error when counsel failed to alert the judge by exception and when a finding of murder in the second degree would fail of support in the facts. <em>Hooks </em>foreshadows the result here. The defendant admitted participation in an armed robbery resulting in a homicide. His sole ground for possible acquittal was duress. Nothing in the facts looked to murder in the second degree. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rego, </em>360 Mass. 385, 396-397 (1971). We may reverse for error that raises \u201ca substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d in the absence of exception <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 [1967]), but we think there is no such risk here stemming from the failure to charge in full under the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AMZ\">4. <em>Instruction on premeditation. </em>Here is another claimed error not objected or excepted to. The contention now made is that the facts, while supporting a coventured felony-murder, would not support premeditated murder, and so giving a charge on premeditation was error.</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\">If the absence of exception is forgiven, there was still no error. Donna Horner\u2019s testimony, that the defendant confessed to her that he directed Ellis to shoot Shung Li, was sufficient to warrant an instruction on premeditation. We need not speculate whether the jury might take a view of the evidence, even apart from Horner, that could associate the defendant with Ellis\u2019s premeditated murder of Shung Li on a theory of joint enterprise or coventure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 308-309 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"AyD\">5. <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>The defendant contends for the first time that the charge on reasonable doubt (the essence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of which is set out in the margin<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>) was \u201cmomentary, fragmented and scanty.\u201d We think it was adequate. It stated that being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt means having a \u201cfull and abiding conviction of the guilt of the defendant\u201d after a \u201ccareful and candid and impartial consideration of all the evidence.\u201d This conformed to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850), which we cited recently as the best source for \u201cunimpeachable\u201d instructions on reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 130 n.12 (1977). The remark in the judge\u2019s instruction about \u201cdoubt based on reason\u201d is subject to the criticism made in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bjorkman, </em>364 Mass. 297, 308 (1973), and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>380 Mass. 596, 598-602 (1980), but in both cases we thought that lapse itself should not be held fatal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The same holds here when the charge is read as a whole. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 441 n.12 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 92 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">6. <em>Burden of proof in general, and as to duress. </em>The claim freshly made here, that the charge failed to place the general burden of proof clearly on the Commonwealth, is quite unsupported. At two points in the instructions the jury were told that the Commonwealth must prove beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>a reasonable doubt all essential elements of the crimes charged. This burden was further explained in connection with the presumption of innocence, and the point was also driven home by a contrast between the Commonwealth\u2019s burden in a criminal trial and the preponderance burden borne by a party in a civil matter. Although some isolated comments in the charge on the defendant\u2019s privilege to remain silent and on the role of defense counsel could not be thought ideal, they did not shift any burden to the defendant or undercut the statements placing the general burden firmly on the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s more serious contention, again not made the subject of an exception, that the instructions erroneously placed on him a burden of proof as to duress. As to the meaning of duress, the early case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elwell, </em>2 Met. 190, 192 (1840), said merely that no \u201ccriminal will or purpose\u201d could be implied from an act that was caused \u201cby force or the compulsion of others.\u201d The theme has not been renewed in our modern cases,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and so we need say here that, in respect to serious crimes of the order involved in the present case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cduress\u201d is usually taken to require a present, immediate, and impending threat of such a nature as to induce a well-founded fear of death or of serious bodily injury if the criminal act is not done; the actor must have been so positioned as to have had no reasonable chance of escape. See <em>R.I. Recreation Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. </em>&amp; <em>Sur. Co., </em>177 F.2d 603, 605 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(1st Cir. 1949); <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>76 F.2d 490, 493 (10th Cir. 1935). See also Annot., Coercion, Compulsion, or Duress as a Defense to Criminal Prosecution, 40 A.L.R.2d 908, 910-911 (1955). He must have been put in a condition of mind where neither he nor a person of reasonable firmness could have acted otherwise in the circumstances. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>26 F. Cas. 207, 210 (C.C. E.D. Pa. 1823) (No. 15,321); <em>Powe v. State, </em>176 Miss. 455, 461 (1936). See also Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09(1) (Proposed Official Draft 1962).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial judge\u2019s instructions were essentially faithful to this description of duress and no serious challenge on that score is made now.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The parties assumed, as did the trial judge in his memorandum, that in the state of the record the judge was obliged to instruct the jury on duress. That was correct, for \u201c [t]he fact that the evidence may not be of a character to inspire belief does not authorize the refusal of an instruction based thereon.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 398 (1967), quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen, </em>36 Cal. 2d 768, 773 (1951). Also assumed were two more controversial points \u2014 that the defendant was entitled to an instruction on duress with respect to murder as well as the other crimes charged,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that, under <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, 421 </em>U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>684 (1975), the Commonwealth bore the burden of negating duress beyond a reasonable doubt as a matter of due process. Thus it is from the viewpoint of our self-defense cases implementing <em>Mullaney, </em>for example, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684 (1976), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583 (1978), that the parties and the trial judge have discussed the adequacy of the charge in casting the burden regarding duress, and the effect of a failure to take exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As to the first assumption, the common law doctrine was that murder (in some undifferentiated sense) remained punishable as such regardless of duress (see R. Perkins, Criminal Law 951 [1969]; Annot., <em>supra </em>at 909<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>), a posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion still taken in many<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but not all<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> States that speak to the point by statute. The second assumption is troublesome because the standards applied in the cases following <em>Mullaney </em>are influenced by the fact that constitutional imperatives are conceived to be involved. Thus <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 591, defined a \u201cconstitutionally sufficient\u201d instruction on burden of proof, and the decision there to review such instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>despite the absence of exceptions in trials predating <em>Rodriguez </em>derived in part from the decision in <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233, 241, 243 (1977), to give the constitutional right announced in <em>Mullaney </em>a retroactive effect. See <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 588-590. But perhaps duress should not fall into the same constitutional pattern as self-defense or comparable matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Due process requires that the State disprove beyond a reasonable doubt those \u201cdefenses\u201d that negate essential elements of the crime charged. See <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 210 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Arpin, </em>R.I. (1980) (410 A.2d 1340, 1350 [R.I. 1980]). See also <em>Mullaney, supra </em>at 705-706 (Rehnquist, J., concurring). This is a somewhat question-begging yet indicative canon. The defenses of provocation, self-defense, defense of others, a claim of \u201caccident\u201d \u2014 all are considered to go to the presence of \u201cmalice\u201d; hence the State assumes the burden of disproof of each of them, where malice is an ingredient of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>372 Mass. 517, 518-519 (1977) (provocation); <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527, 529-530 (1979) (self-defense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monico, </em>373 Mass. 298, 304 (1977) (defense of others); <em>Lannon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 786, 790 (1980) (accident). Conceivably, however, duress is to be classified with insanity, the proof of which may, according to the Supreme Court, be fastened on the defendant without due process difficulties. See <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>429 U.S. 877 (1978) (dismissing for want of a substantial Federal question a Delaware decision placing the burden as to insanity on the defendant); <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>343 U.S. 790, 799 (1952). See also <em>Mullaney, supra </em>at 705-706 (Rehnquist, J., concurring).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Yet if the effect of duress, as defined, is to reduce the person to a state of involuntariness or automatism, see Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09, Comment at 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>(Tent.

See also <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 514-515 (1979) (due process requires that State bear the burden on \u201cintent\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In fact, a number of recent decisions, cited in the margin,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that place the burden regarding duress on the State, have done so on grounds derived from statute or other reasoning, and not because of supposed constitutional compulsion. One decision has put the burden on the defendant without adverting to any constitutional problem. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toscano, </em>74 N.J. 421, 443 (1977).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Two other decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>have reached the same result after dismissing constitutional objections, relying on <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, supra. </em>See <em>Foraker </em>v. <em>State, </em>394 A.2d 208, 214 (Del. 1978) (relying on <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>State, </em>382 A.2d 238, 241 [Del. 1977], denial of writ of habeas corpus affd sub nom. <em>United States ex rel.

The <em>Patterson </em>case is read as leaving a neutral space of unsettled dimension in which a State\u2019s classification of a \u201cdefense,\u201d with burden-of-proof consequences, will be respected by the Supreme Court and held beyond constitutional impeachment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Our assignment of the burden of proof to the State with respect to insanity <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kostka, </em>370 Mass. 516, 531-532 [1976]), alibi <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leaster, </em>362 Mass. 407, 416-417 [1972]), and entrapment <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 651-652 [1972]) \u2014 all without reliance on the Constitution \u2014 suggests that we might do the same with duress. But this does not mean that we would scrutinize a charge as rigorously, or waive the failure to take exception to the charge as readily, as we have done in our self-defense decisions where the Constitution was in the foreground.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">For purposes of the present case we are content to assume, without deciding, that duress was available to meet a charge of homicide,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that the burden of disproving duress beyond a reasonable doubt was upon the Commonwealth as a matter of constitutional law (as that impinged on a trial in the <em>post-Mullaney, pre-Rodriguez </em>era).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus we grant the defendant, but only arguendo, the best of legal climates. On that basis we find that the instructions on the duress-burden were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-21\">There was no explicit instruction that the Commonwealth bore the burden of negating duress beyond a reasonable doubt. But <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 591, indicated, in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>text of self-defense, that a charge could be constitutionally sufficient if it \u201cclearly placed the burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt on the Commonwealth and contained other discussion which, although not referring to the burden of proof as to self-defense and reasonable provocation, adequately defined those factors and established them as negating a finding of malice.\u201d These words in <em>Stokes </em>followed from the indication in <em>Rodriguez </em>that the \u201ccritical\u201d part of a constitutionally sufficient charge was that a \u201cnexus\u201d be established between the elements of the crime charged, and the absence of the particular defense. See <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 691; <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 529-530, 531. The instructions in the present case required the Commonwealth to prove voluntariness: the Commonwealth must, according to the charge, shoulder the burden as to all essential elements of the crimes charged, and criminal intent (which subsumes voluntariness, an absence of duress, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, </em>15 Cal. 3d 953, 964 n.9, cert, denied, 429 U.S. 805 [1976]) was such an element. The charge made the \u201ccritical nexus\u201d in the following passage: \u201cPerhaps I should say this: that the exercise of free will is essential to the commission of a criminal act. Criminality does not attach to an act committed under duress, if the actor had no free will, because if he had no free will he could have no criminal intent.\u201d The charge here is rather like the one found adequate in <em>Gagne </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 417 (1978). <em>Gagne </em>followed <em>Stokes </em>in upholding a charge in which the judge did not instruct in terms that the burden of disproving provocation was on the . Commonwealth, but rather instructed that the Commonwealth must prove every essential element of the crime charged, that malice was an essential element, and that a legal justification or excuse, such as provocation, negated malice. <em>Id. </em>at 421. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>372 Mass. 319, 319-325 (1977) (charge sufficient which makes malice and provocation \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">There were remarks in the charge which, independently considered, might imply some burden on the defendant. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>comment on these although the defendant does not single them out for attack in his argument on this appeal. They included statements that the jury must \u201cdetermine whether in this case there was . . . coercion or duress,\u201d and that \u201cthe defense is not available\u201d to a person in certain circumstances. Similar language in other cases has been deplored. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 690, criticized a statement that the jury must \u201cdetermine whether or not\u201d the defense of self-defense existed; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 453-454 (1980), saw difficulties with language that \u201c[sjelfdefense is available to a defendant only under [certain] circumstances,\u201d and is never \u201cavailable\u201d to an agressor.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But the charge held insufficient in <em>Rodriguez </em>contained additional, more troublesome language about the jury \u201cfind[ing]\u201d or being \u201csatisfied\u201d that the evidence supported self-defense, see <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 690. See also <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 533-535 (reversing for charge repeatedly using \u201cfinding\u201d language); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>374 Mass. 596, 600 (1978) (holding insufficient instructions that defendant \u201cseeks to establish\u201d self-defense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 592 n.5 (reversing for charge asking whether evidence was \u201cenough to justify\u201d provocation). And the charge in <em>Harrington </em>was held inadequate not only because of its language above quoted, but also because it failed to make the \u201ccritical nexus\u201d: it \u201cfailed to define self-defense adequately or to explain its significance with reference to the question of malice.\u201d <em>Harrington, supra </em>453-454. The charge at bar shares neither of these characteristics. We think any questionable remarks were overcome by the charge as a whole which was sufficient to inform the jury about their true duty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 481 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Grace, </em>381 Mass. 753, 758-759 (1980).

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 146-147 [1980].) On this basis we find no reason to order a new trial or reduce the verdict. The jury could well find that the entire plea of duress was a fictional contrivance by the defendant and that it was disproved by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt.

A dissent argued that throwing the burden on the accused was an \u201cunwarranted modification of the civilized concept of Anglo-American criminal law that it is the burden of the State to prove the guilt of the criminally accused beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; since duress necessarily negates culpable intent, the decision allowed the jury to convict a defendant because duress was not shown preponderantly even if they reserved some doubt as to the defendant\u2019s freedom from the coercive effects of duress. And evidence of duress is no more within the defendant\u2019s exclusive reach than evidence of other matters that the State must prove. <em>Id. </em>at 444-446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> <em>Patterson </em>upheld the application of a New York statute requiring the defendant to shoulder the burden on \u201cextreme emotional disturbance\u201d which, if proved, reduced the crime of murder to manslaughter. The court looked to New York law for the definition both of the crime and the defense, 432 U.S. at 205-208, and concluded that the defendant could constitutionally bear the burden of proof because the defense did not negate an element of murder but merely reduced punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 206-210. <em>Patterson, </em>did not settle the question how far the State can constitutionally redefine traditional elements of crime, such as intent, as elements of defense, and thus place a burden on the defendant, but it suggested there were some due process limits. <em>Id. </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\"><em>Moes </em>v. <em>State, </em>91 Wis. 2d 756, 768 (1979), although it held under a Wisconsin statute that the State bore the burden as to duress, also concluded, in reliance on <em>Patterson, </em>that the Federal Constitution did not compel that burden placement. It justified the latter conclusion by a quotation from <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>119 Cal. Rptr. 614, 616 (Ct. App. 1975), that \u201c[t]he defense of duress does not negate an element of the crime [of robbery].\u201d <em>Graham, </em>however, had been vacated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>57 Cal. App. 3d 238 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b218-24\"> The present case may raise only the issue of duress with respect to felony murder, discussed at note 14 above. The evidence we think sufficient to require an instruction on premeditated murder \u2014 the express encouragement to Ellis to shoot attributed to the defendant by Donna Horner (point 4 above) \u2014 is denied by the defendant rather than rebutted through a claim of duress. Otherwise the participation which the defendant acknowledges, but explains by duress, possibly does not attain to the level that would lend support to premeditated murder on a theory of joint venture with Ellis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 308 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b218-34\"> The trial here occurred in April, 1976, between the <em>Mullaney </em>and <em>Rodriguez </em>decisions. This court brings \u201cgreater expectations\u201d and consequeritly \u201cmore careful scrutiny\u201d to judges\u2019 instructions in trials postdating <em>Mullaney </em>and especially <em>Rodriguez, </em>see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 591 (1978), although counsel are then under heavier responsibility to take exceptions at trial to faulty instructions.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, 379 </em>Mass. 472, 481 (1980); <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 377 </em>Mass. 527, 533 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>367 Mass. 500, 502 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Defense counsel, in his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and in conversation with the trial judge about the jury instructions, indicated his view that the Commonwealth had the burden on duress. After listening to the entire charge he seemed content, for he took no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The defendant mentions two remarks by the judge suggesting incautiously that the jury might not have to reach the issue of duress. After objection, the judge gave an instruction which served to correct any misimpression the remarks might have created.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
