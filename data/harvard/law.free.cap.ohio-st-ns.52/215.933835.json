Baker, treasurer of the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining company, with the seal of the company attached thereto. Did this make out a <em>prima, facie </em>case? We think it did. The attaching of the seal of the company corporation would be sufficient for that purpose.

Dec., 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-6\">But, it may be claimed that this assignment offered and rejected did not purport to be, and was not in .fact, the assignment of the company. From the whole instrument it clearly appears that it was the assignment of the company and not the individual assignment of George F. Baker, and \u2022the whole instrument must be looked at. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Calhoun, </em>95 U. S., 710; <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Clinton Company, </em>12 N. H., 430; <em>Tenny </em>v. <em>Fast Warren Lumber Co., </em>43 N.

A. </em>Guthrie, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">It requires no extended argument to show that the assignment of the lease was no assignment whatever. It was made without authority so far as the treasurer was concerned, and there is no evidence offered that he was competent under the laws of Massachusetts to make such an assignment, and the court properly held that assignment absolutely void and as if it had never been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">The action of the directors,\u2019 on the 31st of October, 1864, voting to lease their property does not help out this defective execution of their purpose. The court will notice that the transcript of the record of the directors authorizing the lease, and which was made by George F. Baker, as treasurer, is also certified by George F. Baker as clerk, showing the real fraudulent character of the whole transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">There were three items of evidence offered which were excluded by the court below. They all stand on similar footing. If any one of them, however, was incompetent, the case of the plaintiff below failed, and the whole question now is, was the act, or attempt to act, as set out in exhibits \u00a3\u00a3C,\u201d \u00a3\u00a3D,\u201d and \u00a3&lt;E, \u201d the act of the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company? That is all there is in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">We claim that the act of Baker was not the act of the corporation, and indeed that the corporation, has not acted at all and did not act. The au-i thority in the \"first place was a vote of the directors. It does not appear that the directors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>had any power to authorize the lease of this corporation\u2019s property. It was real estate. And not only so but they did not authorize a transfer of this lease. They authorized another lease to be made. There is a vast difference, and this authority must be strictly construed and strictly complied with. What right has an individual, having put his hand xto a document, to take the corporate seal of some corporation which he is trying to act for and use it? That is the whole thing. 17 Ohio St., 581; <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>16 Mass., 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">Now, coming to the question as to whether this was a legal assignment or not, we will cite the same case which has already been cited by learned counsel on the other side, that of <em>Hutchins </em>v. Byrnes, 9 Gray, 267. There the corporation attempted to act and did act through their treasurer, and the argument was made that inasmuch as the corporation purported to act and inasmuch as the corporation seal was affixed, it was a good conveyance. The corporation gives, grants, bargains and sells, or the corporation hereby assigns, etc. But not only is this statement wholly obscure in this case but Mr. Baker does not assume to do it. He makes no attempt to make the corporation act, but he acts. He says that he, and he describes himself as the treasurer of the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company, a mere description of the person, \u201c(I) do hereby sell, assign, 'transfer and convey the foregoing lease,\u201d and he did not do anything of the kind so far as the corporation is concerned. Under the head of Deeds in the Am. <em>ds </em>Eng. Ency. of Law is the following: \u201cBut the general rule is that the names of both the principal and the agent must arppear in the signature,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>cites the cases of <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>16 Mass., 42; <em>Wood v. </em>Goodridge, 6 Cush., 117; <em>Thurman v. </em>Cameron, 24 Wenden, 90.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\">In Maine it is held that the principal\u2019s name need not appear in the signature, if it appears in the recitals that he is the grantor. <em>Inhabitants </em>v. Clark, 68 Me., 87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">The proper mode of signing\u2019 is A (principal) by B (agent); and there are some authorities which hold that no other signature will be a good execution. But the better opinion is that, where the deed purports in terms to be the act of the principal, and the signature is B (agent) for A (principal ), or B as the attorney of A, and the like, it will be a valid execution. <em>Wilkes </em>v. Black, 2 East., 142; <em>Mussey </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>7 Cush., 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">Now, in his case there is no pretense that it is the act of the corporation. So we stand upon two propositions and either one is fatal to the plaintiff in error. <em>First </em>\u2014 The power to Baker, which must be strictly construed, was not to assign a lease but was to make a new lease. <em>Second </em>\u2014 The corporation did not make any assignment whatever.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-7\">Dickman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">The record shows that on April 25, 1864, Isaac Samuels, of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts, leased to John P. Augustus, a tract of land situate in Meigs county and state of Ohio, for a term of ninety-nine years. The lease was afterwards, on May 12, 1864, assigned by the lessee to the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company, a corporation duly organized, its successors and assigns, for the full term of the demise. On November 8, 1864, an instrument of writing was executed in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, purporting to be an assignment of this lease by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company, through George F. Baker as its treasurer, to George W. Norris the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The only question presented for our consideration is, whether the court of common pleas. erred in excluding from the jury as testimony, the assignment claimed to have been made by the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company to George W. Norris, which was offered in evidence at the trial by the plaintiff. In other words, was the assignment in question the act of the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">It appears from a copy of the vote written under the assignment by the company, that at a directors\u2019 meeting''1 held October 31, 1864, it was voted, that the company lease to George W. Norris their property in Ohio, for the unexpired term of their lease; and the treasurer of the company was authorized to execute any instruments which might be necessary in order to perfect the title of Norris to the same. We do not deem it necssary to consider how far the instrument executed by George F. Baker, as treasurer, though containing words of assignment, may, by virtue of its reservations, be construed as not conflicting with the authority given to lease. Suffice it that in the body.of the instrument it is not the company that is made to assign the lease, but George F. Baker with the <em>descriptio personce </em>of treasurer. The language of the instrument is : \u201cI, George F. Baker, treasurer of the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company, * * * do hereby sell, assign, transfer, set-over and convey unto the said Norris, his heirs and assigns, the foregoing lease,\u2019\u2019etc. And in executing the assignment, it is \u201cGeorge F. Baker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>treasurer as aforesaid in behalf of said company,\u201d who sets his hand and seal of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">By section 4111, of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, it is provided: \u201cAll deeds, mortgages, powers of attorney, and other instruments of writing for the conveyance or incumbrance of lands, tenements, or hereditaments situate within this state, executed and acknowledged, or proved, in any other state, territory, or country, in conformity with the laws of such state, territory, or country, or in conformity with the laws of this state, shall be as valid as if executed within this state, in conformity with the foregoing provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As the record discloses no proof of the law of Massachusetts as to whether the assignment by the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company was executed in conformity thereto, it is to be presumed that in that regard the law of Massachusetts is the same as our own. But, in the absence of such proof, we may have recourse to the decisions of that state, in aid of determining the principles of the common law which should govern, as to the mode of executing' deeds or other instruments of conveyance through the medium of an ag'ent or attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">It must be conceded that in respect to the manner in which a deed must be executed by an agent, the law is extremely technical; and yet, in view of preserving the stability of judicial decisions, the rule <em>sta/re clecisis </em>is not to be ignored. In the early leading case of Combes\u2019, 9 Co. 76, it is explicitly said: \u201cWhen any one has authority, as attorney, to do any act, he ought to do it in his name who gives the authority; for he appoints the attorney to be in his place, and to represent his person; and therefore the attorney cannot do it in his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>name, nor as his proper acfc, but in the name, and as the act, of him who gives the authority. \u2019 \u2019 This doctrine has been frequently recognized as law by the English courts, and it has also received the approval of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>Elwell </em>v. Shaw, 16 Mass., 42, it was said by Wilde, J.: \u201cIt does not appear that the authority of <em>Combed </em>ease is at all shaken by more modern decisions. All concur in laying it down as an indispensable requisite, to give validity to a deed executed by an attorney, that it should be made in .the name of the principal.\u201d In this case the tenant, to maintain the issue on his part, read in evidence a letter of attorney from the demandant <em>Jonathan Elwell </em>to one <em>Joshua Ehoell. </em>A deed executed by <em>Joshua </em>conveying the demanded pr\u00e9mises, proceeded thus: \u201cKnow ye that I the said <em>Joshua </em>by virtue of the power aforesaid, in consideration, etc., do hereby bargain, grant, sell and convey unto, etc. In testimony whereof I have hereunto set the name and seal of the said Jonathan, this,\u201d etc.; signed <em>Joshua Elwell, </em>and a-seal. It was held that the letter of attorney and the deed of conveyance were insufficient in law to pass the fee from the demandant to the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>9 Gray, 367, it was objected that the assignment was not so executed by the treasurer as to be the act and deed of the corporation. The objection was not sustained, as the plaintiffs claimed to hold the mortgage by an assignment which purported in the body thereof to be from the corporation \u2014 the Bristol County Savings Bank. \u201cThe assignment,\u201d say the court, \u201cwas made in the name, and as the act, of the corporation, according to the rule laid down in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Combes\u2019 </em>case, and always adhered to in England and in this commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">And in <em>Haven </em>v. Adams, 4 Allen, 80, where the mode of execution by the corporation was called in question, the objection was unavailing. In the body of the mortgage it was expressed to be the deed of the corporation, to which they had caused their seal to be affixed, and the name of their president to be signed. Chapman, J., in pronouncing the opinion, said: \u201cThe question in such cases is, whether the deed purports to be the deed of the principal, or the deed of the agent executed by him in behalf of the principal. In the first case, it is held to convey their property, because it is their deed; in the latter case, it does not convey their property, because it is his deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In Ohio there is no general statute prescribing the mode in which deeds of conveyance are to be executed by corporations. In <em>Sheehan </em>v. Davis, 17 Ohio St., 571, the deed sets forth that: \u201cThis indenture, made this second day of July, in the year 1855, between the Albany City bank of the first part, and Charles Butler, of the city of New York, of the second part, witnesseth, that the said party of the first part, for and in consideration, etc., do grant, bargain, etc., unto the said party of the second part, and to his heirs and assigns forever,\u201d etc., concluding\u2019: \u201cIn witness whereof, the said party of the first part have caused their corporate seal to be hereto attached, and these presents to be signed by their cashier on the day and year first above written. \u2019 \u2019 It was held that the deed of conveyance by the banking corporation was properly executed, but .this court emphasized the .fact that, \u201cin this case the deed throughout purports to be the deed of the corporation.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>deed did not, as in <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Shaw, supra, </em>purport to be the deed of the attorney, but purported on its face to be the deed of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">For collation of other authorities in line with the aforegoing views, see 1 Hare &amp; Wal., L. C.,575; Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, vol. 4, pp. 238-242, and vol. 5, p. 440, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Subjecting the assignment claimed to have been made by the Scipio Iron and Coal Mining Company to the plaintiff in error, to the test of the cases we have cited, we do not think it can properly be held to be the act of that company, and it was therefore properly withheld by the court from the jury, when offered in evidence by the plaintiff.'</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Section 4110 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, provides that \u201cNo deed of real estate executed by any person acting for another, under a power of attorney duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded, shall be held to be invalid or defective because he is named therein, as such attorney, as the grantor, instead of his principal; nor because his name, as such attorney, is subscribed thereto, instead of the name of his principal.\u201d But it cannot be claimed, that the assignment under consideration in the case at bar was made under a power of attorney, executed, acknowledged and recorded, as provided by the above section of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">It is suggested in argument, in behalf of the defendant in error, that the court will' notice that the transcript of the record of the directors authorizing the lease, and which was made by George F. Baker as treasurer, is also certified by George F. Baker as clerk, thus showing the fraudulent character of the whole transaction. But the record does not profess to contain all the evidence intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ducecl at the trial, and does not present to our consideration a question of fraud. The .judgment of the circuit court should, in our opinion, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
