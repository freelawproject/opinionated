On.the date last mentioned, the board did meet pursuant to adjournment, and all the members were present. The meeting was-, therefore legal. Sections 3920 and 3985, Revised Statutes. Preparatory to carrying out the objects of the meeting, a motion to proceed to the election of teachers was proposed, and was adopted by unanimous vote. The preliminary motion to proceed to the election was, in effect, a motion to suspend any rules which the board may have had providing for the election at any other time. Cushing\u2019s Manual, par. 21; 2 C. C., 510. The board therefore acted within the statutory authority conferred upon it, and elected plaintiff below, not-merely by the statutory quorum, but by a unanimous vote. Sections 3982 and 4017, Revised Statutes. The rules of the board were not a limitation of its power, if it saw fit to disregard them. The statute fixes the only limitation of its power. It is doubtful whether the doctrine of <em>ultra vire\u00ae </em>applies in any case to <em>quasi </em>corporations; but if it. be thus extended, the doctrine is, that the plea should not prevail, when justice would not be= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>advanced, but on the contrary would accomplish a legal wrong. Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, vol. 2, p. 335.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">The second question arises on the board\u2019s motion to strike out of the reply defendant\u2019s denial of knowledge of the board\u2019s rules. It is claimed that the law holds her to a knowledge of the rules, and that she was bound by them, even though she did not know, in fact, of their existence. One dealing with a corporation is not bound by the bylaws of such corporation unless he has knowledge of them. Waite\u2019s Actions and Defenses, vol. 2, p. 326. There is a vast difference between statutes enacted by the legislature and rules made for their own convenience bya school board.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">The third question arises upon the board\u2019s motion to arrest the testimony from the jury and-the judgment of the common pleas court sustaining the same. This judgment was founded upon the claim that plaintiff below failed to offer any evidence of a contract, and that her evidence failed because she did not prove that an aye and nay vote was taken on her election. This was no part of her case; if available at all, it should have been set up in defendant\u2019s answer. The record does not show that the clerk called the roll; but it does show what is equivalent to an aye and nay. . The record shows this evidence, and the defendant offered nothing in defense. Section 3982, Revised Statutes, is directory only, and a substantial compliance is all that is necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\"><em>(a) </em>If no legal sanction is provided by which a compliance can be enforced, they are plainly directory.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABM\">As shown by the record, the defendant in error, Miss Jennie Best, some time prior to May 17, 1887, made a proposal by written application to the plaintiff in error, the Board of Education of New Concord Village School District, to teach the intermediate or primary department of the school of that district. At the regular June meeting of the board she was nominated for teacher, and her application, at her request, was considered among others, for appointment as a teacher in the intermediate department. At the meeting , of the board, two weeks later, in July, 1887, her application was rejected and another teacher duly elected. Notwithstanding the rejection of her application, she presented herself at the school house on the 5th day of September, 1887, when the scholastic year began, prepared to take charge of the school and teach it, but was not. permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">It is contended in behalf of the defendant in error, that though not elected a teacher at the regular June meeting, she was duly and legally elected at the meeting of May 17, 1887, whereby a right of action accrued to her against the board when she was refused charge of the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Among the provisions applying to boards of education, it is provided by section 3985 of the Revised Statutes, that: \u201cThe board of each district shall make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient and necessary for its government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and the government of its appointees and pupils. \u201d In pursuance of this section of the statutes, the board adopted a set of ' rules and regulations, among which section 1, of article 3, reads as follows: \u201cThe teachers shall be elected by the board of education annually, and shall hold their position for one year, unless sooner removed by the board. The nominations for teachers shall be made at the June regular meeting\u2019, and not be acted on for two weeks.\u201d The wisdom of such a rule is obvious, designed and effective as it is to give an opportunity to become acquainted with the qualifications and fitness of the applicant. The board met on May 10, 1887, and without any suspension of rules, balloted without result for an intermediate teacher, and adjourned to May 17, for the purpose of electing\u2019 teachers for the intermediate and primary departments. On May 17, 1887, without any suspension of rules, a motion to proceed to an election was carried'by unanimous vote, and the board then proceeding to an election, Miss Best was declared elected by unanimous vote for the intermediate department. On May 27, 1887, at a leg\u2019al meeting\u2019 of the board, this election was declared illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It is contended in behalf of the plaintiff in error that the election was illegal for' noncompliance with the rules of the board, and for disregard of the statutory mode of election as prescribed by section 3982 of the Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It is urged, however, on the part of the defendant in error, that the power of the board to make rules and regulations carries with it the power to suspend a rule, and that when, on May 17, the motion to then proceed to elect teachers was carried by unanimous vote, it worked a suspension of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>rule that nominations for teachers should not be acted on for two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We deem it unnecessary to consider whether the election of the defendant in error was void by reason of a failure to comply with the rule requiring such nominations to be made at the regular June meeting, and not to he acted on for two weeks. In our judgment, the election was without the sanction of law, because in disregard of the above mentioned section 3982. That section contains the following provision: \u201cUpon a motion to adopt a resolution authorizing the purchase or sale of property, either real or personal, or to employ a superintendent, teacher, janitor, or other employe, or to elect or appoint an officer,-or to pay any debt or claim, or to adopt any text hook, the clerk of the hoard shall call, publicly, the roll of all the members composing the board, and enter on the record required to be kept the names of those voting \u2018aye,\u2019 and the names of those voting no.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The clerk is made the recording officer of the hoard, and it is incumbent upon him to call the roll on taking a vote. The statutory provision that he shall publicly call the roll, and enter on the record the names of those voting aye and the names of those voting no, is <em>tantamount </em>to a provision, that the vote shall be taken by yeas and nays and entered on the journal. It is not claimed, nor is it a fact, that at the election of the defendant in error as teacher, the clerk of the hoard called the roll and entered the ayes and noes as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">But, it is urged that such requirement is not mandatory, but directory merely. Mandatory statutes are imperative, and must be strictly pursued, otherwise the proceeding which is taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ostensibly by virtue thereof will be void.

It will be observed, that a motion to employ a teacher is placed on the same footing with a motion to adopt a resolution for the purchase or sale of real or personal property, or to pay any debtor claim \u2014 matters of such interest and importance as involving the expenditure of the school fund, that the statute should be strictly followed when a vote is to be taken on the adoption of such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">By section 1694 of the Revised Statutes, \u2018 \u2018 ordinances of a general or permanent nature, shall be fully and distinctly read on three different days, unless three-fourths of the members elected dispense with the rule; and the vote on such suspension shall be taken by yeas and nays and entered \u2022on the journal.\u201d In <em>Bloom </em>v. Xenia, 32 Ohio St., 461, it was held that the section is imperative in its injunction that ordinances shall be read on three different days, unless the rule is dispensed with by a three-fourths vote; and the remaining .language of the clause is, we conceive, no less imperative or mandatory, that the vote on such suspension shall be taken by yeas and nays, and \u2022entered on the journal. The principles announced in the last cited case were approved in <em>Campbell </em>v. Cincinnati, 49 Ohio St., 463, and we see no good reason why the most important duties enjoined upon boards of education, should be held less imperative than those of no geater importance that are made mandatory upon municipal councils. The authority of boards of education, like that of municipal councils, is strictly limited. They both have only such power as is expressly granted or clearly implied, and doubtful claims as to the mode of exercising the powers vested in them are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>resolved against them. Clearly, these organizations that derive their existence as bodies politic and corporate from the legislature, cannot be allowed the same latitude in the observance of their statutory duties, as is permitted to the general assembly. Such subordinate bodies corporate are not privileged to treat express and explicit provisions of the statute as only directory, discretionary, because, there are provisions in the constitution that are held directory in their character for the reason that their observance by the general assembly is secured by their sense of duty and official oaths, and not by any supervisory power of the courts. .</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">It is said, however, that the primary object of the law in providing that the roll of members of the board shall be called publicly, and the names of those voting aye or no recorded, is to determine whether a teacher has been elected by the requisite majority; and that such object is fully attained when such evidence is produced, as appears in the minute book of the plaintiff in error, which contains the record: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Board met; members all present. Miss Jennie Best was declared elected by unanimous vote for intermediate department. \u201d Where there is a <em>viva voce </em>vote, taken in the usual way, which is by a call.for all those who are in favor to say aye, and those opposed to say no, without entering at large on the minutes the names of those voting, the presiding officer judges by his ear which side has the more voices. But, if the vote of a, quorum is in favor of a motion or resolution and no vote is cast against it, the record may still be, that it was adopted unanimously, though some of the members present, in fact, abstained from voting. <em>Steckert </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>The City of East Saginaw, </em>22 Mich., 104. To avoid uncertainty, therefore, in determining the conduct of boards of education in transacting such important official business as concerns the purchase or sale of property, the payment of debts or claims, and the selection of teachers who are to stand somewhat in <em>loco parentis </em>in training the minds, and shaping the moral character of their pupils, the general assembly has carefully guarded against ambiguity by prescribing a method of voting which should not be departed from, and in that regard, the rule <em>expres'sio </em>unius, should, we think, be strictly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><em>Steckert </em>v. <em>The City of East </em>Saginaw, <em>supra, </em>was a bill to restrain the collection of an assessment for paving a street. The first ground of alleged invalidity in the proceedings was, that the several votes in the\u00abcommon council ordering the improvement made, were not taken by ayes and noes, as required by the city charter. The provision of the charter was : \u2018 \u2018 Whenever required by two members, the votes of all the members of the common council, in relation to any act, proceeding or proposition, had at any meeting, shall be entered at large on the minutes. \u2019 \u2019 The record of the meeting of the council gives the names of all the aldermen present. After stating\u2019 the resolutions ordering the improvement, there was this minute, \u201cadopted unanimously on call.\u201d The argument was that the record shows, <em>first, </em>the names of the several aldermen who were present when the action was had; second, that the roll was called on the vote; and <em>third, </em>that each of them, when the roll was called, voted for the adoption of the resolutions. This being so, the vote, it was contended, was in effect entered at large on the min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>utes, and that the repetition of the names of the aldermen in the minutes would have been only ah idle ceremony, accomplishing no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It was said by Cooley, J., in pronouncing the opinion of the court: \u201cWe have found ourselves unable to take the same view of this record-that is taken by the counsel for defendants. There can be no'doubt that the provision of the statute which requires these votes to be entered at large on the minutes, was designed to accomplish an important public purpose, and that it cannot be regarded as immaterial, nor its observance be dispensed with. The purpose,' among other things, is to make the members of the common council feel the responsibility of their action when these important measures are upon their passage, and to compel. each member to bear his share in the responsibility, by a record of his action which should not afterwards be open to dispute.\u201d See also <em>Spangler </em>v. Jacoby, 14 Ill., 297. The same views are similarly expressed in Judge Cooley\u2019s treatise on <em>Constitutional </em>Limitations, as follows: \u201cIt is provided in the constitutions of some of the states that, on the final passage of every bill, the yeas and nays shall be entered on the journal. Such a provision is designed to serve an important purpose in compelling each member present to assume as well as to feel his due share of responsibility in legislation; and also in furnishing definite and conclusive evidence whether the bill has been passed by the requisite majority or not.\u201d (6th ed., 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The same doctrine is unqualifiedly approved by-Judge Dillon in his work on <em>Municipal Corpora</em>tions., after an examination of the authorities supporting the opposite view. Sec. 291 (229).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">In <em>Rich </em>v. <em>City of </em>Chicago, 59 Ill., 286, the street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>improvement was not asked for by the petition of the owners of a majority of the property to be assessed; and in such case, the city charter'declares, that the improvement \u201cshall be ordered <em>only </em>by the votes of at least three-fourths of all the aider-men present, such vote to \u00bbbe entered by ayes and noes on the record of the common council. \u201d It was objected that there was no valid ordinance commanding the improvement, or the assessment to be made. The court say: \u201cIt does not appear, from the record introduced, or otherwise, that this improvement was ordered by the votes of three-fourths of all the aldermen present, and it appears, affirmatively, that the vote was not entered by ayes and noes on the record. W\u00e9 must, therefore, regard the objection as well taken. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In Cutler v. <em>Town of </em>Russellville, 40 Ark., 105, it was held, that the weight of authority and the better opinion seems to be, that a requirement that the yeas and- nays shall be called and recorded on the passage by a municipal council of an order or resolution to enter into a contract is designed to accomplish an important public purpose; and hence cannot be reg-arded as immaterial, nor its observance dispensed with. To the same effect are the decisions in <em>Town of Olin v. Meyers, </em>55 Iowa, 209; <em>Morrison, Administratrix, </em>v. <em>City of Lawrence, </em>98 Mass., 219, and in numerous other cases involving the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">For the aforegoing reasons, the election of the defendant in error by the board of education of the New Concord Village School District, was, in our opinion, illegal and void. And being so, the court of common pleas did not err in taking the case from the jury, and rendering judgment for the defendant below \u2014 the board of education. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The judgment of the circuit court should, therefore, he reversed, and that of the court of common pleas affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
