The result of the statute passed April 15, 1892, 89 Ohio Laws, 647, relating to the Cincinnati College, which, in terms, gives absolute control and management of the affairs and property of the Cincinnati College to the directors of the University of Cincinnati, is to take the property of the former and donate it to the latter institution.

Inasmuch as the act leaves the title to the property just where it was before \u2014in the corporation \u2014 and leaves the property devoted to precisely the same object to which it had been previously devoted, and to which alone it can lawfully be devoted' \u2014 the maintenance of a college \u2014our adversaries find themselves obliged to maintain that the privilege and duty of the shareholders to elect trustees to manage the affairs of the corporation are property; the property of the shareholders, of which the act attempts to deprive them. The notion that this privilege and duty are property of the stockholders rests upon a misconception of the corporate character of the Cincinnati College, and of the law of public dharities. The Cincinnati College, though a private corporation, is a public charity. ' <em>Morman Church </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 136 U. S., 47; article XII, section 2, Constitution; <em>Gerke </em>v. Purcell, 25 Ohio St., <em>229; Humphries </em>v. <em>The Little Sisters of the </em>Poor, 29 Ohio St., 201; <em>Cleveland Library Association </em>v. Pelham, 36 Ohio St., 253; <em>Mannix </em>v.

Stephen Girard, by his will, created a public charity similar to that provided for by the charter of the Cincinnati College. <em>Girard </em>v. Philadelphia, 7 Wall., 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">The Cincinnati College was specially created for the sole purpose of the erection and maintenance of a college \u2014 the administration of a public charity \u2014 and in the charter, in the very act which is the law of its being, the legislature provided that \u201cThis act shall be subject to such alterations as the general assembly may from time to time see proper to make.\u201d The custom of reserving in the charters of corporations the power to alter, amend, and repeal became almost universal after the decision of the Dartmouth College case, so as to enable legislatures to do <em>inter </em>alia, the precise thing (i. e., change the number and mode of appointment of trustees), which, in that case, the Supreme Court decided a legislature could not do, unless the power to alter had been reserved in the charter creating the corporation. 4 Wheat., 675.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">Since then many states, including Ohio, have embodied in their constitutions a provision reserving to the legislature this power of alteration, amendment, and repeal of the charters of all corporations which it might create. The question as to the effect of such reservation has been frequently before the courts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Gas Light and Coke Co., </em>18 Ohio St., 262; <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Jessup, </em>15 Wall., 454; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>96 U. S., 499; Sinking Fund cases, 99 U. S., 700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">It is true that the reserved power to alter a-charter is not without a limit, and all the decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>cited by us concede this. Our learned adversaries say that the test to be applied in determining what is the limitation to the power reserved to alter a charter is stated by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Essex Company, </em>13 Gray, 253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">After the amendatory act of 1892, the property remains just as it was before; the legal title in the corporation, and the beneficial interest in the public for the Cincinnati College is a purely public charity. The only change made by the act is to take from the stockholders the privilege and duty of selecting the trustees who are to administer the charity. This privilege and this duty are, as we think we have already shown, not property at all, Assuredly they are not property or rights which have become vested under a legitimate exercise of the powers granted. The right to vote for trustees was created by the act of incorporation itself, it did not become vested by the exercise of any power granted by the act. Property, purchased under the power granted in the act to acquire property, would become vested under a legitimate exercise of the powers granted. The right to vote for trustees never became vested under the exercise of any power granted by the act, but was conferred and existed solely as a power granted directly by force of the act itself; and by virtue of the reservation in the charter, could be taken away by the legislature. <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Jessup, </em>15 Wall., 459; Sinking Fund cases, 99 U. S., 721.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">We have heretofore referred to authorities which lay down the general rules defining the ambit within which the reserved power to alter charters may be exercised. These rules have been frequently applied in cases of corporations of the character of the Cincinnati College, and of corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>affected with a public interest, in respect of legislation similar to that involved in the ease at bar. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonsall, </em>3 Whart., 559; Pennsylvania College cases, 13 Wall., 190. <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>151 U.

Monroe, 357; <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>44 Mo., 570; Morawetz on Corporations, section 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">We have never contended that the power to alter a thing was a power to destroy it, and substitute something else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">The power to alter the charter of a college founded and incorporated as a nonsectarian institution, does not include the power to convert into a Catholic, Methodist or Presbyterian institution. This would not be alteration, but the destruction of one thing and the substitution of another. Nothing of the kind is attempted' in the case at bar. The meaning of the power to alter is clearly defined in <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>The Railroad Companies, </em>35 Wis., 425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-8\">Mr. Justice Story cannot be supposed to have intended to overrule what he said in the Dartmouth College case as to the effect of reserving the power to alter the charter itself. Our adversaries denounce the legislature for passing the act of 1892, charging that body with having acted hastily, or ignorantly, or worse, they \u201cindignantly protest.\u201d Strictly speaking this is irrelevant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Desmoines, etc., Co., </em>142 U. D., 544; <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Freight Co., </em>105 U. S., 17; <em>Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>146 U. S., 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The terms of the reservation in the act incorporating the Cincinnati College are equally broad.; they are that this act shall be subject to such alterations as the g-eneral assembly may from time to time see proper to make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">The present alleged stockholders hold certificates for 134 shares of-stock issued in 1873 to 114 persons, many of whom were then dead, some who were living, no longer residents of Cincinnati, and still others utterly unknown except by name. These are the only certificates of stock in the Cincinnati College extant. The holders claim in their aggregation to he that corporation, and that the act of April 15, 1892, deprives them.of their prop erty without due process of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">The edifice, for the repair of which this money was subscribed, was totally destroyed by fire in 1845. The property in question belonged in 1819 as a leasehold estate to the Lancaster Seminary, a corporation. By the act of 1819 creating the Cin: cinnati College the control of the property was transferred to the latter. It is the supposed successors to those persons only who in 1835-6 subscribed $4,300 for the repair of a building entirely destroyed in 1845, who issued certificates to themselves in 1873, who claim to be the body of stockholders. It is only the subscribers to a small fund for the repair of a building nonexistent now for nearly fiftjT-years, who claim the right to control the real estate of the corporation to the acquisition of which they'never contributed a cent, and to prevent it from the purpose for which it was given by the donors, <em>Cincinnati College </em>v. State, 19 Ohio, 110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-7\">The record shows that the First Presbyterian church granted the lands by perpetual lease at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>nominal rent to the Lancaster Seminary in return for the right to nominate for -gratuitous annual instructions twenty-five children in the lower and three in the higher department of said seminary. It never entertained the idea of giving away its lands to support a law school.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">II. Does the act of April 15, 1892. confer corporate power ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-6\">1st. It is claimed that it confers corporate power on the Cincinnati College.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-7\">2d. That it confers corporate power upon the directors of the Cincinnati University.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-8\">3d. That if it does not confer corporate power, it is the exercise by the legislature of the power of appointment to office contrary to article XXVII, section 2, of the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-9\">The corporate power mentioned in article XIII of the constitution, must be some power conferred on a corporation already created or some power conferred upon individuals which makes them into a corporation. <em>State </em>v. Cincinnati, 23 Ohio St., 466; M. &amp; C. R. R. Co. case, 15 Ohio St., 35; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>43 Ohio St., 110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\">In this ease a solution of the question, therefore, requires us to ascertain what corporation was created by the original act; secondly, what, if any, new powers were conferred upon such corporation; and thirdly, what individuals, if any, have been created into a corporation, by the act in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-11\">1. The original charter of th'e Cincinnati College created certain individuals and their associates a body corporate, with perpetual succession, under, the name of the \u201cPresident, Trustees and Faculty of the Cincinnati College.\u201d It seems to be necessary at this late day to seek to maintain, by argument, that a corporation is a real thing. It is said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to be a mere fiction \u2014 -a nothing. Corporate powers conferred; the rights and powers and franchises and property of a corporation; the stock of a corporation and the rights of stockholders in a corporation, are all meaningless expressions. It is quite true that you cannot hide behind a corporate charter and exercise the corporate powers in defiance of the laws of the state, as in the Standard Oil Co. case, <em>27 W. </em>L. B., 197. But within the reason and the policy of the. law, and when not used as a shield to hide infractions of the law and morals, a corporation is as much a juristic person as any natural individual. <em>State </em>v. Sibley, 25 Minn., 387; Revised Statutes, p. 3239.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-4\">Surely the object of the statutes must be to create a body or person separate and distinct from the persons who constitute it. It cannot be that the corporate body is a reality, only when its stockholders desire to evade its debts and responsibilities, and yet a mere fiction when otherwise advantageous to them. <em>Bank </em>v. Morton, 4 Gray, 156.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">The directors or trustees are mere agents of the corporation. Morawitz on Corps., section 516. It is quite essential to distinguish between the corporation itself, its agents or the agents of the stockholders, and the stockholders. It is also necessary to distinguish between the office of director or trustee, and the incumbent or person who administers the office. It is first arg-ued that the act confers corporate power upon the corporation known as the \u201cPresident, Trustees and Faculty of the Cincinnati College, \u201d which are called for convenience merely the \u201cCincinnati College,\u201d by conferring upon it the power to have a new board. It is herein assumed that the corporation is a real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>person capable of having powers conferred upon it. The second claim is that the university directors are created into a corporation; that under the charter the stockholders have the corporate power and are in fact the corporation, and that such corporate power is taken from them and conferred upon the university directors. First, the Cincinnati College is a corporation; next, the stockholders are the corporation, and now the trustees are the corporation. It would be difficult to imagine three more contradictory propositions. By the original charter, thealleged stockholdershad the right to choose trustees. To those trustees was committed the sole charge and management of the property of the Cincinnati College.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">The act of April 15, 1892, called the amendatory act, does not in any way interfere with the Cincinnati College or its property. (It merely changes the method of choosing its trustees.) It is in vain that we search for any burden laid upon the corporation or privilegie granted to it, that it did not before possess. This is admitted to the extent that no change is attempted save in the method of choosing the governing body. It is claimed, however, that such change confers upon the corporation, \u201cThe Cincinnati College,\u201d corporate powers in this that the right to have such a board so chosen, instead of the board as chosen as before, is corporate power. As decisive of this proposition, <em>The State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>48 Ohio St., 211; <em>Kirker </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>48 Ohio St., 507, are cited. 29 Ohio St., 102; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>43 Ohio St., 119; <em>State </em>v. <em>Constantine, </em>42 Ohio St., 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-7\">2. Nor does the act of April 15, 1892, confer corporate power or perpetual succession upon the university directors any more than the original char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ter conferred perpetual succession on the trustees of the college. The office, presumably, was perpetual, but the change of persons then and now is analogous. Even if the university directors were a corporation, the new act would not have conferred corporate power, because they could do no act in connection with the Cincinnati College as a board of the university, but would act as individuals comprising the college board; which may be the case, as is assumed in the Hospital case, 23 Ohio St., 466, and was decided in <em>People </em>v. Freeman, 22 Pac. Rep., 173, and <em>ex parte </em>Frazier, 54 Cal., 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">The persons composing the board of directors of the university chang\u2019e; so do the persons comprising the board of trustees of the college exactly as they did before. The only change is in the appointing power, so far as the college is concerned. It is confusing to confound the office with the officer in discussing the theory of perpetual succession. The board is concerned with the mere internal management of the business of the corporation. <em>Jackson </em>v. Walsh, 23 Alt. Rep., 778; Marietta Railroad case, 15 Ohio St., 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">Plainly, the new board in this case is merely wielding the powers of the old corporation. Plainly, the new board is either appointed or desig\u2019nated directly by the legislature. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>66 N. C., 9; <em>State </em>v. Pugh, <em>supra. </em>In neither aspect is power conferred upon a corporation or a new corporation erected, but a change is made in the manner of designating\u2019 the agents who shall wield the powers of the old corporation. <em>State </em>v. <em>David, </em>23 Ohio St., 424; <em>State </em>v. <em>City of Cincinnati, </em>23 Ohio St., 445; 29 Ohio St., 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-7\">3. The designation of directors or trustees of a private corporation is not obnoxious to article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>XXVII, section 2, of the constitution. <em>State </em>v. Kennon, 7 Ohio St., 566.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-6\"><em>E. W. Kittredge, John F. Follett </em>and <em>J. W. Warrington, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">It is claimed by the relators that the act of April, -1892, leaves the legal title to the property of the Cincinnati College in the corporation, and leaves the property devoted the maintenance of a college. But it is said that the idea that the corporation or its stockholders are protected in the right to control and manage the property and apply it to the maintenance of a college, arises upon a misconception of the corporate character of the Cincinnati College, and of the law of public charities. There are two kinds of public charities as that term is used in the law: First, where the ownership of the property is private, but the object is public charity. Second, where both the ownership and the object, which is charity, are public. The Cincinnati College belongs to the former of these classes. Where the law creates a private corporation to be controlled and administered by the shareholders who contribute the funds or stock, although the object may be charitable, it is a private corporation. In such case, the charity is not different in kind from that which is created when a man by his deed conveys property to a trustee to be administered for a charitable purpose, and where no corporation is contemplated or created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\">The provision of the constitution of this state, that private property shall be held inviolate, includes the property of private corporations and individuals, whether it is held for private purposes or for purposes of purely public charity. The' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>provision is general in its terms, and contains no exception of private property held for charitable uses. No case has been cited by our adversaries tending to support the proposition that private property may be taken from its owners, corporate or otherwise, because it has been devoted by them to the support of a public charity. It being admitted that the Cincinnati College is a private corporation, there is nothing in its charter that precludes the corporation, if it should make profits in the prosecution of its business, from declaring dividends.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-5\">Still more certainly, under section 3762, of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, it is the right of the stockholders of the Cincinnati College, by the concurrent action of the trustees selected by them, and by their own vote, to dispose of and divide its property among themselves. Our adversaries deny this, without attempting any argument or reasoning in support of their denial. A private eleemosynai\u2019y corporation, though, organized for the purpose of administering a public charity, holds its title to property acquired as much exempt from legislative control as any other private corporation. <em>Trustees for Vincennes University </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 14 Howard, 268; <em>Regents </em>v. Williams, 9 Gill and Johnson, 365; <em>Trustees </em>v. Bradbury, 11 Me., 113; <em>Montpelier Academy </em>v. George, 14 La., 395; <em>Yarmouth </em>v. <em>North </em>Yarmouth, 34 Me., 411; <em>Trustees of the University </em>v. <em>Foy, </em>1 Murphy (N. C.), 58; <em>State v.

Take any of the trusts of a charitable nature that exist in our midst \u2014 the music hall, the art museum, the art school in Cincinnati, or the churches of various denominations throughout the state \u2014 is it possible because their object is public charity, when the ownership is of private property, that the legislature can by legislative enactment displace the possession and control of the corporations, and appoint agents of its own to possess, manage and control them? The civil law in defining property, expresses ownership by the word <em>dominium. </em>. This idea is at the foundation of every legal definition of property. The word owner, which is of Anglo-Saxon origin, as applied to property, signifies the right to control, to administer and dispose of the property, The control and management of the property ia taken away from it; and being taken away from it, it is taken away from its stockholders who compose it. Does this take us any further than the lega] entity, with which we have long been familiar, oi which we know, from the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Standard, Oil Co., </em>49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Ohio St., 137, that, apart from the natural persons who compose it, it is a mere fiction, introduced for convenience in the transaction of business ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-5\">We have already discussed the proposition that every definition of property or of the ownership of property includes as its fundamental idea the right to control, manage and dispose of it. And we conceive that in recognizing the correctness of the rule as laid down by Chief Justice Shaw, our adversaries have conceded that the legislature, under its reserved power to alter this charter, cannot take away from this corporation, nor yet from its stockholders, the right to control, manage and dispose of the property which it has acquired. But the definition of the limitation upon the power to alter a charter does not rest solely upon the authority of 13 Gray, 253; <em>People </em>v. O'Brien; 111 N. Y., 48; <em>Railroad </em>v. Elliott, 58 N. H., 457; <em>Allen </em>v. McKean, 1 Sumner, 276; <em>Sage </em>v. <em>Dillard, </em>15 B. Monroe, 359; <em>Orr v. Bracken Co., </em>81 Ky., 593; <em>Shild </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>95 U.

S., 362; Lewis on Eminent Domain, section 54.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\">Under the act of 1892, the Cincinnati College and its board of trustees are excluded from the right to use, manage and control its property, and thereby are, and were intending to be, absolutely deprived of the property itself, which the legislature is prohibited from doing by both the constitution of the United States and of this state, unless it is done in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and then it can be done only upon paying-full compensation therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\">The trustees of the Cincinnati college unanimously remonstrated against the passage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>act of 1892, and the trustees and stockholders each unanimously refused to accept the provisions of the act after it was passed. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>State, </em>15 Wall., 98; <em>Jackson </em>v. Walsh, 23 Atl. Rp. Glenwood cemetery case, 107 U. S.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-5\">The act violates the inhibitions against special legislation and appointing officers. The exact question raised by the legislation in dispute may be stated to be: Whether it is competent to enact by statute that corporation A shall, without a hearing and without compensation, surrender to B, forever, the entire control and dominion of its property both real and personal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-6\">' The solution of the question of whether power has or has not been conferred upon a corporation, cannot involve the question of whether a corporation is a legal entity, apart from the natural persons who compose it or not. As it is admitted that there is a corporation, no one with clear ideas and a clear case would ever claim the definition of a corporation could aid in determining whether or not power has been conferred on the corporation. The act is special in form and substance, and is in no sense a general law. This is so according to the express terms of the act, and is so admitted by opposing counsel. It is only necessary, then, to show either that the act confers corporate power or creates a corporation. We maintain that it does confer corporate power upon the Cincinnati College corporation, by giving it power to have the board, created by the amendatory act in dispute, instead of the old board mentioned in section 3 of its charter. If this can be done at all, it must be by general law \"and not by. special act. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>20 Ohio St., 35; <em>State </em>v. Smith, 48 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>St., 211; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>15 Ohio St., 35; <em>Kirker </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>48 Ohio St., 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">If the mandatory act is valid, it has furnished the college with a new board, constituted in a new way, composed of members whom the stockholders of the college had no- right to select, and clothed with power to manage its property and funds in connection with the Cincinnati University property and funds. It is immaterial whether this would be a benefit or an injury. It is something new and something added ; not something old \u25a0 or something taken away merely. <em>State </em>v. <em>Constantine, </em>42 Ohio St., 442; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>44 Ohio St., 248; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>43 Ohio St., 98; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>31 Ohio St., 592; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>23 Ohio St., 445; <em>State v: Cincinnati, </em>20 Ohio St., 18; <em>School District </em>v. <em>Ins.

The particular claim urged is that the legislature can, as regards such corporations, confer power by special act. A plain statement of such a claim ought to furnish its complete refutation. . 43 O.

The scheme was not successful, and in the year 1818, the institution being in a languishing condition, application was made to the legislature for a new incorporating act, which was passed on the 22d day of January, 1819, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cSection 1. <em>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of </em>Ohio, That Jacob Burnett, Francis Dunlavy, Samuel Johnson, William Lytle, Zaccheus Biggs, Joshua L.

The object of this body, The Cincinnati College, as expressly declared by the first section of the incorporating act, is \u201cthe erection .and maintenance of .a college,\u201d the act nowhere designating the nature of the instruction to be given, or the .method by which it was to be imparted.. The early transactions of the institution, from the plate of the incorporation, of The Cincinnati Lancaster Seminary in 1814, until its merger in The Cincinnati College in 1819, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>buried in obscurity, and but little more has been satisfactorily ascertained respecting its affairs after the incorporating act of 1819 was passed, until about the year 1845. However, it may be gathered from the record, that soon after The Cincinnati Lancaster Seminary was incorporated, it established, and for a time maintained, a school wherein both primary and academic instruction was given; that the school was not successful and soon began to languish. That in 1819, The Cincinnati Lancaster Seminary was superseded by The Cincinnati College, and the property of the former, of the value of about ten thousand dollars, transferred to the latter corporation, -and by the same act, the stock of the last named corporation was fixed at five thousand shares, of twenty-five' dollars each, a sufficient number of which were subscribed to add about forty thousand dollars to the funds received from The Cincinnati Lancaster Seminary.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Schools were maintained by the new institution until about the year 1825. After this date, for eight or ten years, whatever educational processes, if any, that may have been continued, were desultory and unsystematic. In 1835 additional shares of stock were subscribed, amounting- in the aggregate to about four thousand dollars, primary and academical education established, and a medical-school established. About the same time instruction in law was also begun. After a year or two, the medical school was discontinued and as early as 1845 or 1846 all attempts to impart- primary or academical instruction were abandoned, since which time a law school only has been maintained, except a course of philosophical lectures continued during a few years at a later period, and since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>abandoned. The date when the law school was established is left uncertain, but probably it was in 1832; if not quite so early as that, yet it had had an uninterrupted existence of more than fifty years, when in the year 1892, the following statute was passed by the general assembly :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\u201cAn act to amend sections 3, 4 and 5, of an act entitled \u2018 An act to incorporate The Cincinnati College,\u2019 passed January 22, A.

Be it further enacted, that sections 3, 4, and 5 of the said act of January 22, 1819, entitled \u2018An act to incorporate The Cincinnati College, \u2019 be, and the same are hereby repealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\u201cSec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">The constitutionality of this statute is assailed on a number of grounds, one of which is that it violates that provision of the nineteenth section of article I of the constitution of Ohio, which asserts that \u201cPrivate property shall ever be held inviolate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Whether the statute is obnoxious to that constitutional provision depends, 1, whether it violates the property rights of The Cincinnati College, and 2, if it does so, whether that corporation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>entitled to the protection secured by the clause of the constitution of this state, above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">No refined process of reasoning or unusual keeness of perception is required to ascertain the effect of this statute upon the property rights of The Cincinnati College. It simply and in unambiguous terms, abrogates these rights by transferring them to a body of strangers. No language that the court might use can make this \u2022 result more clear than does the concise language employed by the general assembly. The expressly declared reason for this legislative action is the assumed insufficiency of the property of The Cincinnati College, as managed by the present directory, to \u201ccarry out the purposes of its charter, \u201d and assuming further, that \u201c it would be advantageous to The Cincinnati College and to the University of Cincinnati, and the public generally, that the government of the two institutions should be joined and consolidated,\u201d it seizes the entire property of the one and hands it over to the other of the two bodies. It is no answer to this to assert that the new directory represents the old corporation, or that the legal title to the property still remains in The Cincinnati College. The mere naked legal title to property has no value, when that title is absolutely severed from its control and beneficial enjoyment. It is the province and the duty of courts to look at the substance of a transaction, and to ignore refined and unsubstantial distinctions. And we can see no substantial difference between a statute which expressly creates a new corporation and endows it with the property of another body corporate, and a statute, like the one under consideration, which, finding a corporation already existing, vests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>in the directory of the latter all the powers and rights of property which had belonged to another corporate body. And whether we regard the corporation as the actual and potential proprietor of the property in contention, or whether we consider those who contributed to or created this fund or property as such proprietors, and the corporation a mere agency, created to represent them and carry their will into .execution, is immaterial in this connection. For, if the corporation is the real owner, it has been deprived of its use and enjoyment of its property, while if those who originally created the fund are the real owners, then without their consent and against their will, it has been taken from their chosen ag\u2019ents, and placed in the custody and management of others, whom they did not appoint and over whom they have no control. - Property in the hands of an agent is just as inviolate as that in the custody of the owner himself. As long\u2019 as the principal may choose and control his agent, his dominion of the property confided to the agent continues, but this dominion, or proprietorship, is at once destroyed the moment that his property is forcibly, and against his will, seized, and absolutely and irrevocably transferred to another agent, selected not by the owner, but by some other person or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We have seen that the statute under consideration has taken from the control and management of The Cincinnati College all of its property and placed it under the control and management of the University of Cincinnati. One ground, as we understand the argument of counsel, upon which this result is maintained to be lawful, is that the purpose to which this property was devoted by its original donors is a public purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>and therefore, that circumstance alone is sufficient to impress upon the property a public character; but if that is not so, yet as the purpose of the donors was not private gain, but public charity, and as - the property under the new corporation would be applied to the same purpose to which The Cincinnati College would have applied it, had the latter continued its administration, that therefore no substantial right, either of the original donors or of the corporation, was violated by the law. That in fact the- only rights the original donors had, as the - result of their contribution to the funds of The Cincinnati College was that of voting\u2019 for directors of the concern, which was \u201cno more property than the privilege and duty of a citizen to vote for a governor of state, or presidential electors, are property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The results of establishing this doctrine would be to place every eleemosynary corporation' within the state, whether religious, educational, or created to administer to the wants of the suffering or needy, beyond the limits of constitutional protection. Whenever, in the opinion of a majority of the general assembly, the public interest, or the interest of two or more colleges, or churches, or other private or eleemosynary corporations, required them to be united, the property of one or more of them could be seized and transferred to another.- The doctrine finds no support in any treatise or -adjudication within our knowledge, nor by reason or justice. There are two classes of public charities, one where the institutions are public in the broadest sense of that term, that is, they are owned by the state, or some subdivision thereof created for governmental purposes, and maintained at the public expense. These institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tions are absolutely-under the control and management of the public through its proper representatives. As - respects them no vested or private rights pertain. It does not follow, -however, that because this class of public charitable institutions are the subjects of absolute public control, that another class, whose property consists of private donations and to which the organized public has contributed nothing* shall-also be subjected to such absolute governmental control because the charity they administer has been christened a \u201cpublic charity\u201d in legal nomenclature. In common-.acceptation; colleges are not \u201ccharitable institutions,\u201d although in law they administer a public charity. This, means no more than that the public are incidentally benefited by the education of some of its members, the immediate advantage accruing to the individual members who have received instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The unbroken current of authority declares that the property of such institutions is private property, and the corporations themselves private corporations. <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 518; <em>Vincennes University </em>v. Indiana, 14 Howard (U. S.), 269; <em>Inhabitants of Yarmouth </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of N.

The consideration for which they stipulated, is the perpetual application of the fund to its object, in the mode prescribed by themselves. Their descendants may take no interest in the preservation of this consideration. But in this respect their descendants are not their representatives. They are represented by the- corporation. The corporation is the assignee of their rights, stands in their place, and distributes their bounty, as they would themselves have distributed it, had they been immortal. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Whether The Cincinnati College is regarded as the owner in its own right of the property donated to it, or as the representative of the donors, charged with the execution of their purpose, is not material; in either view the property is private as contradistinguished from public, and as such is within the protection of that provision of the constitution which declares private property to be inviolate.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We now come to the consideration of the provision in the charter of The Cincinnati College, which reserves to the general assembly the right of amendment. This reservation would be wholly unnecessary if The Cincinnati College had no rights of property which the general assembly was bound to respect. If the legislature, at its will could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>divest this corporation of its property, the legislative-control of the institution would be absolute, for by taking away its entire property rights, all effectual corporate action would be at once paralysed. Thenceforward it would be powerless to advance the purposes of its creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The authorities agree in holding that the legislative power of amendment and alteration thus reserved in charters, is not absolute, although its .boundaries are not yet established. In Kentucky this- power of amendment seems to be limited to those matters which concern the \u25a0 relations established by the charter between the corporation and the .state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u25a0 \u201cThe power,to alter or amend the contract, in our conception, is to change it <em>as betiveen the original </em>pa/rties, <em>and such others </em>only, <em>as have been per</em>mitted, <em>by their mutual </em>consent,. <em>to come into the enjoyment of its benefits and privileges; </em>not to compel one of the parties to operate in conjunction with others, and share with them the privileges and benefits of the contract.\u201d <em>Sage v. </em>Dillard, 15 B. Monroe, 359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u2022 Whatever difficulties have been encountered by the courts in ascertaining\u2019 -the limits of this -reserved legislative power,, they concur in denying that under it, the legislature can strip a corporation of its rights of property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">\"The power of alteration and amendment is not without limit. The alterations must be reasonable; they must be in. good faith, and be consistent with the scope and object of the act of incorporation. -Sheer oppression and wrong cannot be inflicted under the guise of amendment or alteration. - Beyond the sphere of the reserved powers, <em>the vested rights of property of corporations in such cases are </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>surrounded by the same sanctions and are as </em>inviola\u2022 <em>ble as in other cases.\u201d Shield </em>v. Ohio, 95 U. S., 324; <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Plank </em>Road Co., 43 Mich., 140; <em>Orr </em>v. <em>Bracken </em>Co., 81 Ky. Rep. 593.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The Cincinnati College was the lawful owner of the property in its possession; it is immaterial whether it was acquired from The Cincinnati Lancaster Seminary that it succeeded, or by subscriptions and donations subsequently made. This property had been intrusted to it for the purposes of establishing and maintaining a \u201ccollege,\u201d no specific branches of learning were prescribed, or method of instruction commanded. Primary, academical, medical, legal and philosophical courses were from time to time attempted; all of them except the law school, proved unsuccessful and were abandoned; the latter has been continuously and successfuly maintained for nearly sixty years, and substantially the entire income of the institution during that period has been devoted to its maintenance and improvement, without material objection appearing to have been made by any one of the donors. The facts that such donors of the property to this institution, gave it with knowledge that- no specific branches of learning or method of instruction were prescribed by its charter, together with the brief history of its various educational attempts and failures just adverted to, and the acquiescence of such donors therein, tend to show that these donors entrusted to this chosen instrument of their will a wide discretion respecting the course and method of instruction to which their donations were to be, devoted, and if good faith is to be kept with these donors, we must deny to the legislature the powers to seize the fund thus raised, and transfer it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>these chosen agents to others, in whose discretion they did not confide. This power, we think is prohibited by section 19,' of article I, of the constitution of 1852, which declares the inviolability of private property. This conclusion makes the consideration of the other questions raised in argument unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
