The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, holding that mere residency of the representative and service in Maryland were too ephemeral for the tort action to be maintained in Maryland. For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On 6 January 2003, a vehicle operated by Carver James Leach, Jr., struck a vehicle driven by M\u2019Hamed Kortobi in the intersection of 12th Street, N.W., and K Street, N.W., in Washington, D.C. Kortobi allegedly received medical attention for injuries sustained in the collision. At the time of the accident, Kortobi was a resident of Virginia and Leach was a resident of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">A little over a year after the accident, on 9 January 2004, Leach died from causes unrelated to the 2003 motor vehicle accident. Because he was a resident of D.C. and his assets, including real estate, were located in the District of Columbia, an estate was opened in the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Brian L. Kass, Esquire, ultimately was appointed on 19 April 2006 by the probate court as the personal representative of Leach\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kass is an attorney in the firm of Kass, Mitek &amp; Kass, with offices in Washington, D.C. Although he is a resident of Maryland, Kass initiated all of the filings for the Leach Estate from his District of Columbia office. Kass conducted no estate business related to the Leach Estate, in his capacity as personal representative, in the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">As Leach\u2019s personal representative, Kass gathered and reported all assets to the Superior Court. Leach\u2019s only beneficiaries were Willene C. Leach and Angela Leach, both of whom are residents of the District of Columbia. Leach did not own property in the State of Maryland or in any jurisdiction other than the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Initially, Kortobi filed a tort action, arising from the 2003 automobile accident, against the Leach Estate and Progres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>sive Casualty Insurance Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, even before Kass\u2019 appointment. After the appointment of Kass as the personal representative, Kortobi dismissed the action in the Superior Court, and filed the instant suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On 15 July 2006, after amending the complaint to sue Kass as the personal representative, Kortobi served Kass, in his capacity as the personal representative of the Leach Estate, at Kass\u2019 residence in Howard County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In response, Kass filed, among other things, a motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction. The motion was denied by the first judge who considered it. A motion to reconsider the denial was placed before a different judge. After reviewing the parties\u2019 initial submissions, the second judge ordered the parties to prepare memoranda addressing the applicability of Md. Code (2001 Repl. Vol.), Estates and Trusts Art., \u00a7 5-502(a) (discussed <em>infra). </em>Neither party requested an evidentiary hearing, and none was held. The Circuit Court, upon consideration of the parties\u2019 papers and the case law deemed applicable, issued a memorandum opinion and order granting Kass\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction, concluding that there was insufficient contact with the State of Maryland to sustain the exercise of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Kortobi pursued an appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. In a reported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, opining that Maryland does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>not have personal jurisdiction over a foreign estate based solely on the Maryland residence of the estate\u2019s personal representative. <em>Kortobi v. Kass, </em>182 Md.App. 424, 442-43, 957 A.2d 1128, 1138 (2008). We issued a writ of certiorari upon Kortobi\u2019s petition. <em>Kortobi v. Kass, </em>406 Md. 743, 962 A.2d 370 (2008).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction to determine whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss the action. <em>Bond v. Messerman, </em>391 Md. 706, 718-19, 895 A.2d 990, 998 (2006) (citing <em>Beyond Sys., Inc. v. Realtime Gaming Holding Co., </em>388 Md. 1, 29, 878 A.2d 567, 584 (2005); <em>Jason Pharms., Inc. v. Jianas Bros. Packaging Co., </em>94 Md.App. 425, 434, 617 A.2d 1125, 1129 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Kortobi does not dispute that the Leach Estate has no contacts with the State of Maryland and that all estate business performed by Kass on behalf of the Estate was performed in the District of Columbia. Rather, Kortobi pins his hopes on two statutory provisions which, he contends, subject Kass, in his capacity as personal representative, to jurisdiction in Maryland. Kortobi argues that the plain language of \u00a7 5-502(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article provides that a foreign personal representative may sue and be sued in Maryland. In addition, Kortobi contends that the personal service of Kass at his residence in Maryland gives the Circuit Court jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 6-102 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>A. Section 5-502(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The parties agree that Kass was viewed properly by the trial court, for purposes of Maryland law, as a foreign personal representative. Foreign personal representatives are the subject of Subtitle 5 of Title 5 of the Estates and Trusts Article. Section 5-502<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides specifically for the powers of foreign personal representatives, stating in subsection (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Any foreign personal representative may exercise in Maryland all powers of his office, and may sue and be sued in Maryland, subject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Kortobi argues that the plain language of \u00a7 5-502(a) endorses that Kass may \u201cbe sued in Maryland\u201d in his capacity as the personal representative of the Leach Estate. Kass retorts that the \u201csubject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents\u201d language of \u00a7 5-502(a) sweeps up Maryland\u2019s Long-Arm Statute, Md. Code (2006 Repl. Vol. &amp; Supp. 2008), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 6-103, and that, under Long-Arm Statute jurisprudence, the Leach Estate\u2019s contacts with Maryland are insufficient for jurisdiction to lie in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Our polar star in navigating the sometimes treacherous straits of statutory interpretation questions is to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 645, 943 A.2d 1260, 1264 (2008). Statutory construction \u201cbegins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613, 937 A.2d 242, 257 (2007) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005)). \u201cWhen construing a statute, we recognize that it \u2018should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 691, 861 A.2d 727, 732 (2004) (quoting <em>James v. Butler, </em>378 Md. 683, 696, 838 A.2d 1180, 1187 (2003); <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 757 (1993)). We will \u201cneither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003) (citing <em>County Council v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 417, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">If the plain language of the statute is unambiguous, \u201cthe inquiry as to legislative intent ends; we do not then need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (quoting <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 220, 817 A.2d 229, 233 (2003)). If, however, the meaning of the plain language is ambiguous or unclear, \u201cwe seek to discern legislative intent from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u201d <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998) (citing <em>Haupt v. State, </em>340 Md. 462, 471, 667 A.2d 179, 183 (1995)). \u201cWe have said that ambiguity exists within a statute when there are \u2018two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004) (quoting <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Application of the language of Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5-502(a) that \u201c[a]ny foreign personal representative may ... be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sued in Maryland, subject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents\u201d is neither plain nor clear to us when the foreign personal representative happens to be a Maryland resident. Thus, we turn to the legislative history of Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5-502(a) in a search for guidance as to legislative intent for application of the statutory provision in the particular situation before us in this case. Section 5-502 formerly was Maryland Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), Article 93,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u00a7 5-502.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The comment accompanying former \u00a7 5-502 in Article 93 is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">This Section adopts the basic theory of The Uniform Powers of Foreign Representatives Act. Its adoption supplants the rules in former \u00a7\u00a7 83-85. See Sykes, \u00a7\u00a7 471 through 473. The new statute also repeals \u00a7 87, which gave to District of Columbia personal representatives certain powers given to Maryland personal representatives. <em>The poivers of a District of Columbia or any foreign representative toill now be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in ivhich he was appointed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">(emphasis added). That comment suggests that the language \u201cof his office\u201d in \u00a7 5-502 should be interpreted as meaning that a foreign personal representative is bestowed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>same powers, capable of being exercised in Maryland, as he or she has in the jurisdiction in which he or she was appointed. Thus, the legislative scheme contemplates that the foreign personal representative\u2019s powers be determined according to the laws of the appointing jurisdiction, taking no consideration of the personal residence of the representative. Thus, we examine the laws of the District of Columbia that provide for the powers and authority of a personal representative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The powers and authority of a personal representative under District of Columbia law are provided in Title 20, Chapter 7 of the D.C.Code. Of particular relevance to the present case, D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-701(c) (LexisNexis 2009)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(c) Except as to proceedings which do not survive the death of the decedent, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in the District of Columbia at his death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this and any other jurisdiction as the decedent had immediately prior to death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Applying the laws of the District of Columbia in light of the instructive comment to former \u00a7 5-502, Kass, in his capacity as the personal representative of the Leach Estate, would have the same standing to \u201csue and be sued\u201d as Leach had immediately prior to his death. Therefore, for purposes of jurisdictional analysis under D.C. law, Kass stands in the shoes of Leach. The issue then becomes whether Kortobi could have sued Leach in Maryland for the injuries he allegedly suffered in the District of Columbia car accident. In other words, was Leach subject to personal jurisdiction in Maryland for the alleged tort prior to his death?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">A threshold issue we must address before turning to the personal jurisdiction analysis is the meaning of the language in Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5-502 that a foreign personal representative may be sued in Maryland \u201csubject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents.\u201d Kass argues that the language \u201csubject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents\u201d includes, among other things, the Maryland Long-Arm Statute, \u00a7 6-103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Kortobi does not dispute Kass\u2019 contention, arguing only that the plain language of Estates and Trusts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00a7 5-502 authorizes the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Kass in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The legislative history of the change in the law implemented by Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5-502 supports Kass\u2019 argument. As the comment accompanying former \u00a7 5-502 in Article 93 indicated, \u00a7 5-502 \u201cadopt[ed] the basic theory of The Uniform Powers of Foreign Representatives Act.\u201d That basic theory was that the revised statute now would give foreign personal representatives the power to sue in Maryland without having to open an ancillary administration. <em>See </em>Stiller &amp; Redden, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 104-06.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature, consistent with the Henderson Commission\u2019s recommendations, adopted former \u00a7 5-502 in Article 93 to revise the law so that it would be consistent with the approach taken in the Uniform Powers of Foreign Representatives Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The parallel section that former Article 93, \u00a7 5-502 drew upon in the Uniform Powers of Foreign Representatives Act was Section 2. That Section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">Section 2. <em>(Powers of Foreign Representative in General.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">When there is no administration or application therefor pending in this state, a foreign representative may exercise all powers which would exist in favor of a local representative, and may maintain actions and proceedings in this state subject to the conditions imposed upon nonresident suitors generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Banks McDowell, Jr., Foreign Personal Representatives 194 (1957) (quoting Handbook Of The Nat\u2019L Conference Of Comm\u2019rs On Unif. State Laws 325 (1944)). Notably, the Maryland Legislature\u2019s version of the powers of foreign personal representatives in \u00a7 5-502<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> departs from the version presented in the Uniform Act in a significant way\u2014the Legislature\u2019s version included the additional language (when enumerating the powers authorized) that the foreign personal representative may \u201cbe sued.\u201d While expanding this \u201cpower\u201d of foreign personal representatives via statute, the Legislature was careful to articulate the conditions qualifying its reach. The Legislature did not employ language similar to the Uniform Act\u2019s \u201csubject to the conditions imposed upon nonresident suitors generally.\u201d Rather, the Legislature\u2019s version employed the language \u201csubject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents,\u201d which, unlike the Uniform Act, does not contain a specific reference to the nonresident representative\u2019s role as a party in court proceedings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, \u201csubject to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>statute or rule relating to nonresidents\u201d could be interpreted to mean that \u201cany statute or rule relating to nonresidents\u201d should apply both to the situation in which the foreign representative is suing and the situation in which the personal representative is sued.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Given that the Maryland Legislature employed more general, non-party-specific language in the qualifying condition when expanding the \u201cpowers\u201d of a foreign representative to include the power to \u201cbe sued,\u201d we agree with Kass that the conditional \u201csubject to any statute or rule relating to nonresidents\u201d includes, among other things; the Maryland Long-Arm Statute,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">B. Sections 6-102 and -103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Personal Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Personal jurisdiction in Maryland is governed by, among other things, Md. Code, (2006 Repl. Vol. &amp; Supp. 2008), Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 6-102. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">(a) <em>Basis of personal </em>jurisdiction.\u2014A court may exercise personal jurisdiction as to any cause of action over a person domiciled in, served with process in, organized under the laws of, or who maintains his principal place of business in the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(b) <em>Exercise of jurisdiction on other </em>basis.\u2014This section does not limit any other basis of personal jurisdiction of a court of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Personal jurisdiction in Maryland over nonresident defendants is provided for in Maryland\u2019s Long-Arm Statute, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 6-103. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">(a) Condition.\u2014If jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon this section, he may be sued only on a cause of action arising from any act enumerated in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who directly or by an agent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(1) Transacts any business or performs any character of work or service in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(2) Contracts to supply goods, food, services, or manufactured products in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">(3) Causes tortious injury in the State by an act or omission in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(4) Causes tortious injury in the State or outside of the State by an act or omission outside the State if he regularly does or solicits business, engages in any other pertinent course of conduct in the State or derives substantial revenue from goods, food, services, or manufactured products used or consumed in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">(5) Has an interest in, uses, or possesses real property in the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">(6) Contracts to insure or act as surety for, or on, any person, property, risk, contract, obligation, or agreement located, executed, or to be performed with the State at the time the contract is made, unless the parties otherwise provide in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">In determining whether a Maryland court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant, we engage in a dual inquiry, considering if the exercise of jurisdiction (1) -15-is authorized under Maryland\u2019s Long-Arm Statute, Md.Code, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 6-103, and (2) comports with the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Beyond Sys., Inc., </em>388 Md. at 14-15, 878 A.2d at 575-76 (citations omitted). \u201cThe purview of the long <em>arm </em>statute is coextensive with the limits of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>jurisdiction set by the due process clause of the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 878 A.2d at 576. As a result, \u201cour statutory inquiry merges with our constitutional examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 878 A.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In order to pass constitutional muster under the Due Process Clause, a foreign defendant must have \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with Maryland, such that exercise of personal jurisdiction in Maryland \u201cdoes not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v.

While the \u201cnature\u201d of the defendant\u2019s contacts with Maryland are important, <em>see Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A v.

In any event, \u201c[t]o exercise either general or specific jurisdiction, the defendant must maintain sufficient minimum contacts with the forum such that the exercise of jurisdiction meets the \u2018general test of essential fairness'\u201d <em>Republic Props. Corp. v. Mission W. Props., LP, </em>391 Md. 732, 760, 895 A.2d 1006, 1022 (2006) (quoting <em>Presbyterian Univ. Hosp. v. Wilson, </em>337 Md. 541, 552, 654 A.2d 1324, 1330 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Kortobi, similar to his argument under Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5-502, contends that the plain language of Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 6-102 confers personal jurisdiction in Maryland over Kass because Kass resides in Maryland and was served with process at his residence. Kass responds that Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 6-102 does not apply in the present case because he was sued, and was served with process in that suit, in his capacity as a foreign personal representative. Kass maintains that the analysis of personal jurisdiction is dictated by Maryland\u2019s Long-Arm Statute, Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 6-103, and that, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Statute, neither Leach nor his Estate had the requisite contact with Maryland to satisfy the dual inquiry. We agree with Kass.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">As we noted previously, under Estates and Trusts \u00a7 5-502(a), Kass derives primarily the authority and powers \u201cof his office\u201d, i.e., as the personal representative of the Leach Estate, from the laws of the District of Columbia. Under D.C.Code \u00a7 20-701(c), Kass has the same standing to be sued in \u201c[Maryland] as [Leach] had immediately prior to death.\u201d In other words, under this statutory scheme, Kass stands in the shoes of Leach for purposes of personal jurisdiction, regardless of Kass\u2019 personal residency in Maryland. Thus, in suing Kass in his representative capacity as a foreign personal representative, Kortobi is suing a nonresident defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">That Kass\u2019 Maryland residency may not be deemed to confer personal jurisdiction over him in Maryland, in his representative capacity, under either Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 6-102 or under the theory of general jurisdiction, is supported directly by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Religious Technology Center v. Liebreich, </em>339 F.3d 369 (5th Cir.2003). In applying the Texas Long-Arm Statute, the Fifth Circuit reversed the federal district court\u2019s holding that personal jurisdiction over the representative of the Florida estate lies in Texas based on the personal representative\u2019s Texas residency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">Because the Texas Long Arm Statute is coextensive with the confines of due process, questions of personal jurisdiction in Texas are generally analyzed entirely within the framework of the Constitutional constraints of Due Process. <em>See Texas Long Arm Statute, Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 17.041 </em>(Vernon 2001) <em>et seq.; Gessmann v. Stephens, </em>51 S.W.3d 329, 335 (Tex.App.2001); <em>[Interfirst Bank Clifton </em>v.] <em>Fernandez, </em>844 F.2d [279] at 282 [(1988)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">However, exercising personal jurisdiction over an estate which is probated in a foreign district presents particular jurisdictional problems. Usually when a court exercises jurisdiction over either a foreign or domestic estate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>jurisdiction is <em>in </em>rem\u2014that is, the court has jurisdiction over the property itself. Here, however, there is no question that the district court lacked <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the Estate. Instead, the contention here is that Liebreich, as the personal representative of the Estate, created <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over the Estate. There are two ways in which Liebreich might have brought the Estate into the reach of the district court, and both avenues have' been presented to this Court. First, the district court found general jurisdiction over the Estate via Liebreich. Morever, RTC argues that Liebreich created specific jurisdiction over the Estate. However, neither general nor specific jurisdiction existed over the Estate....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">The district court correctly found that it had general jurisdiction over Liebreich as a resident of Texas. However, the district court impermissibly imputed that general personal jurisdiction to the Estate. The district court stated, \u201cthere can be no doubt that as a resident of the State of Texas, Ms. Liebreich has had sufficient contacts with the state to confer general jurisdiction over her in this matter, both in her individual and representative capacities.\u201d Thus, the district court concluded that the general jurisdiction which a Texas court has over a Texas resident applies equally to a foreign estate whose representative lives in Texas. However, the district court is in error on this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">General jurisdiction exists where a \u201cdefendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state are substantial and continuous and systematic but unrelated to the instant cause of action.\u201d <em>Central Freight Lines, </em>322 F.3d [376] at 381 [(2003)] (internal quotations omitted); <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984). The residency of a defendant in the forum state routinely creates such systematic and continuous contact. In the instate case, however, the defendant in question is not a resident of Texas. As a creature of the Florida probate regime, the Estate resides in Florida. Thus, for an estate probated in a foreign jurisdiction to establish the type of continuous and systematic contact necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>general jurisdiction, the representative of the Estate must have made those contacts in her representative capacity, on behalf of the Estate. It is not sufficient that the personal representative herself lives in Texas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Religious Tech. Ctr., </em>339 F.3d at 373-74. In accordance with <em>Religious Technology Center, </em>we conclude that, in suing Kass in his capacity as personal representative of the Leach Estate, Kortobi sued a nonresident defendant, and therefore Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 6-102 does not apply. Thus, personal jurisdiction over Kass, as a foreign personal representative, may lie in Maryland only under the Maryland Long-Arm Statute, Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 6-103 (consistent with due process requirements).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The only contacts with Maryland upon which Kortobi relies are Kass\u2019 personal residence in Maryland, and his being served with process there. Having rejected Kortobi\u2019s claim that these fortuitous circumstances are sufficient for personal jurisdiction to lie in Maryland under \u00a7 6-102, we likewise find that there are insufficient contacts for jurisdiction under Maryland\u2019s Long-Arm Statute, \u00a7 6-103. The record is devoid of any evidence that either Leach, or Kass acting on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Estate, established minimum contacts with Maryland, or that either purposefully availed himself of its laws. We reiterate that: (1) Leach was domiciled in the District of Columbia; (2) all of his assets, both real and personal, were located in the District of Columbia; (3) the beneficiaries of the Estate are residents of the District of Columbia; and (4) the motor vehicle accident giving rise to the present dispute occurred in the District of Columbia. There is simply no basis from which to conclude that jurisdiction lies in Maryland over the Leach Estate for the purposes of Kortobi\u2019s motor tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\">.

The requirement that a foreign personal representative take out letters in Maryland was generally based on four theories: (1) foreign personal representatives have no power to sue or otherwise to act in Maryland without first obtaining authority from a Maryland court; (2) local creditors will be protected by being afforded an opportunity to file claims against the Maryland estate when the Maryland letters are obtained; (3) letters should be obtained to enable the foreign personal representative to deal with Maryland real estate!; 1 and (4) letters should be obtained to afford the Maryland taxing authorities a belter opportunity to collect Maryland death taxes due with respect to Maryland assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Stiller &amp; Redden, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 104 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\">.

Section 5-501 of new Article 93 states that \"a foreign personal representative shall not be required to take out letters in Maryland for any purpose.\u201d Section 5-502 sets forth the rule that: \"Any foreign personal representative may exercise in Maryland all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>powers of his office, and may sue and be sued in Maryland, subject to any statute or rule relating to non-residents.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Stiller &amp; Redden, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\">.
