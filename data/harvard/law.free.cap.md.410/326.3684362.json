Supplying an answer to this admittedly unphilosophical question is our task in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Maryland Code (2007 Repl.Vol.), Environment Article, \u00a7 3-401(c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in relevant part, limits the authority of the Maryland Department of the Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d) to adopt \u201cnoise control rules and regulations [that] ... prohibit trapshooting, skeetshooting, or other target shooting between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m.\u201d in certain counties. In 2005, the General Assembly added paragraph (6) to \u00a7 3-401(c), exempting from such regulations \u201cshooting sports clubs\u201d in Allegany, Anne Arundel, Garrett, and Washington counties, provided the clubs were \u201cchartered and in operation as of January 1, 2005.\u201d The Legislature, however, created an exclusion to the exemption, allowing MDE to continue enforcing noise control regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>on clubs that the agency \u201cdetermines were not in compliance [with existing MDE regulations] as of January 1, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Petitioner, Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. (\u201cLonaconing\u201d), is a shooting sports club in Allegany County that has existed as such for over 40 years. As of 1 January 2005, however, it was determined not to be compliant with an existing MDE noise regulation prohibiting human-initiated activity that causes sounds greater than 60 decibels to be heard on adjacent residential property during daylight hours.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lonaconing here challenges a judgment of the Circuit Court for Allegany County enjoining the club from trapshooting on its property until it complies with that regulation. The club claims that \u00a7 3-401 (c)(6) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by distinguishing arbitrarily between shooting sports clubs in different counties and by discriminating arbitrarily against clubs that MDE determines were not compliant with the agency\u2019s regulations as of 1 January 2005. For reasons we shall explain, we hold that \u00a7 3-401(c)(6) does not run afoul of the club\u2019s Federal or State constitutional rights to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Lonaconing operates on a 2.8 acre lot on Water Station Road in a rural area of Allegany County. Its property has been used in some capacity as a shooting range since the 1930s. Lonaconing, formed in 1968, began a summer shooting league in 1970; the club incorporated in 1972. According to the record, it has approximately eighty members, 30 of whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>participate in a shooting league at the club. Lonaconing\u2019s shooting schedule has remained more or less the same since 1968. During its twenty-two week annual shooting season, lasting from April to September, club members engage in trapshooting<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. and Saturdays from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">MDE is the State agency responsible for enforcing, among other things, environmental noise standards, sound level limits, and noise control rules.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 2003, Frances Nolan and Patricia Russell, whose residences are on properties adjacent to Lonaconing\u2019s, complained to MDE about the noise generated by Lonaconing\u2019s shooting activities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In April 2003, pursuant to the complaints, David Jarinko, the agency\u2019s noise control and acoustic enforcement specialist, conducted tests to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>measure the sound levels heard on Nolan\u2019s property during Lonaconing\u2019s regularly scheduled shooting activities. Measuring from her property boundary (which is approximately 300 feet from Lonaconing\u2019s firing line) for a duration of fifteen minutes, Jarinko determined that the received gunshot sounds generally were eighty decibels or higher. MDE regulations prohibit sounds that register higher than 60 decibels on adjoining residential property. Approximately two months later, Jarinko\u2019s supervisor, George Harman, conducted additional sound measurements with comparable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Harman visited with Lonaconing\u2019s leadership on 26 June 2003 and presented the agency\u2019s test results to the club\u2019s President, Edward Evans. Harman explained that Lonaconing\u2019s shooting activities exceeded the permitted decibel limitation and that the club was subject potentially to fines. Following the meeting, Harman sent a letter, dated 27 June 2003, to Evans conveying MDE\u2019s desire to work with the club towards an amiable solution. Lonaconing continued its shooting activities, prompting more complaints to MDE from Nolan and Russell. Over the next year and a half, MDE and Lonaconing attempted to resolve the matter, but were unable to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, on 10 November 2004, Harman sent another letter to Evans reiterating that Lonaconing was exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>permitted decibel limitations and informing him that the club had until 29 November 2004 to achieve compliance or submit a plan for becoming compliant. The letter further warned that MDE would initiate an enforcement action against Lonaconing if any shooting activity occurred on club property after 29 November 2004, unless the club had an MDE-approved plan for compliance. Presumably due to Harman\u2019s letter, Lonaconing ceased its shooting activities in December 2004. In March 2005, Harman sent yet another letter to Evans, reiterating MDE\u2019s willingness to work with Lonaconing to develop a plan for compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Meanwhile, during the 2005 legislative session in Annapolis, the General Assembly enacted chapter 394, 2005 Md. Laws 1834-37, which, in main part, exempted existing shooting sports clubs in Allegany, Anne Arundel, Garrett, and Washington counties from noise control regulations prohibiting trapshooting and other forms of target shooting. The General Assembly, however, chose not to extend the exemption to clubs that MDE determined were not \u201cin compliance\u201d as of 1 January 2005 with existing MDE regulations. Chapter 394, 2005 Md. Laws 1834-37, is codified as \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In April 2005, Lonaconing resumed its regularly scheduled shooting activities. One month later, MDE conducted additional sound measurements on the Nolan and Russell properties. Each test yielded results exceeding 80 decibels. That same day, the agency initiated against Lonaconing an action in the Circuit Court for Allegany County, seeking civil penalties and an injunction prohibiting Lonaconing from engaging in shooting activities on its property until it complied with the 60 decibel limitation established in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">At the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, Dr. George Lutz testified for MDE as an expert witness in the fields of psychology and sound management. Dr. Lutz stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>authored the noise control guidelines adopted by the U.S. Army for its small arms ranges. He explained that variables affecting the measured/perceived sound of gunfire (such as temperature, humidity, wind, and barometric pressure) are negligible at a distance as small as four hundred feet. Thus, in his opinion, the sounds of gunshots emanating from Lonaconing\u2019s property consistently will generate sound levels greater than eighty decibels on Nolan\u2019s and Russell\u2019s properties.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Lonaconing denied that its shooting activities exceed the permitted decibel level, averring that COMAR fails to provide a standard for measuring decibel levels. The club also made two alternative arguments. First, it claimed that it need not comply with existing MDE regulations, in any event, because the recently enacted addition of \u00a7 3-401(c)(6) abrogated them and required MDE to promulgate new, prospective regulations, something MDE did not do. Second, the club asserted that \u00a7 3\u2014401 (c)(6)(ii) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by distinguishing arbitrarily between shooting sports clubs in different counties and by discriminating against clubs that the MDE determines were not compliant with the agency\u2019s regulations as of 1 January 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On 27 January 2006, the Circuit Court rendered an opinion and order fining Lonaconing $1,000 for the recorded violations on 26 May 2005, and enjoining it from further shooting activities on its property until it \u201cbecome[s] compliant with sound level limits and noise control rules and regulations of this State.\u201d The court found that Lonaconing \u201cexceeded permissible noise levels while conducting its skeet [sic]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>shooting activities,\u201d noting that MDE employed the same instruments and methodology that it uses when investigating other noise complaints and that the results obtained were consistent with the sound levels generally produced by gunshots fired at the distances at issue. The court rejected Lonaconing\u2019s argument that there is no standard governing the measurement of sound levels, reasoning that COMAR provides the applicable standard by setting \u201c60 dbA\u201d as the maximum sound level permitted on residential property, and observing that \u201cdbA\u201d is defined as \u201can abbreviation for the sound level in decibels determined by [the] A-weighting network of a sound level meter or by calculation from octave band or one-third octave band data.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the measurements taken by Jarinko and Harman were A-weighted, the court held that they complied with the standard mandated by CO-MAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Circuit Court also rejected Lonaconing\u2019s argument that \u00a7 3\u2014401 (c)(6)(ii) required MDE to promulgate new, prospective regulations after 1 January 2005 to govern sound levels produced by the club\u2019s shooting activities. According to the court, a shooting sports club\u2019s compliance with existing regulations may be determined only by reference to pre-existing, continuing regulations. Thus, the court reasoned that determining non-compliance based on the existing regulations, while requiring a new set of regulations to pursue enforcement against a non-compliant club, would be an absurd interpretation \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6)(ii). With respect to Lonaconing\u2019s equal protection challenge, the court held that the club failed to show that the distinctions complained of were arbitrary or irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Lonaconing noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the trial court judgment in an unreported opinion. This Court granted the club\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to consider the following: (1) Whether adoption of \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6)(ii) required MDE to adopt new, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>prospective noise control regulations in order to prohibit shooting activity by clubs that the agency deems not compliant as of 1 January 2005 with pre-existing regulations? and, (2) Whether \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6)(ii) violates the equal protection guarantees of the Federal and State constitutions? <em>Lonaconing Trap Club, Inc. v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t, </em>406 Md. 743, 962 A.2d 370 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3-401(a), MDE \u201cshall adopt environmental noise standards, sound level limits, and noise control rules and regulations as necessary to protect the public health, the general welfare, and property.\u201d In delegating this authority to MDE, the Legislature limited the agency\u2019s power to prohibit certain \u201cshooting sport\u201d activities in enumerated counties. Before the 2005 legislative session, the General Assembly did so in \u00a7 3-401(c)(5). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">(i) The sound level limits and noise control rules and regulations adopted under this subsection may not prohibit trapshooting, skeetshooting, or other target shooting between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. on any range or other property of a shooting sports club that is chartered and in operation as of January 1, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">(ii) This paragraph does not apply in Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore City, Calvert, Charles, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery, St. Mary\u2019s and Washington Counties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Pursuant to its statutory grant of authority, MDE promulgated several regulations establishing sound limits, including COMAR 26.02.03.03(A)(3), which prohibits \u201cthe emission of prominent discrete tones and periodic noises\u201d that exceed 60 decibels on receiving residential property during daytime hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">In 2005, the Legislature added \u00a7 3-401 (c)(6) to the Environment Article, exempting from MDE noise regulations shooting sports clubs in certain counties not exempted previously by \u00a7 3-401(c)(5). The new section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>(6)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, [MDE] may not adopt sound level limits and noise control rules and regulations under this subsection that prohibit trapshooting, skeetshooting, or other target shooting between the house of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. in Allegany County, Anne Arundel County, Garrett County, or Washington County on any range or other property of a shooting sports club that is chartered and in operation as of January 1, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">(ii)l. Subject to the provisions of subsubparagraph 2 of this subparagraph, [MDE] may adopt sound level limits and noise control rules and regulations under this subsection that prohibit trapshooting, skeetshooting, or other target shooting between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. in Allegany County, Anne Arundel County, Garrett County, or Washington County on any range or other property of a shooting club that [MDE] determines is not in compliance as of January 1, 2005 with environmental noise standards, sound level limits, or noise control rules and regulations adopted under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">2. A sound level limit or noise control rule or regulation adopted under this subsection shall allow trapshooting, skeetshooting, and other target shooting between the hours of 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. by a shooting sports club that [MDE] determines has become compliant with sound level limits and noise control rules and regulations adopted under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Lonaconing asserts that the MDE regulations in existence bn and before 1 January 2005, with which the Circuit Court directed the club to comply, no longer applied to the club after 1 January 2005. It contends that, by enacting \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(ii) 1 in 2005, which provides that MDE \u201cmay adopt\u201d noise control regulations, the General Assembly intended to abrogate the earlier noise control regulations. This is not a fair reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>Ed. v. Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 214, 973 A.2d 233, 241 (2009) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005)). This Court reads the statute as a whole to ensure that none of its provisions are rendered meaningless. <em>Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Guar. Corp. v. Yanni, </em>397 Md. 474, 481, 919 A.2d 1, 5 (2007). \u201c \u2018[We] neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the statute; nor [do we] construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ambrose, </em>403 Md. 425, 439, 942 A.2d 755, 763 (2008) (quoting <em>Kushell, </em>385 Md. at 576-77, 870 A.2d at 193). Additionally, \u201c \u2018[w]e avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. at 215, 973 A.2d at 242 (quoting <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 573, 911 A.2d 427, 432 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The interpretation of \u00a7 3-401 (c)(6)(h) 1 advanced by Lonaconing is unreasonable for at least two reasons. First, through \u00a7 3-401(a), the General Assembly granted MDE the power to \u201cadopt environmental noise standards, sound limits, and noise control rules and regulations.\u201d Thus, because MDE\u2019s power to promulgate noise control regulations stems from \u00a7 3-401(a), which existed prior to the Legislature\u2019s adoption of \u00a7 3-401(c)(6), the latter section is viewed properly as a new limitation on MDE\u2019s already existing rulemaking authority. The 2005 statute is not, as Lonaconing suggests, a wholly new grant of authority that requires MDE to promulgate new regulations in order to exercise its enforcement power. Second, it would be illogical for the General Assembly to demand that MDE re-enact its noise control regulations (or enact different regulations), when the agency\u2019s regulations existing as of 1 January 2005 provide the standard for determining a club\u2019s non-compliant status.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the 60 decibel sound limit required by MDE regulation prior to and on 1 January 2005 continues to apply to shooting sports clubs, such as Lonacon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ing, that are excluded from \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(i)\u2019s general exemption for existing clubs in the applicable counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Lonaconing places most of its emphasis on its argument that \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(ii) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It contends that there is no rational basis for \u201callowing ... trapshooting in the majority of the State, or indeed everywhere else in Allegany County except the [Lonaconing] range, but prohibiting [Lonaconing] from operating as it had for over thirty years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 932 A.2d 571 (2007),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> this Court reiterated the three general standards that courts employ when analyzing equal protection challenges. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201c[T]he top tier of [constitutional] review contemplates that when a statute creates a distinction based upon clearly \u2018suspect\u2019 criteria, or when that enactment infringes upon personal rights or interests deemed to be \u2018fundamental,\u2019 then the legislative product must withstand a rigorous, \u2018strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d When utilizing this most-demanding standard of constitutional review, we deem unconstitutional a challenged legislative classification unless the distinction formed by it is \u201cnecessary to promote a compelling government interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">In contrast, we generally employ the least exacting and most deferential standard of constitutional review when the legislative action under review neither interferes significantly with a fundamental right nor implicates a suspect classification. Under this \u201crational basis\u201d level of scrutiny, the classification will pass constitutional muster so long as it is \u201crationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d In other words, we will uphold the statute under rational basis review \u201cunless the varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that [the court] can only conclude that the [governmental] actions were irrational.\u201d Statutes reviewed pursuant to this level of scrutiny are presumed constitutional, \u201cand will be invalidated only if the classification is clearly arbitrary.\u201d \u201c[A] classification [subject to rational basis review] having some reasonable basis need not be made with mathematical nicety and may result in some inequality\u201d so long as the state can produce any conceivable \u201cstate of facts\u201d to justify the distinction. A statute subject to rational review often passes constitutional muster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">A third level of review has arisen to leaven the rigid two-tiered constitutional framework by which courts review the constitutionality of government action. A \u201cheightened\u201d level of scrutiny, otherwise known as \u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d is triggered when the challenged action creates a classification \u201cwhich ha[s] been subjected to a higher degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>scrutiny than the traditional and deferential rational basis test, but which ha[s] not [yet] been deemed to involve suspect classes or fundamental rights.\u201d This middle-tier scrutiny may be implicated to review a \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d classification. In order to survive this intermediate level of scrutiny, the statute in question \u201cmust serve important government objectives and must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><em>Deane, </em>401 Md. at 272-77, 932 A.2d at 603-05 (first alteration added, internal citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Lonaconing concedes that strict scrutiny does not apply here; however, it is unwilling to yield the intermediate scrutiny ground without a fight. To advance its argument for the intermediate scrutiny standard of review, the club argues that it \u201cand its members are prevented from engaging in an otherwise protected and lawful activity, interfering with their liberty interests and economic freedoms, while others similarly situated have no such statutory or regulatory restrictions.\u201d This argument is not convincing. Lonaconing does not suggest that shooting sports clubs deemed non-compliant with MDE regulations constitute a suspect or quasi-suspect class. Nor does it contend that classifications based on political subdivisions are suspect or quasi-suspect. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Armacost, </em>299 Md. 392, 409, 474 A.2d 191, 199 (1984) (\u201cIn reviewing statutory distinctions based on territory, the rational basis test applies because no fundamental right or suspect class is affected.\u201d). Additionally, while this Court has indicated its willingness to apply intermediate or heightened scrutiny when reviewing \u201cstatutes ... which affect \u2018important\u2019 personal interests or work a \u2018significant interference with liberty or a denial of a benefit vital to the individual,\u2019 \u201d <em>see Atty. Gen. of Md. v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 711, 426 A.2d 929, 944 (1981) (quoting Lawrence Tribe, American Constitutional Law 16-3 (1978)), Lonaconing does not explain how its sport shooting qualifies as such a liberty interest or vital benefit. Without an articulated basis for doing so, we shall not apply a heightened standard of review. Thus, rational basis review is the appropriate standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number> \u201cUnder the rational basis test, a statutory classification enjoys a strong presumption of constitutionality,\u201d <em>Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 409, 474 A.2d at 200, and \u201cwill not be held void if there are any considerations relating to the public welfare by which it can be supported,\u201d <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 48, 300 A.2d 367, 378 (1973). Thus, \u201c[i]t is not necessary [for a reviewing court] to identify the reasons that actually prompted the General Assembly to legislate as it did.\u201d <em>Md. Aggregates Ass\u2019n v.

Nor has the State demonstrated how an important government objective of sound or noise control is substantially advanced by limiting trapshooting in one rural area of a largely rural county while allowing it unabated throughout the rest of that county and the majority of the State\u2019s political subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">MDE has simply relied on the latitude afforded by the legislature\u2019s prerogative to create such territorial distinctions without offering any rational basis for such a prerogative, and the Court of Special Appeals has abrogated any responsibility to assess the rationality of the subject classifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>cation under legitimate rational basis or intermediate scrutiny analysis. MDE has presented no evidence of a statutory history reflecting a valid basis for this distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">This argument misunderstands the burden under rational basis review. Our cases make clear that Lonaconing must establish \u00a7 3-405(c)(6)\u2019s irrationality,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> something it fails to do on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The club claims that the statute violates equal protection guarantees in two ways. First, it asserts that \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(h) distinguishes arbitrarily between counties with respect to application of sub-subparagraph 1, denying the general exemption (from noise control regulations) to clubs deemed non-compliant as of 1 January 2005. In doing so, the club points out that, under \u00a7 3-401(c)(5), similarly situated clubs in most political subdivisions of the State do not have their ability to evade application of noise control regulations determined based on that benchmark. This argument shall not carry the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Territorial classifications generally are permissible under equal protection analysis. <em>See Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 409, 474 A.2d at 191. The territorial distinction here is no different.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[a] state legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>lature may itself determine [matters related to the public welfare] for each of its local subdivisions, having in mind the needs of each. Territorial uniformity is not a constitutional requisite.\u201d <em>Salsburg v. Maryland, </em>346 U.S. 545, 552, 74 S.Ct. 280, 284, 98 L.Ed. 281, 288 (1954) (upholding statute that limited, in certain counties, the application of the Exclusionary Rule for evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment) <footnotemark>19</footnotemark>; <em>see also Supermarkets Gen\u2019l Corp. v. State, </em>286 Md. 611, 622, 409 A.2d 250, 256 (1979) (upholding statute that required retail stores in certain counties to close on Sundays). Here, the relevant statutory history reflects that the Allegany County delegation in the Maryland House of Delegates unanimously supported House Bill 756, which became \u00a7 3-401(c)(6). Moreover, the State Senator representing Allegany, Garrett, and Washington counties sponsored the Senate version of the bill, Senate Bill 685, and the Allegany County Board of Commissioners unanimously endorsed the Senate bill. The Board of Commissioners also sent a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs, urging that committee to support the bill as well. Thus, on the record before us, the General Assembly\u2019s passage of \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6) is related rationally to its legitimate interest in promoting local preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Second, Lonaconing maintains that denying the general exemption to clubs, within Allegany County (or any other county covered by \u00a7 3\u2014401 (c)(6)), deemed not in compliance with existing regulations creates an unconstitutional classification because other clubs in the county, which were not deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>non-compliant, now may produce with impunity gunshot sounds that register, on neighboring residential properties, the same as or louder than the sounds generated by Lonaconing\u2019s shooting activities, while Lonaconing must develop (and pay for) a means of reducing the sounds produced by its activities. This argument also is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u201cUnderinclusiveness does not create an equal protection violation under the rational basis test.\u201d <em>Armacost, </em>299 Md. at 409, 474 A.2d at 199. The constitution does not demand that the Legislature \u201c \u2018strike at all evils at the same time or in the same way.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 466, 101 S.Ct. 715, 725, 66 L.Ed.2d 659, 670 (1981) (quoting <em>Semler v. Or. Bd. of Dental Examiners, </em>294 U.S. 608, 610, 55 S.Ct. 570, 571, 79 L.Ed. 1086, 1089 (1935)). To be sure, the General Assembly has a legitimate interest in protecting the citizenry of the counties covered by \u00a7 3-401(c)(6) from offensive or dangerous levels of noise. While \u00a7 8\u2014401(c)(6)(ii) does not eliminate all gunshot noise louder than 60 decibels on residential property, it allows shooting sports clubs to operate without noise limitations only if they already were not generating offensive or dangerous levels of noise. The Legislature may have presumed that residents, unhappy with current levels of noise, would have contacted MDE previously about suspected violations, causing MDE to deem any such club to be non-compliant. Thus, even though the statute exempts most clubs from noise regulation prohibiting sport shooting, \u00a7 3\u2014401 (c)(6)(ii) nonetheless advances the legitimate government objective of protecting the citizenry from undue noise. At the same time, \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(i)\u2019s exemption for most existing clubs advances the legitimate State interest in promoting the reasonable expectations of clubs that were complying with existing regulations as of 1 January 2005, by protecting those clubs from increased regulation. <em>See Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 13, 112 S.Ct. 2326, 2333, 120 L.Ed.2d 1, 14 (1992) (recognizing legitimate government interest in protecting \u201creasonable reliance interests\u201d through a property tax system that taxed older homes at a lower rate than new or recently purchased homes). A club, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>such as Lonaconing, that was not in compliance as of that date patently has not relied on the pre-existing and continuing MDE noise control regulations. Additionally, the dichotomy created by \u00a7 3-401 (c)(6) simply may reflect the Legislature\u2019s desire to protect the citizenry from undue noise, balanced against its interest in saving the costs associated with continuing to regulate clubs that have not proven themselves to be a source of undue noise in their respective communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">As evidence that \u00a7 3^01(c)(6)(ii) is not related rationally to a legitimate government objective, however, Lonaconing relies principally on a Fiscal and Policy Note prepared by the Department of Legislative Services regarding House Bill 756, which provides that the purpose of \u00a7 3-401(c)(6) is to prevent existing shooting sports clubs from being \u201cforced out of business\u201d by increased regulation stemming from citizens\u2019 noise complaints. Thus, so Lonaconing\u2019s argument proceeds, its exclusion (based on its non-compliant status), from \u00a7 3-401 (c)(6)(i)\u2019s general exemption for other existing clubs, is not related rationally to the statute\u2019s stated objective because Lonaconing effectively is being forced out of business by Nolan\u2019s and Russell\u2019s complaints to MDE. Lonaconing\u2019s logical leap is flawed. As stated, the Fiscal and Policy Note reveals the Legislature\u2019s concern over subjecting existing clubs to <em>increased </em>regulation. Yet, \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6)(ii), as written and applied, excludes only clubs that were deemed non-compliant with <em>existing </em>regulations. MDE has not sought to subject Lonaconing to more numerous or more stringent noise control regulations than what Lonaconing (and every other existing shooting sports club in the applicable counties) was subject to before the Legislature adopted \u00a7 3-401 (c)(6) in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Lonaconing also emphasizes that it is the only shooting sports club affected by \u00a7 8\u2014401(c)(6)(ii)\u2019s exclusion of clubs deemed non-compliant as of 1 January 2005. This, however, is not significant in and of itself, even if true. <em>See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073, 1074 145 L.Ed.2d 1060, 1063 (2000) (noting that \u201cthe number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>individuals in a class is immaterial for equal protection analysis\u201d). For Lonaconing to succeed on its equal protection challenge as a \u201cclass of one,\u201d it \u201cmust show that (l)[it] was treated differently from others similarly situated and (2) there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment.\u201d <em>See Stotter v. Univ. of Tex., </em>508 F.3d 812, 823 (5th Cir.2007). As stated previously, Lonaconing does not satisfy its burden to establish that \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6)(ii) is without a rational basis. Moreover, Lonaconing does not explain how it is treated differently from similarly-situated shooting sports clubs. Clubs opening in the counties governed by \u00a7 3\u2014401(c)(6) after 1 January 2005 likewise do not receive the benefit of \u00a7 3-401(c)(i)\u2019s general exemption from noise control regulation. Evidence adduced by MDE revealed that an existing club in Anne Arundel County was deemed not in compliance with existing noise control regulations, but since agreed to a plan of compliance with the agency.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Finally, Lonaconing suggests as evidence of irrationality that, if and when it becomes compliant with MDE\u2019s existing 60 decibel sound limitation for residential property, \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(ii)2 does not require it to maintain compliance with that limitation for any determinant period of time in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>gain the benefit of \u00a7 3-401(c)(6)(i)\u2019s general exemption from noise regulations. Thus, the club postulates that it is irrational to require it to become compliant in the first place. We disagree. As noted previously, the Legislature has legitimate interests in protecting existing clubs\u2019 reasonable reliance on existing MDE regulations, while ensuring that clubs are not shooting currently at sound levels found to be excessive by MDE. The statute advances those interests. Any problems that may develop in the future as a result of clubs (including Lonaconing, if and when it becomes compliant) escalating the noise that they produce, due to louder guns or deteriorating sound proofing structures, for example, are matters of legislative concern. The \u201cwisdom or expediency\u201d of the statute in its current form is not a matter for judicial intervention. <em>Salisbury, </em>268 Md. at 48, 300 A.2d at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">As we observed in <em>Supermarkets General Corp. v. State, </em>286 Md. 611, 629, 409 A.2d 250, 260 (1979), \u201c[some laws] have been characterized as unwise, complex, a patchwork, a crazy quilt, a labyrinth, a legal maze, unnecessarily befuddling statutory crabgrass, an inconvenience, a hypocrisy. But even were that so, those laws could not for those reasons be voided by the judiciary. As we have indicated, absent some constitutional infirmity the judiciary simply has no power to interfere.\u201d Lonaconing\u2019s suggestion that \u00a7 3-401(c)(6) reveals a \u201ctangled web of statutory history\u201d may be an accurate assessment, but that is not something this court need opine here.

We also resolve that Lonaconing did not satisfy its burden to establish that the regulatory scheme is not related rationally to a legitimate government interest.

Nonetheless, the Court enumerated several factors to be considered in deciding whether a statute is a \u201cspecial law.\u201d The Court reiterated the importance of these factors in <em>State v. Good Samantan Hospital, </em>299 Md. 310, 473 A.2d 892 (1984). The factors include: whether \u201cthe underlying purpose of the legislation is to benefit or burden a particular class member or members\u201d; whether particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>people or entities are identified in the statute; and what \u201cthe substance and \u2018practical effect\u2019 \u201d of a statute is and not simply its form. <em>State v. Good Samaritan Hospital, supra, </em>299 Md. at 330, 473 A.2d at 902; <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, supra, </em>290 Md. at 569, 431 A.2d at 672-673. Our past decisions have also considered whether particular entities or individuals sought and obtained special advantages under the legislation or if other similar entities or individuals were discriminated against by the legislation. <em>Cities Service Co., supra, </em>290 Md. at 570, 431 A.2d at 673. In deciding whether a law violates \u00a7 33 in applying to only certain members of a class, we have looked to whether the statute\u2019s distinctions are arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, this Court has held that some enactments were not special laws even though they applied to only a single entity. Such laws are permissible where unique circumstances render the entity a class unto itself, <em>Cities Service Co., supra, </em>290 Md. at 568, 431 A.2d at 672, or where the enactment, although it affects only one entity currently, would apply to other similar entities in the future, <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 305-306, 380 A.2d 12 (1977); <em>Potomac Sand &amp; Gravel v. Governor, </em>266 Md. 358, 379, 293 A.2d 241 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 273-74, 554 A.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In the case at bar, the General Assembly has enacted a statute that provides for injunctive relief against Petitioner, and prohibits such relief against every similar entity in Allegany County. It is clear that the enactment at issue (1) has the practical effect of imposing a burden on no entity other than Petitioner, and (2) will <em>not </em>apply to other similar entities in the future. Under these circumstances, the injunction should be dissolved on the ground that it is based upon an unconstitutional \u201cspecial\u201d law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Moreover, while the General Assembly certainly has the right to enact statutes that allow (or require) the trial judge to impose an enhanced penalty for a second (or subsequent) conviction of driving while impaired by alcohol, and that provide for the imposition of \u201calcohol restrictions\u201d on motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ists who have been convicted of that offense, it would not be rational to conclude that the General Assembly also has the right to enact a statute under which the only persons who can henceforth be convicted of driving while impaired by alcohol are persons who (1) committed that offense in Allegany County, and (2) had previously been convicted of that offense prior to October 1, 2009. I would therefore hold that the enactment also fails the \u201crational basis\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge GREENE have authorized me to state that they join this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
