Like the result in numerous similar collateral order doctrine cases decided by this Court in recent years, the attempted appeal in this case will be unsuccessful.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The facts relating to the appealability issue in this case are not extensive. Most of the factual detail set forth in the briefs and record extract concern matters which we shall not reach, namely the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 asserted causes of action and the defenses advanced by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">This litigation began on October 13, 2006, when 16 former merit system employees of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the WSSC and certain officials of the WSSC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 16 plaintiffs had been employed in the Information Technology Department of the WSSC. The event giving rise to this lawsuit was the WSSC\u2019s \u201crestructuring\u201d of the Information Technology Department, whereby approximately 80 merit system positions in the Department, including the positions held by the 16 plaintiffs, were abolished, and new non-merit system positions were created.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The WSSC then terminated the employment of the 16 plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The plaintiffs alleged in the complaint that, \u201cafter abolishing the plaintiffs\u2019 positions, the WSSC spent millions of dollars on training the new, younger contract workers who replaced the plaintiffs.... \u201d The complaint went on to state that \u201cthe real purpose behind the abolishment ... was: (1) for defendant WSSC to avoid paying costly retirement benefits to the plaintiffs who were nearing retirement age; (2) and to unlawfully create a new class of WSSC workers outside of the protections of the merit system, where they could be hired and fired at will without the statutory protections that the WSSC workforce is entitled to under Art. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The complaint further alleged that most of the plaintiffs \u201cwould have been eligible for retirement within the next few years\u201d and that, because of their ages, most of the plaintiffs \u201chave been unable to find comparable employment elsewhere.\u201d The plaintiffs also asserted that WSSC violated its own procedures and regulations by not terminating \u201cthe least senior employee ... first\u201d and by failing to reemploy the plaintiffs \u201cin preference to any eligible person who is not an employee of the WSSC....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In addition to claiming that the WSSC violated its own procedures and regulations, the plaintiffs contended that the restructuring violated the merit system provisions applicable to WSSC and contained in Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol., 2008 Supp.), Article 29, \u00a7 11-102 <em>et seq. </em>The plaintiffs also claimed that the restructuring violated Article 29, \u00a7 lili 0, relating to layoffs by WSSC, violated the prohibition against age discrimination set forth in Article 29, \u00a7 1-107, and violated Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief restoring the plaintiffs to their former merit system employment. They did not seek monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">WSSC on January 3, 2007, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The principal ground for the motion was that \u201cthe lawsuit is barred by the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity.\u201d The motion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cAbolishing the ... positions Plaintiffs and others occupied was accomplished through a budgetary process spelled out by the Maryland General Assembly, and approved by WSSC\u2019s Commissioners, the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Budget and Management, and by the County Councils of Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery Counties. Eliminating public-sector jobs under these circumstances constitutes legislative activity to which the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity squarely applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">WSSC\u2019s motion also contended that the complaint failed to state a claim and that WSSC did not violate its own proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>dures and regulations. Attached to WSSC\u2019s motion were 45 exhibits, consisting of numerous governmental documents, minutes and agenda of meetings, affidavits by government officials, memoranda written by government personnel, and letters between government personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to WSSC\u2019s motion set forth in detail the reasons underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the restructuring violated WSSC\u2019s own procedures and regulations as well as Article 29 of the Maryland Code and Articles 19 and 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The plaintiffs\u2019 opposition also challenged the applicability of \u201clegislative immunity\u201d under the circumstances of this case. In addition, the plaintiffs disputed WSSC\u2019s assertion that the restructuring was approved by the County Councils of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">A Circuit Court hearing on WSSC\u2019s motion took place on June 1, 2007. After argument by counsel for each side, the Circuit Court orally denied WSSC\u2019s motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. On June 29, 2007, WSSC filed a notice of appeal from the June 1st oral ruling by the Circuit Court. Sometime thereafter, the plaintiffs filed in the Court of Special Appeals a motion to dismiss the interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In July 2007, WSSC filed in the Circuit Court a motion to stay all proceedings in the case while the appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals. The motion was prompted by earlier interrogatories and document requests served on WSSC. WSSC had not responded to those interrogatories and document requests. WSSC\u2019s motion indicated that its purpose was to stay all discovery during the pendency of the appeal. In addition, on July 23, 2007, the plaintiffs sent to the defendants\u2019 counsel a notice to take the deposition of one of the individual defendants. The Circuit Court on August 8, 2007, denied the motion for a stay pending appeal. Nevertheless, WSSC continued its refusal to comply with discovery requests, and the plaintiffs on August 22, 2007, filed a motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>On September 4, 2007, the Court of Special Appeals granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss WSSC\u2019s appeal on the ground that the June 1, 2009, ruling was not a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Two days later, on September 6, 2007, WSSC filed a notice of appeal from the Circuit Court\u2019s August 8th order denying the motion for a stay pending appeal. On the following day, September 7, 2007, WSSC filed in the Court of Special Appeals a \u201cMotion for Stay Pending Appeal.\u201d This motion was denied by the Court of Special Appeals on September 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Next, WSSC on October 15, 2007, filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cPetitioners seek review of the following two questions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">1. Are local government councils and commissions, such as the WSSC, entitled to absolute legislative immunity for a decision to restructure a department pursuant to the legislative budget review process set forth at Art. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 11-102 and 11-103?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">2. Do the top officials of a local commission have the right to appeal an interlocutory order denying their defense of absolute legislative immunity under the collateral order doctrine?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">This Court granted the certiorari petition on December 13, 2007. <em>WSSC v. Bowen, </em>402 Md. 355, 936 A.2d 852 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">We shall answer the certiorari petition\u2019s second issue in the negative and hold that the June 1, 2007, interlocutory ruling was not appealable. Consequently, we shall not express any opinion with regard to the first issue in the certiorari petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The exercise of appellate jurisdiction in Maryland is normally dependent upon a final judgment rendered by the trial court. <em>See, e.g., Hudson v. Housing Authority, </em>402 Md. 18, 24, 935 A.2d 395, 398 (2007)(\u201cThe general proposition in Maryland is that \u2018to be appealable an order or judgment ordinarily must be final\u2019 \u201d); <em>County Commissioners for St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>393 Md. 415, 424, 903 A.2d 378, 383-384 (2006)(\u201c0rdinarily, appellate review is available only after the entry of a final judgment where all claims against all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>parties are resolved. * * * The fundamental objective of this principle is \u2018to prevent piecemeal appeals and to prevent the interruptions of ongoing judicial proceedings\u2019 \u201d); <em>St Joseph\u2019s Medical Center, Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Associates P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 84, 896 A.2d 304, 309 (2006)(\u201cAs this Court has emphasized on numerous occasions, very recently by Judge Raker for the Court in <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 323, 884 A.2d 1215, 1219 (2005), \u2018[t]he general rule as to appeals is that, subject to a few, limited exceptions, a party may appeal only from a final judgment\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The \u201cexceptions\u201d to the final judgment principle were recently summarized in <em>St. Joseph\u2019s v. Cardiac Surgery, supra, </em>392 Md. at 84, 896 A.2d at 309:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cMoreover, under Maryland law, the \u2018few, limited exceptions\u2019 to the final judgment rule number only three. Judge Wilner for the Court in <em>Salvagno v. Frew, </em>388 Md. 605, 615, 881 A.2d 660, 666 (2005), explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u2018[W]e have made clear that the right to seek appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties, and that there are only three exceptions to that final judgment requirement: appeals from interlocutory orders specifically allowed by statute; immediate appeals permitted under Maryland Rule 2-602; and appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\"><em>See also St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, supra, </em>393 Md. at 424-425, 903 A.2d at 383-384.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">It is undisputed that the Circuit Court\u2019s June 1, 2007, riding denying WSSC\u2019s immunity defense was not a final judgment, was not an appealable interlocutory order under any statute, and was not appealable under Maryland Rule 2-602. The issue, as pointed out in the beginning of this opinion, is whether the ruling was appealable under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">This Court, in numerous opinions, has described and delineated the requirements of the collateral order doctrine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>For example, Judge Harrell for the Court, in <em>St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, supra, </em>393 Md. at 428, 903 A.2d at 386, explained the collateral order doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201cThis doctrine treats a \u2018narrow class\u2019 of interlocutory orders as final judgments regardless of the posture of the case. <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 326, 783 A.2d 673, 685 (2001); <em>Harris v. David S. Harris, P.A., </em>310 Md. 310, 315, 529 A.2d 356, 358 (1987). This reprieve from the final judgment requirement, however, is a \u2018very narrow exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pittsburgh Corning v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, 660, 728 A.2d 210, 211 (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cThe collateral order doctrine permits an appeal from an order that satisfies the following four requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">(1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">(2) it must resolve an important issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">(3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">(4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Moreover, the \u201c \u2018four elements of the test are conjunctive in nature and in order ... to fall within this exception to the ordinary operation of the final judgment requirement, each of the four elements must be met.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 563, 914 A.2d 783, 792 (2007), quoting <em>In Re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 327, 783 A.2d 673, 686 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">In <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>376 Md. 53, 64, 827 A.2d 115, 121 (2003), we characterized the collateral order doctrine as follows (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">\u201cThe collateral order doctrine is based upon a judicially created fiction, under which certain interlocutory orders are considered to be final judgments, even though such orders clearly are <em>not </em>final judgments. The justification for the fiction is a perceived necessity, in \u2018a very few ... extraordinary situations,\u2019 for immediate appellate review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Time after time, this Court\u2019s opinions have emphasized that the collateral order doctrine is extremely narrow and that it is applicable only under extraordinary circumstances. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Hudson v. Housing Authority, supra, </em>402 Md. at 25, 935 A.2d at 399 (The doctrine encompasses \u201ca \u2018narrow\u2019 class of interlocutory orders in \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d); <em>St. Joseph\u2019s v. Cardiac Surgery, supra, </em>392 Md. at 85, 896 A.2d at 310 (The doctrine applies \u201cunder extremely limited circumstances\u201d); <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, supra, </em>389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223 (\u201cThe collateral order doctrine is a very narrow exception to the final judgment rule, and each of its four requirements is very staidly applied in Maryland. * * * [It is inapplicable if the] case does not present an extraordinary situation\u201d); <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587, 591, <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 948, 124 S.Ct. 398, 157 L.Ed.2d 279 (2003)(\u201c[T]he doctrine may be entertained only in extraordinary circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The interlocutory ruling, from which the appeal in the case at bar was taken, was the Circuit Court\u2019s June 1, 2007, oral ruling denying the defendants\u2019 claim of immunity from suit. We shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that the first three requirements of the collateral order doctrine were satisfied. The issue debated by the parties, and the issue that we shall focus upon, is whether the fourth requirement of the doctrine was met, namely whether the ruling denying the immunity claim would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The issue of WSSC\u2019s claimed immunity from an adverse judgment would clearly be reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. If a final judgment is entered against WSSC, and if WSSC is actually immune from suit under the circumstances, the judgment will be reversed on appeal and the trial court will be directed to dismiss the action. Consequently, in this respect, the fourth requirement of the collateral order doctrine is obviously not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Nonetheless, WSSC argues that one aspect of immunity is to \u201cinsulate\u201d the defendants \u201cagainst the rigors of defending a lawsuit\u201d and that this aspect of \u201cimmunity is effectively unreviewable if the appeal must await the entry of final judgment . .. . \u201d (WSSC\u2019s opening brief at 32, 33.) This \u201cavoidance of trial\u201d argument is the same argument that has been made in all other cases in this Court involving attempted appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>from interlocutory trial court orders denying immunity claims. <em>See Dawkins v. Baltimore Police, supra, </em>376 Md. at 60-65, 827 A.2d at 119-122, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The Court in the <em>Dawkins </em>opinion, quoting <em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. 472, 540 A.2d 805 (1988), pointed to the major problem with the \u201cavoidance of trial\u201d contention (Dawkins, 376 Md. at 60-61, 827 A.2d at 119):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cThe <em>Bunting </em>opinion, 312 Md. at 479-480, 540 A.2d at 808, went on to point out that a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u2018difficulty with the defendant\u2019s argument is that numerous \u201crights\u201d can readily be characterized as entitling a party to avoid trial under some circumstances. For example, the \u201cright\u201d to summary judgment might be characterized as a light not to stand trial unless the opposing party has created a genuine issue of material fact. Similarly, the statute of limitations might be characterized as granting a defendant a right not to be tried out of time. <em>See Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 550-551, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2828-2829, 86 L.Ed.2d 411, 441 (1985) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). If all \u201crights\u201d which could be characterized in this manner were treated like the right against double jeopardy, the collateral order doctrine would largely erode the final judgment rule. Consequently, it is important that we narrowly construe the notion of an entitlement not to be sued or prosecuted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201cThe Court in <em>Bunting </em>concluded that permitting interlocutory appeals because an order involves the right to avoid trial should be confined to a few extraordinary situations (312 Md. at 481-182, 540 A.2d at 809):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u2018In sum, the idea that an issue is not effectively renewable after the termination of the trial because it involves a \u201cright\u201d to avoid the trial itself, should be limited to double jeopardy claims and a very few other extraordinary situations. Otherwise, as previously indicated, there would be \u00e1 proliferation of appeals under the collateral order doctrine. This would be flatly inconsistent with the long-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>established and sound public policy against piecemeal appeals.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">This Court in <em>Dawkins </em>went on to hold as follows (376 Md. at 65, 827 A.2d at 122, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, public official immunity, statutory immunity, <em>or any other type of immunity, </em>are not appealable under the Maryland collateral order doctrine. Whether, and under what circumstances, interlocutory orders overruling immunity defenses asserted by the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller, Treasurer, Attorney General, Speaker of the House, President of the Senate, or judges as defined in Article IV, \u00a7 2, of the Maryland Constitution, are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine will have to be determined in any future cases that might arise. <em>Cf. Mandel v. O\u2019Hara, </em>320 Md. 103, 134, 576 A.2d 766, 781 (1990). Interlocutory trial court orders overruling immunity claims by other government officials, employees, departments, agencies, entities, units, or subdivisions, or by private persons or entities, are not appealable under the doctrine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The <em>Dawkins </em>holding reflected several prior decisions by this Court rejecting appeals from interlocutory trial court orders denying immunity claims. <em>See Housing Authority v. Smalls, </em>369 Md. 224, 798 A.2d 579 (2002); <em>Orthodox Jewish Council v. Abramson, </em>368 Md. 1, 791 A.2d 129 (2002); <em>Peck v. DiMario, </em>362 Md. 660, 766 A.2d 616 (2001); <em>Bowers v. Callahan, </em>359 Md. 395, 754 A.2d 388 (2000); <em>Dennis v. Folkenberg, </em>354 Md. 412, 731 A.2d 883 (1999); <em>Samuels v. Tschechtelin, </em>353 Md. 508, 727 A.2d 929 (1999); <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 165-170, 725 A.2d 549, 560-563 (1999). Moreover, <em>Daivkins </em>has consistently been cited with approval by this Court\u2019s subsequent opinions dealing with the collateral order doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Hudson v. Housing Authority, supra, </em>402 Md. at 25, 935 A.2d at 399; <em>Ehrlich v. G'rove, supra, </em>396 Md. at 562-563, 914 A.2d at 791; <em>St. Joseph\u2019s v. Cardiac Surgery, supra, </em>392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Md. at 85-86, 896 A.2d at 310; <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, supra, </em>389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The holding in <em>Dawkins </em>is dispositive of the present ease. The immunity asserted by WSSC certainly falls within the <em>Dawkins </em>phrase \u201cany other type of immunity.\u201d None of the individual defendants falls within the category of officials whose immunity claims might be within an exception to the principle that interlocutory orders denying immunity are not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Despite the above-cited cases, WSSC advances essentially two arguments for allowing the present interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">WSSC argues that <em>Dawkins </em>\u201cdid <em>not </em>include legislative immunity in [the] list\u201d of immunity claims which are not appealable under the Maryland collateral order doctrine and that our cases do not preclude applying the doctrine when officials are \u201cacting in a legislative capacity.\u201d (WSSC\u2019s opening brief at 35, emphasis in the original). Although <em>Dawkins </em>did not expressly delineate legislative immunity, such immunity claims clearly fall within the language in <em>Dawkins </em>of \u201cany other type of immunity.\u201d Furthermore, the final paragraph of <em>Dawkins, </em>setting forth its holding, expressly refers to <em>Mandel v. O\u2019Hara, </em>320 Md. 103, 132-134, 576 A.2d 766, 781 (1990), which involved a claim of <em>legislative immunity </em>by the Governor in connection with the veto of legislation. There is no sound basis, in <em>Dawkins </em>or in any other decision by this Court, for distinguishing legislative immunity from all other types of immunity with respect to attempted appeals under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">WSSC also argues that <em>Daiokins, </em>and other cases in this Court refusing to apply the collateral order doctrine to interlocutory appeals from orders denying immunity, involved \u201cqualified immunity, not absolute ... immunity,\u201d and that \u201c[a]bsolute legislative immunity differs significantly from qualified ... immunity, and it deserves greater protection.\u201d (WSSC\u2019s opening brief at 32, 36). <em>Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 65, 827 A.2d at 122, however, expressly held that \u201cinterlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of ... <em>sovereign immuni</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>ty </em>..., or any other type of immunity, are not appealable under the Maryland collateral order doctrine.\u201d (Emphasis added). Moreover, one of the cases relied upon in <em>Dawkins </em>was <em>Samuels v. Tschechtelin, supra, </em>353 Md. 508, 727 A.2d 929, reversing <em>Tschechtelin v. Samuels, </em>124 Md.App. 389, 722 A.2d 414 (1999), which involved a claim of sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity of the State or State Agencies is absolute immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In addition, for purposes of interlocutory appeals from denials of immunity claims, where the issue relates to the fourth requirement of the collateral order doctrine, there is no reason for distinguishing between a valid absolute immunity claim and a valid qualified immunity claim. When a qualified immunity claim is not defeated by malice or some other factor which might defeat qualified immunity, the two types of immunity claims are the same and are reviewable on appeal from an adverse final judgment. If valid, either form of immunity will result in a reversal of the judgment and a direction to dismiss the action. As to the \u201cavoidance of trial\u201d aspect, there is also no difference between a valid absolute immunity defense and a valid qualified immunity defense. One purpose of any type of immunity from suit is to avoid having to stand trial. This same purpose, however, underlies a plethora of pre-trial orders. For this reason, pre-trial orders denying immunity claims are generally not reviewable by interlocutory appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In light of <em>Dawkins </em>and numerous other decisions by this Court, the Court of Special Appeals correctly dismissed WSSC\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

It is not clear from the briefs and record precisely how many positions were abolished. At different places in the briefs and record, the numbers 73, 80 and 81 are used.

As previously pointed out, in addition to WSSC's appeal from the June 1, 2007, ruling denying WSSC's motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, WSSC on September 6, 2007, filed a second notice of appeal. This second appeal was from the Circuit Court's August 8, 2007, order denying a stay of Circuit Court proceedings, and particularly a stay of all discovery. The Court of Special Appeals on December 4, 2007, after the certiorari petition was filed in the present case, dismissed the second appeal. The Court of Special Appeals' mandate in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>appeal was issued on January 3, 2008. WSSC did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the second appeal case. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 dismissal of the second appeal finally terminated appellate proceedings with respect to the interlocutory appeal regarding a stay or a postponement of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Nevertheless, WSSC\u2019s briefs in this Court argued that officials of the WSSC should not be required to appear for depositions, relying upon <em>Public Service Comm'n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 477 A.2d 759 (1984), and <em>Montgomery County v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 654 A.2d 877 (1995). (WSSC\u2019s opening brief at 34, 37-38; WSSC\u2019s reply brief at 2, 19-20). Neither <em>Patuxent Valley </em>nor <em>Stevens </em>involved claims of immunity from suit. Instead they were appeals from interlocutory orders by trial courts, in actions for judicial review of adjudicatory administrative decisions, ordering the administrative decision-makers to appear for depositions concerning their thought processes in rendering the administrative decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">WSSC's discovery argument is not properly before us for at least two reasons. <em>First, </em>the argument was the subject of the second appeal, from the Circuit Court's order of August 8, 2007, and WSSC did not file a certiorari petition in the <em>second </em>appeal case. The present appellate proceedings are from the Circuit Court\u2019s June 1, 2007, ruling, and that ruling did not involve any discovery matter. In fact, at the beginning of the June 1, 2007, hearing, counsel for WSSC stated that no discovery issue was before the Court. <em>Second, </em>the discoveiy issue was not encompassed by the questions presented in WSSC\u2019s certiorari petition. For this reason also, the issue is not before us. <em>See </em>Matyland Rule 8-131(b); <em>Garner v. Archers Glen, </em>405 Md. 43, 60-61, 949 A.2d 639, 649 (2008); <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 473, 924 A.2d 1112, 1121 (2007), and cases there cited. Finally, even if the issue were before us, it would lack merit. The present case is distinguishable from <em>Patuxent Valley </em>and <em>Stevens </em>on several grounds. <em>See also Hudson v. Housing Authority, supra, </em>402 Md. at 25-26, 935 A.2d at 399; <em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 914 A.2d 783 (2007); <em>St. Mary's County v. Lacer, supra, </em>393 Md. at 429-430, 903 A.2d at 386-387; <em>St. Joseph\u2019s v. Cardiac Surgery, supra, </em>392 Md. at 87-88, 896 A.2d at 311; <em>Goodwich </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 141 n. 8, 680 A.2d 1040, 1045 n. 8 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\">. In connection with the argument distinguishing qualified immunity from absolute immunity for purposes of the collateral order doctrine, WSSC cites <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, supra, </em>353 Md. at 166, 725 A.2d at 561, and attributes to <em>Shoemaker </em>a \"ruling that the collateral order doctrine \u2018will likely' apply 'when immunity is absolute and is not defeated by malice, gross negligence, or other defense.\u2019 \" (WSSC\u2019s opening brief at 32). The quoted language from <em>Shoemaker </em>was this Court's description of a Court of Special Appeals' opinion in another case. Moreover, the portion of <em>Shoemaker </em>which is quoted by WSSC related to the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine and not the fourth requirement which involves reviewability of the order on appeal from a final judgment. <em>Shoemaker </em>dealt with the fourth requirement later in the opinion, 353 Md. at 168-170, 725 A.2d at 562-563.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
