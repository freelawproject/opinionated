TH1EME, JR., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3H\">Retired Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In this opinion, we revisit the increasing problems posed by cases of gang-related intimidation of witnesses, which cannot be overstated. After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, petitioner, Jovon Brian Lancaster (\u201cLancaster\u201d), was convicted of two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, two counts of second degree assault, one count of first degree burglary, and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. Affirming Lancaster\u2019s convictions, the intermediate appellate court held that the circuit court (to which we shall also refer as the \u201cmotion court\u201d) did not abuse its discretion by granting \u201ca pre-trial protective order that required [Lancaster\u2019s] defense counsel to delay disclosing to him[,] until the day of trial[,] the names, addresses, and statements of certain prosecution witnesses.\u201d <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 1, 4, 948 A.2d 102, 104 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Lancaster presents to us three questions, which we have reduced to one and rephrased for clarity:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Did the intermediate appellate court err in holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the protective order? We shall hold that the intermediate appellate court erred, and hence, we shall reverse Lancaster\u2019s convictions and remand his case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We quote the intermediate appellate court\u2019s excellent recitation of the pertinent facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">The Crimes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">At trial, the State presented evidence that ... Lancaster and his codefendant brother, Pablo Guillermo Lancaster [ (\u201cPablo\u201d) ], were involved in a series of drug-related incidents that culminated in a home robbery. On July 13, 2005, Michael Ford and Jason Friday used a counterfeit $100 bill to buy ecstasy pills from \u201cSukie,\u201d ... Lancaster\u2019s girlfriend, who lived across the street from Ford\u2019s house at 17909 Shotley Bridge Place in Olney. The next morning, July 14, Sukie called Friday to complain about the counterfeit money. When Friday rebuffed her, she told him that two drug dealers were coming to his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">A couple of hours after Sukie\u2019s call, two men, whom Friday later identified as [Lancaster] and Pablo ..., visited Friday\u2019s home. Friday\u2019s father escorted them into the home. The pair demanded money for the prior night\u2019s transaction, and asked Friday to \u201cstep outside\u201d when his father \u201ckept asking what was going on.\u201d Friday went to the porch, and promised them that he would give them the money when he had it. The pair left, but came back to get Friday\u2019s phone numbers. Once inside, one of them picked up Friday\u2019s cell phone from the table and left with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">Michael Ford also received a call from Sukie on the morning of July 14. She was \u201cangry, upset and confused.\u201d Ford exchanged calls with Friday, telling his friend that he was not going to give him any money, at which point the call terminated abruptly. Shortly thereafter, Ford received another call from Friday\u2019s cell phone. When Ford answered, an unknown male said, \u201cYou got our money.\u201d- In a second call, the same man said he was on his way to Ford\u2019s house. Minutes later, the same caller informed Ford, \u201cI\u2019m outside.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">Ford enlisted his brother C.J.\u2019s help, and together they walked out to the car parked on the street in front of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>house. Two men identified as the Lancasters sat in the car. They told him that Friday gave them fake money and that Friday sent them to him. During the encounter, Michael Ford called Friday\u2019s cell, which rang in the possession of the man in the back seat, who identified himself as \u201cJuvenile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">Over the next several days, Ford received at least five calls from the same man demanding repayment and/or asking where to find Friday. On July 18, Ford received three calls from the same caller, again demanding payment. On the third call, the caller said, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to your house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">Presently, a group of men, some wearing masks and carrying firearms, came to the Ford home. The Lancaster brothers were part of this group; neither was masked and both carried handguns. Neither Michael Ford nor his mother Rosetta Ford were home at the time. Michael\u2019s brother C.J. and Deandre were outside. The men patted them down, brandished a shotgun, then directed them inside, where the Lancasters took their wallets, cell phones, and money. The robbers seated both brothers on a couch with an unidentified woman, where they remained while the robbers went through the house, taking two stereos, jewelry, and clothes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Upon returning home after her night shift, Rosetta Ford learned what happened and reported the incident to police. On August 26, 2005, Pablo and ... Lancaster were arrested for robbery and related crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">Hearing on Protective Order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">On December 15, 2005, the State moved for a protective order, seeking to withhold from the Lancasters and their counsel the current location of victim witnesses, and to prevent defense counsel from sharing with their clients before trial the names, criminal records, prior statements/] and grand jury testimony of certain non-victim civilian witnesses (the \u201cprotected witnesses\u201d). Defense counsel filed written opposition to the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>At a January 12, 2006 hearing on the motion, the State explained that it was seeking protective orders with respect to three different categories of witnesses: (1) victims; (2) non-victim eyewitnesses, <em>ie., </em>persons who participated in the crime with the Lancasters; and (3) other fact witnesses who were neither victims nor eyewitnesses, <em>ie., </em>persons who had information that tied the Lancasters to the armed robbery but were not present while it was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The State presented the testimony of Defective] Eric A. Mason, the \u201cprimary investigator,\u201d as grounds for the protective order. [Det.] Mason had been assigned to the robbery section of the Montgomery County Police Department\u2019s major crimes unit for one year; he had 24 years experience in the Department before that.. On direct examination, [Det.] Mason testified that some witnesses feared retaliation by the Lancasters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">[Prosecutor]: How many witnesses would you say you\u2019ve interviewed in the course of your investigation of this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">[Det. Mason]: Numerous, I would probably say, ballpark of maybe ten.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">Q: Okay, and of those witnesses have any of them expressed any concerns regarding their involvement in the case, talking to you, et cetera?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">Q: Okay. What kind of concerns on a generalized fashion [have] those witnesses articulated to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">A: Fear that retaliation will be made against them. Fear that they would come to their homes.... That they knew where they lived at....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">Q: And is the fear specific to the two defendants or is it to go to known associates of the defendants as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoj\">A: The defendants and their associates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">Q: Okay. And within these ten witnesses is there a smaller group of those witnesses who expressed particularized fears because of specific threats they\u2019ve perceived from these defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>A: Yes. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">When counsel for both Lancasters expressed concern about their ability to cross-examine the protected witnesses regarding the allegation of specific threats, the prosecutor assured court and counsel that full disclosure of the identities, prior statements, and criminal records of all witnesses, including the protected witnesses, would be made to defense counsel as soon as the hearing concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The State then proceeded with its direct examination of Det. Mason regarding the protected witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">[Prosecutor]: This subset of witnesses ... have they told you about specific threats they\u2019ve perceived from the defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">[Det. Mason]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Q: Okay. And has this subset of witnesses perceived those threats to be in relation to their potential participation in this matter, and your investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Q:.... The crime charged, .... allegation involves a home invasion, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-13\">Q: And does it involve people in addition to the two defendants here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-15\">Q: Okay. It involves, in fact, five or six people, correct? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-16\">Q: And is there an allegation that firearms were involved in that home invasion[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-17\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-18\">Q: Okay. And are you aware of other violent conduct by the two defendants that has been charged against them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUl\">A: Yes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-20\">Q: Has that violent conduct involved firearms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-21\">A: Yes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Q: Do you know if that violent conduct that involved firearms has resulted in indictments against the two defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">Q: Okay. And is it for a carjacking for both of them? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Q: And armed robbery for both of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">Q: Okay. And are you aware about the subset of witnesses that we\u2019re talking about, are they aware of that conduct by the defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">Q: And this subset of witnesses, ... have they made known to you their awareness of other violent conduct by the defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-12\">A: Yes. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">On cross-examination, defense counsel established that some of the protected witnesses have a criminal background and that Det. Mason interviewed each witness independently from the others. Counsel then unsuccessfully attempted to question [Det.] Mason about the specific nature of the alleged threats against prosecution witnesses. Counsel for Pablo ... asked the detective, \u201cCan you give me a detail of what they perceived as a threat. What articulable fact they would have had, that they could have perceived as a threat?\u201d The prosecutor objected, arguing that \u201cthe response to that question is going to further any attempt by the defendants to identify this witness.\u201d The court suggested that the question be rephrased, noting that \u201cit is a fair concern that\u201d information regarding \u201cthe substance of the threats\u201d could \u201callow a determination as to ... the identity of those individuals.\u201d Defense counsel then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV9\">[Counsel for Pablo]: This is rather ethereal here but let me ... try it this way.... [Y]ou were not personally present during any threats made to any of these subset of witnesses, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>LDet. Mason]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">Q: So, you would have heard that they perceived the threat, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">Q: Were any of them direct contact with either one of these two defendants?.... [D]id they say that, to you, it was made directly by one of these two gentlemen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">A: One of them, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">Q: And .... which one of the defendants ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANz\">[Prosecutor]: And Pm objecting.... I think we\u2019ve established a very fine perimeter around what this threat is specific threat [sic], the witness perceived it, and perceived it from one of the defendants. I think any question beyond that is going ... too close to the identification of who these witnesses are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">The [c]ourt: All right, I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">[Counsel for Pablo]: Can you tell me a little bit more about the nature of the threat, verbal, look, glance, shrugged shoulders, pointing fingers, telephone call, letter, what\u2019s the nature of the basis of their perceived threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">A: Verbal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">Q: Okay. And would the answer be the same if I asked you what their perceived threat was from, what you call, associates of the defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-14\">A: Just prior history.... It\u2019s just prior history of knowing of the group they hung with. What they are capable of doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-15\">Q: Okay, so they\u2019re telling you I\u2019ve been involved with these people in the past then basically, I guess, I\u2019m afraid of them in the future, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-16\">A: Basically, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-17\">Q: Okay. Now[,] none of these people was hurt or harmed in any way up to the time you talked to them and you testified in court today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>A: Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Q: Nobody had to move, at least these witnesses, or anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">A: It depends on what witnesses you\u2019re talking about. Yes, some of them moved. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Next[,] counsel for ... Lancaster continued the cross-examination of Det. Mason. After establishing that [Det.] Mason was not aware of \u201cany threats by the associates,\u201d defense counsel attempted to learn more about the threat allegedly made by one of the defendants. He asked when that threat was made, and whether any threat had been made while both defendants were incarcerated pending trial. The court sustained objections to both inquiries, despite defense counsel\u2019s insistence that this information \u201cgoes to their dangerousness.\u201d Cross-examination continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">[Counsel for Lancaster]: When the home invasion allegedly occurred, the invaders said things to the victims, in the home, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">[Det. Mason]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">Q: ... The threat, is it from an event other than that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">A: Yes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">Q: The people that said that they were concerned about threats from the associates, from retaliation from the associates, did they know the associates, or are they just worried about the associates in general?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">Defense counsel argued that the prosecution had not provided enough specific information about the threats to justify the protective order. Counsel for [Lancaster] compared the record to <em>Coleman v. State, </em>321 Md. 586, 583 A.2d 1044 (1991), in which the motion court \u201cknew what the specific statements by various people at various times\u201d were and then narrowly tailored the protective order to prevent only disclosure of identity and contact information, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>substance of the witnesses\u2019 statements. He complained that there was insufficient information \u201cfor the court to make a rational, balanced, determination in exercising [its] discretion.\u201d In counsel\u2019s view, the generalized nature of the allegations means that \u201cwe don\u2019t know if it really was a threat. We just know that they perceived it as a threat. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ... enough to grant that relief given the constitutional issues at point in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The motion court ruled [that] it was \u201csatisfied that there is a significant issue with respect to the safety and welfare of these witnesses given the nature of the testimony, the nature of the allegations and the ... reasonable fear with respect to their personal safety and prospect of retaliation by these two defendants or individuals on behalf of the defendants, in spite of the fact that they are locked up.\u201d The court granted the motion, distinguishing between victim witnesses and non-victim eyewitnesses, and ordering as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">\u2022 Victim witnesses: The State was required to give defense counsel the names of victim witnesses, but allowed to withhold current addresses, subject to the State making these witnesses available to defense counsel as set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u2022 Non-victim eyewitnesses: The State was ordered to turn over to defense counsel, immediately following the hearing, the names, addresses, prior statements, charging documents[,] and officer interview notes relating to this case, as well as the prior criminal records of these witnesses, and to make them available to defense counsel as set forth below. But[,] defense counsel was ordered not to disclose this protected information to either defendant before the trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u2022 Witness availability: The State was ordered to produce all witnesses before trial at its office for defense counsel to have a chance to meet with them, at least two weeks before trial. Each witness could decide whether he/she wanted to speak with defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The motion court then addressed defense counsels\u2019 complaint that the order against discussing the substance of the witnesses\u2019 statements with their clients would interfere with their representation. Specifically, counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">[A]ny time someone takes a plea in a case there\u2019s always the question by the court, have you had enough time to talk to your lawyer about this case, have you discussed possible defenses, et cetera. So, I\u2019m a little bit troubled ... that in order to discuss the case and have a theory of defense with a ... client that\u2019s going to trial, we need to say [that] this is the evidence the State has produced against you. And it consists of a statement of a ... witness that says this about what you did. And this witness says he was ... in a position to say what he did. So, I\u2019m bothered and feel extremely curtailed by my ability to effectively communicate with my client, theorize a defense in the case, and actually represent him effectively at trial, if I can\u2019t actually ... say[,] look[,] there\u2019s three witnesses that are going to slam dunk you.... They\u2019re going to say they did this....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The court agreed with the prosecutor that immediate disclosure of the identity and statements of all witnesses to defense counsel after the hearing would give counsel an opportunity to assess whether the protective order actually created any of these theoretical conflicts. The court assured defense counsel that it would reconsider its order if that occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">[T]hat full discovery is being given to you with the understanding that it\u2019s essentially not going to be disclosed to your clients. And then after you review it, then you\u2019ll have an opportunity to discuss with [the prosecutor] any agreement that can be reached that would allow you to further disclose that information .... If after your review of the discovery, there is information you feel would, that you would be able to discuss with your clients, that would not conflict with the protective order, and it would not cause a concern with respect to the safety [of] the individuals involved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>then the protective order would be modified to allow you to disclose that. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">A written order followed stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cif defense counsel desire further guidance from the [c]ourt or a reconsideration of this Order[,] they may seek such relief from the [c]ourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The Lancaster brothers were tried over three days. The only victim eyewitness to testify was C.J. Ford, who identified both Lancasters as participating in the home robbery on August 18-19. He testified that about two weeks after the robbery, he saw Pablo at a bus stop. Pablo approached him and \u201casked [him] about the police and his brother and [C.J.\u2019s] brother!.]\u201d C.J. told him, \u201c T haven\u2019t talked to my brother,\u2019 \u201d because C.J. \u201cwas mad at [Michael] about what happened!.]\u201d He also told Pablo that he did not \u201cknow anything about ... what was going on between ... [Michael Ford] and his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The State presented four witnesses whose identity and statements had been subjected to the protective order, all of whom had been arrested or charged with involvement in the robbery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u2022 Justin Navarro and Milton Doley accompanied the Lancasters during the robbery; both accepted plea deals that reduced their charges and sentences. During the robbery, Navarro carried a shotgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u2022 Randall Gilmore saw the Lancasters with Hutson, Sukie, and three other men on the evening of the robbery, but he declined Pablo\u2019s invitation to accompany them in order to \u201cmake a move.\u201d He was arrested in connection with the robbery, but charges were later dropped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">\u2022 Stephanie Hutson, who was dating Pablo at the time of the robbery, was at the Ford house just before the robbery, but left with Sukie. They went to a park and smoked marijuana, then were picked up after the robbery in a car occupied by Pablo, [Lancaster], Navarro, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and Doley. While riding in the car, she heard the Lancasters and their accomplices say \u201chow everybody in the house was scared and they just kind of punked out and followed what everybody said.\u201d They were \u201cjoking\u201d about taking a CD player, cell phone, and credit cards. The charges against Hutson were <em>[nolle prossed </em>].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">Two of these non-victim eyewitnesses testified about pretrial contacts with the Lancasters while this case was pending. Doley saw [Lancaster] while Doley was in jail on an unrelated burglary charge. [Lancaster] asked him \u201cif the police talked to [him] about what happened [on t]he night in Olney.\u201d Doley told him he had not been approached, because police did not learn about his involvement until later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">Hutson testified that in August, before Pablo was arrested, she had \u201c[a] few\u201d conversations with him about the fact that Det. Mason was contacting her. Pablo \u201ctold [her] to say that [she] didn\u2019t know anything\u201d and that she \u201cbetter not say anything.\u201d After she, Pablo, and [Lancaster] had been arrested, she saw the brothers again while they were waiting to appear for their preliminary hearings via video monitor. As she walked into the waiting room, Pablo was still in his holding cell, but he called \u201cto get [her] attention just yelling AFALOVA and [her] name.\u201d This was shorthand for \u201call for one love one for all[,]\u201d which the Lancasters both used in \u201creferring to people, their close friends, family.\u201d Pablo had the saying tattooed on his forearm. [Lancaster] also yelled out her name and \u201cAFALOVA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">Later,, when Pablo was released from his holding cell, he \u201ccame over and sat in front of [Hutson] and started talking to [her].\u201d She testified, \u201cHe was saying that I better not be snitching.

After Brady was charged with premeditated murder, his counsel made a request to review the extrajudicial statements of his co-accused. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 83 S.Ct. at 1195, 10 L.Ed.2d at 217. One statement, in which the co-accused admitted to committing the homicide, was withheld by the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), the Supreme Court recognized the government\u2019s privilege to withhold certain evidence, particularly the identity of informants. <em>Id. </em>at 59, 77 S.Ct. at 627, 1 L.Ed.2d at 644. But, the Court qualified the privilege, stating that courts must \u201cbalanc[e] the public interest in protecting [this source] of information against the [defendant\u2019s] right to prepare [a] defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628-29, 1 L.Ed.2d at 646. Courts balancing these interests must \u201ctakfe] into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informant\u2019s testimony, and [any] other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 629, 1 L.Ed.2d at 646. <em>See also U.S. v. Wilson, </em>77 F.3d 105, 111-12 (5th Cir.1996) (court did not abuse discretion by denying disclosure of informant identities where informants feared for their safety, defendant had a pending indictment for witness tampering, and defendant failed to produce evidence as to how informants\u2019 testimony might bear on his innocence or guilt, or make a substantial showing that informants\u2019 falsifications or misrepresentations were included in affidavits supporting applications for wiretaps). The Court further held that \u201c[w]here the disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity ... is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\u201d <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 60-61, 77 S.Ct. at 628, 1 L.Ed.2d at 645 (footnote omitted).

In the seminal case of <em>Coleman, supra, </em>we concluded that it may be necessary to balance a defendant\u2019s discovery rights and Sixth Amendment right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>against the State\u2019s interest in safeguarding witnesses, thereby preserving the integrity of the judicial process. 321 Md. at 602-03, 583 A.2d at 1051-52. The protective order in question prevented defense counsel from disclosing to Anthony Coleman and Gregory Givens, co-defendants on trial for first degree murder, the identity of two key prosecution witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 597-99, 583 A.2d at 1049-50. According to the prosecution, Coleman, one of the gang\u2019s \u201chigher-ups,\u201d ordered Givens, the gang\u2019s \u201cenforcer,\u201d to shoot the victim, Delroy McNeil, who was believed to have stolen drugs from the gang\u2019s \u201cstash.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 594, 583 A.2d at 1046-47. Givens later shot McNeil in broad daylight as McNeil sat on the steps of a church. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 583 A.2d at 1047. The State requested a protective order that the names of the State\u2019s key witnesses be withheld from the defendants until trial began. <em>Id. </em>at 592, 583 A.2d at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In support of the order, officers with substantial experience in homicide and drug investigations testified that Coleman and Givens were members of a drug-dealing gang that terrorized a neighborhood through fear and intimidation. <em>Id. </em>at 592-97, 583 A.2d at 1046-49. First, the officers described a community-wide fear of retaliatory violence that thwarted law enforcement efforts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">The picture painted by the ... officers was appalling, all the more so because it reflected life on the street.... The residents of those neighborhoods ... are forced by fear and intimidation to accept an oppressive and onerous way of life. By reason of their fear and intimidation, the ability of law enforcement authorities to assist them is, to say the least, seriously hampered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 593, 583 A.2d at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The officers then testified regarding the street drug war that precipitated the murder for which Coleman was on trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">... The area around the 800 block of Broadway is a notorious place where drug deals are made....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">John (Skeeter) Holt apparently considered the area to be the exclusive territory of a drug organization he headed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The organization maintained \u201cstash houses\u201d in the area. Its cocaine was stored in these houses. The narcotics were packaged in clear vials ... distinguished by a pink cap.... Only the organization\u2019s cocaine was packaged with pink caps, and all the cocaine sold in the area by the organization had pink caps on the vials. This enabled the organization to control competition by assuring that only its drugs were being sold in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">Givens was a member of the organization. He played a dual role. He was a runner, one who sells drugs to users, and he was an enforcer, one who inflicts punishment on those who act contrary to the interests of the organization. He and Oswald (Pru) Trayham were responsible for \u201cenforcing\u201d in the organization. McNeil became the subject of Givens\u2019 enforcement duties. The organization was aware that McNeil \u201cwould sit for hours many times and watch\u201d where the organization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">put [its] stashes and then he would go steal the stash of drugs and sell it for his own profit, which angered the drug dealers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">The organization\u2019s cocaine was \u201cpure,\u201d but McNeil would \u201ccut\u201d it before selling it. Thus, McNeil\u2019s activities not only diminished the organization\u2019s income, they also damaged the organization\u2019s reputation for the quality of its merchandise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">Coleman, one of the higher-ups in the organization, took steps to assuage the anger by terminating McNeil\u2019s activities and, at the same time, providing an example to others who might be so tempted. He directed Givens \u201cto go and take care of\u2019 McNeil. He provided Givens with a weapon. Givens found McNeil sitting on the church steps. In broad daylight, he went up to McNeil and shot him three times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjA\"><em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 583 A.2d at 1047. The State also presented evidence of other crimes that Coleman\u2019s organization employed in order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">to preserve its territory and to protect its interests. The murder of one Maurice Ireland was traced to Givens. Ireland, fresh out of jail, was owed money by Holt, apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>for some drug deal. He was \u201cvery pushy for his money [about $5000] to be paid back.... \u201d At one point, \u201c[h]e forcibly tried to get his money back ... and as a result his murder was ordered.\u201d He was executed about a block from where McNeil was slain. Givens was charged with the murder of Ireland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 594-95, 588 A.2d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The prosecution witnesses were aware of these reasons to fear testifying against Coleman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">The media\u2014press, radio, and television\u2014provide clear indication that the extreme sanction employed by the drug organization here is not unusual. A harkening of the news reports shows that unlawful drug organizations often use that means to preserve the territory they have adopted, to enforce what they consider to be their rights, and to protect their interests. The impact of this on enforcement functions, [an officer] explained, is that there is great difficulty in locating witnesses who will cooperate with authorities in drug related offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">[Witnesses] are very candid, usually that they don\u2019t want to be involved because they fear that they will be hurt in retribution for any information that they would give to us. They fear the people that are involved in the murder and they will not give us a statement, let alone come to court and testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The officer emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">These cases are usually very, very difficult to make an arrest on, very difficult because there is a low level of cooperation in the community because of the fear in the community. They fear these people. These people rule the communities through intimidation and ... these are citizens that ... don\u2019t want to be the next one laying Out there in this street with nobody coming forward to testify for them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 595, 583 A.2d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Next, we summarized the evidence of threats specific to that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The police did .. . receive information from the witnesses who were the subject of the protective order, one of whom was an eyewitness to the shooting. It was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">specific information, and ... a positive identification of ... Givens was made as the shooter of ... McNeil. Also, there was information given relative to a conversation that was, that happened between ... Coleman and ... Givens just prior to the shooting of ... McNeil and also there was information as to actions of both individuals, what they did right before the shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">The witnesses agreed to testify in court, but not without reservations. [The officer] said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">... The biggest concern they had when I interviewed them was their personal safety. They are in extreme fear. They feel that if their identity is revealed that they would have to have 24 hour guard around the clock, but they feel like their life would not be worth a nickel. That\u2019s their words, extremely difficult to get people to come forward like this in these particular type cases and to give this kind of information and even more difficult, when you do get the information, for people to want to remain anonymous and not testify in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">The officer observed that it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">[v]ery unusual for a person to put themselves this up front, so to speak, and be willing to go before the Baltimore City Grand Jury and come into a courtroom in front of whoever chooses to come in here and testify against an individual like this, an individual who is already indicted on two murders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 595-96, 583 A.2d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">We also considered the potential for retaliation by criminal associates of the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-12\">[Although Givens was in jail pending trial on Ireland\u2019s murder, ... Trayham, the organization\u2019s other enforcer, was still on the street. Also[,] police investigation indicated that Coleman was \u201csending emissaries from the Baltimore City Jail to issue harm to any of [the State\u2019s] witnesses.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Questioned as to the basis of the witnesses\u2019 fear that they would be killed, [the officer] said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">Because of the prior activities of this drug organization. People that have been shot and people that have been shot and killed. There are also people that have just been shot and have not died because they have crossed this particular drug organization and their death was ordered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">He explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">Now, in some particular instances the murder wasn\u2019t complete. The person didn\u2019t die because the hospital saved them. They believe that if their identity is made known to this drug organization!,] they are not safe wherever they may be, whether it be under our protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">The court remarked that this would be true even after they testified and the case was over. [The officer] responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">Yes, it would be true---- To be quite candid, Your Honor[,] they are hoping that once the case is over the persons being tried will be incarcerated and then we would provide [the witnesses] with a means of leaving this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">The judge inquired if the police would provide the witnesses with new identities. The officer replied the police did not have that capability, but, combined with the State\u2019s Attorney they would \u201cdo everything [they] can to help them leave the area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 596-97, 583 A.2d at 1048-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">The motion court in <em>Coleman </em>\u201cdetermined that the officers\u2019 testimony was credible\u201d and \u201cthat the fears for the safety of the witnesses were well warranted,\u201d because their lives \u201c[\u2018]may [have been] endangered[\u2019]\u201d by their cooperation and testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 597, 583 A.2d at 1049. Concerned about \u201c\u25a1hampering the defense in any way in the preparation of [its] case,!\u2019]\u201d however, the motion court required the State to provide defense counsel with the name of prosecution witnesses two weeks before trial, and to arrange for defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>counsel to \u201cquestion the witnesses out of the presence of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The motion court explicitly prohibited defense counsel from disclosing the identity of these witnesses to anyone, including the defendants, but conditioned that order with the proviso that it would TJconsider at any time prior to trial any reasonable request that [was] made for time to pursue follow-up to any information that [was] obtained as a result of the interview.[\u2019]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597-98, 583 A.2d at 1049.

One aspect of the motion court\u2019s exercise of discretion that we explicitly approved was the order permitting defense counsel to obtain names, addresses, and audiences with the protected witnesses, outside the presence of prosecutors, two weeks before trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Here, unlike in <em>Coleman, </em>the State failed to present any evidence at the protective order hearing about the victim witnesses\u2019 testimony or the facts surrounding the alleged crime, other than the fact that it took place inside a home. With respect to the non-victim civilian witnesses, the State failed to present any evidence regarding their identity, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>expected testimony regarding Lancaster\u2019s alleged robbery, or the importance of that testimony to the State\u2019s case. Moreover, the State failed to present any evidence regarding \u201cspecific threats\u201d from Lancaster, his brother, or their associates against the witnesses.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No evidence was presented regarding Lancaster\u2019s reputation for violence, or the reputation for violence, if any, of his brother and associates. The State also failed to identify any persons who might have carried out the alleged threats against the witnesses, as Lancaster and his brother were incarcerated at the time that the alleged threats were made. Because of these omissions, the motion court had no evidence upon which it could determine \u201cthe materiality of [the witnesses\u2019] testimony to the determination of [Lancaster\u2019s] guilt or innocence[,]\u201d or whether the disclosure of the identity and statements of witnesses to Lancaster \u201cwould entail a substantial risk of harm\u201d to them. Hence, the motions court\u2019s finding that \u201cthere [was] a significant issue with respect to the safety and welfare of [the State\u2019s] witnesses ... and the ... reasonable fear with respect to their personal safety and prospect of retaliation\u201d is clearly erroneous. <em>See Coleman, supra, </em>321 Md. at 603, 583 A.2d at 1052 (applying a clearly erroneous standard to the review of the motion court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe life of any State witness was in danger once the witness was identified\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> We further conclude that the protective order \u201cin effect tied [defense] counsel\u2019s hands and foreclosed him from pursuing a valuable source of information\u201d for cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tion of the State\u2019s witnesses. <em>Clark v. State, </em>306 Md. 483, 489, 510 A.2d 243, 246 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1084, 107 S.Ct. 1286, 94 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987). The main and essential purpose of confrontation of witnesses is to secure for a defendant the opportunity of cross-examination. Cross-examination is the principal mechanism by which the defense tests witness credibility and the truth of witness statements before the trier of fact. It is used not only to test a witness\u2019s memory and perceptions of what occurred, but also to impeach or discredit a witness\u2019s testimony. Here, because the protective order placed a marked restraint upon defense counsel\u2019s tactical or strategic judgment, it impaired defense counsel\u2019s effectiveness, violating Lancaster\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 488, 510 A.2d at 245 (\u201ccounsel\u2019s effectiveness is impaired by action of the court or the state placing a marked restraint upon counsel\u2019s tactical or strategic judgment\u201d). Because the protective order violated Lancaster\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel, the motion court abused its discretion by issuing the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The State contends that \u201cLancaster waived any complaint with respect to the protective order [by] agreeing] to the course of action proposed by the [motion] court and made no further objection to the order after the hearing, either prior to ... or during trial.\u201d <em>See Rocks, supra, </em>241 Md. at 630, 217 A.2d at 541. This contention is unpersuasive. At the time that the motion court issued the protective order, Lancaster made known his objection to the issuance of the order. <em>See </em>Rule 4-323(c) (\u201cFor purposes of review ... on appeal of any ... ruling or order [other than an objection to evidence], it is sufficient that a party, at the time [that] the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court.\u201d). \u201c[Hjaving vigorously argued the matter,\u201d defense counsel\u2019s \u201cpolite deference\u201d to the motion court cannot be \u201cdeem[ed] acquiescence!.]\u201d <em>Beverly v.

But, Lancaster does not need to prove that he was prejudiced by the protective order. \u201c[Wjhere the state deprives [a] defendant of effective assistance of counsel, constitutional error will be found without the showing of prejudice.\u201d <em>Clark, supra, </em>306 Md. at 491, 510 A.2d at 247 (citations omitted).

Additionally, because the witnesses and defendants in this case apparently knew each other, cross-examination of the witnesses on the issue of bias could have revealed a motive to testify falsely. Lancaster could not have ascertained such motives unless he knew the identities of the witnesses, and hence, the motion court\u2019s abuse of discretion in issuing the protective order was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

First, because the Circuit Court expressly stated that it would revisit the protective order issue if requested to do so, that order constituted an <em>in limine </em>ruling that was not thereafter preserved for appellate review. As the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">The motion court acknowledged the possibility that, after reviewing [the protected] information, defense counsel might find a need to discuss an aspect of the protected information with his client before the trial, in order to determine plea and trial strategy. Lancaster reads the court\u2019s order, however, as limiting the \u201cthe type of clarification and modification it would consider ... to circumstances in which witness statements and identities could be shared with Lancaster \u2018without him being able to determine the witness\u2019 identification.\u2019 \u201d After reviewing the bench ruling and written order in context, we conclude that Lancaster construes it too narrowly. The motion court explicitly invited defense counsel to seek reconsideration and/or clarification of the protective order in the event counsel developed a specific concern following disclosure of the protected information to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">Defense counsel had the protected information for nearly two months before trial, but did not seek modification or clarification of the protective order as it pertained to any of the disclosed information. <em>Cf. United States v. Padilla, </em>203 F.3d 156 (2d Cir.)(protective order temporarily barring counsel from informing clients about investigation into allegations of witness and jury tampering was lifted when it became relevant to their witness-selection decisions and to the nature of the anticipated cross-examination if defendants were to testify), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 832, 121 S.Ct. 86, 148 L.Ed.2d 47 (2000). There is nothing in the record to suggest that counsel approached the prosecutor in this regard, either, despite the court\u2019s suggestion of that alternative possibility. In these circumstances, we think that the failure to request relief from the protective order severely undermines Lancaster\u2019s complaint about it. <em>See, e.g., Coleman [v. State], </em>321 Md. [586] at 604[, 583 A.2d 1044, 1052 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(1991) ] (appellate court\u2019s decision that protective order delaying disclosure of prosecution witness information until trial did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights was \u201cbolstered by the fact that\u201d defendant did not request time for additional investigation even though the court assured counsel that additional time would be granted if the defense found that \u201cto be advisable as a result of the testimony of [protected] witnesses at trial\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>Lancaster v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 1, 27-28, 948 A.2d 102, 117-18 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Second, when the protective order expired on the date of trial, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had an opportunity to\u2014but did not\u2014explain how the defense was prejudiced by the tardy disclosure of the protected information. Because no explanation was provided and no request for relief was presented to the Circuit Court, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Judges HARRELL and RODOWSKY have authorized me to state that they join this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
