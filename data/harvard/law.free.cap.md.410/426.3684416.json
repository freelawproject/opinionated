In answering that question, we must interpret and apply the phrase \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d which is the only relevant term the Code does not define. For reasons we shall explain, we effectively shall affirm the decision of the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals of Baltimore City (the \u201cBoard\u201d), which concluded that such a living arrangement satisfies the Code\u2019s definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Cresmont Properties Ltd. (\u201cCresmont\u201d) owns a 28,132 square-foot parcel of land (the \u201cProperty\u201d) located at 2807-35 Cresmont Avenue in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioners, a group of neighborhood residents opposed to Cresmont\u2019s development of and particular use established on the Property, challenge here the last of three construction permits, as well as an occupancy permit, issued to Cresmont by the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development (\u201cDHCD\u201d) for a multi-unit residential building known as Cresmont Loft. The labyrinthine history of this litigation is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\n<em>The First Construction Permit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ay6\">On 15 November 2002, the Zoning Administrator for DHCD issued to Cresmont a permit to construct a seven-story residential apartment building, consisting of twenty-six dwelling units and an adjacent parking lot with thirty-three parking spaces.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time, the Property was a vacant lot. Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ers filed a negative appeal<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the Board. They alleged that the project violated Section 10-504(a) of the Code, which requires that an ordinance be adopted by the Mayor and City Council (the \u201cCity\u201d) to authorize the use of land as a parking lot.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board ruled against Petitioners, reasoning that Section 10-504(a) did not apply to accessory off-street parking for newly-erected structures. Thus, construction of the Cresmont Loft building and parking lot began in August 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On 4 November 2003, however, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, upon Petitioners\u2019 petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision, reversed the Board, noting that the Code did not exempt an accessory use from the requirements of Section 10-504(a). Shortly thereafter, the Director of Permits for DHCD revoked Cresmont\u2019s construction permit. The City, siding with Cresmont, appealed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported decision, dismissed the appeal on the ground that the provision of the Code authorizing judicial review by the Court of Special Appeals was not in effect when the City filed its appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Mayor of Balt. v. Armstrong, </em>No. 02096, September Term, 2003, 163 Md.App. 704 (filed 10 August 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>The Second Construction Permit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">On 6 January 2004, while the appeal concerning the first construction permit was pending in the intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>court, DHCD issued to Cresmont a second construction permit, as the earlier one had been revoked following the Circuit Court\u2019s November 2003 order. Construction resumed about two weeks later. Petitioners filed a negative appeal to the Board, asking the Zoning Administrator to stay construction during the pendency of their negative appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They relied on Section 17-203 of the Code, which provides that \u201can appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from.\u201d The Zoning Administrator refused their request, informing them that continuation of construction is not a \u201cproceeding.\u201d Petitioners then noted an appeal to the Board from the Zoning Administrator\u2019s refusal to stay construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Board heard both matters in March 2004. Shortly thereafter, the Board rendered its decision, agreeing with Petitioners that the second construction permit was issued unlawfully; however, it determined that Petitioners were not entitled to a stay of construction. Petitioners filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court. The City filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that Petitioners\u2019 petition was moot, as the second permit had been revoked pursuant to the Board\u2019s decision. The Circuit Court agreed with the City and dismissed the petition. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the Board in another unreported opinion. <em>Armstrong v. Bd. of Mun. &amp; Zoning Appeals, </em>No. 02525, September Term, 2004, 169 Md.App. 736 (filed 25 August 2006). The intermediate appellate court opined that the question regarding the stay was an exception to the mootness doctrine because it was a matter of public importance that consistently might evade judicial review of the merits. On the merits, the Court of Special Appeals held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>construction should have been halted when Petitioners filed their negative appeal to the Board from the issuance of the second permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\n<em>The Third Construction Permit &amp; The Occupancy Permit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">In March 2004, while the negative appeal of the second permit was pending before the Board, the City passed, at Cresmont\u2019s request, the ordinance apparently needed to allow the thirty-three off-street parking spaces that Cresmont desired on the Property. One month later, DHCD issued to Cresmont a new construction permit. In May 2004, Petitioners noted a negative appeal to the Board in which they objected to the new permit on the ground that the project, if developed and used as Cresmont intended, would exceed the allowable dwelling unit density in the B-3-2 Community Commercial District in which the Property is located.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>tion on the Property, however, continued notwithstanding the appeal (having started again pursuant to the second construction permit issued in January), and, in August 2004, DHCD issued to Cresmont an occupancy permit for twenty-six dwelling units on the Property. Shortly thereafter, Petitioners noted another negative appeal to the Board, this time challenging the issuance of the occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">On 23 November 2004, nearly two months after the completion of the construction of Cresmont Loft, the Board held a hearing on Petitioners\u2019 negative appeal of the construction permit issued in April of that year. Petitioners\u2019 negative appeal of the occupancy permit, however, remained pending. At the hearing, Petitioners argued that the Property was not going to house the twenty-six dwelling units for which the construction permit was issued. Although there were twenty-six four-bedroom suites, Petitioners urged that the suites were not dwelling units. They claimed that the developer intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>to lease separately each of the four bedrooms in each of the suites. Thus, as this argument proceeded, the Property actually housed 104 individual \u201crooming units.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Cresmont countered that each of the twenty-six suites satisfied the Code definition of a \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A \u201cdwelling unit,\u201d Cresmont observed, is a rental unit that contains a bathroom, kitchen facilities, and is occupied by a \u201cfamily.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cresmont proffered that the tenants of each suite would constitute a \u201cfamily,\u201d despite having separate leases, because they would be \u201cliving together as a single housekeeping unit,\u201d as required by the Code definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d Thus, accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ing to Cresmont, the project complied with the construction permit\u2019s allowance of twenty-six dwelling units.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Petitioners also complained that a fence erected by Cresmont restricted unlawfully their access to an alley<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of common use. They also asserted that the location of a transformer on the Property violated the rear yard requirements of Section 6-412(e) of the Code, which call for a minimum yard size of 30 feet deep in the zone, and that enclosure of the transformer by a visual screen was required by Section 6-405(c)(1) of the Code.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Cresmont responded that it owned the alley in question, which was closed to the public by an ordinance passed by the City, and that it was otherwise in compliance with the provisions of the Code cited by Petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">At the hearing, Petitioners introduced several of Cresmont Loft\u2019s promotional materials which made clear that Cresmont intended to rent the twenty-six suites to a total of 104 individual tenants. One advertisement listed a total of 104 \u201cunits\u201d available for rent. A website provided that \u201c[ejach unrelated resident will sign a separate lease.\u201d Petitioners also introduced the affidavit of a \u201cpotential tenant\u201d who inquired about renting at Cresmont Loft. She stated that \u201c[t]he woman who answered the phone said, \u2018You have to understand that [you] would only be renting the bedroom.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The Cresmont Loft standard lease agreement was also introduced. The lease was a form with certain blanks to be filled-in; the beginning and ending dates of the tenancy were to be inserted, among other terms. In pertinent part, the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Description of Leased Premises: 2807 Cresmont Avenue, Apartment #__., Bedroom #_ Baltimore, Maryland 21211</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">It is understood that the Tenant\u2019s premises consists of the exclusive use and occupancy of the dwelling unit described above, including the sole use of Bedroom #.__ and the shared use and occupancy of the bathroom(s), kitchen and living/dining areas with the other co-tenants of Apartment #_(the \u201cPremises\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay all costs and expenses for damage to the bedroom leased by Tenant (including, but not limited to, replacement or repair of all broken or damaged furnishings or fixtures, and any defacement of or damage to walls, ceilings, floors and doors), regardless of whether such damage is caused by Tenant or Tenant\u2019s guests or invitees. It is understood that Tenant will be occupying an apartment unit with other co-tenants, and Tenant shall also be held liable for a pro-rata share of any damages to the common areas of the apartment unit and its furnishings, fixtures, walls, ceilings, floors, and doors unless the party solely responsible for any such damage can be reasonably ascertained. The cost of repairing any such damage/repair shall be specifically deemed additional rent. Accordingly, Tenant must exercise responsibility to see that the entire apartment unit is maintained in good order and repair. No rent payment shall be reduced or offset for Tenant-incurred expenses under any circumstances whatsoever, except as otherwise required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">It is understood that the apartment unit in which the Premises are located contains one or more bedroom(s) in which other co-tenant(s) may reside. For purposes of operating efficiency, Landlord reserves the right, upon fifteen (15) days\u2019 written notice, when possible, to require Tenant to change bedrooms within the apartment unit as well as the right to relocate Tenant to another apartment unit within the Cresmont Loft apartment building. Landlord also re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>serves the right to assign tenants to other bedrooms in the apartment unit in which the Premises are located. Landlord, to the extent practical, will honor tenants\u2019 requests for the sharing of a particular apartment unit. Upon any Tenant\u2019s request for relocation, a new security deposit may be required. In no event shall Landlord (regardless of the negligence of the Landlord) be held responsible for problems or disagreements arising out of any difference in personality, style of living, etc. among co-tenants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Joan Floyd, one of the Petitioners, also testified that a fence erected by Cresmont restricted public access to a twenty-foot-wide right-of-way, which she characterized as an alley of long public use. Ms. Floyd\u2019s garage abuts a ten-feet-wide alley to which the right-of-way in question previously provided vehicular access. According to her, she could no longer drive her car in or out of her garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In February 2005, the Board issued a written decision affirming the issuance of the third construction permit. The Board recounted Petitioners\u2019 arguments, but concluded summarily that the construction permit was issued properly. Petitioners filed in the Circuit Court a petition for judicial review, claiming that the Board did not hold a public deliberation and vote and that the Board\u2019s decision did not include the required findings of fact or conclusions of law explaining the basis for its decision. On 17 November 2005, the Circuit Court remanded the matter to the Board to \u201cpublicly deliberate on said record, issues, testimony, and evidence, <em>\\ </em>] vote in public, and [ ] render a decision in writing, setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, the Board held a public deliberation and vote on 7 March 2006, at which it affirmed the issuance of the construction permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">On the same day, the Board conducted a hearing on Petitioners\u2019 negative appeal of the August 2004 occupancy permit. Petitioners argued, as they did at the hearing on their negative appeal of the third construction permit, that the twenty-six suites did not qualify as dwelling units because the tenants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>renting them were not \u201cfamilies.\u201d They entered into evidence the same materials from the hearing on the appeal of the third construction permit. Cresmont presented the testimony of Brian Swift, the Director of Property Management for the company that manages Cresmont Loft. According to Swift, all leases are for a term of one year,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and all tenants in a suite are equally \u201cresponsible for the care and maintenance of the apartment unit.\u201d He acknowledged that \u201cthe leases are tied to each individual bedroom\u201d; however, he claimed that each tenant has \u201cthe exclusive use to that entire four bedroom unit.\u201d The Board publicly deliberated and voted to affirm the issuance of the occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On 23 June 2006, the Board issued written decisions denying Petitioners\u2019 appeal of the occupancy permit and, again, denying their appeal of the April 2004 construction permit. In its decision on the occupancy permit, the Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATv\">Based on the evidence presented and the application of the relevant provisions of the Zoning Code, the Board makes the following findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">1. The Board finds that each apartment constitutes a separate unit with each having four bedrooms, kitchen facilities, two bathrooms, and a living area and dining area. The Board finds that the above arrangement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>complies with the definition of a \u201cDwelling Unit\u201d as stated in Section 1-137 of the Zoning Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">2. The Board finds that under the definition of \u201cFamily\u201d as stated in Section 1-142 of the Zoning Code, each dwelling unit may have up to four unrelated people living together as a single housekeeping unit within the dwelling unit. As a result, the Board finds that even though the four occupants of a dwelling unit have separate leases with the lessor, such arrangement does not alter the fact that they are living together as a single housekeeping unit where the testimony established that they would be sharing normal household responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning and other related household duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As a result, the Board finds that the use of each of the dwelling units by four unrelated people who live together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit complies with the definition of \u201cfamily\u201d in Section 1-142 of the Zoning Code.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">3. Upon reviewing the record and the issues presented, and after considering the testimony and evidence, the Board finds that Permit No. COM2004-19844 [the occupancy permit] was issued in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Zoning Code and thus sustains the action of the Zoning Administrator in approving the issuance of the permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Petitioners filed in the Circuit Court a petition for judicial review, claiming that the Board erred in determining that four unrelated individuals with separate leases constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d and that the Board erred in failing to determine that the occupancy permit was issued in violation of Section 2-404(a) of the Code, which prohibits the issuance of occupancy permits before construction is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The written decision regarding the construction permit, however, prompted Petitioners to write to the Board\u2019s executive director and again complain that the decision, like the earlier one, was insufficient for purposes of meaningful judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>review. Petitioners alleged that the decision did not address all of the issues put before the Board. They indicated that they would file a petition for judicial review asking the Circuit Court to remand the matter for the Board to make further findings of fact and conclusions of law, unless the Board rendered a new decision in which it did those things sufficiently. The Board acquiesced and convened another public deliberation and vote in September 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On 2 November 2006, the Board issued its third (and final) written decision affirming the issuance of the April 2004 construction permit. In pertinent part, the Board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">1) The Board finds that the use of the property cannot be considered 104 rooming units. The arrangement of the units each with four bedrooms and a kitchen providing cooking facilities to the occupants does not fit with the definition of \u201crooming unit\u201d under Section 1-186 of the Zoning Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">2) The Board finds that under the definition of \u201cFamily\u201d as stated in Section 1-142 of the Zoning Code, each dwelling unit may have up to four unrelated people living together as a single housekeeping unit within the dwelling unit. The Board finds that even though the four occupants of a dwelling unit have separate lease agreements with the lessor, such arrangements do[] not alter the fact that they are living together as a single housekeeping unit. As a result the Board finds that the use of each of the dwelling units by four unrelated people who live together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit complies with the definition of \u201cFamily\u201d in Section 1-142 of the Zoning Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">6) The Board finds that this structure contains 26 dwelling units, with each having four bedrooms, kitchen facilities, two bathrooms, and a living and dining area. The Board finds that the units comply with the definition of a \u201cDwelling Unit\u201d as stated in Section 1-187 of the Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>7) The Board finds that the Negative Appellants raised concerns about two separate alleys. The previous use of 2807-85 Cresmont was several groups of one story garages that contained a variety of uses and tenants. There was a 20 foot wide by 119 foot alley that served these garages. This alley did not serve as a secondary means of vehicular access to the properties fronting on Howard Street or W. 29th Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">The garages were razed several years ago and the lot became unimproved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">The alley was closed per Ordinance No. 03-548 and the area was consolidated into the 2807-35 Cresmont Avenue lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">The other alley in question is the alley in the rear of the properties fronting on the 2800 block of N. Howard Street. Ms. Joan Floyd testified that the development plan constricts, reduces and obstructs public use of the rear alley in this block. Ms. Floyd submitted photographs of the alley prior to the demolition of the garages; a copy of an aerial photograph of the block from 1926/27 and a copy of the 1928 Sanborn Map of this block. The Board finds that the alley in the rear of 2824 thru 2839 N. Howard Street is a 10 foot wide alley as shown on the real property plat for Block 3650C. The Board also notes that the 1928 Sanborn Map also shows that the same alley was a 10 foot wide alley at the time. While this development makes it more difficult to turn into the rear of the properties fronting on N. Howard Street, the Board finds that there has been no change or reduction in the use of the alley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The Board also determined that Petitioners failed to show that the transformer on the Property violated the rear yard requirements demanded by Section 6-412(e) of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Petitioners filed a timely petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court, alleging that the Board erred in determining that four unrelated individuals with separate leases constitute a \u201cfamily,\u201d in ruling that the Cresmont Loft project did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>reduce their access to an alley of long public use, and in failing to determine that the transformer violated the Code\u2019s rear yard requirements. On 1 March 2007, the Circuit Court ordered consolidation for hearing of the petition challenging the Board\u2019s decision on the construction permit and the petition challenging the Board\u2019s decision on the occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">On 9 May 2007, the Circuit Court affirmed the decisions of the Board. Petitioners timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported decision, affirmed in part and reversed in part. <em>Armstrong v. Mayor of Balt., </em>No. 00883, September Term, 2007, 181 Md.App. 734 (Md. Ct. Spec.App. filed 14 July 2008). The intermediate appellate court upheld the Board\u2019s determinations that the Property contained twenty-six \u201cdwelling units\u201d and that the fence erected by Cresmont did not restrict unlawfully Petitioners\u2019 access to an alley of public use. The court disregarded Petitioners\u2019 argument that the occupancy permit was unlawful because it was issued before construction on the Property was complete, observing that Petitioners did not ask the Board to take any action on that point and did not indicate what relief they sought. The Court of Special Appeals, however, reversed the Board on the issue of whether the transformer violated the Code\u2019s rear yard requirements, noting that it was Cresmont\u2019s obligation, not Petitioners\u2019, \u201cto supply the Board with a plat showing the dimensions of the lot and the location and the dimensions of all the existing and proposed structures and uses thereon.\u201d Because Cresmont did not do so, the court could not affirm the Board\u2019s decision in favor of Cresmont in that regard. The court also observed that it could not affirm the Board with respect to the transformer, in any event, because the Board failed to address Petitioners\u2019 claim that it needed to be enclosed by a screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We granted Petitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether \u201cthe arranged, intended, designed, and actual use of Cresmont [Loft] was and is 26 \u2018dwelling units\u2019 for 26 \u2018families\u2019 \u201d and to determine whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to justify the Board\u2019s conclusion that the fence erected by Cresmont did not impede access to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>alley commonly used by neighborhood residents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Armstrong v.

In a R-3-2 Community Commercial District, such as the one in which the Property is located, the minimum lot area is calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">(i) 550 square feet per rooming unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(ii) 750 square feet per efficiency unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">(iii) 1,100 square feet per other dwelling unit.

The City, however, urges that each suite constitutes a \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d If the City is correct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>there are twenty-six dwelling units on the Property, exactly the maximum number allowed by the Bulk Regulations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Code defines a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d as \u201c1 or more rooms in a dwelling!<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>] that: (1) are used as living quarters for occupancy by 1 family; and (2) contain permanently installed bathroom and kitchen facilities reserved for the occupants of the room or rooms.\u201d BCZC \u00a7 1-187. Thus, for the City to prevail in its assertion that the suites are \u201cdwelling units,\u201d the tenants of each suite must meet the Code\u2019s land use definition of a \u201cfamily.\u201d The definition of \u201cfamily,\u201d therefore, is the focal point of this case. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">(a) <em>In general.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201cFamily\u201d means one of the following, together with usual household helpers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">(1) an individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">(2) or more people related by blood, marriage, or adoption, living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">(3) <em>a group of not more than k people, who need not be related by blood, marriage, or adoption, living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit. </em>[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">(b) <em>Roomers included.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">\u201cFamily\u201d includes, with respect to those listed in subsection (a)(1) or (2) only, up to 2 roomers within the dwelling unit, as long as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>(1) they share a common entrance and cooking and bathroom facilities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">(2) in the case of a multiple-family dwelling, no more than 2 roomers are in the entire dwelling, regardless of the number of dwelling units.t<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">(c) <em>Exclusions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">In no case, does more than 4 unrelated people, a rooming house, a hotel, or a fraternity or sorority house constitute a family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">BCZC \u00a7 1-142 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The City asseverates that the tenants of each suite may be deemed a \u201cfamily\u201d under sub-Section (a)(3) of the above definition because, so the City claims, they live together as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d Petitioners insist, however, that each individual Cresmont Loft tenant is a family under subSection (a)(1). According to Petitioners, the terms of the tenants\u2019 leases prevent them from \u201cliving together as a single housekeeping unit\u201d because they each have a separate lease agreement with Cresmont and Cresmont reserves the right, pursuant to the leases, to move any tenant to another suite in the Property or into another bedroom within the suite in which she or he currently resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The Code does not define the phrase \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d; however, it is the pivotal term in our assessment of whether the Board concluded properly that the tenants of a suite at Cresmont Loft constitute a \u201cfamily,\u201d and, in turn, that each suite is a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d for purposes of the Code\u2019s Bulk Regulations. The parties agree that the City adopted the term \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d as part of the Code definition of \u201cfamily\u2019 in 1971 in the course of creating a more comprehensive zoning scheme for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Neither side in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>this case suggested that there was any relevant legislative history that might illuminate what the City intended the term to mean. Our considerable independent research in that regard also was unavailing. Nevertheless, the phrase \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d is found with some frequency in the zoning codes of other municipalities and local governments across the country, and the attendant judicial opinions interpreting those codes help us to triangulate on a common and ordinary sense of the phrase as used in comparable land use settings.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">When interpreting a statute or ordinance, courts presume that the enacting legislative body uses \u201c \u2018familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense,\u2019 \u201d unless the legislature indicates a contrary intent. <em>Trinity Assembly of God, </em>407 Md. at 92, 962 A.2d at 427 (quoting <em>United States v. Dodson, </em>291 F.3d 268, 271 (4th Cir.2002)). Although there is no reported Maryland appellate opinion defining or applying the term \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d the phrase has been part of the national land-use dialogue for a considerable time. According to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, \u201c[t]he use of the \u2018single housekeeping unit\u2019 formulation flowed from its use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>by leading commentators on zoning.\u201d <em>In re Appeal of Miller, </em>511 Pa. 631, 515 A.2d 904, 907 n. 3 (1986) (citing Edward M. Bassett, Zoning 189 (1940 ed.)). The court offered the following epistemological lesson on the term\u2019s history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">Alfred Bettman in a law review article written in 1924 stated the proposition that \u201cpromotion of the single family home ... is deemed good public policy in America.\u201d Bettman, <em>Constitutionality of Zoning, </em>37 Harv. L.Rev. 834, 839-40 (1924). From that point \u201czoning spread swiftly, particularly in suburban communities.\u201d J.R. Richards, <em>Zoning For Direct Social Control, </em>5 Duke Law Journal 761, 767 (1982). At an early stage of that development the legitimacy of exclusive single-family districts was settled. However, the question that emerged was how, if at all, a given ordinance should define the term \u201cfamily.\u201d Initially, a significant number of ordinances resolved that issue by leaving the word undefined. <em>See, e.g., </em>Baltimore, Md., Code art. 49 \u00a7 1 (1928); Birmingham, Ala., General Code Ordinance 1101-C, art. I, \u00a7 1 (1930). The consequence of that approach was to leave the resolution of the term \u201csingle family\u201d to the courts. <em>See, e.g., Brady v. Superior Court, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 69, 77-82, 19 Cal.Rptr. 242, 247-49 (1962); <em>Region 10 Client Management, Inc. v. Town of Hampstead, </em>120 N.H. 885, 887, 424 A.2d 207, 208-09 (1980); <em>Carroll v. Washington Township Zoning Comm\u2019n, </em>63 Ohio St.2d 249, 251, 408 N.E.2d 191, 193 (1980). The weakness of that strategy was the uncertainty it created and also the attendant cost of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">As the dissatisfaction with reliance solely upon judicial interpretation for the definition of the term \u201cfamily\u201d became increasingly apparent, the drafters of those ordinances attempted to legislatively set forth a more precise meaning within the ordinances. One of the early formulations used to define \u201cfamily\u201d within the terms of those provisions was that of a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926). The ordinance in effect, in the instant Township prior to the 1978 amendment, used the \u201chousekeeping unit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>formulation. Regrettably, this attempt to define \u201cfamily\u201d did not supply the degree of clarity it was intended to provide. A review of the cases throughout the country indicates that the change served only to focus the litigation upon a determination as to the meaning of a \u201chousekeeping unit.\u201d In those cases interpreting zoning ordinances wherein the \u201cfamily\u201d limitation had been defined as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d many extended family groups were deemed to fall within that category. The use of this test was viewed as extending beyond the occupancy by a one-family unit to a determination as to whether it was a one-housekeeping unit. <em>See Neptune Park Ass\u2019n v. Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 357, 84 A.2d 687 (1951). The focus was on whether the unit functioned as a family unit, rather than on the respective relationships that existed between the members of the unit. <em>See, e.g., City of Syracuse v. Snow, </em>123 Misc. 568, 205 N.Y.S. 785 (Sup.Ct.1924) (\u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d held not to exclude a college sorority); <em>Robertson v. Western Baptist Hospital, </em>267 S.W.2d 395 (Ct. of Appeals of Ky.1954) (use of a residence as a home for about 20 nurses constituted a permitted use under a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d test); <em>Boston-Edison Protective Ass\u2019n v. Paulist Fathers, </em>306 Mich. 253, 10 N.W.2d 847 (1943), 306 Mich. 253, 10 N.W.2d 847, 148 A.L.R. 364 (approved the use of a dwelling house in a highly restricted district as a residence for Roman Catholic priests).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>Miller, </em>515 A.2d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">As noted in Rathkopfs treatise on zoning, \u201c[i]n the past, courts have interpreted [the phrase \u2018single housekeeping unit\u2019] in a rather elastic way, generally ruling that any living arrangement which makes use of unified house-keeping facilities satisfies such an ordinance.\u201d 3 Edward H. Ziegler, Jr. et al\u201e Rathkopf\u2019s The Law of Zoning and Planning 23-33 (Thompson Reuters 2009). A survey of relevant case law from other jurisdictions confirms this.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In <em>Miller, supra, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a homeowner, who allowed unrelated elderly and handicapped persons to live with her, did not violate a local ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>limiting the occupation of a home in her zoning district to one \u201cfamily,\u201d where \u201cfamily\u201d was defined by the ordinance as \u201cany number of persons living and cooking together as a single house-keeping unit.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 515 A.2d at 909. That court opined, based on the extensive history of the term, that \u201cthe \u2018single housekeeping unit\u2019 evolved as a term limiting the use [of a property] to a unit that functions in the manner of a family residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908. The court reasoned that the unrelated individuals living with the homeowner constituted a single housekeeping unit because the evidence established that they lived and cooked together, shared meals together, and had shared access to all areas of the premises. <em>Id. </em>Similarly in <em>Robertson v. W. Baptist Hosp., </em>267 S.W.2d 395 (Ky.1954), the Court of Appeals of Kentucky<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> held that a group of twenty nurses, who rented a large house near the hospital where they worked, constituted a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d In so doing, that court emphasized that the nurses had joint use of the home\u2019s parlor and \u201climited kitchen facilities,\u201d although each nurse was responsible for furnishing her own food. <em>Robertson, </em>267 S.W.2d at 396. In another case, <em>Linn County v. City of Hiawatha, </em>311 N.W.2d 95 (Iowa 1981), the Supreme Court of Iowa held that a foster home in which a married couple cared for six unrelated, developmentally-disabled children constituted a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d There, the court rejected the argument that, because the children\u2019s Social Security benefits covered the cost of maintaining them in the home, the setting was akin to a boarding house. <em>Linn County, </em>311 N.W.2d at 100. The court reasoned that, in effect, \u201c \u2018the duties and responsibilities of the occupants [of the foster home] in ... maintaining a household ... cannot be distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>guished from those performed by other home dwellers in the community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(ellipses in original) (quoting <em>Twp. of Wash. v.

The student roommates shared the common areas of the house, as well as a telephone line; they \u201coften ate meals together in small groups, cooked for each other, and generally shared the household chores, grocery shopping, and yard work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Like the tenants of Cresmont Loft, the roommates in <em>Vallorosi </em>had separate lease agreements with the landlord. <em>See id. </em>Each lease was for a term of four months (the length of a semester) and was renewable at the term\u2019s end. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The <em>Vallorosi </em>court framed the \u201cnarrow issue before [it]\u201d as \u201cwhether there [wa]s sufficient credible evidence in th[e] record to sustain the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the occupancy of the defendants\u2019 dwelling by these ten college students constituted a single house-keeping unit as defined by the Glassboro ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 894. Answering in the affirmative, the court highlighted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The students ate together, shared household chores, and paid expenses from a common fund. Although the students signed four-month leases, the leases were renewable if the house was \u201cin order\u201d at the end of the term. Moreover, the students testified to their own intention to remain in the house throughout college, and there was no significant evidence of defections up to the time of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 894.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The \u201cnarrow issue\u201d before this Court is whether the Board\u2019s decisions affirming the issuance of the April 2004 construction permit and the August 2004 occupancy permit were supported by substantial evidence. Viewing the evidence of record in a light most favorable to the Board, we hold that they were. The Cresmont Loft form lease agreement provides that a tenant has the sole use of her or his bedroom and the \u201cshared use and occupancy of the bathroom(s), kitchen and living/dining areas\u201d of the apartment in which she or he resides. It further establishes that the tenant is \u201cliable for a pro-rata share of any damages to the common areas of the apartment unit ... unless the party solely responsible for any such damage can be reasonably ascertained.\u201d Moreover, according to the undisputed testimony of the property manager, Brian Swift, Cresmont Loft leases are for a term of one year. Mr. Swift also echoed that a tenant has \u201cthe exclusive right to th[e] entire four bedroom unit\u201d and that she or he is equally \u201cresponsible for the care and maintenance of the apartment unit.\u201d As observed in the cases discussed herein, shared access to the premises and joint responsibility for the care thereof are significant considerations. <em>See Robertson, </em>267 S.W.2d at 396; <em>Vallorosi, </em>568 A.2d at 890; <em>Miller, </em>515 A.2d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Cresmont received a construction permit for a twenty-six unit apartment building and, ultimately, an occupancy permit authorizing the Property\u2019s use for twenty-six \u201cdwelling units.\u201d In determining that the permits were issued properly, the Board observed, in its decision on the occupancy permit, \u201ceven though the four occupants of [a Cresmont Loft apartment] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>have separate lease agreements with the lessor, such arrangement does not alter the fact that they are living together as a single housekeeping unit where the testimony established that they would be sharing normal household responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning and other related household duties.\u201d It made essentially the same finding in its final decision on the construction permit. Thus, the Board reasoned that the tenants of each suite constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d under BCZC \u00a7 1-142(a)(3), rendering each suite in the Property a \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d The Board\u2019s rationale and assessment of the evidence were reasonable, and, accordingly, we shall not disturb its conclusion. <em>See Trinity Assembly of God, </em>407 Md. at 78, 962 A.2d at 419 (observing that the fact-finding of a zoning body will not be reversed if it was reasonable); <em>Bereano, </em>403 Md. at 731, 944 A.2d at 547 (noting that, when reviewing an administrative decision, courts do not engage in an \u201cindependent analysis of the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Petitioners\u2019 flagship argument in opposition to the Board\u2019s conclusion lies in the Cresmont Loft lease agreement. Petitioners maintain that the tenants of a suite may not be a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d because each has a separate lease agreement \u201ctied to\u201d an individual bedroom, and, under those agreements, Cresmont reserves the right to move any of them to another suite at any time. We are not persuaded that these considerations compel a different conclusion than that reached by the Board. In <em>Vallorosi, </em>the ten college students residing together had separate lease agreements with their landlord. 568 A.2d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In addition, the fact that the Cresmont Loft leases are \u201ctied to\u201d individual bedrooms, with Cresmont reserving the right to move a tenant to another suite, is not inconsistent with the rights and obligations of the tenants <em>with respect to one another </em>(namely the right to shared use of the common areas of the apartment and the joint obligation to maintain the apartment). Petitioners do not offer any reason for concluding that four unrelated individuals whose leases are \u201ctied to\u201d individual bedrooms are in a living arrangement that, for purposes of the \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d analysis, differs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>materially from an arrangement in which four unrelated individuals, in similar circumstances, collectively sign a lease for a four-bedroom apartment. <em>Cf. Linn County, </em>311 N.W.2d at 100 (holding that married couple and six unrelated foster children were a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d because their duties and responsibilities in the home were indistinguishable from those of other homeowners in the community). Furthermore, by signing a Cresmont Loft lease agreement, a tenant ordinarily may expect to share an apartment with the same three suitemates for the one-year duration of the lease. The mere possibility that one (or more) of the suitemates may be removed from the housekeeping unit in less than one year\u2019s time does not undermine the unit\u2019s stability or permanence to such a degree as to warrant reversal of the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Vallorosi, </em>568 A.2d at 894 (affirming lower court\u2019s determination that 10 college students living together constituted a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d despite the fact that each student\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>lease was for a term of four months, in part, because the students intended to renew their leases and continue living together).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Petitioners next posit that allowing the Board\u2019s decisions to stand leads to an absurd result in light of sub-Section (b) of the Code\u2019s definition of \u201cfamily,\u201d which extends the definition of \u201cfamily\u201d to include a group made up of an individual occupying a dwelling unit and not more than two \u201croomers,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> as long as the roomers \u201cshare a common entrance and cooking and bathroom facilities\u201d with the individual. BCZC \u00a7 1-142(b)(1). According to Petitioners, sub-Section (b) prohibits an individual from having more than two roomers. They argue, therefore, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">[I]f an individual occupant shares a common entrance, kitchen and bathroom facilities with one or two \u2018roomers,\u2019 the resultant group of two or three unrelated residents is considered a \u2018family\u2019 occupying a \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 under \u00a7 1-142(b)(1). The allowable number of \u2018roomers\u2019 ... is expressly limited to two; if the individual occupant should add a third \u2018roomer,\u2019 the resultant group of four unrelated residents is <em>not </em>a \u2018family\u2019 occupying a \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 under the plain language of \u00a7 l-142(b)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">The unambiguous limit of two \u2018roomers\u2019 per \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 under \u00a7 l-142(b)(l) <em>loses all meaning and effect </em>if \u00a7 1\u2014 142(a)(3) allows four unrelated individuals sharing a common entrance, kitchen and bathroom facilities to be considered a \u2018family\u2019 occupying a \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 <em>regardless of leasing arrangements. </em>It then becomes difficult to discern any purpose whatsoever for the application of the \u2018roomers\u2019 provision [in \u00a7 l-142(b)(l) ], since an individual with one or two roomers would already qualify as a \u2018family\u2019 of two or three unrelated individuals under the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 l-142(a)(3). Certainly, under the Board\u2019s broad read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ing, an individual sharing a common entrance, kitchen and bathroom facilities with one, two or even three \u2018roomers\u2019 would <em>always </em>be a \u2018family\u2019 of not more than four unrelated residents occupying a \u2018dwelling unit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">(italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Stated more plainly, Petitioners assert that the Board\u2019s notion of a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d under sub-Section (a)(3) so dilutes the statutory scheme that it renders nugatory subSection (b)\u2019s provision allowing an individual occupying a dwelling unit to have up to two roomers. This argument is not persuasive. The fatal defect in Petitioners\u2019 reasoning is that it assumes that an individual with \u201croomers,\u201d qualifying as a \u201cfamily\u201d under Section 1-142(b), necessarily would satisfy also the \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d standard of Section 1-142(a)(3), as applied by the Board. While the Board\u2019s decisions here cut a broad swath, they do not go so far as to negate the \u201croomers\u201d provision in sub-Section (b) as Petitioners claim. Indeed, the \u201croomers\u201d provision requires only that an individual occupant of a dwelling unit and her or his roomers \u201cshare a common entrance and cooking and bathroom facilities\u201d in order for them to qualify as a \u201cfamily\u201d under subSection (b). The evidence before the Board, however, established that each tenant of a Cresmont Loft apartment enjoyed shared use of the entire apartment (with the exception of the other bedrooms) and was jointly responsible for its maintenance and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In addition, the \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d standard ordinarily does not embrace circumstances in which one or more of the members of the purported unit are transient. <em>See Open Door Alcoholism Program, Inc. v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>200 N.J.Super. 191, 491 A.2d 17, 19, 22 (App.Div.1985) (holding that eleven people staying in a group home for alcoholics did not qualify as a \u201cfamily\u201d under the \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d standard because they \u201ccould leave at any time\u201d and the average length of stay was only six months); <em>cf. Planning and Zoning Comm\u2019n v. Synanon Found., Inc., </em>153 Conn. 305, 216 A.2d 442, 443 (1966) (applying a zoning ordinance that did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>not define the term \u201cfamily\u201d and holding that \u201can ever-changing aggregate of individuals\u201d did not constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d). The Board\u2019s decisions do not deviate from that general proposition, as the testimony of the property manager established that each of Cresmont Loft\u2019s tenants signs a one-year lease. The \u201croomers\u201d provision of Section l-142(b), however, facially allows for an individual occupant of a dwelling unit to rent space to transient roomers, as it places no limitations on such arrangements. Thus, certain arrangements between an individual occupying a dwelling unit and one or more roomers, which may qualify them as a \u201cfamily\u201d under sub-Section (b), might not be sufficient to qualify them as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Furthermore, the arrangements that sub-Section (b) allows need not be mutually exclusive with what subSection (a) allows. Therefore, the presence of one or more tenants in a dwelling unit who meet the definition of a \u201croomer\u201d does not mean necessarily that the entire group might not qualify also as a \u201cfamily\u201d under sub-Section (a)(3) by otherwise living together as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d Thus, Section l-142(a)(3) as applied by the Board does not render sub-Section (b) nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Petitioners also direct our attention to <em>Prospect Gardens Convalescent Home, Inc. v. City of Norwalk, </em>32 Conn.Supp. 214, 347 A.2d 637 (1975), as support for the proposition that the tenants of a Cresmont Loft apartment are not a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d In that ease, the owner of a convalescent home leased three houses near the convalescent home to as many as thirty of its employees. After the local health department notified the owner that the employee housing facilities constituted rooming houses, the owner filed suit against the city seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The owner alleged that the employee-occupants of the houses were \u201cfamilies\u201d under an ordinance defining the term as \u201cany number of individuals living and cooking together as a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>housekeeping unit.\u201d <em>Prospect Gardens, </em>347 A.2d at 639. The Superior Court rejected the owner\u2019s argument, reasoning that the employee-occupants were not families because they each paid rent individually to their employer, there was no showing that they cooked and/or ate together, and they rarely were together as a group due to the fact that they worked different shifts at the convalescent home. <em>Id. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We reject Petitioners\u2019 favored comparison of <em>Prospect Gardens </em>to the present case. In <em>Prospect Gardens, </em>the three houses at issue housed, respectively, seven, ten, and eleven employees. <em>Id. </em>at 639. Because controlling population density is one of the objectives of limiting what constitutes a \u201cfamily,\u201d the court observed that the high number of people comprising each purported housekeeping unit mitigated against finding that they constitute a family. <em>Id. </em>at 641. In the instant case, however, there are only four tenants comprising the \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d It is not apparent whether the <em>Prospect Gardens </em>court would have resolved that case in the same way if the houses at issue housed only four employees each. Moreover, to the extent that <em>Prospect Gardens </em>is inconsistent with the Board\u2019s decisions here, we note that the <em>Prospect Gardens </em>decision is that of a trial court, albeit of a respected sister state\u2019s judiciary. Other opinions by state supreme courts persuade us that we should not hold that the Board here improperly construed or applied the term \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d <em>See Robertson, </em>267 S.W.2d at 397 (affirming trial court\u2019s decision that twenty nurses sharing a house constituted a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d because they had joint use of a parlor and kitchen facilities); <em>Vallorosi, </em>568 A.2d at 894 (affirming trial court\u2019s decision that ten unrelated college students sharing a house constituted a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d despite fact that they each had a separate lease with their landlord).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Petitioners next claim that Cresmont\u2019s erection of a fence impedes their access to an alley of long common use and that the Board\u2019s conclusion otherwise was not supported by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>stantial evidence. The \u201calley\u201d in question is located on what is now the Property. According to Petitioner Joan Floyd, who testified at the hearing on the negative appeal of the construction permit, it is a twenty-foot-wide right-of-way.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> She stated that she lives on North Howard Street and has used the right-of-way to access her garage since moving into her house in 1996. She claimed essentially that her garage is obsolete now because the fence erected by Cresmont precludes her from using the right-of-way. She averred also that other public and private users, such as the Fire Department and Baltimore Gas and Electric, occasionally used the right-of-way and that police even ticketed cars that parked there. Additionally, Petitioners produced aerial photographs and a 1928 map of the neighborhood reflecting the presence of the right-of-way. The map also showed that there is a ten-foot-wide alley behind Ms. Floyd\u2019s house. That alley was accessible previously by the right-of-way at issue. Ms. Floyd\u2019s garage abuts the ten-foot-wide alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In its decision on Petitioners\u2019 appeal of the construction permit, the Board found, with respect to the issue of the right-of-way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">[T]he Negative Appellants raised concerns about two separate alleys. The previous use of 2807-35 Cresmont [the Property] was several groups of one story garages that contained a variety of uses and tenants. There was a 20 foot wide by 119 foot alley that served these garages. This alley did not serve as a secondary means of vehicular access to the properties fronting on Howard Street or W. 29th Street [the houses owned by Petitioner Floyd and others].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">The garages were razed several years ago and the lot became unimproved. The alley was closed per Ordinance No. 03-548 and the area was consolidated into the 2807-25 Cresmont Avenue Lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>The other alley in question is the alley in the rear of the properties fronting on the 2800 block of N. Howard Street. Ms. Joan Floyd testified that the development plan constricts, reduces and obstructs public use of the rear alley in this block. Ms. Floyd submitted photographs of the alley prior to the demolition of the garages; a copy of an aerial photograph of the block from 1926/27 and the 1928 Sanborn Map of this block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">The Board finds that the alley in the rear of 2824 thru 2830 N. Howard Street is a 10 foot wide alley as shown on the real property plat for Block 3650C. The Board also notes that the 1928 Sanborn Map also shows a that the same alley was a 10 foot wide alley at that time. While this development makes it more difficult to turn into the rear of the properties fronting on N. Howard Street, the Board finds that there has been no change in the use of the alley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The Board\u2019s conclusion on the alley/right-of-way issue was supported by substantial evidence. The Code defines an \u201calley\u201d as \u201ca way, other than a street, that: (1) is open to common use; and (2) affords a secondary means of vehicular access to adjacent or adjoining property.\u201d BCZC \u00a7 1-108. The unrefuted evidence adduced by Petitioners suggests that the twenty-foot-wide right-of-way, at some time; satisfied the definition of an \u201calley\u201d; however, even if that were so, the City, as noted by the Board, enacted an ordinance closing the right-of-way. Petitioners do not allege that the Board was mistaken on that point; nor do they allege, at least in this case, that the ordinance was invalid. Additionally, the evidence adduced by Petitioners shows that the alley abutting Ms. Floyd\u2019s garage has been ten feet wide since the 1920s. They did not present any evidence suggesting that that alley was reduced in size by Cresmont\u2019s development of the Property. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s determination\u2014that Cresmont did not restrict an alley of public use by erecting a fence on the Property\u2014is \u201c \u2018sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trinity Assembly of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>God, </em>407 Md. at 77-78, 962 A.2d at 418 (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">For the reasons discussed, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s conclusion that the tenants residing in a Cresmont Loft apartment constitute a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d and, therefore, a \u201cfamily\u201d as defined by the Code. Thus, each apartment in the Property is a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d and the Board properly affirmed DHCD\u2019s issuance of a construction permit and, ultimately, an occupancy permit to Cresmont for development and use of the Property. In addition, substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s determination that a fence erected on the Property did not restrict Petitioners\u2019 access to an alley of common use.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\">. <em>Armstrong v.

The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was a prolonged series of conflicts between the royal Houses of Valois and Plantagenet, each vying to rule France after the extinction of the Capetian line of French kings. The House of Valois (the ultimate victors) were native French. The Plantagenets were French-English and ruled England at the time. The Hundred Years\u2019 War gave history Joan of Arc. The instant case also has a central figure named Joan (one of the Petitioners), who, like her saintly antecedent, faithfully presses her cause, having battled the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore numerous times. Although Joan of Arc suffered an unfortunate fate, her principals, the House of Valois, ultimately succeeded.

In a 2 February 2004 order, the Circuit Court denied the petition on the basis that the November 2003 decision was on appeal; however, the court warned Cresmont and the City that \"[t ]he continuing construction at 2807-2835 Cresmont Avenue is proceeding upon a legally unstable foundation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">.

Second, they filed suit pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.

The City moved to dismiss the appeal in the intermediate appellate court, under Maryland Rule 8-602(a)(1),- as an appeal \u201cnot allowed by these rules or other law,\u201d reiterating its argument that the ordinance did not constitute a \"zoning action\u201d under Section 2.09(a)(1) of Article 66B.

On remand to the Circuit Court, the trial judge dismissed the petition for mootness, in light of a subsequent ordinance passed by the City that amended the definition of a \u201cparking lot\u201d to exclude accessory parking.

In June 2003, the court determined that the passage of the ordinance violated the Open Meetings Act and awarded an undetermined amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to Petitioners, but also granted summary judgment in favor of the City because, so the court determined, the ordinance was not voidable merely because of the Open Meetings Act violation.

It doesn't necessarily mean it has to [be] short-term. All of our leases are for a one-year period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Petitioners, however, do not explain how the above testimony was self-contradictory.

Petitioners did not ask this Court to decide whether the issuance of the occupancy permit to Cresmont before construction was finished violated Section 2-404(a) of the Code; nor did the City file a cross-petition asking us to decide whether the transformer violated the Code's rear yard requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\">.

Mayor of Balt., </em>207 Md. 401, 407, 114 A.2d 639, 641 (1955). Until then, the term \u201cfamily\u201d was not defined by the Code. <em>See id. </em>(holding that, where property owner sought to prove that four families lived in the building prior to 1931 for purposes of establishing the building\u2019s non-conforming use as a four-family dwelling, boarders did not constitute separate \u201cfamilies\u201d because they did not have their own \"housekeeping facilities,\u201d even though \"family\u201d was not defined expressly until 1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b499-5\">.

The ordinance at issue in <em>Vallorosi </em>defined \"family\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">one or more persons occupying a dwelling unit as a single non-profit housekeeping unit, who are living together as a stable and permanent living unit, being a traditional family unit or the functional equivalency [sic] thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">568 A.2d at 889 (alteration in original) (quoting Glassboro, N.J., Code \u00a7 107-3 (1986)). That definition does not diminish Vallorosi's persuasive value to the instant case. If anything, Glassboro\u2019s definition of \"family\u201d is less permissive than BCZC \u00a7 l-142(a) with regard to what types of living arrangements may qualify as a \"single housekeeping unit\u201d; however, it does not place an upper limit on the number of unrelated individuals that may qualify as a \"single housekeeping unit\u201d in the way that BCZC \u00a7 1-142(a)(3) does.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b503-5\">. We reiterate that the narrow scope of judicial review of administrative fact-finding guides our holding here. The fact that a tenant may be removed by the landlord from the purported housekeeping unit certainly weighs against a determination that the group of tenants comprises a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\" <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaffe, </em>398 Mass. 50, 494 N.E.2d 1342, 1344, 1347 (1986) (affirming criminal conviction for violation of an ordinance that precluded the use of a dwelling for more than one family; assuming the \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d standard applied, the conviction was supported by the facts that each of the eight tenants had her or his own mailbox and was subject to eviction at any time upon thirty days\u2019 notice without the eviction affecting the tenancies of the other tenants). Yet, as we emphasized on a previous occasion, \u201cfi]n judicial review of zoning matters, ... 'the correct test to be applied is whether the issue before the administrative body is 'fairly debatable,' that is, whether its determination is based upon evidence from which reasonable persons could come to different conclusions.' \" <em>White v.

Additionally, there was no evidence before the Board (that we can discern from the record) suggesting that Cresmont exercised its rights to shuffle tenants. Evidence of frequent changes to the makeup of a group sharing an apartment might compel a different outcome than that reached by the Board. <em>See Planning &amp; Zoning Comm'n v. Synanon Found., Inc., </em>153 Conn. 305, 216 A.2d 442, 443 (1966) (holding that \u201can ever-changing aggregate of individuals\u201d did not constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">. As previously noted, a \u201croomer\u201d is \u201can individual who: (1) occupies a room with a family in a dwelling unit; or (2) occupies a rooming unit for compensation.\u201d BCZC \u00a7 1-184. Here, we are dealing with the former.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">. Transiency is not the only factor that might prohibit a tenant from being part of a \"single housekeeping unit.\u201d We discuss transiency only as an example to explain that not all roomers (who may, or may not, be transient) would qualify as part of a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">.

Petitioners also argue that the intermediate appellate court upheld the Board for reasons not relied upon by the Board.
