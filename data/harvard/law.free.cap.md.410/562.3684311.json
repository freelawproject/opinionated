Your Honor, again the petition alleges that Ms. H., failed to see that her child attended school. Ms. H., testified that she got up early in the morning, because she had to be in school to work at 7:00. She got her daughter up. Her daughter left the house with her. She paid for a cab for her daughter to go to school after they determined it wasn\u2019t safe after a robbery at the school bus stop with her tote. She drove her to school sometimes herself. Her daughter said\u2014Monica also testified that some days she also got a ride from her aunt. Ms. H., never let her daughter just stay home from school. When Ms., H., received phone calls from the school that her daughter wasn\u2019t in class, she did leave work to go check\u2014a\u2014at home to make sure she was not there and then reported to the school. Your Honor, once she gets her daughter to school, which is her responsibility, she\u2019s not'\u2014\u2022 she\u2019s in the care and custody of the school. She has to go to work. She\u2019s not going to sit in school all day and follow her around. The statute says that she has to see that her daughter attends school and she did that. She did not fail to see that her child attended school. She got her there. Her daughter just decided that she wasn\u2019t going to go to class and she got up there and she testified to that. I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>think that should be attributed to Ms. H., Your Honor and I would ask that she be found not involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The prosecutor responded with the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apt\">[THE PROSECUTOR]:' Your Honor, the\u2014again this case boils down to credibility, and this is just very sad, and very pathetic. One of the reasons being the apathy, with which the [Appellant] testified. Counsel\u2014the apathy that was evident on the part of the child, Monica S. According to this [Appellant] she did everything she could, yet she admitted that she never once asked her daughter why don\u2019t you want to go to school. The statute clearly states that she has a responsibility to ensure that that child attends school or obtains some sort of instruction. She testified that she would get a cab, but she didn\u2019t always see the child get into the cab. There were times she would go up to the school, and the child would be there, but would not be in class, but that was not all the time. I\u2014I\u2014Your Honor, of those 74 days, it boils down to credibility. There\u2019s no way that she could say for sure that for those 74 days that child was in the school building or had even made it to school if she didn\u2019t see her get into the cab. I think that [Appellant] clearly, yes, she may have made an attempt by calling a cab and paying $10.00 per day, but she did not do everything she could to ensure that her child received the education that she needed to receive. All she did was to ground her. We don\u2019t know whether it was for hours, days, weeks or months. But all that child got was or all that happened was that she was told she couldn\u2019t go outside when she was missing so many days of school. And her mother knew from Ms. Nayes that there was a problem. I think she could have done more and I ask that you find her involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">At that point, the Circuit Court announced the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">THE COURT: I guess your case is a lot\u2014it is a lot different\u2014a lot like a lot of other cases coming here in these kinds of cases especially the testimony that\u2019s been presented here. And that is, whether or not I believe the testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>ny that\u2019s been presented to me. The [Sjtate\u2019s witnesses testified basically regarding the records that are contained and the number of days that you\u2019ve missed. And your lawyer is right to an extent. Seventy-four days have been missed in the 2005-2006 school year. Quite frankly only to 76\u2014seven of those may be directly attributable to\u2014attributable to you not sending the child to school and the child not attending school properly or being unexcused absences have\u2014in fact those seven may have been excused because the child was suspended. But what is probably shocking and telling in this case, one of the last questions the [Sjtate\u2019s attorney asked you. Did you ever talk to your child about why she wasn\u2019t going to school? To me that\u2019s a bit incomprehensible that the answer would be no. When the child was withdrawn in February because the child had missed 44 days by February 24, 2006 and you never talked to her. She goes to live with the father purportedly to try to get her on the right t[rjack to go to school. She comes back or re-enrolled somewhere around February\u2014strike that, March 17, then she misses another 26 to the end of the school year in June. You never talked to her to find out\u2014 ask her why and she\u2019s not going. And she was suspended, as you say, for cutting classes. You never\u2014after she\u2019s suspended you don\u2019t ask, baby why you being suspended, and you know you\u2019re suspended for cutting classes, what is your reason for cutting classes? I would have to say something is wrong. Either you talked to her or you knew that she wasn\u2019t going and you weren\u2019t encouraging her to going\u2014to go to school and\u2014or that she missed the six or seven days from school and you knew she missed the six or seven days from school and you didn\u2019t encourage her to go to school. So it is one of two. Did you talk to her and if you talked to her and you just encouraged her, or you just didn\u2019t give a durn that she wasn\u2019t going to school? And it appears as though you just didn\u2019t give a durn. That\u2019s what it appears as though. That\u2019s the\u2014and the hard cold reality of it all right now, I don\u2019t think it has registered on you or your daughter until today ... T\u2019m concluding that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>wasn\u2019t going to school because it is just hard for me to imagine someone is paying $10.00 a day basically every day to catch a taxi to school and you\u2019re going to ask\u2014you see the report card, you know she\u2019s been suspended. You know by February she\u2019s already missed 44 days and you\u2019re not going to ask. When you put all those pieces together, I\u2019m going to\u2014I can\u2019t help but conclude that the child was not attending school and the mother knew that she was not attending school and she was not encouraging her to attend school. And the court will find that the [Sjtate has proven its case. The court will, in fact, find the [Appellant] involved of the one count of this petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Circuit Court placed Appellant on unsupervised probation, Appellant noted an appeal of that disposition to the Court of Special Appeals, and filed a brief in which she presented a single argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">THE EVIDENCE WAS LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FINDING THAT THE APPELLANT VIOLATED MD.

Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 572 A.2d 174 (1990), while ordering that a Petition for Disciplinary Action be dismissed, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">[The Hearing Court] plainly rejected Clements\u2019s testimony[.] Thus, we eliminate from our analysis that aspect of Clements\u2019s defense.... The issue is whether Bar Counsel presented sufficient evidence of the charge to meet the clear and convincing standard of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 298, 572 A.2d at 179. Because the Circuit Court was entitled to reject all of Appellant\u2019s evidence, to determine whether the State presented sufficient evidence to meet the beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof, we are required to \u201celiminate\u201d Appellant\u2019s evidence from our analysis. Having done so, we must determine whether evidence that a high school student was not in his or her home-room when attendance was taken is sufficient to support the inference that the student did not attend school on that day. We conclude that, from evidence of the days that Monica was not in her homeroom on the days that she was marked absent, a reasonable trier of fact could reasonably find beyond a reasonable doubt that, for more than ten weeks of the 2005-2006 school year (1) Monica did not attend school, and (2) Appellant had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>see that Monica attended school during that period of time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Having concluded that the evidence presented by the State was sufficient as a matter of law to establish that Appellant failed to see that Monica attended school, we must then determine whether the verdict announced by the Circuit Court was based upon a clearly erroneous factual finding and/or a mistaken conclusion of law. In making this determination, we presume that the Circuit Court knows the applicable law and applied that law correctly. This presumption is <em>rebuttable, </em>however, and may be rebutted in several ways. For example,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in <em>Thornton v. State, </em>397 Md. 704, 919 A.2d 678 (2007), while holding that the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to prove that the Appellant had committed a second degree murder, this Court also held that, \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s mistaken conclusions of law, which modified the specific intent requirement and unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to Thornton, warrants our reversal of Thornton\u2019s conviction for murder in the second degree and a remand of the case for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 919 A.2d at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">This presumption was rebutted in the case at bar when the Circuit Court based its verdict upon an impermissible inference. In <em>VF Corp. v. Wrexham Aviation, </em>350 Md. 693, 715 A.2d 188 (1998), this Court stated that, \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s prerogative not to believe certain testimony ... does not constitute affirmative evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711, 715 A.2d at 196. In <em>Clements, supra, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>A refusal to believe evidence of a respondent, however, does not, of itself, supply affirmative evidence of the dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">319 Md. at 298, 572 A.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The record clearly shows that the Circuit Court\u2019s verdict was based in substantial part upon its finding that, because Appellant\u2019s \u201cincomprehensible\u201d testimony lacked credibility, the opposite of her exculpatory testimony must be true. For the reasons stated in <em>VF Corp., supra, </em>and <em>Clements, supra, </em>the Circuit Court erred in drawing this impermissible inference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore hold that, although Appellant was not entitled to a judgment in her favor as a matter of law, she is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Appellant also argues that she was entitled to a verdict in her favor on a ground that is certain to be raised during the retrial. According to Appellant, while it is her obligation to \u201csee that Monica attends school,\u201d it is the school system\u2019s obligation to see that Monica attends <em>classes </em>after she has arrived at school. The record shows that Ms. Nayes agreed with the assertion that, \u201conce [Monica] enters the school building[,] she\u2019s then in the care and custody of the Suitland High School[J\u201d For the reasons that follow, so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Whether the legislature intended to impose criminal liability on parents whose children go to school, but do not attend classes, presents an issue of statutory interpretation.

Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533, 823 A.2d 664, 668 (2003), citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 313, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979); <em>Moye v.

We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478, 649 A.2d at 337, citing <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d at 573, and <em>Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 182-83, 502 A.2d 496, 498 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Gloria H. was found in violation of Section 7-301(c) of the Education Article, Maryland Code (1978, 2006 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides: \u201c[e]ach person who has legal custody or care and control of a child who is 5 years old or older and under 16 shall see that the child <em>attends school </em>or receives instruction as required by this section.\u201d (Emphasis added). Here, the burden was on the State to prove that Gloria H. had legal custody or care and control of a child who is 5 years old or older and under 16 years old and failed to see that the child attended school. There is no dispute that Gloria H. had legal custody over Monica, who, at the time in dispute, was 14 years old. The only fact in dispute was whether Gloria H. failed to see that her child <em>attended school.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Attempting to meet its burden, the State relied on testimonial evidence that Gloria H. was aware that Monica was at school but not in class on the 67 days that Monica, who was 14, was marked absent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jacqueline Nayes, the pupil personnel worker, testified that she contacted Appellant in person at least five times during the school year, as well as telephoned Gloria H. several times. Ms. Nayes testified she advised Gloria H. that Monica was missing school and that something needed to be done. Gloria H., while admitting that she was aware of Monica\u2019s attendance problems, testified that, as a working single mother, she did everything she could to get Monica to school and never \u201cjust let her stay home.\u201d She testified to waking Monica up, arranging for a cab to drive Monica to school after Monica reported her fears of riding the bus because of her coat being stolen, and on some days, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>driving Monica to school, though Gloria H. worked at a job that required her to be at work before Monica left for school. Gloria H. also testified that on some days, when the school called her to say Monica was absent, she would leave work to go to the school, but would find Monica in the building. Most telling was Monica\u2019s testimony that she went to school every day, but did not always attend her classes; rather, she would hang out \u201cin the hallways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">While the trial judge disbelieved the totality of Gloria H.\u2019s testimony, he did so on the basis of his sense that Gloria H. never talked to Monica about her absences, which strained his credulity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">But what is probably shocking and telling in this case, one of the last questions the state\u2019s attorney asked you. Did you ever talk to your child about why she wasn\u2019t going to school? Did you ever talk to your child about why she wasn\u2019t going to school? To me that\u2019s a bit incomprehensible that the answer would be no. When the child was withdrawn in February because the child had missed 44 days by February 24, 2006 and you never talked to her. She goes to live with the father purportedly to try to get her on the right track to go to school. She comes back or re-enrolled somewhere around February\u2014strike that, March 17, then she misses another 26 to the end of the school year in June. You never talked to her to find out\u2014ask her why and she\u2019s not going. And she was suspended, as you say, for cutting classes. You never\u2014after she\u2019s suspended you don\u2019t ask, baby why you being suspended, and you know you\u2019re suspended for cutting classes, what is your reason for cutting classes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">I would have to say something is wrong. Either you talked to her or you knew that she wasn\u2019t going and you weren\u2019t encouraging her to going\u2014to go to school and\u2014or that she missed the six or seven days from school and you knew she missed the six or seven days from school and you didn\u2019t encourage her to go to school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">So it is one of two. Did you talk to her and if you talked to her and you just encouraged her, or you just didn\u2019t give a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>durn that she wasn\u2019t going to school? And it appears as though you just didn\u2019t give a durn. That\u2019s what it appears as though. That\u2019s the\u2014and the hard cold reality of it all right now, I don\u2019t think it has registered on you or your daughter until today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">I would find this ruling to be clearly erroneous, because it interjects that the parent must \u201ctalk\u201d to the child as an element of the crime or risk criminal culpability as a result of the judge\u2019s personal belief system.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">All of the evidence supports the conclusion that Gloria H. did not violate Section 7-301(c)\u2014she did see that Monica <em>attended </em>school\u2014that Monica was <em>at </em>school. Gloria H. drove Monica oftentimes, insured that she paid for a cab to take her, and that she went to school when she was called and found Monica in school, although the school staff obviously did not. Monica even testified that she went to school daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The majority, however, determines that the evidence was sufficient, but reverses Gloria H.\u2019s conviction, based upon the premise that \u201cwe must then determine whether the verdict announced by the Circuit Court was based upon a clearly erroneous factual finding and/or a mistaken conclusion of law.\u201d Citing <em>Thornton v. State, </em>397 Md. 704, 919 A.2d 678 (2007), the majority opines that the case must be retried because the trial court did not believe Gloria H.\u2019s testimony and relied on an \u201cimpermissible inference\u201d that \u201cthe opposite of her exculpatory testimony must be true.\u201d In <em>Thornton, </em>however, we held that \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s mistaken <em>conclusions of law, </em>which modified the specific intent requirement and unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to Thornton, warrants our reversal of Thornton\u2019s conviction for murder in the second degree and a remand of the case for a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 919 A.2d at 700. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">In the second case relied on by the majority, <em>VF Corp. v. Wrexham Aviation Corp., </em>350 Md. 693, 715 A.2d 188 (1998), a civil case, this Court reversed one of the judgments because of a lack of clear and convincing evidence of fraud. We explored the circumstantial evidence presented and determined that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>constituted \u201can extremely thin reed upon which to base any inference of fraud ... it certainly does not amount to clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 715 A.2d at 197. Our explanation of the jury\u2019s alleged disbelief and reliance on the opposite was within a lengthy discussion of insufficience, rather than the determinative basis for reversal. We stated that, \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s prerogative not to believe certain testimony ... does not constitute affirmative evidence of the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711, 715 A.2d at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On the basis of both of these cases, the majority reverses and orders a new trial. If the majority were to have found the evidence insufficient to sustain Gloria H.\u2019s conviction on the charge of violating Section 7-301, as I would do on the basis of clear error, Gloria H. could not be retried. In <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 387 A.2d 762 (1978), we were required to apply, and did apply, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause [of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States] precludes a second trial once the [federal] reviewing court has found the evidence legally insufficient\u201d and that \u201cthe only \u2018just\u2019 remedy available for that court is the direction of a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Mackall, </em>283 Md. at 113-14, 387 A.2d at 769 (alterations in original), quoting <em>Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 18, 98 S.Ct. at 2150-51, 57 L.Ed.2d at 14. The <em>Burks </em>Court recognized that the prohibition against successive trials bars \u201cthe prosecution [from] another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>Burks, </em>437 U.S. at 11, 98 S.Ct. at 2147, 57 L.Ed.2d at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In <em>Greene v. Massey, </em>437 U.S. 19, 98 S.Ct. 2151, 57 L.Ed.2d 15 (1978), decided the same day as <em>Burks, </em>the Court granted certiorari \u201cto decide whether a State may retry a defendant after conviction has been reversed by an appellate court on the ground that the evidence introduced at the prior trial was insufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 98 S.Ct. at 2152, 57 L.Ed.2d at 18. The Court, referring to its holding in <em>Burks </em>that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once a reviewing court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>determined that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to sustain the verdict,\u201d held: \u201cSince the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy is fully applicable to state criminal proceedings, <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>[395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969)] we are bound to apply the standard announced in <em>Burks </em>to the case now under review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 98 S.Ct. at 2154, 57 L.Ed.2d at 21. In the instant case, the evidence was insufficient to prove that Gloria H. violated Section 7-301. Consequently, she can not lawfully be retried on the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance upon a trial judge\u2019s \u201cimpermissible inference,\u201d which is a ground for the judge\u2019s reaching evidentiary facts contrary to Gloria H.\u2019s testimony, is entirely misplaced. The trial judge was drawing a <em>factual </em>inference which, in the trial judge\u2019s view, created evidence contrary to Gloria H.\u2019s testimony. The factual inference drawn by the judge was the key to the judge\u2019s finding that the evidence was sufficient. Since the factual inference was an impermissible one, the evidence was insufficient. Accordingly, under <em>Burks, Greene, Mackall, </em>and their progeny, a new trial violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The majority goes too far also in creating a bright line rule that Section 7-301 cannot be violated by a parent whose child \u201centers\u201d the school. The majority claims that because Section 7-301 is unclear, \u201cwhether the legislature intended the compulsory public school attendance law would impose criminal liability on a parent whose child \u2018cuts class,\u2019 \u201d the rule of lenity, as defined in <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525, 529 (1990), should be applied, and criminal liability should not be imposed on a parent whose child \u201centers the school building.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The majority cites <em>Western Correctional Institution v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2002) for its recital of this Court\u2019s process of statutory interpretation, overlooking the first step in seeking legislative intent, that being, \u201cwe first look to the words of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 807 A.2d at 41. The words of Section 7-301 require that a parent \u201cshall see that the child attends school.\u201d \u201cAttend,\u201d is defined as \u201cto be present at: go to.\u201d Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 79 (11th ed. 2005). The majority\u2019s statutory line-drawing ignores the many circumstances in which culpability could be appropriate, and forecloses all parental liability under the statute, as soon as the child crosses the threshold of the schoolhouse doors, but does not attend classes. Although the prosecution in the instant case failed to establish that Gloria II. was liable under the statute, what could be proven in a particular case is that the child hides in the school so that the child will not be seen by school personnel, and the parent knowingly dumps the child at the school as a babysitting opportunity; or the parent encourages the child to skip classes\u2014situations that could result in culpability under Section 7-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The majority, in absolving the parent from any criminal culpability, also imposes a per se responsibility on the school to ensure that a student attends class once the school\u2019s threshold is crossed, citing <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset County Board of Education, </em>295 Md. 597, 458 A.2d 758 (1983), <em>Frugis v. Bracigliano, </em>177 N.J. 250, 827 A.2d 1040 (2003), and <em>Blau v. Fort Thomas Public School District, et al., </em>401 F.3d 381 (6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Cir.2005). None of these cases, in any way, supports the imposition of that liability on the school system. In <em>Hornbeck, </em>this Court reviewed the constitutionality of the State\u2019s public school financing system rather than statutory arguments or the liability of the school board. In <em>Frugis, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court reviewed whether the trial court properly directed a liability verdict in favor of parents on their negligence and negligent supervision claims against a school board for the actions of one of its male principals, who took naked, pornographic photographs of male students in his office. The majority invokes the <em>Frugis </em>court\u2019s statement that the \u201claw imposes a duty on children to attend school and on parents to relinquish their supervisory role over their children to teachers and administrators during school hours,\u201d <em>Frugis, </em>827 A.2d at 1050, in order to totally excuse parents from any liability, once a child crosses the threshold of the school. One wonders what would have happened in <em>Frugis </em>had the school board been able to show that the parent was complicit in the photography session.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The majority cites <em>Blau </em>to support its holding that the artificial designation of the structure of the schoolhouse door obviates any proof of parental culpability. In <em>Blau, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed whether a public school dress code interfered with a parent\u2019s right to direct the education of his child. The court stated that, \u201c[wjhile parents may have a fundamental right to decide <em>whether </em>to send their child to a public school, they do not have a fundamental right generally to direct <em>how </em>a public school teaches their child.... [Ijssues of public education are generally committed to the control of state and local authorities.\u201d <em>Blau, </em>401 F.3d at 395-96 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in original). Relying on <em>Blau, </em>the majority thereby declares that Gloria H. cannot face criminal liability because the school is in control of the child, as soon as her daughter enters the building. Certainly, as <em>Blau </em>points out, a school has control over various aspects of the child\u2019s educational experience, but control does not enable a parent to escape liability if she is a participant in a child\u2019s failure to attend class.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The majority\u2019s notion that a parent cannot face liability once the child enters the schoolhouse also obviates any tort liability of the parent for acts of the child while on the premises. In <em>In re Sorrell, </em>20 Md.App. 179, 315 A.2d 110 (1974), a teenager\u2019s parents were held vicariously liable for property damage and medical expenses stemming from personal injuries caused by the wilful misconduct of their child. The court noted that, \u201cin all fairness, it is better that the parents of these young tortfeasors be required to compensate those who are damaged, <em>even though the parents be without fault, </em>rather than to let the loss fall upon the innocent victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 315 A.2d at 114, quoting <em>Kelly v. Williams, </em>346 S.W.2d 434, 437 (Tex.Civ.App.1961) (emphasis added) (internal quotations removed).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Would a parent be able to escape culpability if she gave a knife to the child to carry into the school and the child used it to harm another?</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The majority\u2019s insistence on the threshold as determinative also supports the notion that the school acts as a protector of the child, which, at least federally, is questionable. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>J.O. v. Alton Community Unit School District 11, </em>909 F.2d 267, 272-73 (7th Cir.1990), along with a majority of other federal courts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> held that school officials do not owe a constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>duty to protect students. The court noted that the due process clause is not a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety, and that because schoolchildren were not as helpless as those in prisons or mental hospitals, the school did not have an affirmative duty to protect the children. The court concluded that because \u201cparents still retain primary responsibility for ... caring for the child,\u201d compulsory school attendance does not mean the State had assumed responsibility for the child\u2019s entire personal life. \u201c[T]hese children and their parents retain substantial freedom to act.\u201d <em>J.O., </em>909 F.2d at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The majority\u2019s bright-line rule creates an imaginary, arbitrary threshold of the schoolhouse door to define liability when there is no need or circumstance to do so. In so doing, the majority determines evidentiary sufficiency, impermissible inference, and then the threshold rule to permit Gloria to be retried but not convicted. The case involves evidentiary insufficiency, and Gloria H. should not be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Chief Judge BELL has authorized me to state that he joins in the concurrence and Part I only of the dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\">.
