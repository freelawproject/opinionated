The result of the DNA testing was the basis for the second challenged ruling, the trial court order that the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>child support obligation to the child the DNA testing determined he did not father be terminated. The respondent challenged these rulings in an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, agreeing with the respondent, vacated the judgment on which the challenged rulings were based and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Resources v. Kamp, </em>180 Md.App. 166, 949 A.2d 43 (2008). For reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The petitioner and Ms. Duckworth were married on September 13, 1983. The couple had three children whose paternity is neither questioned nor the subject of the proceedings <em>sub judice. </em>The child whose paternity is at issue in these proceedings, Julie Kamp, was conceived in the early half of 1992, when Ms. Duckworth became pregnant with a fourth child. This is significant because the petitioner had had a vasectomy performed in approximately June, 1987. Also, when. Julie was conceived, the petitioner was employed out of state in Ravenswood, West Virginia. As a result, although the couple engaged in sexual relations when the petitioner was home, the petitioner was home only on an inconsistent basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both the petitioner and Ms. Duckworth testified that both of them were aware, when Ms. Duckworth was found to be pregnant, that Julie was not, or possibly was not, the petitioner\u2019s biological child.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">For her part, Ms. Duckworth had the following exchange with the petitioner\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">\u201c[MR. HANNA]: Following the conception of Julie, did you have any questions in your mind as to who the father was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201c[MS. DUCKWORTH]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201c[MR. HANNA]: Okay. Who was the father as far as you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-4\">\u201c[MS. DUCKWORTH]: James Stanton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201c[MR. HANNA]: At the time you were having sexual relations though, were you not with Darren?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201c[MS. DUCKWORTH]: No, not during the time I conceived. No. Darren and I were having marital problems and he was staying with a friend of his in West Virginia and had had sexual relations with another woman. That\u2019s what spawned all of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201c[MR. HANNA]: Did the two of you have any discussions concerning paternity of Julie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201c[MS. DUCKWORTH]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">\u201c[MR. HANNA]: And what was the nature of those discussions? The very next day after I had sexual relations with Jamie, I had called Darren and I had told him what had happened. And, we both know it\u2019s very easy for me to get pregnant. It always was. And he told me to wait a week or two and go get a pregnancy test done and we\u2019ll decide what to do from there. I waited a week or two, went and got a pregnancy test done, which, of course, came back positive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Later, the petitioner testified at the hearing on the Motion to Modify Child Support and the Motion to Set Aside Paternity. He admitted, in an exchange with Donald Davis, counsel for the State, that he knew that he could not possibly be Julie\u2019s father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">\u201c[MR. DAVIS]: Okay. And isn\u2019t it true that the time leading up to when she became pregnant, you were during one of those periods where you were out of town for a while. And that\u2019s why you would ask her to get the pregnancy test right away because you knew at that point you weren\u2019t the one who could have impregnated her at that point. Isn\u2019t that why you asked for the test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">\u201c[MR. KAMP]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>According to Ms. Duckworth, both she and the petitioner discussed their options, including the possibility of abortion and adoption. Ms. Duckworth testified that family members, including her parents and her sisters, were involved in the discussion. While the petitioner was not certain, he conceded, as the colloquy with the Master reflects, that he was aware that James Stanton, with whom Ms. Duckworth admitted having an affair, could have been Julie\u2019s father.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">\u201c[THE MASTER]: So you\u2014were told Mr. Stanton was the father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201c[MR. KAMP]: Well, we assumed because nobody did any other surgery, I guess. I didn\u2019t do anything as far as I checked to see if I was a hundred percent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201c[THE MASTER]: All right. But, what Ms. Duckworth talked about, you and her talked about the possibility of Mr. Stanton was the father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201c[MR. KAMP]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Ms. Duckworth, on the other hand, testified that she had no doubt of Julie\u2019s paternity, that Mr. Stanton was Julie\u2019s father. Before Julie was born on December 10, 1992, however, the couple decided to raise Julie as the petitioner\u2019s child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The couple separated in 1998 and were finally divorced in April of 1999. The Judgment of Divorce incorporated, but did not merge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the terms of the Voluntary Separation Agreement that the petitioner and Ms. Duckworth agreed to and executed on December 15, 1998. According to that agreement, four children, including Julie, were born of the marriage. The Judgment of Divorce also listed the minor children of the parties. That list included Julie. The Judgment of Divorce, in addition, awarded custody of the four minor children to the parties jointly and ordered the petitioner to pay child support for each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Julie lived primarily with Ms. Duckworth after the divorce, although she went to live with the petitioner, who had remarried, in June of 2001. After residing with the petitioner and his new wife at their home for approximately one year, Julie resumed living with Ms. Duckworth. During the summer of 2001, when she was eight years old, Julie learned that Mr. Stanton, and not the petitioner, was her biological father. It appears that Mr. Stanton\u2019s daughter informed Julie one day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>that they were sisters, a fact that was later verified by Ms. Duckworth. Ms. Duckworth maintains that she provided confirmation only after speaking with the petitioner and obtaining his consent to tell Julie. The petitioner denies that he gave permission to Ms. Duckworth to tell Julie that he was not her biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">On January 11, 2002, Ms. Duckworth filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Garrett County asking the court to establish fixed visitation and child support. In her petition, Ms. Duck-worth alleged that the petitioner \u201crefused to develop a fixed schedule for visitation with the minor children\u201d and that the petitioner\u2019s new wife had \u201cacted in a manner to interfere in matters involving the children and has on several occasions refused to return one or more of the children with the acquiescence of the [petitioner].\u201d Further Ms. Duckworth pleaded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cThe prior Judgment of this Court and the Agreement of the parties requires [petitioner] to pay child support; however, [petitioner] has failed, refused and/or neglected to pay child support in a consistent and reasonable manner, but rather makes unilateral reductions in the amount to be paid based upon what he perceives to be required by the Judgment and Agreement. [Ms. Duckworth] believes that the Court should establish child support in accordance with the Maryland Guidelines and require [petitioner] to pay the same pursuant to an Earnings Withholding Order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In her amended petition, Ms. Duckworth requested that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201ca. Pass an Order establishing a fixed visitation schedule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">\u201cb. Determine the arrearage in child support payments to be made by [petitioner];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\u201cc. Enter a judgment in favor of [Ms. Duckworth] in the amount of any child support arrearage of [petitioner];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">\u201cd. Pass an Order establishing child support; .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-11\">\u201ce. Pass an Order for Earnings Withholdings Order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cf. Grant such other relief as the nature of her cause might require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The petitioner answered the petition on February 27, 2002 and, in addition, filed a counter-petition to establish custody, visitation, and child support. In his answer, the petitioner requested custody of the three children who remained minors, of whom Julie was one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) regarding the custody of the minor children on February 3, 2003. In that Memorandum, which was incorporated by the Circuit Court on March 14, 2003, the parties agreed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-5\">\u201cFour children were born as issue of their now dissolved marriage, of which two have reached the age of majority. There are two remaining minor children, to wit: CASEY, born, February 12, 1998, now age fourteen (14); and JULIE, born December 10, 1992, now age ten (10).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The parties agreed that Ms. Duckworth would have sole legal custody of the two children and joint physical custody would be shared between the two parties. The petitioner agreed to pay Ms. Duckworth child support in the amount of $100.00 per month. Consistent with the MOU, the court ordered the petitioner to pay child support for Casey and Julie, the- two children born \u201cas issue of their now dissolved marriage,\u201d who remained minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On July 28, 2005, the respondent filed, on behalf of Ms. Duckworth, a motion to modify child support. In that motion, the respondent proffered that \u201cthe Plaintiff/ Counter-Defendant, DARREN GERARD KAMP, has income with which he can pay an increased amount of child support.\u201d The minor children for whose benefit the increase in support is sought are identified in the motion as Casey Kamp and Julie Kamp. Answering the motion, the petitioner made an assertion and a request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201c[T]he minor child, Julie Kamp, is not his biological daughter. Moreover, he has not adopted the said Julie Kamp, and requests this Honorable Court to order blood test for DNA testing for the purpose of establishing paternity of Julie Kamp. The issue of paternity was recently raised by the said Vicki Jo (Kamp) Duckworth when she began to indicate to Julie Kamp and to others that Darren G. Kamp was not, in fact, the biological father of Julie Kamp.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">After a hearing, the presiding Master recommended that the petitioner\u2019s request for DNA testing be denied. The petitioner\u2019s exceptions to the Master\u2019s recommendations were sustained by the Circuit Court, which, after a hearing, ordered that the testing be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">When DNA testing ordered by the court determined that the petitioner was not Julie\u2019s biological father, the petitioner filed a motion to terminate or stay payment of the child support attributable to her. The hearing master recommended that the petitioner\u2019s motion be disposed of as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">\u201cThe mother\u2019s request for an increase in child support is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\u201cThe father\u2019s request to terminate support is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">\u201cThe father\u2019s child support obligation is terminated and any and all arrearage are deemed uncollectible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The master reasoned, notwithstanding that the petitioner had always known, as the master found, that he was not Julie\u2019s biological father, yet had treated her as his daughter, the genetic test results rebutted the presumption that Mr. Kamp was Julie\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The respondent\u2019s exceptions to these recommendations were overruled by the Circuit Court. Accordingly, the Circuit Court adopted the Master\u2019s recommendations; it denied the motion to modify child support, granted the petitioner\u2019s motion to terminate both his child support and his child support obligation and deemed all arrearages uncollectible. The respondent timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. As we have seen, that court vacated the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>entered by the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We first must consider whether, where the petitioner had not previously challenged the paternity of the child at issue, either during the marriage or during the divorce and post divorce proceedings, the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that the trial court erred when it granted the petitioner\u2019s request for DNA paternity testing. As we have seen, the child was born during the petitioner\u2019s marriage to her mother and, therefore, her paternity could have been, but was not, raised either during the marriage or during subsequent divorce proceedings. We hold that the intermediate appellate court ruled correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Determining the propriety of the decision by the intermediate appellate court begins with the Maryland statutes addressing and, therefore, governing, paternity. They are found in the Estates and Trusts Article and in the Family Law Article and represent two viable methods or proceedings for establishing paternity. <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 478-79, 578 A.2d 761, 764 (1990); <em>Turner v. Whisted, </em>327 Md. 106, 112, 607 A.2d 935, 938 (1992)(\u201c[T]he legislature offered a choice of actions by which one could seek to establish paternity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Maryland Code (1974, 2001Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 l-206(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article teaches, concerning the legitimacy of a child, that \u201ca child born at any time after his parents have participated in a marriage ceremony with each other, even if the marriage is invalid, is presumed to be the legitimate child of both parents.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>1027(c)(1) of the Family Law Article confirms that there is such a presumption and provides a more precise statement of the nature of that presumption. It states, \u201cthere is a rebuttable presumption that the child is the legitimate child of the man to whom its mother was married at the time of conception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">This is in contrast to a child born to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony. Such a child, Estates and Trusts \u00a7 1-208 advises, is \u201cconsidered to be the child of the mother,\u201d in section (a), and is considered, in section (b) to be the child of the father, only when the father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201c(1) Has been judicially determined to be the father in an action brought under the statutes relating to paternity proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">\u201c(2) Has acknowledged himself, in writing, to be the father; \u201c(3) Has openly and notoriously recognized the child to be his child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">\u201c(4) Has subsequently married the mother and has acknowledged himself, orally or in writing, to be the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">When the child is \u201cborn out of wedlock,\u201d <em>see </em>Family Law \u00a7 5-1002(b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the applicable provisions are those found in \u00a7\u00a7 5-1001-5-1048 of the Family Law Article. Of some significance to this case is \u00a7 5-1029. Captioned, \u201cBlood or genetic tests,\u201d it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201c(b) In general.\u2014On the motion of the Administration, a party to the proceeding, or on its own motion, the court shall order the mother, child, and alleged father to submit to blood or genetic tests to determine whether the alleged father can be excluded as being the father of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApS\">This Court has construed this section to mean that a trial judge has no discretion to deny a blood or genetic test request.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 429, 754 A.2d 389, 407 (2000)(\u201cTo now require a trial court to conduct a best interests analysis prior to granting a blood or genetic test would counter the original and long-standing legislative intent of this statute.\u201d) <em>See Evans v. Wilson, </em>382 Md. 614, 626, 856 A.2d 679, 686 (2004). On the contrary, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\">\u201cthe provisions of section 5-1029 are mandatory once a party to any paternity proceeding moves for a blood or genetic test. This includes a post-declaration proceeding, subsequent to the initial declaration of paternity, conducted under section 5-1038(a)(2)(i)2, challenging the declaration because the putative father is not, or may not be, the biological father. Given the mandatory statutory language of section 5-1029, and the history of that section, the \u2018best interests\u2019 analysis generally may not be conducted in determining whether to grant a motion for testing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 435, 754 A.2d at 410. Also of interest and relevant to the case <em>sub judice, </em>are \u00a7\u00a7 5-1027 and 5-1038(a)(2)(i)(2). The former, in addition to confirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>presumption of paternity and categorizing it as rebuttable, \u00a7 (c)(1), prescribes one method for rebutting it. Section (c)(2). Section 5-1038(a)(2)(i)(2) prescribes another: \u201cif a blood or genetic test done in accordance with \u00a7 5-1029 of this subtitle establishes the exclusion of the individual named as the father in the order.\u201d [<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">As we have seen, the presumption of paternity is applicable to paternity proceedings under both the Estates and Trusts Article and the Family Law Article. If, as \u00a7 5-1038 recognizes, the result of blood or genetic testing is ground for modifying an enrolled judgment of paternity, it follows that the result of such testing is evidence that rebuts the statutory presumption of paternity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Turner, </em>327 Md. at 110-11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>607 A.2d at 937, in which this Court, rejecting the determination by the Court of Special Appeals that the putative father in that case \u201c \u2018may not initially use the blood test provisions of the paternity statute to overcome the presumption of legitimacy of the child herein,\u2019 \u201d recognized this to be so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also Evans, </em>382 Md. at 629, 856 A.2d at 688, emphasizing that <em>Turner </em>made clear that, under Estates and Trusts \u00a7 1-206, \u201ca blood or genetic test may be ordered only upon a showing of good cause presumably of sufficient persuasive force to overcome the statutory presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In proceedings brought under the Family Law Article, as we have seen, <em>see infra </em>at \u00a7 5-1029, it has been held that the request for blood or genetic testing requires that the blood or genetic testing be ordered, and that there is no discretion to deny the request. On the other hand, no such mechanistic response has been required when the request is made during proceedings, brought under the Estates and Trusts Article, to resolve the paternity dispute between \u201ctwo men each acknowledging] paternity of the same child.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 113, 607 A.2d at 938. Indeed, as we explained in <em>Turner, </em>it was the need to exercise discretion that militated in favor of proceedings under that Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">\u201cAs advanced by this Court in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Dawson, </em>the Estates &amp; Trusts Article presents the \u2018more satisfactory\u2019 and \u2018less traumatic\u2019 means of establishing paternity. <em>Thom</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>as [v.

In Turner\u2019s attempt to establish paternity under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, he had to rebut the presumption that Jeffrey was the legitimate child of Kelly and Danny Whisted.... A motion for blood tests made under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article is best analyzed as a request for a physical examination under Maryland Rule <em>2-423,[</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>and the court has discretion to grant or deny the blood tests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 113, 607 A.2d at 938-39.

There, as in <em>Turner, </em>two men, one of whom was the husband of the mother when the child was born, and thus the presumptive father, claimed paternity. The putative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>father made a motion for an order for blood test in order to establish his paternity. We held that, prerequisite to ordering a blood or genetic test, the trial court should be satisfied that good cause for the testing has been shown, that \u201cblood or genetic testing would be in the best interests of [the child].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, 856 A.2d 679, 856 A.2d at 688.

If the mandatory blood or genetic testing under Section 5-1029 could be invoked every time an individual seeks to establish paternity of a child born during a marriage, the consequences to intact families could be devastating. Without regard to the child\u2019s best interests, courts would be forced to order genetic tests of every child whose paternity is merely questioned. This would be the case even if the child is well cared for and could assert that he or she does not want his or her life to be disturbed. We do not believe that, in enacting the \u2018Paternity Proceedings\u2019 of the Family Law Article, the legislature intended such an effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 636, 856 A.2d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">That was not the end of our inquiry in <em>Evans, </em>however. The trial judge in that case recognized her obligation to assess the putative father\u2019s request for testing from the perspective of the child\u2019s best interest, and, finding his showing in that regard to be deficient, denied it. Thus, we were required to review that determination for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 637, 856 A.2d at 693 (and cases therein cited). In concluding that there was no abuse of discretion, we were satisfied that the trial judge followed the guidance provided by <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 116-117, 607 A.2d at 940, noting that, in rendering her opinion, she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201cemphasized that her primary concerns were [the child\u2019s] best interests. Invoking <em>Turner, </em>she recognized that preserving the family unit was \u2018crucial\u2019 to [the child\u2019s] interests and that it outweighed Evans\u2019 interest in establishing his status as [the child\u2019s] father. Judge Holland acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>that Evans\u2019 relationship with [the mother] created some \u2018suspicion\u2019 that he was the father. The judge refused, however, to \u2018destroy a family unit based on suspicion,\u2019 especially given what was, in the judge\u2019s estimation, an insufficient connection between Evans and [the child].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANA\"><em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 637, 856 A.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Although it was the mother who sought to disestablish paternity in that case, the discussion of \u201cbest interest\u201d and \u201cgood cause\u201d in <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 621 A.2d 898 (1993) is instructive. There, during a custody case battle over a child born out of wedlock, mother moved for blood testing of the man who acknowledged the child as his own, both before and after they were married, and maintained a fatherly relationship with the child, solely for the purpose of disestablishing his paternity and thus his right to custody. <em>Id. </em>at 766, 621 A.2d at 902. Although we recognized that the mother was entitled to request that paternity blood testing be done, we concluded that consideration of her request was to be made pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-423, which, as a threshold determination, requires a showing of good cause. <em>Id. </em>at 767, 621 A.2d at 902. Whether \u201cgood cause\u201d had been shown, in turn, was to be assessed in <em>light </em>of the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child, we added. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Aware of the reason that the mother was requesting the blood test,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>id., </em>and the policies and purposes underlying the paternity statute and Estates &amp; Trusts \u00a7 1-208\u2014the legitimation of children born out of wedlock and securing them \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>nearly as practicable, the same rights to support, care and education as children born in <em>wedlock\u201d\u2014id., </em>we proceeded on the premise that, while not directly implicated in a custody dispute, those policies and purposes were \u201cnevertheless ... relevant to the determination whether good cause for ordering the blood test ha[d] been shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\">\u201cTo justify ordering blood tests, at the behest of the mother, under circumstances in which the only effect of results favorable to the mother would be to show that a man who has acted as the child\u2019s father, who the child regards as her father, who has acknowledged the child, and who is married to the child\u2019s mother is, in fact, not the child\u2019s father requires a showing by the mother that to do so is in the best interest of the child. <em>In the Matter of the Marriage of Ross, </em>245 Kan. 591, 783 P.2d 331, 338 (1989)(\u2018Prior to ordering a blood test to determine whether the presumed parent is the biological parent, the district court must consider the best interests of the child, including physical, mental, and emotional needs.\u2019); <em>In the Matter of the Marriage of Zodrow, </em>240 Kan. 65, 727 P.2d 435, 440 (1986) (same); <em>Ban v.

Indeed, we opined that the same factors identified in <em>Turner </em>applied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>equal force to the analysis to be conducted in that case. <em>Monroe, </em>329 Md. at 772-78, 621 A.2d at 905. That is as it should be, for though the factual circumstances surrounding the issue may change or be different, the issue itself, the best interest of the child does not. It simply must be analyzed and resolved in the context of the facts giving rise to it.</p>\n<p id=\"A2L\">This case is, to be sure, different from both <em>Turner </em>and <em>Evans. </em>In both those cases, two men were vying for paternity; the question presented in each was designed to determine which, of two men, was the father. In present case, the man who is the presumed father of the child, who also has acknowledged the child as his own not simply during the marriage, but for over six years after the parties divorced, is the one seeking to rebut the presumption that he is the father and, thereby, to renounce, to rescind, his acknowledgment of paternity. On these facts, the case for conditioning the ordering of a blood test on a finding of good cause, tied to and determined by the best interest of the child, is, at least as, if not more, compelling than it was in <em>Turner </em>and <em>Evans. </em>That is the position this Court took in <em>Monroe, </em>a case with which the case <em>sub judice </em>shares similarities. It certainly appears to be the position taken by the Court of Special Appeals in this case. <em>See Kamp, </em>180 Md.App. at 198, 949 A.2d at 62. That position is likewise evident in the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Ashley v.

Julie was born on December 10, 1992. Because the couple was not divorced until April 9, 1999, there can be no question that, pursuant to Estates and Trusts \u00a7 l-206(a), Julie is presumed to be the child of both the petitioner and Ms. Duckworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>In his answer to the respondent\u2019s motion to modify child support, despite his prior acknowledgment of parentage, after Julie\u2019s birth, during the marriage, during the divorce proceedings and during a prior post divorce hearings on custody visitation and support, the petitioner denied that he was the Julie\u2019s father and requested a DNA paternity test to confirm that denial, and, thereby rebut the presumption that he was Julie\u2019s father. When the master recommended denial of the petitioner\u2019s request for DNA testing, the petitioner filed exceptions. In those exceptions, the petitioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">\u201c5. That in its evaluation of whether or not to grant the requested blood or genetic testing, the Master disregarded the existing Maryland Law. The cases indicated that in making the determination which was at issue in this case, the Court should consider the interests of the family unit, the interests of the parties seeking the request, and the best interests of the child. The Master did not comment on these factors in making his decision. Therefore, it is the opinion of the excepting party that the Master did not base his Recommendations on Maryland Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201c6. Moreover, no reason was advanced by the said Vicki Duckworth, or the State, as to why continuing to charge Darren Kamp with child support would be in the best interests of any family unit, Darren Kamp, or the minor child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">\u201c7. That no reason was advanced to show why collecting child support from Darren Kamp, rather than from the true father of the child, would be in the child\u2019s best interests.

The trial judge simply granted the petitioner\u2019s exceptions. In a later opinion, terminating the petitioner\u2019s child support obligation, however, the trial judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u201cIn its decision to order the DNA testing, the court considered the various factors involved. The parties were separated and the truth about Julie\u2019s parentage was out. There was no family unit to protect. In this instance, there was no reason not to obtain indisputable medical evidence to confirm the truth about Mr. Kamp\u2019s relation to Julie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><em>Kamp, </em>180 Md.App. at 188, 949 A.2d at 56. He also acknowledged and deferred to the master\u2019s extensive knowledge of this case, the parties, and the children involved, commenting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWK\">\u201cIt is also clear that he considered the interests of Julie in making his decision. The truth about her parentage was already well known. There was no testimony to indicate that Ms. Duckworth could not get child support from Mr. Stanton. The Master clearly took these things into consideration while properly applying Maryland law when making his recommendations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 189, 949 A.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The Court of Special Appeals did not agree that ordering the DNA test served Julie\u2019s best interests. It reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASv\">\u201c[T]he case <em>sub judice </em>does not contain any evidence to show that a paternity test was in Julie\u2019s best interest. Julie was approximately thirteen years of age by the time the genetic test was ordered. DSS offered evidence that Julie might suffer emotional harm if such a test were ordered at that point. Julie\u2019s therapist, Ms. Barnard, testified that Julie did not want a paternal relationship with Stanton. Moreover, Ms. Duckworth claimed that \u2018[i]t would be detrimental\u2019 to Julie for [the petitioner] to undergo a genetic testing to prove he is not Julie\u2019s biological father, because Ms. Duckworth has attempted to make \u2018very clear\u2019 to Julie that paternity is not \u2018a blood issue\u2019 and [the petitioner] \u2018is now making it a blood issue.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 200, 949 A.2d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals. To be sure, the trial court considered some factors relevant to a consideration of best interest, namely, that the parties were separated and that Julie knew that the petitioner was not her biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>father, \u201cthe truth about Julie\u2019s parentage was out,\u201d from which it concluded that \u201cthere was no family unit to protect.\u201d It is clear, however, that the court either did not consider, or gave short shrift to, other important factors bearing on Julie\u2019s best interests. The father-daughter relationship existing between Julie and the petitioner was neither a recently developed one nor one lacking in complexity. It has existed, at minimum, some 13 years, and without any legal challenge or hint of challenge, from Julie\u2019s birth in 1992 to 2005, when the petitioner, in court pleadings, withdrew his long-standing acknowledgment. For eight of the years that the relationship existed, Julie had no knowledge of any controversy concerning her parentage. That was true despite the circumstances surrounding her conception, which rendered the petitioner\u2019s parentage ambiguous, to say the least. Whether, or not, the petitioner knew he was not Julie\u2019s father, he agreed to, and, in fact, did, raise her as his child. Indeed, the father-daughter relationship was developed and maintained throughout the parties\u2019 marriage and it continued even after the parties separated and were divorced. As we have seen, the petitioner entered into a Voluntary Separation Agreement with Julie\u2019s mother, in which he represented that Julie was one of the four children born of the marriage. That separation agreement was incorporated, although not merged, in the Judgment of Divorce, and, thereby the representation of paternity therein contained was made to the court. Based on that agreement, the Judgment awarded joint custody of the parties\u2019 minor children to the petitioner and Ms. Duckworth and ordered the petitioner to pay child support for each. Although Julie lived primarily with her mother after the parties separated and divorced, she did live for a time, approximately one year, with the petitioner and his new wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">It is undisputed that Julie was told that the petitioner may not be her father, that the person who probably was her father was identified, that the initial source of the information was a girl who believed Julie to be her sister and that the petitioner\u2019s non-paternity was confirmed by Ms. Duckworth. What is disputed is whether the confirmation was authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>by the petitioner. In any event, subsequent to that disclosure, the petitioner continued to acknowledge Julie and, in fact, in a counter-petition to Ms. Duckworth\u2019s petition to establish custody, visitation and child support, the petitioner sought custody of Julie. By subsequently entering into a Memorandum of Understanding, the petitioner settled for joint physical custody. He agreed to pay, as ordered by the court order, child support for Julie. It was more than two years later that the petitioner raised the paternity issue as a defense. That was approximately four years after Julie was told that he was not her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Looking at what the trial court said in justification of the DNA testing order, it is, we believe, fair to assume that it believed the critical inquiry into best interest could be distilled to whether Julie was aware of her parentage<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and whether there was a family unit to protect. That assumption is confirmed by what the trial court said immediately after making these points: \u201cWhenever the status of the law is such that there is little or no interest in the truth, then there is something wrong with the system or the law.\u201d <em>Kamp, </em>180 Md.App. at 189, 949 A.2d at 56. As the factual recitation just concluded evidences, the inquiry is not so simple and certainly not so cut and dried. In addition to the length and complexity of the relationship between the petitioner, Julie and Ms. Duckworth and its interrelationship to the family unit and the other members in that unit, which certainly have to be considered, Ms. Duckworth offered evidence of the effect, emotionally, that DNA testing might have on Julie and with regard to how she viewed a parental relationship with another \u201cfather.\u201d The trial court\u2019s narrow focus does not suffice to ensure the best interest of this child. To be sure, the trial court did reference the master\u2019s report, which \u201cclearly identified some of the effects these proceedings have had on Julie, <em>Kamp, </em>180 Md.App. at 189, 949 A.2d at 56-57; however, it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>thereby broaden its focus. Instead, reiterating and accepting that \u201cJulie already knew that Mr. Kamp was not her biological father,\u201d it assumed and stated emphatically that \u201c[a]ny emotional damage resulting from that knowledge cannot be attributed to a Master\u2019s hearing or recommendation some five years after the fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 949 A.2d at 57. As we pointed out in <em>Monroe, </em>329 Md. at 767, 621 A.2d at 902, \u201cTh[e] assessment [of whether DNA testing is in the child\u2019s best interest] may only be made by considering the entirety of the relationship between the child, the petitioner and the respondent.\u201d Knowledge of parentage alone or in combination with the divorce of the child\u2019s parents is not the entirety of the relationship between the child, her mother and her presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In any event, what the Supreme Court of South Dakota said when addressing a similar issue has particular relevance to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cBelated efforts to declare a child illegitimate, for whatever reasons, should seldom prevail. [The presumptive father] has failed to show sufficient cause for paternity testing at this late juncture. The welfare of the child must be considered over the father\u2019s long delayed challenge to the child\u2019s parentage. [The presumptive father] has treated both children as his own since birth. He claims that his request is not made to recover past child support, but merely to find out if he is the father and whether [the children\u2019s mother] perpetuated a fraud upon him. These are not compelling enough reasons to disrupt the life of a child born during their marriage.\u201d (footnotes and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>Ctdhane v. Michels, </em>615 N.W.2d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In this case, the petitioner has treated Julie as his own since her birth. Moreover, his only claim is that \u201cno reason was advanced to show why collecting child support from [the petitioner], rather than the true father of the child, would be in the child\u2019s best interest [, especially since,] subsequent to the divorce of the parties, the mother of the minor child unilaterally took it upon herself to declare to the child that [the petitioner] was not her father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The reasons offered by the trial court being insufficient cause, in the interests of the child, to order DNA testing, the trial court abused its discretion in that regard. Moreover, like the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Kamp, </em>180 Md.App. at 198, 949 A.2d at 62, and contrary to the express finding of the trial court, we are not at all sure that the trial court applied the correct test in ordering DNA testing. And, because, unlike <em>Monroe, </em>essentially a custody case in which paternity was being used as a sword to defeat the self-acknowledged father\u2019s claim to custody, the meaning and vitality of the long-standing, well-recognized presumption of legitimacy and fatherhood are at stake. Accordingly, unlike <em>Monroe, </em>we agree with the intermediate appellate court that a remand for further proceedings in light of the principles we have here reiterated is required. Although it is true that \u201cthe cat is now out of the bag and cannot now be stuffed back in,\u201d <em>Monroe, </em>329 Md. at 773, 621 A.2d at 905, nevertheless, the DNA test results need not be and, we hold, shall not be considered until doing so is determined to be in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See Matter of the Marriage of Ross, </em>245 Kan. at 602, 783 P.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The respondent argues alternatively, and in any event, that the petitioner is barred from denying his obligation to pay child support. Its premise, accepted by the Court of Special Appeals, is that, despite relieving the petitioner of his support obligation, the trial' court did not disturb the petitioner\u2019s parental rights, 180 Md.App. at 201-02, 949 A.2d at 64, and is based on the theories of judicial and equitable estoppel, among others. To support those theories, it relies on many of the factors we have already identified as informing the determination of the best interest of the child, most particularly the length of the time that the father-daughter relationship has continued, its continuation despite the breakup of the marriage of the petitioner to Ms. Duckworth and the representations the petitioner made to the court, via the Separation Agreement entered into during the divorce proceedings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>the Memorandum of Understanding, which resolved a custody and support dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">This Court most recently defined judicial estoppel in <em>Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 913 A.2d 10 (2006). There, we instructed, to assert a claim of judicial estoppel, a party must show that three circumstances exist: \u201c(1) one of the parties takes a factual position that is inconsistent with a position it took in previous litigation, (2) the previous inconsistent position was accepted by a court, and (3) the party who is maintaining the inconsistent position must have intentionally misled the court in order to gain an unfair advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 913 A.2d at 22 (citing <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Berrett, </em>395 Md. 439, 464, 910 A.2d 1072, 1087 (2006))(citing <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 529 n. 9, 754 A.2d 1030, 1038-39 n. 9 (2000)).

Like the petitioner in this case, the husband had undergone a vasectomy-one and one-half years earlier-prior to Stephen\u2019s conception. The Knills decided to move past the wife\u2019s infidelity and continue their marriage. Thus, Stephen was raised as if he were Mr. Knill\u2019s biological child. The Knills remained married for an additional twelve years before Mrs. Knill revealed to Stephen, as a result of a family argument, that Mr. Knill was not his father. Mr. Knill confirmed that fact to Stephen, but continued to support him until two years later, in 1984, when Mrs. Knill sued for divorce and requested child support for Stephen. At that time, unlike in the present case, where the petitioner waited six years after the couple\u2019s divorce and four years after the disclosure that the petitioner was not her father to dispute Julie\u2019s paternity, Mr. Knill denied that<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stephen was his natural child. According to the record, the Knills knew who Stephen\u2019s biological father was. In fact, the evidence at trial suggested that the natural father was \u201cat all times available for process and financially able to support Stephen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 510 A.2d at 547. There was also no evidence presented that Mr. Knill discouraged Mrs. Knill from seeking support from Stephen\u2019s biological father. The Circuit Court found that Mr. Knill was equitably estopped from denying his obligation to support Stephen financially and Mr. Knill appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Id. </em>This Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to argument in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Although we were satisfied that two of the required elements, representation and reliance, were present in the case, <em>Knill v.

Indeed, if any detriment was incurred by Stephen, it was emotional and attributable to his mother. It was she who ripped the \u201ccloak of legitimacy\u201d off the boy following a family dispute, when she revealed to him that [Mr. Knill] was not his father, a fact she had not concealed from the rest of the family. [Mr. Knill\u2019s] attempt to console Stephen demonstrates his concern for Stephen\u2019s emotional well-being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 537, 510 A.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held in present case that the error committed in ordering DNA testing tainted the trial court\u2019s ruling terminating the petitioner\u2019s child support obligation based on those test results. Nevertheless, it went further, opining that the same conclusion would obtain \u201ceven if the circuit court had properly ordered the genetic test.\u201d 180 Md.App. at 200, 949 A.2d at 63. In reaching that conclusion, the intermediate appellate court was persuaded that, when the trial court did not terminate the petitioner\u2019s paternity, it left intact his legal status as Julie\u2019s father, and with it the obligation, imposed by Family Law Article \u00a7 5-203<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>common law, to support Julie.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals was satisfied as well that laches<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> had been raised timely and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>applied to bar the petitioner\u2019s late challenge of his paternity. In addition, the intermediate appellate court relied on judicial estoppel.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Applying the test of judicial estoppel, we conclude that the application of the doctrine in this case is persuasive. As to the first prong, the petitioner acknowledged his paternity of Julie in the Circuit Court on two separate occasions: (1) in the Separation Agreement which he executed with Ms. Duckworth in December of 1998 and presented to the court for incorporation, he represented that Julie was born of the marriage and, thus, that he was her father and (2) in 2002 in his answer to Ms. Duckworth\u2019s petition to establish fixed visitation and child support, he counter-petitioned for custody and, subsequently, in a Memorandum of Understanding, again represented that Julie was born of the marriage. In the 2005 proceedings, at which the support order emanating <em>from </em>the Memorandum of Understanding was at issue, however, the petitioner changed his factual position and alleged in his answer to the respondent\u2019s motion to modify that child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>port order, that \u201cthe minor child, Julie Kamp, is not his biological daughter.\u201d Regarding the second prong, the position previously taken by the petitioner, inconsistent with his present one, had been accepted by the Circuit Court; responding to those filings, it had incorporated the Separation Agreement into the Judgment of Divorce and the Memorandum of Understanding into a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">As to the third prong of the judicial estoppel test, the petitioner knew, or should have known, both at the time of the divorce and custody proceedings and when Ms. Duckworth filed her petition to establish fixed visitation in 2002, that it was highly unlikely that he was Julie\u2019s father; he knew that he had had a vasectomy in 1987 and that Ms. Duckworth was involved in an affair during the time that Julie was conceived in 1992. Despite this knowledge, the petitioner, as we have seen, represented to the court that Julie was born of the marriage, she was his biological child. As a result of these representations the petitioner was awarded, successively and respectively, joint legal and shared physical custody. By claiming Julie as a dependant on his income taxes, moreover, the petitioner was also enabled to receive a tax deduction in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Nevertheless, we do not decide these issues. Indeed, we suggest that, where there is a belated request for DNA testing to challenge paternity, the success of which requires rebuttal of the presumption of paternity, a decision on these issues in advance of the decision whether to order testing is inappropriate. We have held, consistent with our prior cases, <em>see Turner </em>and <em>Evans, </em>both <em>supra, </em>that DNA testing to rebut the presumption of paternity requires a threshold showing of good cause that it is in the affected child\u2019s best interests to conduct such tests. The facts and considerations informing that preliminary determination are many of the same facts and considerations that inform the judicial estoppel and laches defenses. For example, how long the presumptive father maintained the father-daughter relationship and the manner in which he accepted and acknowledged it militates against rebuttal of the presumption and in favor of estoppel and laches. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>If the showing of good cause fails, then paternity remains extant, with its concomitant responsibilities; there would be no occasion to address the defenses. Similarly, if good cause is found and the test result favors the challenging presumptive father, it would seem to follow that the presumption will have been rebutted and paternity vacated. Because they will have been considered in the preliminary proceedings, it is difficult to conceive of how they then could be used to, in effect, overrule that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">HARRELL, MURPHY, and WILNER, JJ., Concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\">. Although it arose in the context of an action to increase child support, the focus of this appeal is on the issue of paternity. More particularly, the question to be resolved is, when the child that is the subject of the inquiry is born during the marriage, but the issue of paternity was raised for the first time years after the parties divorced and at no time during the marriage or its immediate aftermath, under what circumstances is testing to determine paternity appropriate. The child's paternity necessarily was one of the issues the divorce court had to consider and it necessarily was also the subject of agreement between the petitioner and Ms. Duckworth during divorce and subsequent related proceedings. Nevertheless, it was the Bureau of Support Enforcement (\u201cBOSE\u201d) that initiated the proceedings that resulted in the issue which prompted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The BOSE is a unit in the Department of Human Resources, Md.

Courts with similar statutes have reached dramatically different conclusions about the circumstances in which rebuttal of the marital presumption of paternity is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\"Central to these differences is the question of the role of genetic testing. In most states, scientific evidence of paternity creates a presumption of paternity. In some states scientific evidence of paternity creates a conclusive presumption. In those states that do not treat the results of genetic testing as a conclusive presumption, courts must determine whether the results of the genetic testing are, by themselves, sufficient to rebut the marital presumption or if other factors, such as equitable estoppel or the best interests of the child, prevent the rebuttal of the marital presumption.

Glendale Corp., </em>219 Md. 465, 468, 150 A.2d 433, 435 (1959)(noting that, although it is essential to raise the defense of laches in the pleadings, \u2018equity may decline relief for a stale claim after the facts are fully developed'); <em>Warburton v. Davis, </em>123 Md. 225, 231, 91 A. 163, 165 (1914)(recognizing that a court, in a proper case and on its own motion, may refuse to grant relief to a complainant who on the final hearing appears to have been guilty of laches, although the defense was not interposed by the defendant), <em>citing Syester v. Brewer, </em>27 Md. 288, 319 (1867). This Court has held that laches defense in equity 'is a defense in equity against stale claims, and is based upon grounds- of sound public policy by discouraging fusty demands for the peace of society.\u2019 <em>Ross, supra, </em>387 Md. at 668, 876 A.2d at 703, quoting <em>Parker v. Board of Election Supervisors, </em>230 Md. 126, 130, 186 A.2d 195, 197 (1962); <em>Buxton v. Buxton, </em>363 Md. 634, 645, 770 A.2d 152, 158 (2001); <em>Berman v. Leckner, </em>193 Md. 177, 187, 66 A.2d 392, 396 (1949); <em>Kaufman v. Plitt, </em>191 Md. 24, 28, 59 A.2d 634, 635 (1948). In its application, \u2018[tjhere is no inflexible rule as to what constitutes, or what does not constitute, laches; hence its existence must be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.\u2019 <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 669, 876 A.2d at 704, quoting <em>Parker, </em>230 Md. at 130, 186 A.2d at 197, <em>citing Brashears v. Collison, </em>207 Md. 339, 352, 115 A.2d 289, 295 (1955); <em>Bowie v. Ford, </em>269 Md. 111, 122, 304 A.2d 803, 810 (1973); <em>Day v. Day, </em>237 Md. 229, 236, 205 A.2d 798, 803 (1965).\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b725-5\">. The Court of Special Appeals did not address equitable estoppel. We believe that, unlike <em>Knill, </em>in the instant case, a <em>strong </em>case exists that the three elements required to raise an equitable estoppel are present. As mentioned earlier, the petitioner represented that he was Julie\u2019s biological father in several filings, including the Separation Agreement and the Memorandum of Understanding between the two parties, that were accepted by the Circuit Court, as evidenced by its incorporation of those agreements into the Judgment o\u00ed Divorce and the court order of March, 2003. Julie, as did Stephen in <em>Knill, </em>carried the same last name as the petitioner\u2019s other children. That signaled to the world that Julie was the petitioner\u2019s biological child. It is reasonable to believe that, during the approximately thirteen years before the petitioner requested a paternity test, Julie believed that the petitioner was her father, the incident in 2001 involving Mr. Stanton\u2019s daughter notwithstanding. Throughout Julie\u2019s life, before the paternity test request, she relied on the petitioner for financial support. Moreover, the petitioner was court ordered, albeit for the most part with his consent and agreement, to pay child support for Julie. There is no assurance that, once the petitioner is relieved of that obligation, it will be met from another source, from the biological father, who, as far as the record reflects, has neither volunteered nor been tequested to undertake it. There also is the matter of the child\u2019s emotional response to a ruling that would change her legal status and relationship. That too may be a detriment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Concurring Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AKV\">HARRELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4H\">which MURPHY and WILNER, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals; however, I write separately only to note that I would reach that conclusion solely upon the judicial estoppel analysis in the Majority opinion (Maj. op. at 672-78, 980 A.2d 464-68). The Majority opinion does not persuade me that the rest of its analysis is at all necessary. Thus, I would direct the Court of Special Appeals, in its remand of the case to the Circuit Court for Garrett County for further proceedings, specifically to deny Kamp\u2019s request to terminate his child support obligation and to reconsider Respondent\u2019s motion to modify child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Judge MURPHY and Judge WILNER authorize me to state that they join this concurrence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
