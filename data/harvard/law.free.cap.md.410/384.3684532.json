On January 2, 2002, Ray was adjudged incompetent to stand trial and was committed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which designated him to the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital in Jessup.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After five years elapsed, Ray filed a motion to dismiss the charges pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Section 3-107(a), and a hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Harford County, during which psychiatrists testified that Ray remained \u201cdangerous,\u201d but could be restored to competency to stand trial in the relatively near future. The judge denied Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss his charges, because he found that the seriousness of Ray\u2019s charges, coupled with his dangerousness and restorability, constituted \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to extend the time within which the charges were to be maintained. Ray appealed and petitioned this Court for immediate review, whereupon we granted the petition and issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Ray v. State, </em>406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 370-71 (2008), prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">Did the trial court err in finding \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to refuse to dismiss an incompetent defendant\u2019s charges without any \u201cextraordinary\u201d predicate?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">We shall hold that the judge erred in finding \u201cextraordinary cause,\u201d under Section 3-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article, and shall reverse the denial of Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">On February 27, 2001, John Wesley Ray was indicted by a Harford County Grand Jury for attempted first-degree mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>der, attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault and second-degree assault, stemming from a confrontation with a girlfriend. Prior to trial, Ray entered a plea of not criminally responsible (\u201cNCR\u201d), after which he was ordered to undertake a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he was competent' to stand trial. In January of 2002, a judge concluded that Ray was not competent to stand trial, and Ray was committed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which ultimately placed him at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital in Jessup, Maryland, where he has since lived. Annual evaluations related to Ray\u2019s incompetency have been filed each December with the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On January 5, 2007, five years after Ray had been found incompetent to stand trial, Ray\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss criminal charges pursuant to Section 3-107(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article, in which he argued that the charges had to be dropped because of the passage of time. The State opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing that the charges needed to be extended, because Ray continued to be both incompetent and dangerous, but restorable\u2014conditions constituting \u201cextraordinary cause.\u201d A hearing to address whether the charges should be maintained because of \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d was held in October of 2007, during which the State offered the testimony of four forensic psychiatrist experts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as two law enforcement officers and the victim\u2019s husband, in addition to hundreds of letters written by Ray while he was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Dr. Angela Kim-Lee, Director of Pretrial Services at Clifton T. Perkins Hospital, testified that Ray had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, that in the early stages of his treatment, Ray was under the belief that the FBI and different government agencies were conspiring against him, but that with treatment, in particular with antipsychotic medications, including Rispiridone and Geodon, his paranoid beliefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>had diminished over time. She stated that in 2005, she had believed that he was competent to stand trial and took a first step by referring him for a pretrial criminal responsibility evaluation, but that during the course of that evaluation, he had expressed paranoid beliefs that the victim of the crime was still trying to poison him; she explained that the pretrial evaluator ultimately determined that he remained not competent to stand trial. As of September 2007, Dr. Kim-Lee considered Ray to be \u201cdangerous,\u201d based on prior hospitalization for mental illness, stemming from violent encounters based on paranoid beliefs and his conduct while at Perkins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS-\">There were other hospitalizations prior to his admission at Perkins. Two specific hospitalizations at Fallston General Hospital, one in 1993 and one in 1994, and the hospital records from those admissions talk about Mr. Ray having an explosive temper, having periods of rage followed by memory loss. Two admissions occurred in the context of dangerous behavior. The first one was in 1993 was a result of Mr. Ray attacking his brother-in-law and then claiming no memory of it. The second hospitalization was reported to be also in the context of him having violent thoughts towards others. There were charges of assault and battery pending against him at the time as a result of the fight and there was also a charge of sexual assault against his daughter who was apparently two at that time. So there is a history of psychotic or of psychiatric hospitalizations that predates the current admission in Perkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">His admission in Perkins as we all know precipitated from the instant offense which Mr. Ray in our opinion continues to hold paranoid, delusional beliefs about the victim in the offense.... He has in the past acted on his symptoms by example of not resulting in his current arrest for the instant offense but he has also wrote numerous letters to various government agencies, various officials articulating his paranoid, delusional beliefs. He has a history of becoming agitated and threatening. He has contacted the victim during his hospitalization despite being told and aware that he is not only to do that against her wishes and the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>has perceived these contacts as threatening and has come to the point over the years that the hospital has had to restrict him from phone use. There is also an incident in which he had his mail supervised because he was sending unwanted communications or letters to a female at Howard County Detention Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">She also evaluated Ray as lacking \u201cinsight into his mental illness\u201d and opined that he would discontinue medication if released from Perkins. Dr. Kim-Lee testified further that in her opinion Ray was \u201crestorable\u201d to competency through further treatment and trials of antipsychotic medications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">It\u2019s my opinion Mr. Ray is considered restorable. He has a history of being restored in our Hospital, certainly respond-' ing, improving with treatment and there is no reason to doubt that he would not respond to treatment. He has only had a limited trial of a couple antipsychotic medications. There are a number of other alterative medications out there in addition to his current treatment plan he is getting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">[B]ased on his history of treatment .... he has demonstrated significant improvements from his previous mental state with the medication and so I think it\u2019s reasonable clinically to expect that he would continue to improve with continued treatment and trials of medication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Dr. Ana N. Cervantes, a staff psychiatrist at Perkins and supervisor of those patients at the Institution who had been determined to be incompetent to stand trial, testified that she agreed with Dr. Kim-Lee that Ray was both \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201crestorable\u201d and specifically expounded on the \u201crestorable\u201d characterization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">[Dr. Cervantes]: [T]he basis for my opinion [that Ray is restorable] is twofold. He has been restored in the past. In 2005 he was at the point where he was able to meet the standard for competent to stand trial. That wasn\u2019t sustained, but he was able to get there. And also it is my opinion that after speaking with him in October that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>certainly able to provide a large amount of relevant information, show that he was able to cooperate and assist in his defense more so than he had demonstrated in previous reports and it\u2019s my opinion that part of the reason we have not been able to obtain as much information as we would like is his lack of cooperation as opposed to psychotic symptoms only.... I mean that Mr. Ray chooses who he wishes to speak with and who he doesn\u2019t wish to speak with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">* \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: And do you have any other basis for your opinion he is restorable to competency in the reasonably near future?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">[Dr. Cervantes]: Well, I believe there is evidence that he is responding partially to his current treatment regiment and also in reviewing his medication he has received while at Clifton Perkins he certainly has not had an exhaustive trial of all the available antipsychotic medications or combinations thereof. He has only been on two antipsychotic medications. I believe currently he is on one. The[re] was a very recent medication change and I understand that there are plans to change medications at this particular time again. So certainly he has not had what we would consider an exhaustive trial of all the available medications that are used to treat this illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The State then called Dr. Marshall Smith, a fellow in forensic psychiatry at Perkins Institute, who had conducted a competency evaluation of Ray in August or September of 2007. Dr. Smith testified that in his opinion Ray was both \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201crestorable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">[State\u2019s Attorney] And based on your evaluation or your review of his records and his treatment plan do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether or not he is dangerous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">[Dr. Smith]: That opinion is that he is dangerous ... I base that on the history of prior dangerousness as Dr. [Kim-]Lee and Dr. Cervantes already mentioned. I also base that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>his active psychosis which mainly includes delusional thoughts or false fixed beliefs as mentioned previously and the fact that he continues to think that he is involved with criminal proceedings and helping folks to solve crimes, writing letters and things of that nature even after being directed on multiple occasions not to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: When you attempted to conduct your interview with him how many times did you attempt that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADH\">[Dr. Smith]: I went to him on three separate occasions. The first time he actually did come into the room and he told me he just didn\u2019t want to talk to me and he left. The second time when I wanted to speak to him we never made it into the room. He saw me and said I\u2019m not talking to you, and just turned and walked [a]way. That was probably I would say maybe three or four days after the first attempt. Then about a week later after the second attempt I tried again and got the same response. He saw me and just refused to even talk to me at all and just turned and walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: What, if any, impact did your inability to actually speak with Mr. Ray have on your ability to come to the conclusion or have the opinion as to his competency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">[Dr. Smith]: I mean it\u2019s always better to be able to in my opinion to interview somebody yourself so that you can formulate your own opinion. I think that\u2019s always best. But I think if the documentation is done well I think that you can, we often rely on history and what\u2019s documented to help us to make a decision and make more accurate diagnoses on a patient. Especially if the patient is not able to really give a verbal account then the chart is often very helpful because you have got a very clear day-to-day documentation over time about a particular person\u2019s illness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Dr. Smith then testified with respect to Ray\u2019s \u201crestorability\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdF\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: And do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether or not Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Ray can be restored to competency within the reasonably near future?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">[Dr. Smith]: Yes, I do.... I think that Mr. Ray can be restored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: In the relatively near future?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">[Dr. Smith]: I do.... I base that on just the fact that he was restored to competency back in 2005 when Dr. [Kim-]Lee evaluated him and that was her opinion then. I know there was a period of time when Mr. Ray refused to take medication but now he is back on medication. Even though he refused to talk to me, Dr. Cervantes did speak to him for over and hour on the 2nd of October and she felt like he really understood a lot of court procedures and thought he was well on his way. I also agree with what Dr. Cervantes says about Mr. Ray\u2019s choice on who he wants to speak to. He chooses not to speak, to me and I don\u2019t know why he chooses not to speak to me but I think that with his cooperation and his continued compliance with his medication that he can be restored to competency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Dr. Paolo J. Negro, Ray\u2019s treating psychiatrist at Perkins, testified about the specific manifestations of Ray\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: Now, since July of 2006 when you became his treating psychiatrist what has been the course of his treatment for this particular psychiatric condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">[Dr. Negro]: There are several aspects. You can take a perspective of how his behavior is in the unit. You can take an aspect of how his fundamental symptoms are. I would say that he responded partially to the medications. He was taking a high dose of Rispiridon when it started. And he was not as intense and angry and agitated at the time of the admission; however, he was too delusional in the sense he was still having fixed false ideas of multiple situations that were also described in his admission. So to the year he mostly presented with this partial improvement but with evidence of continuing symptomology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>So, for example, he still maintains he is a psychic detective, sends letters, you know, sends multiple letters to Mr. Ashcroft. I am not sure when was his last letter to the President, but he claims that he is helping solving crimes and that he has these powers that are partially blocked by medication use. He claims or he states that he has this Indian blot [sic] and he calls himself by an Indian name and so this actually continues in spite of treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: What does this tell you, the fact that he still has these delusions, what does this tell you about his overall diagnosis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">[Dr. Negro]: What happens is the following. All these delusions belong to the same thing which is the schizophrenia. He is very guarded about what he experiences. He got better enough not to tell what he is really thinking but to give little bits of it. So, for example, he tells me that he is a psychic detective and he can get very upset if we contradict him with that information. But in the last couple of times that we met he denied, for example, that he was Eagle Feather or some name like that from the Indian perspective although in the last letter from September that he sent out he was signing himself with that name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">So what that means is that all these delusions belong to the same process like it\u2019s all part of the same pie and the treatment helps him to understand that people find them part of his mental illness but he absolutely does not believe that this is a mental illness. He just gets better enough to be able to portray himself as showing improvement in order to ask for his release basically. I am not sure if that\u2019s the question that you asked but that\u2019s what I observed through the year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">With respect to whether Ray responded to antipsychotic mediation, Dr. Negro opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">[Dr. Negro]: He shows improvement. What happens is some people, they never really respond. So we have pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tients at Perkins at the present time who we give high doses of antipsychotics and never get better, tell you they are still hearing voices, they don\u2019t get better, they have the delusions and the delusions are very active and they keep acting upon the delusions. They cannot control themselves. They cannot even prevent themselves from talking about the delusions. Then you have some people that of course they get much better right away from medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">He is in the middle. He shows response with the Rispiridon, not enough to be able to be released safely from the hospital but enough to not be a danger to others while in the hospital and enough to recognize that other people find this quite psychotic and that he should not talk about it because if he talks about it people would think he has a real problem and they believe he is crazy. So he has this understanding but that does not mean that he truly believes that he has a mental illness. He thinks he has psychic powers and the whole treatment is just impeding the psychic powers. \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Dr. Negro finally testified that in his opinion Ray was restorable with treatment with the drug Clozapine, but indicated, however, that Ray had not begun using the drug because Ray\u2019s brother\u2019s consent, as his guardian, needed to be secured. Negro characterized restoration of Ray to competency as dependent on the administration of the appropriate medication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">I am very concerned and I think that the treatment, I think it\u2019s not fair to not extend the time because, number one, he refused medication until 2004 and I think that we still have a treatment that is very specific and very effective that we did try which is the Clozapine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">I will say this. I have no problem to say he has 90 percent or more chance of being competent on Clozapine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">I believe he will be restored to competency. I think that it\u2019s just a matter to adjust and give the right medication to him. I will tell you this\u2014to my understanding, and I hope I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>am not forcing a wrong number here, but when people go through the system in the Hospital the reincarceration rate is one percent. The system is you start in a locked maximum security unit and then you go to medium. The medium is like a regular, locked unit in any other place. Then you go to minimal. Then you learn how to cope, you learn how to behave and then you go out in the community. When people go through this whole system they tend not to come back and what I believe for him is that when he gets the right medication he will go to medium, he will be able to progress and he will eventually be able to not only be released but not come back to the Hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Dr. Negro, like the other experts, also testified that he believed that Ray was \u201cdangerous,\u201d to himself and others, specifically the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">I am very concerned about the victim. To a certain degree he could be a danger to himself also and I will explain. There is a specific concern. What\u2019s going to happen, and I can guarantee this, he is going to get released, he is going to stop his medications, he is going to get to the victim\u2019s house. Now, I cannot guarantee he will get into the house or he will find the house, but he is going to try and find the house. He is going to try, he is going to do it. It is in his mind. He is still delusional about the victim, not only about the victim but if you look at the letter of September, if I remember the date September maybe 12, he is asking for his biological children to be brought here today and he calls. There is an older letter he calls himself I think Eagle Feather and he gives Indian names to the kids. So the kids are part of the delusion so he may very well go after the kids as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">And then he can be a danger to himself because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to you, you know, how people are going to react to that. Even if he shows up on her doorstep what\u2019s going to be the response, or at the school. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>I don\u2019t know. So I predict that. I am specifically predicting that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">He says that the treatments are a hindrance against his powers.... A hindrance, something that goes against his powers, his psychic powers. His psychic powers are there to help people to solve crimes. I asked him specifically are you going to go and get [the victim] after you leave and he told me no because I am going to be solving crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">So the delusions that caused the instant offense are still there. Therefore, I can predict very well that there will be enactment on the same delusions. And I don\u2019t want to see neither her, her family or him getting hurt in the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The State also called the husband and representative of the victim, who testified about Ray\u2019s attempts to contact his wife from Perkins Hospital, both by telephone and through letters addressed to their home and her workplace. Specifically, he testified that after Ray had contacted his residence, he had called Perkins on several occasions to get Ray to stop. On one such occasion, the husband explained, he spoke to Ray, and Ray asked him, \u201cwhat are you going to do when the Pagans come knocking at your door,\u201d which he acknowledged frightened him and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Lisa Marts, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney responsible for initiating the charges against Ray, also testified to the effect that she had received hundreds of letters from Ray over the years, in many of which Ray purported to have investigative leads to unsolved crimes; all of the letters were admitted into evidence. Ms. Marts further testified that recently she had perceived the tone of the letters to be more threatening. Detective Tom Walsh, who knew Ray as a result of Ray\u2019s prior work as a police informant, took the stand and explained that he also had received many of Ray\u2019s letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Closing arguments ensued, primarily addressing the question of whether \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d existed to extend the time to maintain Ray\u2019s criminal charges within the strictures of Section 3-107. The State argued that \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d was extant, because Ray\u2019s charges were severe, Ray posed a danger to himself and to society, and he could be restored to competency in the near future with treatment at Perkins Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Ray\u2019s counsel argued that before the adoption of current Section 3-107(a) in 2006, Section 12\u2014106(a)(2)(ii) of the Health-General Article governed dismissal of criminal charges, and permitted, but did not require, a judge to dismiss charges if competency was not restored, and only after five years had elapsed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ray argued that amended Section 3-107(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article, mandated that a judge dismiss charges after five years. Regarding whether there existed \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to warrant denial of a motion to dismiss, Ray\u2019s counsel argued that the plain meaning of the word <em>extraordimry </em>is, \u201ccause beyond what is ordinary, usual or common place,\u201d and that there is nothing out of the ordinary about patients in Perkins being both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>dangerous and restorable. Ray\u2019s counsel explained that neither <em>restorability </em>nor <em>dangerousness </em>are helpful to inform what is <em>extraordinary, </em>because a prerequisite to commitment in Perkins is commission of a violent crime or posing a safety risk to the public, and it is Perkins\u2019 goal to treat patients to \u201crestore\u201d them to competency to stand trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, Ray was like all the other patients at Perkins and there was nothing at all \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The judge reserved ruling and, thereafter, issued a written opinion denying Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss and granting the State\u2019s petition to extend time. The judge explored the meaning of <em>extraordinary </em>through dictionary definitions, as well as through the history of the enactment of Section 3-107 and a discussion of cases where, in other circumstances, Maryland appellate courts had opined on the meaning of the word:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">One of the cardinal principles of statutory construction is that we give words their ordinary dictionary definitions unless the context in which they are used in the statute indicates otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\"><em>Chapter 353 </em>of the <em>Laws of Maryland 2006 </em>(HB795) was a comprehensive rewriting of Sections <em>3-104\u20143-108 </em>of the <em>Laws of Maryland </em>dealing with incompetency and criminal responsibility. The purpose clause of this bill, as it relates to <em>Section 3-107, </em>states: \u201c... requiring a court to dismiss, under certain circumstances, a certain charge after passage of certain time periods; requiring a certain notifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tion to a certain person who has filed a certain request for notification ... and generally relating to criminal defendants and incompetency and criminal responsibility.\u201d The legislature did not define, for the purposes of the change, its intent to ascribe to the word \u201cextraordinary\u201d anything other than its normal meaning. <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>describes extraordinary as \u201cgoing beyond what is usual, regular or customary; exceptional to a very marked extent.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, </em>goes much further. <em>Black\u2019s </em>defines extraordinary as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cOut of the ordinary; exceeding the usual, average or normal measure or degree; beyond or out of the common order of rules; not usual, regular, or of a customary kind; remarkable, uncommon; rare :.. the word is both comprehensive and flexible in meaning. Beyond or out of the common order or method, exceeding the ordinary degree; not ordinary; unusual; ... extraordinary designates an accident, casually, occurrence or risk of a class or kind other than those which ordinary experience or prudence would foresee, anticipate or provide for ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\"><em>Black\u2019s </em>also defines a number of terms using extraordinary. Such as extraordinary care, extraordinary circumstances, extraordinary damage, extraordinary hazard, and extraordinary risk among others. <em>Black\u2019s </em>defines extraordinary risk as: \u201can extraordinary risk is one lying outside of the sphere of the normal, arising out of conditions not usual in the business. Is one which is not normally and necessarily incident to the employment ...\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>further defines cause as, among other things, a reason for an action or condition or a ground of a legal action. It is thus apparent that the use of the phrase \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d in <em>Section 3-107(a) </em>may be stated as something out of the ordinary. The appellate courts of this State have from time to time opined, although in other contexts, what extraordinary means. In <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979), the Court of Appeals defined the term as: \u201c... is cause beyond which is ordinary, usual or common place. It exceeds the common order of rule and is not regular or of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the customary kind\u201d (285 Md. 310 at 319, 403 A.2d 356). Extraordinary cause is a higher standard that has to be determined by a trial judge based on the circumstances existent in the particular case. <em>See State v. Toney, </em>315 Md. 122, 553 A.2d 696 (1989); <em>In re Ryan S., </em>139 Md.App. 94, 774 A.2d 1193 (2001); and <em>Guarnera v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 562, 318 A.2d 243 (1974). These cited cases are in the context of speedy trial issues but are helpful in distinguishing between what is considered ordinary, usual or common place and what is extraordinary. It is perfectly clear that the State\u2019s burden under the current iteration of <em>3-107(a) </em>is to establish a higher standard\u2014something out of the ordinary or exceptional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The judge then held that \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d existed to extend the time governing the dismissal of Ray\u2019s criminal charges, because of Ray\u2019s dangerousness and restorability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">1. From the time he was found not competent to stand trial on January 2, 2002, until sometime in 2004, Mr. Ray refused treatment. It was only after a guardian was appointed for him (his brother) that he consented to any treatment via medication or other modalities. The hospital (Clifton T. Perkins) has to take steps to make sure that he takes his medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">2. The underlying criminal charges involve an allegation by the State that Mr. Ray attempted to kill his then girlfriend. It has been made very clear to Mr. Ray that she wishes to have no contact with him. He has been told to refrain from any contact with her. As noted in his last evaluation report of September 12, 2007, Mr. Ray continued to send letters to the victim who is now married. In addition to writing letters to her, he has made some contact by telephone. At various times he has claimed that one of the reasons the underlying criminal case occurred was that his girlfriend and her mother had drugged him. In one of his letters to her dated January 29, 2007, Mr. Ray advised the victim that he had survived through it all despite the fact that she had lied about him. He told her that she had \u201cnow you turned into a witch and was now a true warrior.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>The victim is now married. <em>Section 3-107 </em>allows and indeed requires notice to a victim or victim\u2019s representative .... [T]he victim\u2019s current husband testified that the victim is still afraid of him. He described the letters and phone calls from Mr. Ray to the victim and related four telephone calls from Mr. Ray to the victim that were very disturbing to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">3. Mr. Ray has written literally hundreds of letters to Detective Thomas Walsh of the Harford County Sheriffs Department, Lisa Marts, Esquire, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney who was assigned to the case originally, the Attorney General of the United States, the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other members of the Harford County Sheriffs Department. I have carefully reviewed the letters which have been segregated by year. Some of them are very disturbing while others are somewhat innocuous. The letters illustrate the delusional nature of Mr. Ray. In some of his recent letters, he has demanded that he be provided with money and other things. Ms. Marts testified that she found some of the letters to be very threatening. A careful review of them leads me to concur with her observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">4. All four of the psychiatrists from Clifton T. Perkins who testified agree that Mr. Ray presents a clear and present danger to himself and others as a result of his mental condition. The medication he is taking has had some positive effect. The doctors believe, however, that if Mr. Ray were to be released (these charges dismissed) he would not take his medication. They believe this to be the case because Mr. Ray at various times indicated that he does not believe that he is mentally ill and needs no treatment. Without treatment it is clear that his mental illness would likely be exacerbated. His delusions include the idea that he believes that he has \u201cpsychic powers\u201d to solve crimes. Several years ago he was evidently of assistance to law enforcement in investigating some criminal offenses in Cecil County. While this may be true, his delusional state continues. The doctors feel so strongly about his condition that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>these charges were to be dismissed, they would immediately seek to obtain civil commitment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">5. As pointed out in his most recent evaluation dated September 12, 2007, he continues to display psychotic behavior; continues to be delusional; and has no insight into his illness. His current delusional symptoms were described as \u201cprominent.\u201d One of his treating psychiatrists, Dr. Smith, in commenting on Mr. Ray\u2019s dangerousness, described him as exhibiting active psychotic symptoms that influence his behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">The psychiatrists all agree that he continues to be \u201crestorable.\u201d That means that the doctors believe that with continuing treatment he may progress to the point where he is competent to stand trial. That has not as yet occurred. Even if it were to reach that point, there would then have to be a separate evaluation with regard to criminal responsibility which, of course, has not yet occurred because of his status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Accordingly, the judge denied Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss and granted the State\u2019s motion to extend time to maintain Ray\u2019s criminal charges. Ray appealed, and we granted Ray\u2019s petition for certiorari, prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 708-09; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006); <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604-05, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004). \u201cOccasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language.\u201d <em>Robey v. State, </em>397 Md. 449, 454, 918 A.2d 499, 502 (2007), citing <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078, 1084 (2005). \u201cIn such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"> If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003). When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body,\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 390, 863 A.2d 952, 962 (2004); <em>Drew v. First Guar. Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003), and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613-14, 937 A.2d 242, 258 (2007); <em>Magnetti v. Univ. of Md., </em>402 Md. 548, 565, 937 A.2d 219, 229 (2007); <em>Clipper Windpower, Inc. v. Sprenger, </em>399 Md. 539, 554, 924 A.2d 1160, 1168 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The sole issue in this case is whether \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d existed to extend the time for Ray\u2019s criminal charges or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>whether the charges should have been dismissed, because five years had elapsed since Ray was found not competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u201cExtraordinary cause\u201d is not statutorily defined, but we have in the past referred to it as, \u201c... cause beyond which is ordinary, usual or common place; it exceeds the common order or rule and is not regular or of the customary kind.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 319, 403 A.2d 356, 361 (1979). Themes of rarity, irregularity and unusualness also pervade the definition of <em>extraordinary </em>in Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 444 (11th ed.2003) (\u201cgoing beyond what is usual, regular, or customary; exceptional to a very marked extent.\u201d). The definition of extraordinary cause, however, does not appear to be in dispute, and we recognize that extraordinary means beyond that which is ordinary, usual or commonplace; what constitutes functionally as \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d remains the dilemma.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Ray\u2019s counsel argues that the standard of \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d must be measured within a context of violent offenders, who are incompetent to stand trial but capable of being restored to competency. Measured against this context, Ray\u2019s attorney asserts, Ray\u2019s situation is not extraordinary because committing a serious crime and being dangerous are prerequisites to admission at Perkins, and the mission of Perkins is to \u201crestore\u201d defendants to competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The State posits that \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d must be evaluated in light of problems that are implicated when serious criminal charges are dismissed against a defendant who poses a danger to society, to the victim and to the victim\u2019s family, but who arguably can be restored to competency to stand trial. In general, the State argues that protection of the public from Ray, and the fact that he is restorable, warrants a finding of \u201cextraordinary cause.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>A review of the legislative history of Section 3-107 of the Criminal Procedure Article elucidates that such a finding was intended to be limited to only the rarest of circumstances and that neither the seriousness of the charge nor the dangerousness or restorability of the individual is solely determinative. Apparently, before 1967, there was no statute providing for dismissal of criminal charges against an individual who could not be restored to competency. Rather, if a defendant was adjudged incompetent to stand trial, he/she would be committed to an institution, and criminal charges would be stayed until such time as he/she could stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">Whenever any person charged with the commission of any crime, offense, or misdemeanor shall appear to the court or be alleged to be a lunatic or insane, or if the court shall have any reason to suspect that such person may be a lunatic or insane the court may cause the Department of Mental Hygiene to inquire whether such person is at the time of such inquiry insane or lunatic, or of such mental incapacity as to prevent such person from properly conducting his or her defense or advising as to the conduct of his or her defense; and if the Department of Mental Hygiene shall find that such person is at the time of such inquiry insane or lunatic [or incapable of conducting a defense] ... the court shall in its discretion direct such person to be confined in Spring Grove State Hospital, or such other institution as may be designated, from time to time, by the Department of Mental Hygiene for the care or treatment of the criminal insane, until he or she shall have recovered and shall stay the proceedings against such person until that time, and upon recovery the court shall proceed with the trial of the charge pending against such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Maryland Code (1951), Article 59, Section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In 1967, Section 8 of Article 59 was repealed and re-enacted to include procedures prescribing dismissal of charges against a defendant who had been adjudged incompetent. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>8(b) of Chapter 709 of the Maryland Laws of 1967 permitted a judge to dismiss charges against a defendant who had not become competent, but only after 10 years had elapsed since the finding of incompetency in a capital case and 5 years had elapsed in all other cases punishable by imprisonment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">Whether or not the defendant is confined, if the court is of the view that so much time has elapsed since the finding of incompetency that it would be unjust to resume the criminal proceedings, the court may dismiss the charge; provided, that in capital cases the court may not dismiss the charge until ten (10) years have elapsed from the date of the finding of incompetency and in all other cases punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary the court may not dismiss the charge until five (5) years have elapsed from the date of the finding of incompetency. The Department of Mental Hygiene shall annually report to each court under whose commitment it may hold any person pursuant to this section a list of all such persons in its custody, along with any recommendations' which it may deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney instituting the charges shall within thirty (30) days forward to the court and to the last counsel for each person charged his recommendation as to the disposition of charges against persons who, by reason of the length of their detention, might be eligible for release under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">1967 Maryland Laws, Chapter 709, Section 8(b). This language remained essentially the same until 1982,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when it was amended and re-codified by Chapter 24 of the Laws of 1982 as Section 12-105 of Health-General Article (1982), to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Whether or not the defendant is confined, if the court considers that resuming the criminal proceeding would be unjust because so much time has passed since the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial, the court may dismiss the charge.

Five years later, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 353 of the Maryland Laws of 2006, to deal specifically with the dismissal of charges against defendants who had been adjudged incompetent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">AN ACT ... FOR the purpose of ... authorizing the court to reconsider the question of whether a defendant is incompetent to stand trial at any time before final judgment ...; requiring a court to dismiss, under circumstances, a certain charge after passage of certain time periods ...; requiring a certain notification of [certain individuals]; and generally relating to criminal defendants and incompetency and criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">2006 Maryland Laws, Chapter 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The \u201cBackground\u201d Section of the-Senate Judicial Committee Floor Report to House Bill 795 discusses the impetus for the bill as a lawsuit initiated by numerous defendants previously adjudged incompetent to stand trial, in which they claimed violations of their due process rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Constitution Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as a result of their being held indefinitely in Department of Health and Mental Hygiene facilities, after having been adjudged incompetent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In August 2004, the Maryland Disability Law Center filed a law suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on behalf of five individuals who were found incompetent to stand trial and committed to DHMH facilities for treatment to restore competency, alleging that commitment of defendants found incompetent to stand trial violated the defendant\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of rights because it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u2022 allows people to be institutionalized who are charged with a criminal offense, but who are never going to be restored to competency to stand trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u2022 allows for the commitment of people for treatment to restore competency to stand trial on misdemeanor charges beyond the maximum penalty that could have been received if convicted of the charges; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u2022 fails to provide for review by the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">According to the Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA), there are 100 people being held in MHA facilities [that] are not able to stand trial and doctors have determined that 12 of the detainees are not likely to become competent to stand trial. DDA estimates that 35 individuals being held in its facility are not able to stand trial. This population is not an annual occurrence, but has instead accumulated over time. This bill is the result of a workgroup convened during the 2005 interim, which included representatives of the Courts, the Office of the Public Defender, State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Office of the Attorney General, the Maryland Disabilities Law Center, Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center, and other interested groups and individuals. This bill represents a work-product that is the result of long discussion and compromise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report on HB 795, at 7 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">As the Floor Report noted, numerous public interest groups, participating in workgroups, assisted in the process of developing the amendments to Sections 3-104 to 3-107 and 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>123 of the Criminal Procedure Article, and various of the participants testified in favor of the bill. Representatives of the Maryland Disability Law Center provided written testimony noting that, \u201cHouse Bill 795 provides the due process and equal protection that has been illegally withheld from [the class of individuals adjudged incompetent] for 34 years.\u201d The Mental Health Association of Maryland<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> also urged a favorable report on the Bill, focusing on the need to move nonviolent individuals out of institutions rather than permitting them to \u201clanguish\u201d in facilities well beyond the maximum time that they could have served for their alleged crime. The Maryland Department of Disabilities, in written testimony, noted that \u201c[p]eople who have psychiatric disabilities who find themselves involved with the courts should be assured that they will not be held as incompetent to stand trial for indefinite periods of time without the benefit of periodic review of their competency. This bill addresses that need.\u201d Of particular note, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, itself, strongly favored the bill, emphasizing the need for civil commitment proceedings when a defendant is adjudged incompetent to stand trial but not restorable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Under current law if a Court finds a defendant incompetent to stand trial and dangerous to self or person or property of others due to mental illness or mental retardation, the defendant may be committed to the Department until the Court finds the defendant is no longer incompetent to stand trial or is no longer, because of mental illness or mental retardation, a danger to self or others. At issue was whether an individual could remain committed to the Department as [incompetent to stand trial] for a period longer than the maximum sentence the Defendant would have served if they had been found competent and guilty. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>addition, it was legally debatable as to whether a Defendant could remain court committed to the Department for treatment indefinitely especially if it was it was not is [sic] likely the Defendant would become competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future. This bill was drafted to address these concerns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">The bill provides that if an individual is found not competent due to mental illness and not likely to be restored to competency, the court may civilly commit the individual to a state psychiatric hospital if certain findings are made. The Department recommended the individual be returned to the State hospital for a commitment hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, pursuant to Health General Title 10. The individual therefore would be treated in an identical manner as other individuals presented for civil commitment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiI\">Bill File, H.B. 795 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The Office of the Public Defender, in written testimony, explained that a change in the provisions of Section 3-107 was needed in light of the case of <em>Jackson v. Indiana, </em>406 U.S. 715, 729, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1854, 32 L.Ed.2d 435, 446 (1972), in which the Supreme Court held that it violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment for a State to hold an individual adjudged incompetent indefinitely. In <em>Jackson, </em>Jackson was a mentally impaired deaf mute who argued that his indefinite commitment to an Indiana state mental institution, after having been adjudged mentally incompetent to stand trial, amounted to a life sentence for a robbery. At the time, under the Indiana statute, if the court found that the defendant \u201chas not comprehension sufficient to understand the proceedings and make his defense,\u201d trial was to be delayed indefinitely until such time as the defendant could stand trial. <em>Id. </em>at 720-21, 92 S.Ct. at 1849, 32 L.Ed.2d at 440-41. Jackson argued that he was denied equal protection, because civil commitment would have required the State to shoulder a greater burden to warrant detention, and due process, because he could be indefinitely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>committed without the benefit of appropriate process. <em>Id. </em>at 723-24, 92 S.Ct. at 1850-51, 32 L.Ed.2d at 442-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Court agreed with Jackson on both accounts and held that Indiana could not hold Jackson indefinitely under their criminal commitment statute. In ruling on Jackson\u2019s equal protection challenge, Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing on behalf, of the Court, recognized that Indiana\u2019s civil commitment statute would have required the State to make at least, \u201c(1) a showing of mental illness and (2) a showing that the individual is in need of \u2018care, treatment, training or detention,\u2019 \u201d and that with regard to detention a showing of \u201cdangerousness\u201d was required. <em>Id. </em>at 728-29, 92 S.Ct. at 1853, 32 L.Ed.2d at 445. He also noted that under the Indiana civil commitment statute, release was available, \u201cwhen the individual no longer requires the custodial care or treatment or detention that occasioned the commitment, or when the department of mental health believes release would be in his best interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on this analysis, a unanimous Court concluded that mere pendency of criminal charges did not justify vastly different substantive and procedural rights that would have been afforded to Jackson had his commitment been in the civil context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">The harm to the individual is just as great if the State, without reasonable justification, can apply standards making his commitment a permanent one when standards generally applicable to all others afford him a substantial opportunity for early release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">As we noted above, we cannot conclude that pending-criminal charges provide a greater justification for different treatment than conviction and sentence. Consequently, we hold that by subjecting Jackson to a more lenient commitment standard and to a more stringent standard of release than those generally applicable to all others not charged with offenses, and by thus condemning him in effect to permanent institutionalization without the showing required for commitment or the opportunity for release afforded by \u00a7 22-1209 or \u00a7 22-1907, Indiana deprived petitioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 729-30, 92 S.Ct. at 1853-54, 32 L.Ed.2d at 446 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Jackson\u2019s indefinite commitment also violated due process, the Court recognized, because Jackson had not been afforded a hearing to address the basis for holding him indefinitely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARr\">It is clear that Jackson\u2019s commitment rests on proceedings that did not purport to bring into play, indeed did not even consider relevant, <em>any </em>of the articulated bases for exercise of Indiana\u2019s power of indefinite commitment. The state statutes contain at least two alternative methods for invoking this power.

Without any mandate that this \u201cincompetent yet restorable\u201d person be committed, civil commitment of the person is optional, and dependent on initiation of civil commitment proceedings by a person or institution with a legitimate interest. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (2000, 2005 RepLVol.), Section 10-614 of the Health-General article (addressing who may file an application for involuntary admission of an individual to a facility).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In my view, <em>this </em>is an anomaly because the prospect of achieving competency to stand trial in the foreseeable future does not render a person any less dangerous, or less in need of current commitment to an institution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, I conclude that the legislature\u2019s failure to include any <em>mandate </em>in CP Section 3-106 to civilly commit this \u201cincompetent yet restorable\u201d person, or otherwise address this situation, means that it did not anticipate this situation arising often. Because the legislature did not consider this situation to be an ordinary one that would often arise, I deduce that it did not intend to exclude this set of circumstances from the meaning of \u201cextraordinary cause to extend the time\u201d before mandatory dismissal under CP Section 8-107(a). Without extending the pending criminal charges, civil commitment is the only option, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and I emphasize that it is optional, not mandatory. Moreover, I see nothing in the law which guarantees that there will be no gap between the present commitment and a civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In addition to Ray\u2019s dangerousness and restorability, we also should consider that, although five years have passed since his original commitment, Ray has recently written threatening letters to the victim of his alleged assault with the intent to murder, and that the victim fears him. If charges were to be dismissed, and Ray released for as little as one day, it is entirely possible that he could go straight to the victim\u2019s house or workplace and inflict harm on her. He has also written hundreds of letters to the prosecutor in his case, which have recently become more threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The majority relies on the notion that dangerousness and restorability cannot be \u201cextraordinary\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">[Extraordinary cause must require more than dangerousness and restorability, in order to avoid the necessity of civil commitment that requires greater procedural protections. Dangerousness, the norm for defendants institutionalized at Perkins, cannot be viewed as extraordinary, especially because it is but one factor for civil commitment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">While dangerousness may be the norm for defendants at Perkins, there is no showing that the normal Perkins resident is also one who, after five years, has sufficient improvement so as to be restorable to competency in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Perkins psychiatrists have identified a specific medicine that they believed could improve Ray\u2019s mental capacity to such point that he would be competent to stand trial, but cannot administer that medicine until Ray\u2019s brother, his legal guardian, consents to such treatment. The Circuit Court found credible the psychiatrists\u2019 testimony that if he \u201cwere to be released (these charges dismissed) he would not take his medication\u201d because he does not acknowledge his illness. As a consequence, \u201chis mental illness would likely be exacerbated.\u201d It found credible their testimony that Ray \u201cpresents a clear and present danger to himself and others[.]\u201d All of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>these factors just mentioned contributed to the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201cextraordinary cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Finally, I point out that Ray does not fit within the intended protections sought by the Maryland Disability Law Center and others in promoting the formulation and passage of CP Section 3-107, which are set forth in the majority opinion. As the majority details more fully, the impetus for the bill was to protect people:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u2022 who are never going to be restored to competency to stand trial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u2022 who are committed beyond the maximum penalty that could have been imposed if convicted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u2022 whose detainment has no review by the courts</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Ray simply does not fit this description. Further, as the majority records, the Mental Health Association of Maryland \u201curged a favorable report on the Bill, focusing on the need to move non-violent individuals out of institutions rather than permitting them to languish in facilities well beyond the maximum time that they could have served for their alleged crime.\u201d The continued detention of Ray, who is considered violent and dangerous, and who is subject to an annual hearing by the court, is not inconsistent with the goals of any of these organizations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. These facts and others were all set forth more fully by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\">. The majority sees an anomaly in that Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Section 3-106 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\u201d) mandates civil commitment for a person who is incompetent, dangerous, and cannot be restored, but criminal-type commitment for a person who can, in the foreseeable future, be restored to competency to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\">.
