Code, \u00a7 211).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment of conviction is reversed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Minor, William O., and another young man participated in a robbery of Geraldine Sprechman on August 13, 1976, at approximately 11 p.m. in a lighted area of a parking area in the middle of Vermont Avenue in front of a card casino in the City of Gardena. Mrs. Sprechman, the victim, had a brief opportunity to observe the minor, William O., and the other robbery participant, who was armed with a hand gun, during the few seconds from the time the robbery action commenced until her purse, containing $1,000 in traveler\u2019s checks and $400 in jewelry, was taken from her by the minor, William O; she then ran screaming back to the card casino. The victim\u2019s husband had been face to face with the man with the gun. When the victim ran back toward the card casino, the two young robbers left the parking lot, running, with the minor carrying Mrs. Sprechman\u2019s purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Mrs. Sprechman gave the police a description of the minor, including the clothes he wore, and a description of the other man, including his hair (\u201ccurly Afro\u201d). The other man was described as being older than the minor but young. Mr. Sprechman recalls that the other man wore dark clothing, wore no cap, and had no beard.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The minor was arrested a short time later in the general vicinity of the place of the robbeiy. Mrs. Sprechman\u2019s purse was found nearby and nothing was missing from it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. and Mrs. Sprechman were taken by police officers to the place of the arrest and they identified the minor as one of the robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The minor was taken to the Gardena police station and placed in a juvenile holding cell. The minor\u2019s mother, Mrs. Kathleen O., came to the police station and spoke with her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">On the basis of information supplied by the minor and his mother, an arrest warrant was issued and appellant Allen was arrested in his home at approximately 5 a.m. on August 14, 1976, as the other robbery suspect. The arresting officers searched the bedroom area where appellant was arrested and found no gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Appellant was incarcerated in the Gardena jail where he had a conversation with two prisoners, Raymond Beck and Jorge Feliciano. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Beck and Feliciano later told a Gardena police officer at the jail that appellant admitted his participation in the robbery with a minor accomplice who was now trying to \u201cstick the rap\u201d on him. Appellant was reported to have said that he would hope to avoid identification by changing his hair from curls to \u201ccombed straight back.\u201d Appellant is also reported to have said that he hoped to get his sister to talk the minor into \u201ctaking the rap.\u201d The statements of Beck and Feliciano were tape recorded and the tape was played for the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The minor testified at the trial for the prosecution that the robbery was appellant\u2019s idea; that appellant had the gun; and that the appellant participated in the robbery. On cross-examination, in an attempt to impeach the minor and to show a motive for untruthful testimony, appellant was permitted to elicit from the minor that the disposition phase of his juvenile case arising out of the Sprechman robbery was still pending. Appellant was not permitted to cross-examine the minor about two other pending juvenile charges against him involving recent robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Mrs. Kathleen O., minor\u2019s mother, testified for the prosecution that appellant\u2019s sister told her, after appellant was arrested, that she, the sister, would lie in court to help appellant. This was denied by appellant\u2019s sister who testified that Mrs. O. wanted appellant to tell the police that he was with the minor in the robbery. During the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal, Mrs. O. stated that appellant\u2019s sister told her that appellant was \u201con parole.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Appellant testified, denying his participation in the robbeiy and denying that he told Beck and Feliciano, in the Gardena jail, that he did participate in the robbeiy. He does admit that he told these men, when asked, that he was being charged with a robbeiy. Appellant testified that he and the minor did not get along very well. Appellant denied stating to the other prisoners that he changed his hair style to avoid identification. Appellant testified that he was with his sisters during the entire evening of August 13, 1976, although he did see the minor around 8:30 and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>did see Mrs. O. around 11 p.m. Testimony, of appellant\u2019s sisters corroborated his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The identification testimony of Mrs. Sprechman and of her husband as to the appellant was marginal, but the appellant had a beard at the time of trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Contentions Of Appellant</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The prosecution admits that \u201c. . . the testimony of [Mrs. O.] and [the minor], on one hand, and the appellant\u2019s cellmates on the other, would be somewhat suspect if either was alone and unsupported . . . .\u201d In this close case, appellant asserts that the trial court committed error in four different instances requiring a reversal of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">1. The trial court impermissibly restricted appellant\u2019s lawyer from cross-examining the minor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the key prosecution witness, as to the existence of other pending robbery charges. The thrust of this contention of appellant is that he was prejudicially denied the right to present evidence by cross-examination of the minor of a motive to fabricate or other motive from which the jury could infer untruthful testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">2. The trial court committed reversible error when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial after . Mrs. O., as a rebuttal prosecution witness, testified that appellant was \u201con parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">3. The trial court erred when it gave as a juiy instruction CALJIC No. 2.04\u2014efforts by appellant to fabricate evidence\u2014inasmuch as the instruction was not based on eyidence and was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">4. The trial court committed reversible error when it refused to instruct the jury that the issue of an arrest warrant may not be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>as evidence of guilt after the jury questioned the court about the procedure for the issuance of an arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">\n<em>The Trial Court Erred In Limiting Cross-Examination On the Issue Of The Motive To Fabricate Or To Give A Truthful Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">A party can offer evidence, by preferred extrinsic evidence or by cross-examination of a witness, to attack the credibility of a witness, if such evidence tends reasonably to establish that the witness has a motive to fabricate, or some other motive, that tends to cause the giving of untruthful testimony, even though there may be no reasonable basis for the existence of such a motive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 484-485 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Espinoza </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 287, 291 [140 Cal.Rptr. 846]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 876, 883 [91 Cal.Rptr. 904], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chi Ko Wong </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 698, 716 [135 Cal.Rptr. 392, 557 P.2d 976]; Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (1972) \u00a7 28.8(c); Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) Introduction of Evidence at Trial, \u00a7\u00a7 1229, 1231, and 1977 supp. thereto.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">This evidence, offered to show a bias, a prejudice or a motive to fabricate, is evidence of a state of mind. <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook, \u00a7 28.8.)  The minor must have had the expectation, the 'belief, the state of mind, that he was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>receive prosecution immunity, or a lighter juvenile disposition in connection with the other two robbery charges as well as the current robbery charge\u2014the Sprechman robbery\u2014for the motive evidence to be meaningful. This state of mind was necessary to show a motive for untruthfulness or undue prosecution pressure. This expectation of leniency had to be the minor\u2019s state of mind at the time he was in custody and told the Gardena police officers that the appellant was the other participant in the robbery and at the time he testified at trial. It must be emphasized that there is no requirement that the minor witness\u2019 motive to fabricate had a reasonable basis for its existence. (Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook, \u00a7 28.8.) At the time the minor identified appellant as the other robbery assailant on August 13, 1976, he probably believed that he would have three pending juvenile matters involving three separate alleged robberies, one of April 15, 1976, one of June 15, 1976, and now one of August 13, 1976. At the time of trial of appellant, when the minor testified for the prosecution, he knew that no charge had been filed on the June 15, 1976, occurrence<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that there was to be a dismissal of the April 15, 1976, charge and a disposition of the August 13, 1976 charge on December 28, 1976, the juvenile court disposition hearing date for the Sprechman incident. This hearing date was set for a time after the minor\u2019s testimony in the appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">It is not relevant to the state of mind of the minor, at the time of his arrest, that <em>his mother </em>had not told him of the original promise made by a Gardena police officer to her that things \u201cwould not go hard on William if he revealed the identity of his accomplice\u201d until November 29, 1976, more than three months after the date of the Sprechman robbery. What is relevant is the attitude or state of mind of the minor as to an expectation of leniency on all three robbery charges. The minor could believe that his identification of appellant as his partner in the robbeiy at the time he was in the juvenile detention immediately after his arrest would benefit him even if no one made a promise of leniency at that time or even if he did not know that such a promise had been made to his mother. The minor could have believed that if he failed to identify someone as his robbery partner after he was arrested on August 13, 1976, he would be facing a more severe punishment on all three robbery charges than on one or even two charges. These were matters that should have been presented to the trier of fact, the jury, to determine the state of mind of the minor and whether there was a motive to fabricate or a susceptibility of undue pressure. At the time of trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>minor knew that there was an agreement that one charge of a robbery occurrence of April 15, 1976, was to be dismissed, that there was to be no filing on another charge for a robbery occurrence of June 15, 1976, and a juvenile disposition on the August 13, 1976, robbery occurence. Again, it was a question of fact for the jury to consider the minor\u2019s motive to fabricate after permitting appellant, by his lawyer, to cross-examine the minor about his state of mind, his expectation of leniency, his fear that a prior \u201cplea bargain\u201d would not be kept if he testified differently. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.3d 876, 883.) It was error for the court to restrict the cross-examination as it prevented the appellant from effectively attacking the credibility of a key witness by showing a motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">The respondent seeks to minimize this error by pointing out that the appellant was permitted to cross-examine both the minor and his mother in detail about the fact that there was a pending juvenile disposition hearing for the August 13, 1976, occurrence after the trial. It is true that the jury knew that the minor\u2019s juvenile case arising out of the Sprechman robbery had not yet been disposed of, but the cross-examination concerning the minor\u2019s participation in three separate robberies was more than merely cumulative. The minor could have reasonably believed his punishment would have been greater for the three charges than for the one. Certainly the minor\u2019s mother, Mrs. O., had an expectation of leniency for her son if both he and she identified another assailant on August 13, 1976, and if both he and she testified for the prosecution at the trial. The appellant had the right to show that both the minor and his mother were possibly under greater prosecution pressure because of three recent robbery charges than only one. <em>{Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, supra, </em>415 U.S. 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The respondent\u2019s argument that to permit the evidence of the other charges to be received would be prejudicial and contrary to section 787 of the Evidence Code is without merit.  \u201cEvidence of . . . acts, offered to establish bias or improper motive, is <em>not </em>made <em>inadmissible </em>by Evid C \u00a7 787, since the evidence is relevant for a purpose <em>other than </em>as tending to prove the witness\u2019 character trait. If an act of conduct of a witness is <em>unequivocal </em>in pointing to his having a bias or improper motive, evidence of the act is admissible to prove the witness\u2019 bias or improper motive as an impeaching fact under Evid C \u00a7 780(f), although the evidence is also relevant as tending to prove a character trait of the witness, but is inadmissible for this latter purpose under Evid C \u00a7 787.\u201d (Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (1972) \u00a7 28.8, p. 460; italics in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>original.) The evidence of the additional juvenile charges arising out of other robberies could unequivocally and reasonably tend to prove a motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The trial court also erred in refusing to permit appellant to cross-examine the minor\u2019s mother about the other juvenile robbery charges. This witness had a strong belief and expectation, based upon her conversation with the Gardena police officer and with members of the prosecutor\u2019s office, that there would be leniency given to her son on all three charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court Erred In Failing To Grant Appellant\u2019s Motion For A Mistrial After A Rebuttal Witness Testified That Appellant Was \u201cOn Parole\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The respondent, in an effort to rebut the alibi testimony of Beverly Allen, appellant\u2019s sister, called Mrs. O. as a rebuttal witness expecting her to testify that the sister had stated her willingness to lie in court for appellant. In response to a general question as to what Beverly Allen had said she would testify about in court, Mrs. O. stated: \u201cWell, she stated that Michael was on parole and he couldn\u2019t stand another beef.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Evidence that a witness, including a testifying defendant in a criminal case, has been convicted of a felony may be admissible, under limited circumstances, when offered to attack the witness\u2019 credibility.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The respondent was not offering evidence of appellant\u2019s parole status in order to impeach him as the parole was the result of a prior juvenile adjudication which cannot be deemed a conviction of a crime for any purpose. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 203; <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981].)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The only question to be determined on appeal is whether the trial court cured the impropriety of the statement by ordering the volunteered answer stricken and immediately admonishing the jury to \u201cdisregard it completely, as if it were never said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">A juiy is presumed to have followed an admonition to disregard improper evidence particularly where there is an absence of bad faith. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 544, 554-555 [134 Cal.Rptr. 566]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuiston </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 410, 418-419 [70 Cal.Rptr. 531].) It is only in the exceptional case that \u201cthe improper subject matter is of such a character that its effect... cannot be removed by the court\u2019s admonitions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Seiterle </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 703, 710 [31 Cal.Rptr. 67, 381 P.2d 947].) In a wide variety of decisions there has been a finding of such exceptional circumstances in holding that the court\u2019s admonition to the jury was not sufficient to overcome the substantial danger of undue prejudice and of misleading the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">This court found reversible error when the defendant was called an \u201cex-convict\u201d in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ozuna </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 338, 342 [28 Cal.Rptr. 663], arid when a witness stated that defendant \u201cdid time\u201d in San Quentin in <em>People </em>v. <em>Figuieredo </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 498, 505-506 [279 P.2d 200].<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The finding of exceptional circumstances depends upon the facts in each case. \u201cAn improper reference to a prior conviction may be grounds for reversal in itself [citations] but is nonprejudicial \u2018in the light of a record which points convincingly to guilt. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rolon </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 690, 693 [58 Cal.Rptr. 596, 427 P.2d 196].)</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">An examination of the record reveals an extremely close case in which the jury had to make its fact determination based upon the credibility of the appellant and his witnesses and on the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses. In the light of these facts, it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to appellant would have been reached had the prejudicial information of appellant\u2019s parole status not been divulged to the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>\n<em>The Trial Court Did Not Err When It Instructed The Jury Per CAUIC 2.04</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>12</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em> Efforts By A Defendant To Fabricate Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that there is no evidence in the record which justifies the inclusion of CALJIC No. 2.04 in the jury instructions is incorrect. There were numerous evidentiary facts in the record which support the contention of respondent that appellant made positive attempts to fabricate evidence or to improperly influence witnesses\u2019 testimony and from said facts the juiy could reasonably draw an inference of consciousness of guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hannon </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 588, 597 [138 Cal.Rptr. 885, 564 P.2d 1203].)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">First, there is the testimony of Mrs. O. that on the night of the robbery, appellant had changed his clothes between 11 p.m., when she spoke with him at his apartment, and at the time of his arrest at 4:30 a.m. Police officers had arrested appellant when he was sleeping in his clothes and the early morning change of clothes was, therefore, inferentially done in an effort to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Second, there was evidence that appellant changed his hair style in an effort to manufacture evidence. Prosecution witnesses Back and Feliciano testified that appellant told them that he wore his hair curled during the robbery and proposed to comb it out later, hoping to avoid identification. Mrs. O. testified that when she went to appellant\u2019s apartment at about 11 p.m. he was combing his hair as he answered the door. In this connection, it should be noted that appellant grew a beard between the time of his arrest and the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">A third circumstance justifying the instruction was appellant\u2019s statement to witness Feliciano that he hoped to convince his juvenile accomplice to say that the appellant had no part in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">While appellant has denied that he made any such statements, there was evidence presented to the jury which justified the court\u2019s giving CALJIC No. 2.04 instruction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>\n<em>The Trial Court Did Not Err When It Refused To Instruct The Jury That The Issuance Of The Arrest Warrant May Not Be Considered As Evidence Of Guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">At the trial, one of the arresting officers testified that he \u201cdrew up the papers for an arrest warrant . . . then went to the judge\u2019s house,\u201d awakened him at approximately 4 a.m., and obtained a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest. After the evidentiary part of the trial and after the jury was instructed and while the jury was in the courtroom having certain requested, testimony read back, one of the jurors, who was not the foreman, asked \u201c. . . when a judge signs a warrant for arrest or search warrant, what kind of a discussion [does] he . . . [have] . . . with a representative of the D.A. or the police officer or if he just signs it or it\u2019s presented to him or . .. [does] he asks [jzc] questions?\u201d The court refused to answer that question for the juror. The appellant, citing Penal Code, section 1138,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> contends that the trial court committed error in the manner in which it dealt with the juror\u2019s question. He asserts that the question \u201cclearly implied\u201d that the jury suspected that appellant had been found guilty by another judge in issuing the arrest warrant and that the requested instruction was the type of general principle of law that the court would have been required to give upon request as part of the body of instructions. The appellant wanted the court to instruct the juiy that the issuance of an arrest warrant could not be considered as evidence of his guilt. The court refused this request and informed the juror that he could not answer the question and told the jurors that their decisions must be \u201cbased upon the evidence and the testimony before you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The jury had already been instructed under CALJIC No. 1.00 as follows: \u201c.. . You must not be biased against a defendant because he has been arrested for this offense, or because a charge has been filed against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>him, or because he has been brought to trial. None of these facts is evidence of his guilt and you must not infer or speculate from any or all of them that he is more likely to be guilty than innocent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We find this to be a sufficient answer to the juror\u2019s question and no further instructions were necessary. Certainly it was not necessary to give the jury an additional instruction about the manner in which arrest warrants are issued or that an arrest warrant could not be considered as evidence of guilt. While it may have been preferable for the court to have reread CALJIC No. 1.00 in response to the question, in refusing to answer the juror\u2019s question and instructing the jury to decide the case on the evidence before them, the trial court provided the jury with adequate guidance in this case. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 273 [120 Cal.Rptr. 647]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kageler </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 738, 746-747 [108 Cal.Rptr. 235].)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Error Was Prejudicial Requiring Reversal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The error of a trial court in refusing to permit cross-examination of the minor and of his mother, Mrs. O., as to the other two robbery charges in order to show a motive for fabrication or untruthful testimony and the refusal of the trial court to grant a mistrial after Mrs. O., on prosecution\u2019s rebuttal, had accidentally referred to the fact that the appellant was on parole were prejudicial and require a reversal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) As already mentioned this was a close case in which the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and the credibility of the appellant and his witnesses were the key factors. The appellant was not arrested at the scene of the crime, no stolen goods were found in his possession, the gun was not found and the identification evidence by the victim and her husband was not convincing. The case essentially became a contest between the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and the credibility of the appellant and his witnesses. In refusing to allow appellant to inquire into a motive for fabrication as to both minor O. and his mother, the trial court prevented the trier of fact, the jurors, from considering evidence that might have substantially alfected the credibility of these two prosecution witnesses. In permitting the case to go to the jury after the parole status of the appellant had been accidentally disclosed to the jury, the trial court permitted the jury to hear improper prejudicial information that could have had a substantial effect upon the credibility of the appellant\u2019s case. The conviction resulted from a trial in which the essential rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>appellant were disregarded or denied. Had the appellant been able to present evidence as to the motive of fabrication and the jury not heard the damaging evidence about appellant\u2019s parole status, it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appellant would have been reached. Under such circumstances a reversal is mandated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Allport, Acting P.

The judgment states that the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment in the California Institution for Men- at Chino. The trial court does not have the jurisdiction to specify detention in a particular penal institution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 854, 858 [135 Cal.Rptr. 644].) While this reviewing court has the power to correct this error, which appears to be a clerical error because the oral pronouncement of the sentence simply directed that the appellant be committed to the state prison system for the term prescribed by law, the issue is moot, as we reverse the judgment of conviction. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b812-12\">We find the failure to permit cross-examination of the minor and his mother, Mrs. O., was reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Appellant bases this contention on an alleged violation of article I, section 15, of the California Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, on the grounds that appellant was denied effective cross-examination and therefore his constitutional right of confrontation, citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 308 [39 L.Ed.2d 347, 94 S.Ct: 1105], where the trial judge was held to have improperly restricted cross-examination of a prosecution witness on his probationary status as a juvenile delinquent. The. United States Supreme Court said that the defendant should have been allowed to show the witness\u2019 susceptibility to undue pressure and added: \u201cWe have recognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u201d (415 U.S. at pp. 316-317.[39 L.Ed.2d at pp. 353-354]; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 129 [19 L.Ed.2d 956, 88 S.Ct. 748].) It is necessary to recognize that a denial of this right of cross-examination is not only treated by the courts and legal scholars as a violation of the constitutional right of confrontation but also as a denial of the right, under the laws of evidence, to show the existence of bias, interest or motive to fabricate to attack the credibility of a witness either by cross-examination or by extrinsic proof. <em>(People </em>v.. <em>James </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 876, 886-887 [128 Cal.Rptr. 733].) Under either approach, the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow appellant to cross-examine both the minor and his mother on the other robbery offenses in order to show a motive to fabricate or to show the susceptibility of those witnesses to undue prosecution pressure was prejudicial error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b814-5\">This charge could have been the subject of a juvenile petition for adjudication under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">(Evid.

The determination of whether facts existed in the record of appellant\u2019s attempt to fabricate evidence from which a jury can infer a consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant is a question of law.
