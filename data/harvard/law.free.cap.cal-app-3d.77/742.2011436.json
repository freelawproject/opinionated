The factual setting out of which this and other related issues arise is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\n<em>The Eminent Domain Proceeding:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The district filed an action in eminent domain to acquire a perpetual easement for an underground storm channel and a temporary construction easement along and adjacent to the perpetual easement. The larger parcel consisted of 9.35 acres under a long-term lease to Sunny Crest Dairy, Inc. (hereafter Sunny Crest). The property is located in the City of Westminster and fronts on the southerly side of Westminster Avenue. The land in and over which the perpetual easement was sought consisted of a 50-foot wide strip (designated Parcel 104) comprising 1.41 acres along and adjacent to the east and south boundary lines of the larger parcel. The land over which the temporary construction easement was sought consisted of a 30-foot wide strip (designated Parcel 104.1) comprising .786 acre lying along and adjacent to the interior boundary lines of Parcel 104. The construction easement was for the period January 1974 to May 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The district filed the action on October 29, 1973, and obtained an order of possession a day later.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\n<em>Zoning:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The northerly half of the larger parcel was zoned commercial and the southerly half single family residential. However, at the time the eminent, domain proceeding was filed, the property was subject to a nonconforming use for a cash-and-carry dairy business conducted on the land by Sunny Crest.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In December 1973, after the district commenced construction of the storm channel, Sunny Crest ceased its cash-and-carry dairy business and confined its activities to a dock dairy business on .6 acre at the northwest corner of the property. A cash-and-carry dairy business is one in which milk is produced, processed and sold on the site; whereas a dock dairy operation is one where milk is processed and sold at the site. According to Sunny Crest, it discontinued the cash-and-carry dairy operation because the district\u2019s construction activities made it economically infeasible to continue operating that business on the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">In July 1975, Sunny Crest obtained a conditional use permit to develop the remainder (8.75 acres) in conjunction with an adjoining 1.39-acre parcel to the east for a mobile home park.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\n<em>Valuation Testimony:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Although trial did not commence until October 20, 1975, the date of value was stipulated to be January 20, 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Experts on both sides agreed the highest and best use of the larger parcel in the <em>after </em>condition was for the development of the remainder, along with the adjoining 1.39-acre parcel, for a mobile home park and retention of the dock dairy business on the .6 acre at the northwest corner of the property. The controversy centered on the highest and best use of the property in the before condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">As of the date of value, the nonconforming cash-and-carry dairy use had been lost through cessation of that use for more than one year. Sunny Crest\u2019s position nevertheless was that the highest and best use of the land in the before condition was the nonconforming use. Sunny Crest\u2019s experts arrived at their opinion of the highest and best use in the before condition on the following theory: Institution of the condemnation action and the district\u2019s possession of the strip of land sought to be condemned necessitated removal of a substantial number of cows maintained on the premises; herd reduction coupled with the disruption of existing drainage facilities resulting from the district\u2019s construction activities rendered it infeasible to continue the cash-and-carry dairy operation; thus the loss of the nonconforming use was the direct result of the district\u2019s condemnation activities, and accordingly, any diminution in market value resulting from that loss must be disregarded in ascertaining just compensation and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Sunny Crest\u2019s experts were also permitted to testify that the taking caused \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d for the years 1974 to 1975. Sunny Crest adduced evidence showing that upon cessation of the cash- and-carry dairy business, it immediately investigated other feasible uses for the remainder, including its potential development as a mobile home park; in order to satisfy a zoning requirement of a minimum 10-acre site for a mobile home park, Sunny Crest acquired an adjoining 1.39-acre parcel and engaged in lease negotiations with a mobile home park developer; in July 1975, Sunny Crest obtained a conditional use permit for a mobile home park; following further negotiations, a lease with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>developer was executed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based upon the foregoing evidence, Sunny Crest\u2019s experts testified that Sunny Crest suffered \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d through loss of the fair rental value of that part of the remainder not burdened by the permanent and temporary easements for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In addition, Sunny Crest was permitted to introduce evidence of \u201cout-of-pocket expenses\u201d it had incurred in bringing about the mobile home park development. The evidence was admitted on the theory the expenses were incurred in mitigation of damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The district\u2019s position was that highest and best use must be determined as of the date of value. Its expert, Mr. Joseph A. Mueller, was of the opinion the highest and best use of the remainder in the before and after conditions was for a mobile home park development.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\n<em>The A wards:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The jury verdict was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Just compensation for part taken</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">Permanent easement $33,611</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANW\">Temporary easement 4,900</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">Total $38,511 $38,511</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARc8\">Permanent severance damage 12,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">Temporary severance damage 33,557</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiA\">Damages in mitigation 22,988</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ape\">Total award $107,056</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">On a motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1249.3, the court awarded the condemnee attorneys\u2019 fees calculated on a percentage of the total verdict as well as expert witness\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-18\">The district contends the court erred in the following respects: (1) In permitting Sunny Crest to pursue and to recover compensation on its theory of highest and best use of the property in the before condition; (2) in overruling district\u2019s objections to evidence of the loss of fair rental value of the property for the years 1974 to 1975; (3) in denying district\u2019s motion to strike evidence of claimed damage in mitigation; and (4) in allowing interest on the award for the period prior to January 1, 1976, in addition to the \u201cTemporary severance damage.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-19\">In the ensuing discussion, we have concluded that under the unique facts of the instant case, the court properly permitted Sunny Crest to adduce valuation evidence based on its theory of the before condition\u2019s highest and best use. We have further concluded, however, that the court erred in permitting Sunny Crest to recover the fair rental value of the property for the two-year period and the claimed damages in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Highest And Best Use</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The district mounts the following two-pronged attack on Sunny Crest\u2019s theory of highest and best use of the property in the before condition: (a) Highest and best use must as a matter of law be determined as of the date of value, and (b) the evidence fails to support the theory espoused by Sunny Crest.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">(a) <em>District\u2019s Standing to Challenge the Legality of Sunny Crest\u2019s Theory:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Before reaching the merits of the district\u2019s contentions, we deal with Sunny Crest\u2019s threshold response that the district failed to preserve for appellate review the legal propriety of Sunny Crest\u2019s highest and best use theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The record reveals the following: Mr. Williams was Sunny Crest\u2019s first expert. Although the district objected to some of Mr. Williams\u2019 testimony concerning the profitability of the cash-and-carry dairy business, no objections were interposed to his opinion that the highest and best use in the before condition was the nonconforming cash-and-carry dairy use or to his value opinions based upon that use. However, after Mr. Williams concluded his testimony and Sunny Crest\u2019s next expert, Mr. McCune, was sworn and testified as to his qualifications, the district moved \u201cto exclude the valuation testimony of Mr. Williams in its entirety\u201d on the ground his opinions were based on a nonconforming use which was no longer extant as of the date of value. Following extended argument and discussion, the court expressed the view that under the pertinent case law, Sunny Crest was entitled to proceed on its theory of highest and best use.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">If the foregoing had been the only record made by the district, there might be merit in Sunny Crest\u2019s contention that the district failed to make an adequate record to challenge the validity of Sunny Crest\u2019s theory on appeal. Ordinarily a motion to strike a valuation witness\u2019 testimony must be directed with precision to the particular testimony sought to be stricken, especially where only part of it is objectionable. <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>19 Cal.2d 713, 742 [123 P.2d 505]; <em>San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 889, 901 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>[63 Cal.Rptr. 640]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Loop, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 786, 800 [274 P.2d 885].) In the case at bench, much of Mr. Williams\u2019 testimony and value opinions was not subject to the district\u2019s objection that he used the wrong date of value. Consequently, the district\u2019s motion to strike \u201cthe valuation testimony of Mr. Williams in its entirety\u201d standing alone, may have lacked the specificity required to preserve for appellate review the issue of the validity of Sunny Crest\u2019s theory of highest and best use. (See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>19 Cal.2d 713, 742.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">However, the record shows that contemporaneously with the motion to strike Mr. Williams\u2019 testimony, the district made a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any valuation opinion by Sunny Crest\u2019s next expert, Mr. McCune, based upon a highest and best use for a cash-and-cariy daily operation. Following denial of the motion to strike Mr. Williams\u2019 testimony, the motion <em>in limine </em>was likewise denied on the ground Sunny Crest was legally entitled to pursue its theory. Despite the generality of the motion to strike, the record shows that the two motions fairly apprised the court and opposing party of the particular evidence sought to be stricken and to be excluded and that the issue which district seeks to raise on this appeal was fully argued and was squarely ruled upon by the trial court. Accordingly, the district is entitled to have the issue of the validity of Sunny Crest\u2019s theory of highest and best use reviewed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">(b) <em>Validity of Sunny Crest\u2019s Theory of Highest and Best Use:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The district\u2019s attack upon Sunny Crest\u2019s theory of highest and best use is premised on the proposition that there can be only one date of value in the ascertainment of fair market value and that is the date prescribed by the Legislature in Code of Civil Procedure section 1249.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the instant case, the parties stipulated the date of value was January '20, 1975. Inasmuch as the nonconforming use had expired by that date, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>contends Sunny Crest was precluded as a matter of law from pursuing its theory of the before condition\u2019s highest and best use. The contention must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">It is a cardinal principle of the law of eminent domain that a definite date be fixed as of which property is to be valued for the purpose of ascertaining just compensation. (4 Nichols, The Law of Eminent Domain (3d ed. rev. 1976) \u00a7 12.23, p. 12-98; 1 Orgel, Valuation Under Eminent Domain (2d ed. 1953) \u00a7 21, p. 96.) In this state, unless a different date is required to satisfy the constitutional requirement of just compensation, the valuation date must be fixed in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1249. <em>(Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, 44 [104 Cal.Rptr. 1, 500 P.2d 1345]; <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Water Resources </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 463, 467-468 [109 Cal.Rptr. 39].) It is also the law that where parties stipulate to a valuation date which is at variance with that prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1249, they are bound by the stipulation. <em>(State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Water Resources </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 463, 468.)  It does not follow, however, that there is a legally unacceptable inconsistency between the stipulated date of value and the court\u2019s ruling permitting Sunny Crest to prove market value on the basis that the highest and best use in the before condition was the nonconforming use, even though such use had ceased as of the date of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Sunny Crest adduced evidence that the district\u2019s possession of the easements and commencement of construction of the public improvement brought about the cessation and loss of the nonconforming use, which in turn resulted in a substantial diminution in market value of the property. In light of the evidence before it, the court properly permitted Sunny Crest\u2019s experts to base their value opinions on the premise that the nonconforming use was the highest and best use in the before condition. The court\u2019s ruling was supported by the principle enunciated in <em>Buena Park School Dist. </em>v. <em>Metrim Corp., </em>176 Cal.App.2d 255, 258-259 [1 Cal.Rptr. 250], and approved in <em>Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, 50-51, that the constitutional mandate of just compensation requires property to be valued without regard to value-depressing acts of the condemner.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">In <em>Buena Park School Dist. </em>v. <em>Metrim Corp., supra, </em>176 Cal.App.2d 255, this court stated: \u201cThis classic definition of market value contemplates, of course, the price which the property would have brought at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>time of valuation had it then been placed upon the market and had it then been available for sale. It is obvious that in determining that value the trier of fact must disregard the fact that at that time because of the filing of condemnation proceedings the property was not actually salable. It is a matter of common knowledge that a purchaser would not buy property in the process of being condemned except at a figure much below its actual value. It follows, therefore, that in arriving at the fair market value it is necessary that the jury should disregard not only the fact of the filing of the case but should also disregard the effect of steps taken by the condemning authority toward that acquisition. To hold otherwise would permit a public body to depress the market value of the property for the purpose of acquiring it at less than market value.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 258-259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In <em>Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, the Supreme Court expressly approved the principle embraced in the quoted statement from <em>Metrim (id., </em>at p. 51) and cited the case as an implicit approval of the rule adopted in <em>Klopping </em>permitting a property owner to recover damages for the value-depressing <em>precondemnation </em>acts which fall short of a de facto taking caused by physical invasion of the property or the imposition of unreasonable legal restraints on use of the land <em>(id., </em>at p. 46). The court held that \u201cwhen the condemner acts unreasonably in issuing precondemnation statements, either by excessively delaying eminent domain action or by other oppressive conduct, our constitutional concern over property rights requires that the owner be compensated.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 51-52.)</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The district urges that this case should not be governed by the principle enunciated in <em>Metrim </em>and approved in <em>Klopping </em>because there was no evidence the district engaged in unreasonable or oppressive conduct. The contention lacks merit. <em>Klopping </em>made unreasonable or oppressive conduct a condition to the recovery of damage caused by precondemnation activity because otherwise public agencies would be deterred from affording adequate public participation in project planning <em>(Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, 51), would be severely hampered in undertaking long-range planning (see <em>Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura, </em>10 Cal.3d 110, 119 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111]; <em>Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, 45; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 529, 535-536 [123 Cal.Rptr. 745]), and would be encouraged to make premature purchases of property which may turn out to be unneeded <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>50 Cal.App.3d 529, 536). But those considerations do not come into play where the public authority has actually embarked on the acquisition of property by eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Rather, the applicable competing policies which must be weighed are those which have been stated as follows: \u201c ' \u201c[OJn the one hand the policy underlying the eminent domain provision in the Constitution is to distribute throughout the community the loss inflicted upon the individual by the making of the public improvements. ... On the other hand, fears have been expressed that compensation allowed too liberally will seriously impede, if not stop, beneficial public improvements because of the greatly increased cost.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 250, 263 [42 Cal.Rptr. 89, 398 P.2d 129], quoting from <em>Bacich </em>v. <em>Board of Control </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 343, 350 [144 P.2d 818].)\u201d <em>(Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera, </em>20 Cal.3d 285, 296 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43].) On the basis of those policy considerations, it has been held that \u201c \u2018[m]erely rendering private property less desirable for certain purposes, or even causing personal annoyance or discomfort in its use, will not constitute the damage contemplated by the constitution; . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Heimann </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>30 Cal.2d 746, 756 [185 P.2d 597], quoting <em>Eachus </em>v. <em>Los Angeles etc. Ry. Co., </em>103 Cal. 614, 617 [37 P. 750].) But where there has been a substantial impairment of use which diminishes the market value of the property, compensation is constitutionally compelled. <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Nutter, </em>13 Cal.App.3d 752, 769 [92 Cal.Rptr. 347]; see <em>Breidert </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>61 Cal.2d 659, 664-667 [39 Cal.Rptr. 903, 394 P.2d 719].)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In the instant case, according to the evidence adduced by Sunny Crest, use of its property was impaired to the extent that it was economically infeasible to use it for cash-and-carry dairy purposes. Such impairment is manifestly of a substantial nature. Accordingly, in order to effectuate the principle of just compensation enunciated in <em>Metrim </em>and approved in <em>Klopping, </em>the trial court properly permitted Sunny Crest\u2019s experts to disregard that impairment in use in arriving at their opinion of fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The district urges that <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Water Resources </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 463, compels a result contrary to that which we have reached. We disagree. Despite superficial factual similarities to the case at bench, <em>Clark </em>did not involve the issue here presented. There, on an appeal from a judgment in a state condemnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>action, the property owners complained they were erroneously restricted to the stipulated date of value, a date some two years after the eminent domain action had been filed, in proving the highest and best use of the property in the before condition and were precluded from showing the condition of the property when the summons was issued. They contended that the court erred in rejecting their offer of proof that use of the land for a contemplated subdivision which was permissible on the date the eminent domain action was filed was no longer feasible on the date of value because of a restrictive interpretation of a county subdivision ordinance. The reviewing court held that the highest and best use in the before and after conditions should be determined as of the stipulated date of value and rejected the implication in the owners\u2019 contention \u201cthat experts, in stating opinions as to fair market value in the \u2018before\u2019 condition, should be permitted to ignore conditions which a willing buyer would consider on the stipulated date of value and substitute therefor fictitious conditions existing nearly two years beforehand, even though a willing buyer would not consider such earlier conditions as pertinent to his purchase.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 469.) <em>Clark </em>is materially distinguishable in two important respects: First, in <em>Clark, </em>unlike the instant case, use impairment which resulted in the claimed diminution in market value, assuming it to have been compensable, was not caused by the condemner (the state) but by the county. Second, in <em>Clark, </em>the owners were seeking to avail themselves of two dates of value whereas in the instant case all of the experts adhered to the stipulated date in arriving at their value opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">(c) <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence to Support Sunny Crest\u2019s Theory of Highest and Best Use:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The district attacks the sufficiency of the evidence to support Sunny Crest\u2019s theory of highest and best use on two grounds: (1) The nonconforming use was not lost because of any act of the district, but was the result of Sunny Crest\u2019s business decision, and (2) the court erroneously admitted evidence of the profitability of the cash-and-carry dairy operation. Neither ground is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Whether the district caused the loss of the nonconfirming use or, as the district puts it, the loss was the result of \u201cthe business decision of Sunny Crest\u201d was a factual issue to be resolved by the fact finder. By awarding permanent severance damages, the jury impliedly found in favor of Sunny Crest\u2019s theory. Thus, the district\u2019s attack is simply one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>going to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s implied finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">A reviewing court must start with the presumption that the record contains evidence to support every finding of fact; the burden is on the party attacking a finding of fact for lack of evidentiary support to demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support the challenged finding; the appellant must set forth in his brief all the material evidence bearing on the issue and not merely the evidence favorable to him, and failure to do so may be deemed a waiver of the claimed error. <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>3 Cal.3d 875, 881 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362]; <em>Glendale Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Marina View Heights Dev. Co., </em>66 Cal.App.3d 101, 152 [135 Cal.Rptr. 802].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The district, however, simply directs our attention to testimony from Sunny Crest\u2019s witnesses that it would have been physically possible to continue the cash-and-carry daily use of the property by reducing the size of the herd. On the basis of that testimony, district asserts that Sunny Crest had a choice of either continuing the nonconforming use on a limited scope<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or ceasing that use entirely. This, however, was not all of the evidence bearing on the issue. There was substantial testimony that continued operation with a reduced herd was economically infeasible. In addition, there was testimony that the district\u2019s construction activities so disrupted drainage from the property to render it physically impossible to maintain a sufficient herd to continue operation. Sunny Crest was not required to pursue an economically ruinous course of action simply because it may have been physically possible to do so. (See <em>Benenson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(Ct.Cl. 1977) 548 F.2d 939, 949.) Needless to say, it was for the fact finder to resolve conflicts in the evidence and to judge the credibility of the witnesses. <em>(San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Sweet, supra, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 889, 906-907.) There was evidence of sufficient substantiality to support the jury\u2019s implied finding that the district\u2019s acts caused Sunny Crest to lose the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The district\u2019s second attack on Sunny Crest\u2019s theory of highest and best use is that the trial court committed prejudicial error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>admitting evidence to show that the cash-and-carry dairy operation was profitable. This contention must likewise fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">While loss of profits from a business is not compensable as an element of damage in eminent domain <em>(Ventura County Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Security First Nat. Bank, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 996, 1002 [93 Cal.Rptr. 653]), evidence of economic feasibility of a claimed highest and best use of the property bears upon market value and is, therefore, admissible (see <em>San Bernardino County Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Sweet, supra, </em>255 Cal.App.2d 889, 899). \u201c[T]he highest and most profitable use for which the property is adaptable and needed or likely to be needed in the reasonably near future is to be considered, not as the measure of value, but to the extent that the prospect of such use affects the market value of the land; . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore Railroad, 32 </em>Cal.2d 406, 425-426 [196 P.2d 570, 6 A.L.R.2d 1179]; accord <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept.

On the theory that the loss of income was occasioned by the condemnation proceedings and the district\u2019s construction activities and was, therefore, compensable as \u201ctemporary severance damages,\u201d Sunny Crest sought to introduce through Mr. Williams evidence of the fair rental value of the property for the two-year period. The district objected to such evidence for the period beyond May 1, 1975, on the ground that by that date the district had completed its work and all rights in the strips of land sought to be taken, except for the district\u2019s rights in the perpetual easement, had reverted to the owner. The judge treated the objection as a motion to strike Mr. Williams\u2019 testimony insofar as it related to loss of fair rental value for any period beyond May 1, 1975, but, instead of ruling on the motion, took it under submission and permitted Mr. Williams to give his opinion of the fair rental value for the entire two-year period. The district interposed a like objection to Mr. McCune\u2019s testimony on the same subject which resulted in the same ruling. Mr. Williams based his opinion of the fair rental value of the property on a cash-and-carry dairy use; Mr. McCune based his opinion on a mobile home park use.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The district\u2019s expert testified that the remainder could have been developed for a mobile home park as soon as the cash-and-carry dairy operation was terminated \u201cif everything had been ready to go.\u201d In his opinion, Sunny Crest suffered no loss of use of the remainder and was not entitled to \u201ctemporary severance damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The district advances a number of contentions respecting the award of \u201ctemporary severance damages.\u201d It urges the court erred in denying its motion to strike evidence of fair rental value for the period beyond May 1, 1975; the court should not have admitted any evidence of fair rental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>value without, making a prior determination that there had been a substantial impairment of use of the remainder;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the court compounded its error by permitting the award of \u201ctemporary severance damages\u201d to stand and in addition, by allowing interest on the entire award for the period prior to January 1, 1976. The district argues that there was a total lack of evidence of any substantial impairment of use of the remainder during any period and that the judgment should be modified by striking the award of \u201ctemporary severance damages\u201d or, in the alternative, by disallowing interest on the judgment prior to January 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Although not articulated with clarity, the thrust of the district\u2019s attack upon the \u201ctemporary severance damages\u201d award is that it is unsupported by the evidence and is contrary to the law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district is entitled to raise that issue despite the limited scope of its trial objection to the admissibility of the evidence of fair rental value.  Failure to object to evidence or to move for a nonsuit or directed verdict does not preclude an appellant from attacking a finding on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to support it. <em>(First National Bank of Monrovia </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Company, </em>162 Cal. 61, 72-73 [121 P. 321]; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 414, 421 [97 Cal.Rptr. 730, 53 A.L.R.3d 719].) Similarly, a contention that the uncontradicted facts establish as a matter of law that the decision below was wrong may be made for the first time on appeal. <em>(Jakobsen </em>v. <em>Peratis, </em>213 Cal. 671, 672 [3 P.2d 305].) Here, that contention was also made in the court below on the district\u2019s motion for a new trial. One of the grounds for the motion was that the verdict awarding \u201ctemporary severance damages\u201d was contrary to law in that there was no evidence of substantial interference with Sunny Crest\u2019s use of its property outside the easement area. We conclude that the propriety of the \u201ctemporary severance damages\u201d award in its entirety is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Sunny Crest should not have been permitted to recover the fair rental value of the land for the two-year period or any part thereof as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>damages for a temporary taking of the remainder. There was no evidence of a physical taking of the remainder or its impairment for any permissible use other than the cash-and-carry dairy operation. While there was some testimony by the mobile home park developer that he could not have commenced construction while the district was doing its work, there was no evidence that Sunny Crest or the developer was then ready to commence construction of the mobile home park. Indeed, the uncontroverted evidence was that because Sunny Crest had to acquire the additional 1.39-acre parcel, to secure a conditional use permit, and to negotiate the lease, the developer was not ready to commence construction until long after the district completed its work. In short, there was no evidence that anything the district did impaired the use of the remainder for a mobile home park development or any other permissible purpose other than the nonconforming use.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, there was no factual basis for the recovery of damages on the theory of a temporary taking of the remainder. (See <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>55 Cal.App.3d 749, 754-755 [127 Cal.Rptr. 666].)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In <em>Klopping </em>v. <em>City of Whittier, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 39, 53, the court held that an appropriate measure of just compensation for diminution in market value of property resulting from the loss of rental income caused by unreasonable or oppressive <em>precondemnation </em>acts falling short of a de facto taking was the fair rental value of the property. Here, to the extent that market value of the property was diminished by the impairment of use of the remainder for a cash-and-carry dairy business and its consequent effect upon the income-producing capability of the.property, Sunny Crest was permitted to seek and recover market value and severance damages on the basis that the nonconforming use continued to the date of value. To allow an additional recovery of the fair rental value of the property for the period in question would amount to a double recovery of compensation for diminution in market value caused by the same use impairment. This the law will not permit. <em>(See Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, 62 </em>Cal.2d 250, 268 [42 Cal.Rptr. 89, 398 P.2d 129].) As we have explained, loss of income, as such, is not constitution\u00e1lly compensable in eminent domain as an item of enhanced damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>The cases cited by Sunny Crest <em>(Kimball Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>338 U.S. 1 [93 L.Ed. 1765, 69 S.Ct. 1434]; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>323 U.S. 373 [89 L.Ed. 311, 65 S.Ct. 357]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>37.15 Acres of Land, etc. </em>(S.D.Cal. 1948) 77 F.Supp. 798; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Certain Parcels of Land </em>(S.D.Cal. 1945) 63 F.Supp. 175) simply involve application of the valuation principle that just compensation for a temporary taking is the fair rental value of the property. Here there was no temporary taking of the remainder; there was only a use impairment for which recovery was permitted under the <em>Metrim-Klopping </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Sunny Crest\u2019s attempt to recover fair rental value for the two years was in reality an attempt to recover a business loss.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See generally <em>City of Kings Mountain </em>v. <em>Cline, </em>19 N.C.App. 9 [198 S.E.2d 64, 66].) This it may not do.  Although just compensation requires payment of the fair market value of the property taken and severance damage to the remainder <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 63, 69 [94 Cal.Rptr. 839]), it does not require compensation for losses sustained by an owner such as lost business opportunities, expectations, or inconveniences <em>(Oakland </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Lumber etc. Co., </em>171 Cal. 392, 398 [153 P. 705]; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Allen\u2019s Grocery Co., </em>265 Cal.App.2d 274, 280-281 [71 Cal.Rptr. 78]; see <em>Ventura County Flood Control Dist. </em>v. <em>Security First Nat. Bank, supra, </em>15 Cal.App.3d 996, 1002-1003). In its most recent pronouncement on the subject, our high court in <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Abrams, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 813, posed and answered the question: \u201cWhen and to what extent do the state and federal Constitutions require that the \u2018just compensation\u2019 to be paid upon the taking or damaging of private property for public use include payment over and above the fair market value of the property taken on account of business losses sustained by the condemnee as a result of the taking?\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 816; fn. omitted.) In answering the question posed, the court declared: \u201cSixty years ago we answered this question in decisive fashion, and thereby stated the rule which presently applies in this state and, generally speaking, in all other jurisdictions of this nation. \u2018[T]he real contention of appellant . . . [is] that business is property, and when the taking by the state or its agencies interferes with, impairs, damages, or destroys a business, compensation may be recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ered therefor. We are not to be understood as saying that this should not be the law when we do say that it is not our law. It is quite within the power of the Legislature to declare that a damage to that form of property known as business or the goodwill of a business shall be compensated for, but unless the constitution or the legislature has so declared, it is the universal rule of construction that an injury or an inconvenience to a business is <em>damnum absque injuria, </em>and does not form an element of the compensating damages to be awarded.\u2019 <em>(Oakland </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Lumber etc. Co. </em>(1915) 171 Cal. 392, 398 [153 P. 705].)\u201d <em>(Community Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Abrams, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 813, 816-817, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We conclude that the jury verdict of $33,557 for \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d is unsupported by the evidence and is contrary to law. That amount should, therefore, be deducted from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Mitigation Of Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The district\u2019s next contention is that the court erred in permitting Sunny Crest to introduce evidence of \u201cout-of-pocket expenses\u201d incurred by it in bringing about a mobile home park development on the property. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Through Mr. McCune, Sunny Crest introduced evidence of so-called \u201cout-of-pocket expenses\u201d incurred to enable Sunny Crest to bring about the mobile home park lease. The expenses totaling $27,696.50 consisted of title fees, attorneys\u2019 fees, escrow fees and brokers\u2019 commissions in negotiating and consummating the lease with the mobile home park developer. The district\u2019s objection that such expenses were non compensable was treated as a submitted motion to strike and following arguments, the motion was denied. Evidence of the expenses was offered and received on the theory that they were reasonably incurred in mitigation of damages either because they were made to hasten the mobile home park development and thereby minimized \u201ctemporary severance damages\u201d or because they minimized permanent severance damages in that absent the expenditures the highest and best use in the after condition might have been different and resulted in a lower after condition market value. The evidence was inadmissible under either theory. The trial court erred in overruling the district\u2019s objection and in denying the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The principle of mitigation of damages does apply to condemnation proceedings and an owner whose property is being taken or damaged by a public entity is entitled to be compensated for expenses reasonably and in good faith incurred to minimize his compensable loss because to the extent that loss is minimized, the amount of the public entity\u2019s liability is reduced. <em>(Albers </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>62 Cal.2d 250, 272.) <em>Albers </em>involved expenses incurred by an owner in a good faith attempt to minimize physical injury to his property, a loss for which he was entitled to be compensated. <em>(Id.) </em>In the previous section of this opinion, however, .we pointed out that Sunny Crest\u2019s attempt to recover the fair rental value of the property during the two-year period as \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d constituted an attempt to recover a noncompensable business loss. Expenses' incurred to mitigate a noncompensable business loss are manifestly noncompensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Nor were the expenses recoverable on the theory that absent the expenditures the highest and best use in the after condition might have been different and that the expenses, therefore, mitigated permanent severance damages. There was no evidence that the claimed expenses in any way altered the highest and best use of the land. Indeed, in conformity with the court\u2019s ruling at the outset of the trial that it would permit the appraisers to consider the reasonable probability of the acquisition of the adjoining 1.39 acres in arriving at their opinion of highest and best use, the appraisers on both sides agreed that the highest and best use of the remainder in the after condition was for a mobile home park. A piece of property can have only one fair market value for its highest and best use. Although the cost of developing a property to put it to its highest and best use may properly be a factor an appraiser may consider in arriving at his opinion of fair market value, we are aware of no authority, and none has been cited, permitting recovery of such costs on the theory espoused by Sunny Crest. Moreover, the expenses claimed by Sunny Crest were not in the nature of \u201cdevelopment\u201d costs; they were expenses incurred in negotiating the mobile home park lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Sunny Crest\u2019s attempt to justify allowance of the expenses on the ground they would have been recoverable under the Relocation Assistance Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7260 et seq.) is without merit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>that the expenses incurred come within the scope of that act, benefits recoverable under it may not be asserted or proved in an eminent domain trial. <em>(City of Mountain View </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 72, 84 [126 Cal.Rptr. 358].) One asserting the benefits of that act must file a claim under the procedure therein provided. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 7266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Because of the error in admitting evidence of the claimed expenses in mitigation, the jury made an award for the following: \u201cThe reasonable cost, if any, of defendants attempt to mitigate damages is $22,988.\u201d That sum must, therefore, be deducted from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The district\u2019s sole contention respecting interest is that if the \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d award is upheld, interest should not be awarded on the judgment for the period prior to January 1, 1976. Since we have decided that the \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d award should be stricken, the interest issue is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">We order a limited reversal of the judgment with directions to the trial court to enter a new judgment by subtracting from the total award the sum of $33,557 awarded for \u201ctemporary severance damage\u201d and the sum of $22,988 awarded for mitigation of damages. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees is reversed for the limited purpose of reducing the amount of that award to the appropriate percentage of the amount of the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Sunny Crest shall recover its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Gardner, P.

And we got nothing and we are even out the taxes and our business was stopped and our profits were stopped.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Sunny Crest relies on Government Code section 7262 which provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">\u201c(a) As a part of the cost of acquisition of real property for a public use, a public entity shall compensate a displaced person for his:</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201c(1) Actual and reasonable expense in moving himself, family, business, or farm operation, including moving personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"AGa\">\u201c(2) Actual direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of moving or discontinuing a business or farm operation, but not to exceed an amount equal to the reasonable expenses that would have been required to relocate such property, as determined by the public entity.</p>\n<p id=\"AXb\">\u201c(3) Actual and reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or farm.</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">\u201c(b) Any displaced person who moves from a dwelling who elects to accept payments authorized by this subdivision in lieu of the payments authorized by subdivision (a) shall receive a moving expense allowance, determined according to a schedule established by the public entity, not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300), and in addition a dislocation allowance of two hundred dollars ($200).</p>\n<p id=\"AU_\">\u201c(c) Any displaced person who moves or discontinues his business or farm operation who elects to accept the payment authorized by this subdivision in lieu of the payment authorized by subdivision (a), shall receive a fixed relocation payment in an amount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business or farm operation, except that such payment shall not be less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000). In the case of a business, no payment shall be made under this subdivision, unless the public entity is satisfied that the business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of patronage and is not a part of a commercial enterprise having at least one other establishment not being acquired, which is engaged in the same or similar business. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \u2018average annual net earnings\u2019 means one-half of any net earnings of the business, or farm operation, before federal, state and local income taxes, during the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which such business or farm operation moves from the real property being acquired, or during such other period as the public entity determines to be more equitable for establishing such earnings, and includes any compensation paid by the business or farm operation to the owner, his spouse, or his dependents during such two-year or such other period. To be eligible for the payment authorized by this subdivision, the business or farm operation shall make available its state income tax records, and its financial statements and accounting records, for audit for confidential use to determine the payment authorized by this subdivision. In the case of an outdoor advertising display, the payment shall be limited to the amount necessary to physically move or replace such display.</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">\u201c(d) Whenever the acquisition of real property used for a business or farm operation causes the person conducting the business or farm operation to move from other real property, or to move his personal property from other real property, such person shall receive payments for moving and related expenses under subdivision (a) or (b) and relocation advisory assistance under Section 7261 for moving from such other property.</p>\n<p id=\"AIk\">\u201c(e) Whenever a public entity must pay the cost of moving a displaced person under paragraph 1 of subdivision (a), or subdivision (d) of this section:</p>\n<p id=\"AfB\">\u201c(1) The costs of such move shall be exempt from regulation by the Public Utilities Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"Akh\">\u201c(2) The public entity may solicit competitive bids from qualified bidders for performance of the work. Bids submitted in response to such solicitations shall be exempt from regulation by the Public Utilities Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
