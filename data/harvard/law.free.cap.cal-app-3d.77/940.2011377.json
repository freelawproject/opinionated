By final decision dated July 23, 1975, the commission sustained respondent\u2019s discharge. Respondent petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandamus. The superior court granted the writ and ordered the commission to reverse its order sustaining the discharge, and to reinstate respondent in his position. The commission appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The letter from the board of supervisors discharging respondent cited 14 specific failures of respondent to manage his department effectively. The commission, after lengthy hearings between March 3, and March 28, 1975, found the 14 charges true, and concluded that respondent was not capable of managing the department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>In his petition for writ of mandate, respondent attacked his discharge and the commission\u2019s findings on both procedural and substantive grounds. The superior court did not act upon respondent\u2019s contention that the commission\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence. The court declined to review the many volumes of evidence taken before the commission, and ruled instead that the discharge was invalid because the board of supervisors failed to take certain procedural steps <em>prior </em>to discharging respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The trial court held that the proceedings before the commission were invalid and that respondent was required to be reinstated in his position because (1) respondent was not given, prior to dismissal, notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond as required by <em>Shelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., </em>15 Cal.3d 194 [124 Cal.Rptr. 14, 539 P.2d 774]; (2) neither the commission nor the board ever established \u201cstandards of efficiency\u201d for the position of chief probation officer; and (3) the appointing power (board of supervisors) had failed to give respondent performance evaluation ratings annually as required by rule 21 of the commission. The court further held that in the absence of such performance standards, the court was incapable of reviewing the merits of the charges found true by the commission. In its order the court further provided that respondent must be reinstated in his position, and that the board and commission could not proceed to consider anew any of the charges unless the conduct in question fell \u201cbelow whatever minimum standards, established by competent evidence, might be required for the position of the Chief Probation Officer. Examples of conduct which might fall below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>such minimum standards would be criminal activity or absence without leave for an extended period of time.\u201d We hold that the trial court erred and therefore we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><em>Skelly </em>Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In <em>Skelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 194, the Supreme Court, while acknowledging that a permanent civil service employee has a statutory right to an evidentiary hearing <em>after </em>his dismissal to challenge the action taken against him, held that due process of law also requires that such an employee have certain rights <em>prior </em>to the effective date of the dismissal. The court held that, \u201cAs a minimum, these preremoval safeguards must include notice of the proposed action, the reasons therefor, a copy of the charges and materials upon which the action is based, and the right to respond, either orally or in writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Respondent\u2019s discharge in this case occurred prior to the <em>Skelly </em>decision, and the trial court found that respondent was not accorded his <em>Skelly </em>rights prior to discharge. In <em>Barber </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., </em>18 Cal.3d 395, 402 [134 Cal.Rptr. 206, 556 P.2d 306], the Supreme Court held that <em>Skelly </em>is applicable \u201cto all pending cases where the dismissals are not yet final,\u201d and applied <em>Skelly </em>where the personnel board\u2019s decision, and the trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of mandate, had occurred prior to the <em>Skelly </em>decision. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 399, 405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Thus in the instant case the trial court correctly concluded that <em>Skelly </em>was applicable to respondent, but the court incorrectly analyzed the effect of the <em>Skelly </em>violation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The minimal due process rights required by <em>Skelly prior </em>to discharge are merely anticipatory of the full rights which <em>are </em>accorded to the employee <em>after </em>discharge. The employee can exercise those rights at the subsequent hearing, and if that hearing shows that there were good grounds for dismissal, the employee is not entitled to reinstatement; he is merely entitled to damages for the limited time period in which discipline was wrongfully imposed, i.e., the employee is entitled to back pay for the period from the time discipline was actually imposed to the date the commission filed its decision validating the dismissal. <em>(Barber </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 401-403; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number><em>Shelly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 220, fn. 34; <em>Kristal </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 241; <em>Keely </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.3d at p. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Thus the <em>Shelly </em>violation does not support the trial court\u2019s order in this case reinstating respondent in his position. Respondent was only entitled to damages, measured by back pay for the period between his dismissal on November 19, 1974, and the decision of the commission upholding his dismissal, filed July 23, 1975.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Civil Service Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The trial court also based its order reinstating respondent on the ground that during respondent\u2019s tenure as chief probation officer the commission had failed to establish specific standards by which to evaluate respondent\u2019s efficiency, and the appointing power (board of supervisors) had failed to provide respondent with a yearly performance evaluation rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Article IX, section 34 of the Los Angeles County Charter provides that the commission shall prescribe, amend and enforce rules for the classified service which shall have the force and effect of law. That section further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-8\">\u201cThe rules shall provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-9\">\u201c(15) For the fixing of standards of efficiency and for procedures for the evaluation of the performance of employees in relation to such standards ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Pursuant to this authority, the commission has adopted rule 21 relating to performance evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Rule 21.01 provides in part: \u201cThe performance of each employee in the classified service shall be evaluated by the appointing power in relation to standards for efficient performance of the work in accordance with these Rules and procedures authorized by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Rule 21.02 provides in part: \u201cRatings of efficiency of performance shall be made for permanent employees at least once each year ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Rule 21.04 authorizes and defines four possible ratings, outstanding, competent, improvement needed, and unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The trial court found that neither the board nor the commission has ever established performance standards or evaluation criteria for the county\u2019s 58 department heads, including chief probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The court also found that it was previously the policy of the board to treat department heads differently from other county employees in the classified service and not to provide annual performance evaluations to department heads as required by rule 21. The only time respondent was specifically evaluated under rule 21 was at the conclusion of his probationary status, at which time he was rated competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">It was argued in the trial court that the board was authorized to treat department heads differently and to decline to apply rule 21 to them. It was argued that since adoption of the \u201cexecutive salary\u201d ordinance in 1971 department heads received a form of annual evaluation when the board decided whether or not to raise their salaries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the court found that the executive salary ordinance was no substitute for rule 21. The trial court found that the ordinance was used solely for determining the level of compensation, and did not in effect constitute an evaluation since the decisions were made in executive session and not necessarily communicated to the department head.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The trial court could find no exception in the rules which authorized treating department heads differently from all other classified employees for purposes of rule 21. The trial court held it was unfair and discriminatory not to apply rule 21 to department heads and that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>failure to comply with rule 21 rendered respondent\u2019s discharge invalid and authorized his reinstatement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the failure of the board to apply rule 21 to department heads in the past necessarily invalidates the commission\u2019s decision upholding respondent\u2019s discharge.  An error in the procedures used prior to discharge does not require that the proceedings conducted after discharge be invalidated if the employee had full opportunity to contest the charges at the subsequent hearing and the evidence produced at the hearing supported the discharge. <em>(Barber </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 401-402; <em>Kristal </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 241; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>178 Cal.App.2d 118, 125-126 [2 Cal.Rptr. 836]; <em>Kiddy. State Civil Service Com., </em>13 Cal.App.2d 653, 655-656 [57 P.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">At oral argument in this court respondent conceded that there was nothing in the rules of the commission which specifically provided that the prior receipt of a performance evaluation rating of \u201cimprovement needed\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d was a prerequisite to discharge. In this respect the rules may be contrasted with a provision of the Education Code, section 44938,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which has long provided specifically that \u201c[t]he governing board of any school district shall not act upon any charges of unprofessional conduct or incompetency unless\u201d the employee within a certain time period had previously been given written notice of the conduct and an opportunity to correct such faults. <em>(Fresno City H. S. Dist. </em>v. <em>De Caristo, </em>33 Cal.App.2d 666, 674-675 [92 P.2d 668].) Had the commission intended to adopt such a rule, it could have used language similar to that in the Education Code. <em>(Anaclerio </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>64 Cal.App.3d 194, 197 [134 Cal.Rptr. 303]; see also <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Messner </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Cty. Civ. S. Com\u2019n. </em>(1972) 56 Wis.2d 438 [202 N.W.2d 13, 18-19].)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The fact that respondent did not receive a form with a rating of \u201cimprovement needed\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d would not necessarily mean that he had no notice of problems in his management of the department which required correction. The commission alleges that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>produced at the hearing before the commission showed that respondent did have notice of many of these problems and notice that they were regarded as serious by the appointing power.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Furthermore, a number of the charges involve problems which respondent in his capacity as head of the department should have known required correction, whether or not he was specifically advised by the board of supervisors to correct them. Such problems as the alleged failures to operate an efficient subpoena system resulting in cases being dismissed; failure to register cases with the state criminal, identification index; failure to administer effectively the collection of fines and restitutions; and failure to maintain juvenile institutions at an acceptable level of sanitation would by their very nature have suggested to an effective manager that they required correction, on his own initiative. Lack of knowledge of such problems is in itself evidence of incompetency. An effective department manager would bring the existence of problems such as the above to the attention of the board and request the means to solve them, rather than expecting the board to inform him of the problems. In fact, one of the charges against respondent was that he \u201cconsistently failed to inform the Board of Supervisors or any member thereof of significant problems and needs of the Probation Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The trial court also held that because neither the commission nor the board had ever established specific performance criteria for the position of chief probation officer, it was impossible for the commission or the court to determine whether respondent\u2019s discharge was proper. We hold the trial court also erred in reaching this conclusion. The charges against respondent alleged that he was an inefficient manager of the department. The charges were based both upon specific failures of the department to fulfill its function, for which respondent was held responsible as the department head,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and on certain management techniques used by respondent himself which were alleged to be inefficient.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>It does not require the establishment of specific performance evaluation criteria to show that if such conditions existed they could reasonably be attributed to inadequate management by respondent. Inefficiency is a proper ground for dismissal of a civil service employee. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., </em>58 Cal.App.3d 865, 880 [130 Cal.Rptr. 292], the court said, \u201cInefficiency may be established without evidence of the existence of a sp\u00e9cific rule. . . . [To require a specific rule] would place upon state agencies the impossible burden of attempting to conjure up all- the various hypothetical forms of inefficiency which could occur on the job and then commit them to writing. The product of such a task would reach unmanageable proportions, and not all of the reasonably possible situations would ever be covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Because the trial court disposed of this case on procedural grounds, it did not review the many volumes of evidence produced at the commission hearings to determine whether the evidence supported the commission\u2019s findings. We hold that the procedural errors prior to respondent\u2019s discharge do not justify the order reinstating him in his position or the other orders of the trial court restricting respondent\u2019s discipline for the conduct in question. On remand the trial court should proceed to consider respondent\u2019s contentions concerning the conduct of the commission\u2019s hearings and the evidence in support of the commission\u2019s findings. If the evidence supports the commission\u2019s findings, the petition for writ of mandate should be denied, except to the extent that back pay is awarded pursuant to <em>Barber </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 395, 401-403, 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Kaus, P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied March 24, 1978, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 19, 1978.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\">According to the county\u2019s advertisement for the vacancy created by the discharge, in 1975 the probation department had a budget of approximately $60 million, 4,500 employees, and the responsibility for supervising 18,000 juveniles and 60,000 adults. As head of the department, the probation officer is directly responsible for the administration of all the department\u2019s functions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The commission found specifically that: \u201ca.
