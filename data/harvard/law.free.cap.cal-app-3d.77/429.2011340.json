In two actions brought against it by appellants and other plaintiffs, they asserted the claim that various provisions of the United States Constitution invalidated the levy, as to them, because their local business activity engaged them in maritime foreign commerce at the ocean port of San Francisco. The appeal is from a portion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>declaratory judgment, entered in the actions as consolidated, which denies the constitutional claim as to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The consolidated cause was submitted upon the pleadings, a lengthy written statement of stipulated facts, and some selected depositions and documentary exhibits which were stipulated into evidence. These sources support the following recitals (in which the direct quotations are from the statement of stipulated facts):</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>The Payroll Tax</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The tax is levied pursuant to a \u201cPayroll Expense Tax Ordinance\u201d adopted by respondent in 1970. Pertinent provisions of the ordinance are quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is also described in decisions which have previously adjudicated its validity and effect in various respects. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>A.B.C. Distributing Co. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 566 [125 Cal.Rptr. 465, 542 P.2d 625]; <em>Western States Bankcard Assn. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 208 [137 Cal.Rptr. 183, 561 P.2d 273].) For purposes of its imposition upon appellants, all of whom are corporations, they must be divided into the three distinct classes next described.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>The \u201cSteamship </em>Lines\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Ten of the appellants (the so-called \u201csteamship lines\u201d) own oceangoing vessels and operate them in international commerce. \u201cAll are corporations organized, existing and operating under the laws of friendly sovereign nations other than the United States; all have home ports, principal offices, and principal places of business outside San Francisco . . . and outside the United States. All of. . . [their] . . . vessels . . . are registered under the laws of various maritime nations other than the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The steamship lines\u2019 vessels call at the port of San Francisco from time to time. For this reason, each line \u201chas appointed a steamship agent\u201d who represents it there. (These \u201csteamship agents\u201d are in an appellant class of their own, as described below.) Some of the steamship lines maintain funds in San Francisco bank accounts which are held in the names of the respective principal and agent in each instance. Each steamship line maintains a listing, under its own name, in the San Francisco telephone directory. In addition, each employs one or more so-called \u201cowner\u2019s representatives\u201d who work for it there.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The owner\u2019s representatives are full-time salaried employees who occupy office space in San Francisco, \u201cgenerally within the offices of the particular line\u2019s steamship agent.\u201d Their duties involve attending to the \u201coperational side\u201d of their employers\u2019 visiting ships, such as arranging for fuel, provisions, and repairs. Much of their work is performed in San Francisco proper, .but their \u201csphere of operation^]\u201d includes the entire Pacific Coast of the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\n<em>The \u201cSteamship Agents\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">These appellants include 22 corporations, each of which is \u201corganized and existing under the laws of one of the United States\u201d and maintains an office in San Francisco. Each performs certain services for one or more of the steamship lines and other shipowners in international maritime commerce. These services are performed under contract. Some of them involve details of the \u201coperational side\u201d of the various principals\u2019 ships which call at San Francisco, and parallel or overlap the functions of the steamship lines\u2019 owner\u2019s representatives in these respects. When a steamship agent performs these services, it acts as \u201chusbanding agent\u201d and is paid on an \u201cagreed fee per vessel basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Other contract services provided by the steamship agents include the coordination of cargo shipment and handling, arranging for and overseeing the \u201cstevedoring\u201d of ships, and the solicitation and \u201cbooking\u201d of cargo and passengers. They act as \u201cgeneral agents\u201d (or \u201cport agents\u201d) when they discharge these functions, for which they are paid commissions based upon percentages of cargo and passenger \u201crevenues\u201d generated and collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">So far as appears, all or most of these services are performed by salaried employees of the steamship agents. They work in San Francisco and elsewhere, and much of the traffic they produce originates and moves at places outside the city and county. Their activity nevertheless involves the ownership and use of personal property within its limits, the maintenance of records, bank accounts and telephone directory listings there, and the operation of motor vehicles on San Francisco streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\n<em>The \u201cStevedore Firms\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">This class includes four corporations which are organized and existing under the laws of California or other states of this nation. Each of them maintains one or more offices in San Francisco, some own and operate \u201cterminal facilities\u201d there, and all perform services for the steamship lines and other shipowners whose vessels call at San Francisco. These services principally include the actual loading and unloading of cargo to and from ships, and to and from railroad cars in some instances, at San Francisco docks. The physical labor involved in the loading and unloading function is performed by longshoremen who are hired by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>job and paid by the hour. They work under the supervision of \u201cfull-time\u201d salaried employees of the stevedoring firms. In loading or unloading a particular ship, the longshoremen and supervisory personnel \u201care variously on the dock, on ship\u2019s deck, and in ship\u2019s hold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Some of the stevedore firms also provide \u201cterminal services,\u201d which involve \u201cthe receipt and checking of outbound cargo and the checking, sorting and releasing of inbound cargo.\u201d These activities are performed \u201cwithin the port and terminal area of the Port of San Francisco,\u201d but not on the docks. In addition, the stevedore firms occasionally rent cargo-handling equipment in San Francisco and sell \u201cused or obsolete equipment\u201d there. The terminal, rental and sale activities are apparently conducted by salaried employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In the conduct of all the activities described, the stevedore firms also maintain bank accounts in San Francisco, own and use personal property there, operate motor vehicles on local streets, and maintain listings in the San Francisco telephone directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>The Constitutional Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Respondent asserts the right to levy its tax upon the payrolls of all members of the three appellant classes, measured by the wages and salaries paid to their various employees for work performed in San Francisco as described above. Appellants contended below (1) that the levy upon the steamship lines\u2019 payrolls was prohibited by \u201ccertain treaties\u201d; and that it otherwise violated the provisions of the United States Constitution which appear in (2) the fifth and sixth clauses of section 9 of article I, (3) the import-export clause, and (4) the commerce clause as it pertains to foreign commerce.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\n<em>The Decision, Judgment, and Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The trial court announced its decision in a detailed memorandum opinion upon which it entered a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Part II of the judgment declares in effect that the payroll tax is validly levied upon the steamship lines\u2019 payrolls reflecting the compensation paid to their owner\u2019s representatives, and upon all payrolls of the steamship agents and the stevedore.firms, subject in each instance to the apportionment formula whereby the taxable \u201cpayroll expense\u201d is limited to work performed in San Francisco. (See \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the tax ordinance, quoted in fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>On the appeal, which is from this part of the judgment only,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellants renew the four-point challenge of the tax they asserted below. (See the text at fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Each point requires separate analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">(1) <em>The \u201cTreaties\u201d Point</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The steamship lines contend in effect that the levy of the payroll tax upon them is invalid in light of international \u201ctreaties,\u201d to which this nation is said to be a party, on the subjects of reciprocal taxation or avoidance of taxation. Although the real substance of this contention has not been acknowledged in the briefs, it raises the additional constitutional point that the alleged effect of the \u201ctreaties\u201d immunizes the foreign-based steamship lines from the payroll tax by operation of the supremacy clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Pursuing the point on appeal, the steamship lines -refer to tax \u201ctreaties\u201d between this country and two other nations only. They identify both by naming the nations as Japan and France, but not by express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>citation. They follow the references with a categorical statement that \u201c[t]he United States has such treaty commitments . . . with the following countries, representing essentially all of the nations whose carrier-nationals are represented here: Australia, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The sum of this context refers us to an unknown number of possibly pertinent tax treaties (or \u201ctreaty commitments\u201d) which might exist between the United States and any one of the other 12 nations named. The record on appeal identifies no such treaties or \u201ccommitments,\u201d it actually fails to support the categorical assertion that the 12 named countries are \u201cnations whose carrier-nationals are represented\u201d among the steamship lines, and further inquiries by this court have not confirmed the assertion as to all of them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have nevertheless pursued the point by resorting to a compendium of current treaties of the United States, which shows not less than 25 possibly pertinent tax treaties (or \u201cconventions,\u201d \u201cprotocols,\u201d \u201cagreements,\u201d \u201cnotes,\u201d or \u201carrangements\u201d) with some\u2014but not all\u2014of the 12 nations named above.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Although none of these sources has been cited, we have looked at all of them. It will suffice to state that we find nothing in them which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>supports the steamship lines\u2019 \u201ctreaties\u201d point; for lack of an adequate record (see fn. 7, <em>ante) </em>and explicit treaty citations, our inquiry may go no further. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit, supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 373 [p. 4345], 425 [p. 4391], 427 [pp. 4393-4394].) The point fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">(2) <em>The Fifth and Sixth Clauses of Section 9 of Article I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The term \u201carticles exported,\u201d as used in the fifth clause of this section (quoted in fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>has the same meaning as the term \u201cexports\u201d which appears in the import-export clause. <em>(Kosydar </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co. </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 62, 67, fn. 5 [40 L.Ed.2d 660, 665, 94 S.Ct. 2108].) Any effect of the fifth clause may therefore be disregarded because our discussion of the import-export clause will reach it. Any effect of the sixth clause of section 9 may similarly be disregarded because it has no perceptible relevance to the foreign-commerce situation presented here (see its text as quoted in fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>and\u2014more important\u2014because appellants cite it only once and argue it not at all. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. </em>supra,' Appeal, \u00a7 425, p. 4391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">(3) <em>The Import-Export Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In its earlier decisions dealing with the prohibitory language of the import-export clause (\u201cNo State shall . . . lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports\u201d [see fn. 3, <em>ante]), </em>the United States Supreme Court treated it as an absolute bar to the levy of any local tax which even indirectly reached articles in the flow of importation to, or exportation from, this country. <em>(Spalding &amp; Bros. </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1923) 262 U.S. 66, 68-70 [67 L.Ed. 865, 867-868, 43 S.Ct. 485]; <em>Richfield Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>State Board </em>(1946) 329 U.S. 69, 78-83 [91 L.Ed. 80, 90-93, 67 S.Ct. 156].) The court has since qualified the effect of this view, and distinguished <em>Spalding </em>and <em>Richfield, </em>by holding that the import-export clause does not bar a local tax which reaches only the dockside \u201chandling\u201d of articles in the flow of maritime importation or exportation, and is not levied upon the articles themselves: \u201cThe difference is that. . . the tax is not on the <em>goods </em>but on the <em>handling </em>of them at the port.\u201d <em>(Canton R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogan </em>(1951) 340 U.S. 511, 513-515 [95 L.Ed. 488, 493, 71 S.Ct. 447, 451, 20 A.L.R.2d 145] [original italics]. Cf. <em>Western Maryland R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogan </em>(1951) 340 U.S. 520-522 [95 L.Ed. 501-503, 71 S.Ct. 450, 451] [companion case]; <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equal. </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 713, 721-722 [51 Cal.Rptr. 524, 414 P.2d 820], app. dism. (1967) 386 U.S. 211 [17 L.Ed.2d 870, 87 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>973]; <em>South Coast Fisheries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Fish &amp; Game </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 325, 328-329 [28 Cal.Rptr. 537], app. dism. (1963) 375 U.S. 57 [11 L.Ed.2d 122, 84 S.Ct. 174]. See Annot, Imports and Exports\u2014State Taxation (1977) 46 L.Ed.2d 955, 977-978.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Respondent\u2019s payroll tax reaches only the dockside \u201chandling\u201d of imported and exported articles by employees of the stevedore firms, and it falls even further away from the articles insofar as it reaches the San Francisco activities of the steamship lines\u2019 owner\u2019s representatives and the employees of the steamship agents. Because it does not reach the articles themselves, the import-export clause does not invalidate its levy upon appellants\u2019 payrolls. <em>(Canton R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogan, supra, </em>340 U.S. 511 at pp. 513-515 [95 L.Ed. 488-at pp. 492-493].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">(4) <em>The Commerce Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Appellants\u2019 challenge of the payroll tax, based upon the commerce clause, rests upon the stated premise that its imposition casts upon their San Francisco business activities, in foreign commerce, a \u201cdirect burden\u201d which the clause does not permit. The premise reflects a distinction drawn in older decisions of the United States Supreme Court which invalidated taxes if they \u201cdirectly\u201d burdened the process of importation or exportation in foreign commerce <em>(Fairbank </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1901) 181 U.S. 283, 293 [45 L.Ed. 862, 866-867, 21 S.Ct. 648]), or the flow of interstate commerce <em>(New Jersey Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Board </em>(1930) 280 U.S. 338, 348-349 [74 L.Ed. 463, 468-469, 50 S.Ct. Ill]), but sustained them where their burden was imposed only \u201cindirectly and remotely.\u201d <em>(Peck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Lowe </em>(1918) 247 U.S. 165, 173-174 [62 L.Ed. 1049, 1051, 38 S.Ct. 432] [foreign commerce]; <em>United States Glue Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Creek </em>(1918) 247 U.S. 321, 328-329 [62 L.Ed. 1135, 1141, 38 S.Ct. 499] [interstate commerce]. See discussion, <em>Washington Telephone Company </em>v. <em>State </em>(1970) 77 Wn.2d 923 [468 P.2d 687, 689].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">This standard no longer applies in the <em>interstate </em>commerce area of the commerce clause. (See the continuing discussion in <em>Washington Telephone Company </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>468 P.2d 687 at p. 690.)  Under the modern test, a given tax will be upheld if it is \u201cfairly apportioned\u201d to local activity in accordance with the concepts that interstate commerce is to be protected against discrimination, and from exposure to the cumulative burdens of \u201cmultiple taxation\u201d locally and elsewhere, but must otherwise \u201cpay its way.\u201d <em>(Western Live Stock </em>v. <em>Bureau </em>(1938) 303 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>U.S. 250, 256-257, 258 [82 L.Ed. 823, 828-830, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944]; <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J.

The \u201cfairly related\u201d element refers to the requirement that the affected business, although engaged in interstate commerce, must \u201cpay its <em>just share of the cost </em>of [local] government upon which [it] necessarily relies and by which it is furnished <em>protection and </em>benefits.\u201d <em>(Colonial Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Traigle </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 100, 114 [44 L.Ed.2d 1, 12, 95 S.Ct. 1538] [italics added].)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Application of the modern standard, in interstate commerce cases, requires examination of the particular local activity which the taxing authority has attempted to reach. Its tax will be invalidated, as an \u201cimpermissible burden on interstate commerce,\u201d if its \u201cnominal subject ... is \u2018such an integral part of the interstate process, the flow of commerce, that it cannot realistically be separated from it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dunbar-Stanley Studios </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1969) 393 U.S. 537, 540 [21 L.Ed.2d 759, 763, 89 S.Ct. 757] [quoting <em>Mich.-Wis.

Conversely, a local tax will not offend the commerce clause if the activity it reaches may be perceived to have an \u201cessentially local character.\u201d <em>(Dunbar-Stanley Studios </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra, </em>at pp. 540-541 [21 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Since these standards have been held to apply in the <em>interstate </em>commerce cases decided under the commerce clause, the question is whether they are to be applied in the <em>foreign </em>commerce situation presented here. No clear authority to this effect has been cited, but we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>perceive its equivalent in a very recent decision dealing with the import-export clause. <em>(Michelin Tire Corp. </em>v. <em>Wages </em>(1976) 423 U.S. 276 [46 L.Ed.2d 495, 96 S.Ct. 535].) That case involved the validity of ad valorem property taxes levied upon automobile and truck tires which had been imported from other nations and warehoused, still in their original containers, in the taxing jurisdiction. <em>(Id, </em>at pp. 279-281 [46 L.Ed.2d at pp. 499-501].) The United States Supreme Court sustained the taxes against a contention that they violated the import-export clause (pp. 278-279, 281-283 [46 L.Ed.2d pp. 499-502]), abandoned the longstanding \u201coriginal container doctrine\u201d in the process (pp. 279, 294-301 [46 L.Ed.2d pp. 499-500, 508-512] [overruling <em>Low </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1871) 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 29 (20 L..Ed. 517)]), and stated in pertinent part: \u201cUnlike imposts and duties, which are essentially taxes on the commercial privilege of bringing goods into a country, such property taxes are taxes by which a State <em>apportions the cost </em>of such services as police and fire protection among the beneficiaries according to their respective wealth; there is no reason why an importer should not <em>bear his share of these costs </em>along with his competitors handling only domestic goods.... To be sure, allowance of <em>nondiscriminatory </em>ad valorem property taxation may increase the cost of goods purchased by \u2018inland\u2019 consumers. But as already noted, such taxation is the <em>quid pro quo </em>for benefits actually conferred by the taxing state. There is no reason why local taxpayers should subsidize the services used by the importer; ultimate consumers <em>should pay for such services as police and fire protection </em>accorded the goods just as much as they should pay transportation costs associated with those goods.\u201d <em>(Michelin Tire Corp. </em>v. <em>Wages, supra, </em>423 U.S. 276 at pp. 287-289 [46 L.Ed.2d 495 at pp. 504-505] [italics added, fns. omitted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Although <em>Michelin Tire </em>is not a commerce clause decision, it unmistakably deals with local taxes affecting foreign commerce. We find in the quoted language the essence of the modem cases which will validate a local tax under the commerce clause, although it affects <em>interstate </em>commerce, if it reaches a taxable \u201cnexus,\u201d is \u201cfairly apportioned\u201d to local activity, \u201cdoes not discriminate\u201d against the affected commerce, and is \u201cfairly related to the services provided\u201d by the taxing jurisdiction. <em>(Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, supra, </em>430 U.S. 274 at p. 279 [51 L.Ed.2d 326 at p. 331].) We conclude that the interstate commerce standards are to be applied in the foreign commerce situation here. The only remaining questions involve their application to each of the three appellant classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Because all three classes function through their employees in San Francisco, and pay them there, a taxable \u201cnexus\u201d appears in each instance. (Cf. <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>J. C. Penney Co., supra, </em>311 U.S. 435 at p. 445 [85 L.Ed. 267 at p, 271]; <em>Northwestern Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Minn., supra, </em>358 U.S. 450 at pp. 464-465 [3 L.Ed.2d 421 at pp. 430-431]; <em>General Motors </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>377 U.S. 436 at p. 448 [12 L.Ed.2d 430 at p. 439].) The payroll tax is fairly apportioned to local activity because its payroll base is measured by the hours of work actually performed within the city and county. (See \u00a7 4 of the tax ordinance, quoted in fn. 1, <em>ante. </em>See also <em>General Motors </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>at pp. 447-448 [12 L.Ed.2d at pp. 438-439].) The tax does not discriminate against employers engaged in foreign commerce because it is levied upon all San Francisco employers alike. (See \u00a7 3 of the ordinance in fn. 1.) The tax is \u201cfairly related to the services provided\u201d by respondent because the ordinance so provides (see \u00a7 3, <em>ibid.), </em>and it is an obvious <em>\u201cquid pro quo </em>for benefits actually conferred\u201d by San Francisco in the form of \u201csuch services as police and fire protection.\u201d <em>(Michelin Tire Corp. </em>v. <em>Wages, supra, </em>423 U.S. 276 at p. 289 [46 L.Ed.2d 495 at p. 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The payroll tax thus meets all the applicable constitutional standards, with a single possible exception which pertains to the stevedore firms alone. The possibility is not presented by the \u201cterminal services\u201d and other activities which they perform away from San Francisco docks, but by the \u201cloading and discharge\u201d functions which they carry on at dockside. Because these functions involve their employees\u2019 passage \u201con the dock, on ship\u2019s deck, and in ship\u2019s hold\u201d (as stipulated by the parties), and because the ships involved are instrumentalities in the actual flow of foreign commerce, it is suggested that the dockside activities may not be reached by the payroll tax because they are \u201c \u2018such an integral part\u2019 \u201d of the flow that they \u201c \u2018cannot realistically be separated from it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dunbar-Stanley Studios </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra, </em>393 U.S. 537 at p. 540 [21 L.Ed.2d 759 at p. 763].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The suggestion refers us to a progression of decisions dealing with identical dockside activities by stevedores. The United States Supreme Court initially held that their actual loading and unloading of ships was immune from local business taxes because the functions were an inseverable part of the flow of maritime interstate and foreign commerce. <em>(Puget Sound Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commission </em>(1937) 302 U.S. 90, 92-94 [82 L.Ed. 68, 70-72, 58 S.Ct. 72]; <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>Carter &amp; Weekes Co. </em>(1947) 330 U.S. 422, 424-426, 433 [91 L.Ed. 993, 998-1000, 1004, 61 S.Ct. 815].) In its later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Canton Railroad </em>decision, the court revisited the subject; observed that the dockside activities involved in that case stopped short of the actual loading and unloading of ships; and, for that reason, expressly <em>left open </em>the question \u201cwhether loading for export and unloading for import are immune from [local] tax by reason of the Import-Export Clause.\u201d <em>(Canton R. Co. </em>v. <em>Rogan, supra, </em>340 U.S. 511 at p. 515 [95 L.Ed. 488 at p. 493]; 5 Witkin Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Taxation, \u00a7 57, p. 4042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In a case decided only last year, the Supreme Court of Washington reviewed these decisions and invalidated a state \u201cstevedoring tax,\u201d as a violation of the commerce clause and the import-export clause alike, upon the stated ground that \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court obviously views stevedoring as an integrated inseparable part of commerce by sea, and hence absolutely protected.\u201d <em>(Ass\u2019n. of Wash. Stevedoring </em>v. <em>State, etc. </em>(1977) 88 Wn.2d 315 [559 P.2d 997, 998].) The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 3, 1977 (434 U.S. 815 [54 L.Ed.2d 70, 98 S.Ct. 51]), and has the Washington case under review at this time. These last events may not yet be deemed decisive, but they support the conclusion that the question left open in <em>Canton Railroad </em>should presently be resolved in favor of respondent\u2019s payroll tax insofar as it reaches the stevedoring firms\u2019 activities in the actual loading and unloading of ships docked at San Francisco. We therefore hold that the tax is validly levied upon their payrolls without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Caldecott, P.

(See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>The trial court referred to \u201ccertain treaties\u201d in its memorandum decision (see fn. 4), but cited none and named no nations. The omission of pertinent national identities might have been noted and corrected in the formulation of findings of fact and conclusions of law, but these were waived. (See <em>ibid.) </em>A single set of answers to interrogatories, which were included in the record on appeal by selective choice, identified one country (Japan) as the home and flag nation of one\u2014but only one\u2014steamship line. The lone entry prompted us to go through the superior court\u2019s entire file (as made available to us by its clerk) for similar information concerning the other nine lines. We found such information as to four of them, but none at all concerning the others. The missing national identities are not facts of which judicial notice is required (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 451, 452), and discretionary judicial notice of them has not been requested. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 453, 459.) The factual omissions have been further complicated because the steamship lines name 12 countries as \u201cnations whose carrier-nationals are represented here,\u201d but there are only 10 steamship lines among the appellants. In sum, the record is utterly inadequate to support the pertinence of any tax \u201ctreaty\u201d with any particular foreign nation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">This source is Treaties in Force: A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States in Force on January 1, 1977\u201d (U.S. Dept. of State, Pub.
