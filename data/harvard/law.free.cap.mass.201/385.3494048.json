L. c. 168, if the writ has been returned into court and in it the defendant is named as William Clarke Jewell, which is his true name, whether a notice under R. L. c. 168, \u00a7 33, issued at the request of the defendant, that \u201c Clarke Jewell, defendant,\u201d desires to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors, Clarke Jewell being a name by which the defendant also is known, would be a good notice, here was not considered, because the notice was given before the return day of the writ and when the writ was presumed to be in the hands of the officer.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-15\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAB\">On April 28, 1906, one William Clarke Jewell was arrested in a civil action under a writ returnable on May 12,1906. On the day of his arrest he was taken before a master in chancery, and there recognized, with the defendant in the action now before us as surety, for his appearance in court within fourteen days. On May 2 notice was given to <em>\u201c </em>Edward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>E. Morrison, plaintiff,\u201d that \u201c Clarke Jewell, defendant,\u201d desired to take the oaths of not intending to leave the State and for the relief of poor debtors, on May 4,1906. This was duly served. William Clarke Jewell attended before the magistrate, but neither Morrison nor his attorney appeared. This action was then brought for breach of the recognizance, on the ground that the notice given was not duly given under R. L. c. 168, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 33. The case was submitted to the Superior Court on agreed facts. It is stated in the agreed facts that \u201c The said William Clarke Jewell is frequently called \u2018Clarke Jewell\u2019 and he is accustomed to give an answer to that name.\u201d An order of judgment for the defendant was made in the Superior Court, from which the appeal now before us was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We are of opinion that the notice given was a good notice within R. L. c. 168, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 33. Where a person is in fact known by two names, either one can be used. This principle has been applied in about every connection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gale, </em>11 Gray, 320. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Rockett, </em>121 Mass. 431. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trainor, </em>123 Mass. 414. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O' Hearn, </em>132 Mass. 553. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gormley, </em>133 Mass. 580. <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>146 Mass. 610. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seeley, </em>167 Mass. 163. <em>Lancy </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>180 Mass. 411. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>188 Mass. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It is said in many of the earlier cases that the person in question must be known by one name as well as by the other. That means that he must be known by both names, not that he must be equally well known by both names. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>188 Mass. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The occasion of Jewell\u2019s giving the notice as \u201c Clarke Jewell \u201d in place of \u201c William Clarke Jewell,\u201d as he was named in the writ on which he was arrested, was this. The notice was given before the return day of the writ. That is to say, when the writ was presumably in the hands of the officer. At any rate, Jewell\u2019s attorney applied to the magistrate who took his recognizance for the name of the plaintiff. It is stated in the agreed facts that: \u201cThe memoranda made by the master in his own private books of record, when taking said recognizance, were in the name of Clarke Jewell. The said recognizance was upon condition that the defendant named in said writ would within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>fourteen days deliver himself up for examination before a police, district, or municipal court, or trial justice, giving notice of the time and place thereof to the creditor, as provided in chapter 168 of the Revised Laws.\u201d It is not necessary to consider whether the defendant could have used his other name if the* service of the writ had been completed by returning into court, the writ in which he was sued as William Clarke Jewell.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b413-7\"><em>W.
