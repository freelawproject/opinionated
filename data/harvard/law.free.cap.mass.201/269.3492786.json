Testimony was given by the later plaintiff and three other witnesses, all of whom gave descriptions of the accident as told to them by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate before his death and before the date of the writ. These descriptions showed that the accident occurred five or ten minutes past seven o\u2019clock in the morning of August 12, 1903. Henahan, a brick mason by trade, but working as a laborer when he could not get employment at his trade, was put to work by the defendant in beginning to pull down a wooden building on Bowdoin Street in that part of Boston called Dorchester. Before the close of the first day on the work, the defendant came and took Henahan away, and put him at work at a distance at another kind of employment. For three or four days the work of destroying the wooden building continued, the work being done by one man, with one Scanlan, whom the plaintiff\u2019s intestate called tile foreman and said he gave orders. The next day the defendant ordered Henahan to report for duty to Scanlan, giving him his car fare to go to Bowdoin Street. Early on the day of the accident the intestate reported to Scanlan and then was ordered by him to go into the cellar of the building to get tools and to go to work on the wall or side of the building then standing. The intestate went into the cellar, first looking at the standing side wall and deciding that it was perfectly safe and would stand for a long time. After getting tools he started to come out of the cellar when the wall fell on him, inflicting the injuries complained of. Ho work had been done by any of the men that morning, and none of the men other than the plaintiff\u2019s intestate were close to the side wall when it fell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">The testimony relating to superintendence was of the character stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant rested, and the judge ruled that upon the evidence as a matter of law the plaintiff could not recover, and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-7\"><em>J. P. </em>Magenis, <em>{J. B. Boland </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-8\"><em>J. P. </em>Leahy, for the defendant, was not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-9\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATh\">1. So far as respects the count at common law, the plaintiff failed to show negligence of the defendant. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>not personally present, and there is no evidence that the work was improperly done in any respect, or that suitable means of prosecuting it were not at all times provided, or that proper workmen were not employed. Nor is the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>applicable. The workmen were engaged not in putting up the wall, but in tearing it down; and under such circumstances the fact that finally the wall came down is not of itself evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">2. So far as respects the second count, alleging negligence of one whose sole or principal duty was that of superintendence, it is sufficient to say that even if Scanlan is shown to have been in a certain sense a foreman there is not the slightest evidence that superintendence was his sole or principal duty. On the contrary the evidence, so far as it has any bearing, seems to point the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
