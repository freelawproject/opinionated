The defendant did not admit the facts to be as stated in the offer of proof, but contended that if the statements all were true the plaintiff could not maintain his bill. Thereupon, the judge, being of opinion that upon the facts stated in the offer of proof he could find nothing sufficient to maintain the bill, found for the defendant, and ordered that a decree be entered dismissing the bill. At the request of the plaintiff he-reported the case for determination by this court. If he was-right in his findings and ruling, a decree was to be entered as ordered dismissing the bill; if not, such orders were to be made as justice and equity required.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-6\">The plaintiff offered to prove the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-7\">The plaintiff and the defendant have had business relations for the last ten or eleven years. About eleven years ago the plaintiff entered the employ of the defendant as a clerk, and was advanced from position to position until he finally became a partner with him in his New York business on equal terms. The defendant is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling upholstery supplies, consisting chiefly of brass goods. Up to about five years ago the business was confined to the city of Boston, but in January, 1903, a corporation was formed and a store was opened in the city of New York, and in June it was placed in charge of the plaintiff, as the manager was making a failure. The business was then successful, and later another arrangement was made whereby the corporation ceased to do business in New York and the business was continued by the plaintiff and the defendant as partners, the plaintiff devoting his entire time to the New York business. The business continued to be very successful, but toward the close of the year 1907 various disagreements arose between the\" partners and the partnership was dissolved; the plaintiff disposed of his interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the partnership to the defendant and began to do business in the same line as a stockholder and officer in an existing corporation, which then was doing business in New York in competition with the defendant, known as Gould-Mersereau Company. The plaintiff and the defendant have since been in active competition, and the competition was fiercer than that existing between any other houses, has been so bitter that neither would sell any of his goods to the other, and both had cut prices until the margin of profit on many lines was very slight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-5\">Shortly after the separation the business of the defendant began to decrease, and in May at the instance of one Turner, a common friend of the parties and a creditor of the plaintiff, negotiations were begun for the sale of the defendant\u2019s business to the plaintiff, the proposition being made by the defendant to the plaintiff. These negotiations fell through, but in the latter part of July they were reopened, a proposition being made by the defendant to the plaintiff, it being represented to the plaintiff that the defendant was conducting business at a loss and was in poor health, that he had come to the conclusion that it was unwise for him further to attempt to run both the Boston and New York establishments, being part of the time in each place and a great deal of the time travelling between them. It was, therefore, arranged that the plaintiff and the defendant should meet with their attorneys in Boston on Monday, August 3,1908, at the office of one Yerxa, and they did so, but as Yerxa wished to have Turner present the meeting was adjourned until the following day when Turner, who had been summoned by telephone, was present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-6\">The subject matter of the transaction was gone over thoroughly, point by point, and as the various items were agreed to they were reduced to writing by the attorneys. The matter was finally covered some time in the afternoon and it was agreed to adjourn until the next day to give the attorneys an opportunity to have their memoranda typewritten, and a fair copy of the contract as it then stood prepared. The following day, typewritten copies of the agreement having been prepared, the copies were gone over thoroughly, and several minor amendments were suggested and agreed to. During the discussion several outstanding merchandise contracts which had been entered into by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>defendant were mentioned and were definitely disposed of, being assumed by one party or the other as will hereinafter appear, and the question of the application of the existing law of New York regulating the sales of merchandise in bulk was brought up. In order to find out the application of this law it was agreed that the attorney for the plaintiff should obtain the exact phraseology of the act, and the meeting was adjourned for that purpose. Before adjourning, the defendant stated that he was satisfied with the contract as it then stood with the addition of a clause requiring compliance with the New York bulk law, and promised to sign the contract as soon as the wording of that act should be ascertained and a suitable clause relating to it should be added to the existing draft. The parties met again on the same day and a clause was added to the contract, and agreed to, requiring the defendant to comply with the terms of the act above mentioned. The plaintiff then made a formal demand of the defendant to furnish him a complete and accurate list of his creditors, which demand the defendant acknowledged and promised to comply with. The defendant and his attorney then stated that there was a contract of employment which had been entered into by the defendant with one Smith, which they desired to have disposed of before signing the contract of sale. The plaintiff objected to a postponement of the matter on that account, but the defendant and his attorney told him, and Yerxa assured him in the defendant\u2019s presence, that the contract would be signed on the following Saturday at all events, that they wished to delay signing merely that they might be in a better position to deal with Smith, stating that they could dispose of him more effectively if they could say that the contract was not signed than would be the case if they were obliged to tell him that they had committed themselves to the sale of the business. Upon the assurance of the defendant, his attorney and Yerxa that the disposal of the Smith contract was not a condition to the signing of the contract of sale and that the contract of sale as it then stood would be signed on the following Saturday at all events, the plaintiff assented to the postponement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-5\">The terms of the contract, as finally agreed to, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\">\u201c Memorandum of an agreement made this day of August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>1908, by Dickran M.

It also was agreed that the parties should meet in New York on the following day and call upon the presidents of two national banks, which held notes signed by the defendant, to acquaint them with the fact that the defendant had sold his business and to get them to grant an extension of the notes in order that the defendant might pay them in full, or in part, out of the money which he was to receive from the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b629-7\">In consequence and in pursuance of the foregoing agreement the parties met at the office of the defendant in New York, on Thursday, August 6, and while there the defendant requested of the plaintiff that he would fill the defendant\u2019s orders for merchandise from the store of Gould-Mersereau Company now that the agreement for sale had been completed. Relations between the two concerns had ceased in April, 1908, and no goods had been sold by either to the other since that time. The plaintiff replied that now that the agreement was completed and they were friends again the defendant could have anything he needed from the store of Gould-Mersereau Company. The plaintiff then asked the defendant if he had spoken to his salesmen of the sale, and upon being informed that he had not, asked his permission to speak of it to one who was then present. With the permission of the defendant the plaintiff told the salesman of the sale, and later,. on the same day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>made an arrangement to employ him on and after the first of September.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-3\">The parties then called upon the presidents of the banks, which held the defendant\u2019s notes, and the defendant told each of them that he had sold out his New York business to the plaintiff and that he was unable to pay his notes when they came due, and asked for an extension of time which was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-4\">The plaintiff gave directions to his employees to obtain from the defendant whatever goods they might need to fill orders, such goods to be taken from the stock purchased by him of the defendant, and also told them that if the defendant should send in orders for goods those orders were to be filled, thus modifying the rule of the establishment, which was well known to the defendant, that no goods were to be sold to the defendant. The defendant\u2019s manager came to the store of the GouldMersereau Company for goods on the same day, not having been there since the previous April when the partnership was finally dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-5\">In pursuance of the agreement relating to the delivery of goods by the defendant to the plaintiff and in consequence of it the plaintiff received from the defendant</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-6\">On August 8th, 1908, goods amounting in value to $5.88</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-7\">16 66 10 th, 11 11 66 11 5.10 16 11 15th, 11 11 11 11 5.40 11 61 17th, It 11 16 11 2.03 11 16 26th, 61 16 16 11 1.52</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-8\">making a total of $19.93</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-9\">which goods were delivered to him and accepted and received by him and, the plaintiff says, must in law be taken to have been delivered, received and accepted in part performance of the contract sought specifically to be enforced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b630-10\">No invoices accompanied or followed the goods (which was contrary to the custom of the defendant) nor were any sent until late in August, after the plaintiff had notified the defendant that he intended to compel the performance of the contract, whereupon invoices were sent, charging the goods to the GouldMersereau Company, at prices far in excess of the amount agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>upon. These invoices were returned with the information that the goods should not be charged to the Gould-Mersereau Company, but should be carried on memorandum in accordance with the agreement of the parties, and added to the inventory which should subsequently be made. These invoices are still in the possession of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">On Saturday, August 8, the parties met again by appointment, and it was stated by the defendant that he had not yet been able to make a satisfactory arrangement with Smith, and asked for further time; the plaintiff objected to the postponement on the ground that the Smith matter had no connection with this contract, but finally assented, upon the assurance that on the following Wednesday the contract would be signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-6\">On Tuesday the defendant\u2019s attorney announced that no arrangement had yet been made with Smith, and upon his suggestion Smith was sent for and came from New York, arriving in Boston on Wednesday.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-7\">After extended negotiations with Smith, without result, the signing was further postponed in spite of the objections of the plaintiff. Some time after the middle of the month it became apparent to the plaintiff that the signing of the contract by the defendant would be indefinitely postponed, and he was not until after that time acquainted with the legal significance of the signatures to the contract or of the delivery of the goods in part performance of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-8\">As he had then been at great expense in the course of the negotiations, spending considerable of his own time in Boston and had already cancelled a lease of a store in Boston which he had been intending to open, with consequent loss of business, had discharged an employee in order to comply with the terms of the agreement, and had allowed to lapse a suit which he had commenced against the defendant for the value of the electrotypes and woodcuts, the disposition of which was effected by this contract, and, as he further offered to show, the competition which existed between him and the defendant would continue indefinitely to his irreparable damage, and as the defendant was deeply in debt and losing money and was, or was likely to be, insolvent, he decided to enforce the performance of the contract, and the defendant was so notified. Thereupon invoices came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>from the defendant charging to the Gould-Mersereau Company the goods which had been delivered to the plaintiff and received and accepted by him as part of the goods sold to him, which invoices were returned as previously stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-5\">On September 1 the plaintiff, with a witness, called at the , store of the defendant and demanded of him the transfer of the stock and further compliance with the terms of the contract, offering to pay the money required of him and to give the notes provided for in the agreement. The defendant replied that he was soriy he could not go on with the contract, as he had not yet succeeded in disposing of Smith and had been advised to settle that matter before going further with the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-6\"><em>M.

It apparently was understood that the defendant was to sell to the plaintiff a going business enterprise, including full possession of the premises where it was conducted, and thereafter, within certain prescribed areas, neither for a term of years was to solicit trade in the territory of the other. The parties having discussed the subject and agreed upon details, it is stated in the report that the writing which had been prepared embodied the proposed contract. It was to this paper alone that the defendant referred, when he delayed its execution, to enable him to arrange a settlement with an employee, whom he must discharge when the store where he was employed should be transferred to the plaintiff. If the evidence tended to prove that, having been rivals in business before the writing was drawn up, they afterwards rendered mutual assistance in certain mercantile affairs in which because of their intended agreement each was interested, these transactions should be regarded as merely supplemental, but forming no part of the actual bargain. The plaintiff\u2019s understanding also that the writing alone expressed their agreement was manifest when he assented or yielded to further delay, upon the defendant\u2019s assurance that the adjustment should not be a precedent condition to his final execution of the instrument. If the unsigned writing, therefore, is regarded as being the definite agreement, it never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>came into existence as a contract or became binding, because it was left unexecuted by the parties. <em>McIntire </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>61 Maine, 153. <em>Mississippi &amp; Dominion Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>86 Maine, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"Avf\">But, if the bill is considered as seeking to enforce an oral promise by the defendant to enter into the formal writing, as containing all the essential elements of the contract, it cannot be maintained. The agreement proposed should be construed as embracing the sale of personal property, and the transfer of the defendant\u2019s leasehold interest in the premises. <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Homer, </em>131 Mass. 93. <em>Cincinnati, Sandusky &amp; Cleveland Railroad </em>v. <em>Indiana, Bloomington &amp; Western Railway, </em>44 Ohio St. 287, 314, 315. By the statute of frauds such an agreement was required to be in writing, and an oral promise to execute a contract embodying these terms also comes within the statute. <em>Colman </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>16 Mass. 39. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>11 Met. 251. <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Hulbert, </em>102 Mass. 24. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Fitz, </em>132 Mass. 359. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Easton, </em>7 Johns. 205. R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 1, cl. 4; \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The plaintiff further claims there was a complete oral contract, which has been taken out of the statute by an acceptance of part of the goods, and also because there has been a partial performance by him. If the contract is treated as separable, and enforcement of the provisions relating to the sale of the personal property alone is asked, the receiving of a trifling amount of the goods by a corporation in which the plaintiff was interested is said to have been an acceptance by him of a part of the purchase. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Messinger, </em>147 Mass. 185. But it farther appears that the defendant understood, or asserted, that the transaction was an independent sale, nor was there evidence that the corporation was authorized to act as the plaintiff\u2019s agent or bailee. At most, the obtaining of a part not having been contemplated by the contract, which provided only for the sale of an entire stock of goods connected with an existing business, there has not been a clear and unequivocal act of either delivery or acceptance which concludes the defendant from relying on the statute. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>3 Gray, 331, 333. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>108 Mass. 54, 55. <em>Kemensky </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>193 Mass. 500, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">While the equitable remedy of specific performance applies to a sale of chattels, where it appears that damages for a breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>in an action at law do not afford an adequate remedy, the doctrine of part performance is inapplicable, as it is acceptance by the purchaser of a part of the goods or part payment by him which makes the contract binding. <em>Britain </em>v. <em>Rossiter, </em>11 Q. B. D. 128. No written memorandum then being necessary, the statute is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">But if a sufficient delivery and acceptance are assumed, the stipulation for the plaintiff\u2019s assumption of the lease of the store for the remainder of the term cannot be separated from the sale of the merchandise and business, of which it evidently formed an essential part, and the contract being entire was within the statute. <em>Irvine </em>v. Stone, 6 Cush. 508. <em>French </em>v. <em>Boston National </em>Bank, 179 Mass. 404, 407. <em>Hurley </em>v. Donovan, 182 Mass. 65, 69. <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>Wright </em>&amp; <em>Colton Wire Cloth Co. </em>196 Mass. 474, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">To justify relief, the plaintiff then must show, that by his part. performance he has been placed in a position where a refusal by the defendant to further execute the contract is a fraud on him, which a court of equity will not sanction. <em>Glass </em>v. Hulhert, 102 Mass. 24, 31. <em>Graves </em>v. Goldthwait, 153 Mass. 268, 269. If in expectation of performance by the defendant the plaintiff has incurred expenses, and made changes in his business which have resulted in pecuniary loss, such transactions, not having been either expressed or referred to, were not within the terms of any existing agreement, nor are they shown to have been entered upon with the actual knowledge or assent of the defendant, but having been purely collateral cannot be taken advantage of as a partial execution. <em>Potter </em>v. Jacobs, 111 Mass. 32, 37. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine </em>Railroad, 130 Mass. 388, 390. <em>Graves </em>v. Goldthwait, 153 Mass. 268. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Lovegrove, </em>8 DeG., M. &amp; G. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">If there was no enforceable contract, the insolvency of the defendant, on which the plaintiff finally relies, does not confer jurisdiction in equity to assess damages for a breach rather than to remit him to an action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">We have treated the offer of proof as constituting the evidence on which the plaintiff rested his case, and, for the reasons stated, a majority of the court are of opinion that the findings of the trial judge and his ruling that the bill should be dismissed were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
