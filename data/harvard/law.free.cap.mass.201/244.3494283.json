There was evidence that at the commencement of the term of the lease the cover of the coal hole was not fastened down at all, that a few weeks before the plaintiff was injured the defendant supplied a fastening which the jury might'have found to be insufficient, which insufficiency the defendant might have known of had he used due diligence, and that because of the insufficient fastening the cover slipped when the plaintiff stepped upon it, and she fell into the hole. <em>Held, </em>that the question of the defendant\u2019s liability was for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-11\">Tobt, by a woman, for personal injuries from falling into a coal hole in the sidewalk in front of premises owned by the defendant.

A piece of iron pipe, larger than the diameter of the coal hole, then was put through the iron loop and, by twisting it, the wire was shortened till the iron pipe was against the under side of the stone rim in which the cover rested.' The pipe then was fastened by putting one end in a hole in the brick wall and the other end in a hole in the wall where a brick was out, and the person who arranged the device then \u201c wedged that end in with a loose brick.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">There also was evidence that, before the accident and after the fastening had been placed on the cover, the occupant of the premises had had the cover removed for the purpose of having coal put in, and had directed a day laborer to readjust the cover afterward, and that the cover was tested after that and found to be firm. There also was evidence that after the accident \u201c the cover was made to fit tighter, and it was drilled out. One side of the stone had been worn so as to give the cover \u2014 \u201d This answer was unfinished, according to the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-8\">At the close of the evidence, the presiding judge refused to order a verdict for the defendant, the jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-9\"><em>8.

Upon a careful study of it, however, we are of opinion that the jury properly might have found that at the time of the letting the coal hole was dangerous by reason of the liability of the cover to slip, that the means subsequently adopted to fasten the cover were not sufficiently effective, and that therefore the coal hole continued to be in a dangerous condition,, up to the time of the accident. They might have found further that by the exercise of reasonable diligence this condition of the \"hole would have been known to the defendant, and that the defendant did not use such diligence. Upon such findings the plaintiff made out her case as to the negligence of the defendant. <em>Dalay </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>145 Mass. 38. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>199 Mass. 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled. \u2022</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
