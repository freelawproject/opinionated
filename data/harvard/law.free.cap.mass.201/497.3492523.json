Writ in the Superior Court for the county of Middlesex dated September 18, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>At the trial before Stevens, J., there was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff went with one Murphy from West Newton to Auburndale for the purpose of seeing one Mellody, who kept a livery stable and whom the plaintiff had not previously known, to ascertain whether or not Murphy could assist the plaintiff in securing work. When the plaintiff and Murphy were about to return home, Mellody, who owned a livery stable, offered to drive them back. The carriage was an open Stanhope, cut-under buggy. Tennien was seated on the left, Murphy on the right and Mellody was driving and sitting on their knees. All parties were familiar with the place where the accident happened. As Mellody was driving along Waltham Street, his attention was called by Murphy to the defendant\u2019s wagon coming very fast down Crafts Street. Thereupon Mellody reduced the speed of his horse to a gait of about three miles an hour, driving along the extreme right hand side of Waltham Street and close to the side of the park. Shortly before the accident, the defendant\u2019s team could not be seen but was heard crossing the electric car tracks and turning as though going toward West Newton, upon the defendant\u2019s right hand side of Waltham Street. The next instant, and before there was a chance to give any warning, the breast of the defendant\u2019s horse and one of the shafts of the defendant\u2019s buggy struck the occupants of Mellody\u2019s buggy, and the plaintiff was injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the presiding judge to rule (1) that carelessness by any one or all of the occupants of Mellody\u2019s team was imputable to Tennien; (2) that carelessness by the driver was imputable to Tennien ; and (3) that carelessness by Murphy was imputable to Tennien. The rulings were refused, the jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-6\"><em>C. </em>Abbott, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-7\"><em>C.

But the whole case was submitted to the jury under instructions which, as they are not stated in the bill of exceptions, must be presumed to have been sufficiently favorable to the defendant. The judge could not properly have ruled that the negligence of either or both of the plaintiff\u2019s companions must be imputed to him. The principles involved in the question were considered at large in the recent case of <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 309. See also <em>Feneff </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine Railroad, </em>196 Mass. 575, 578; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Northern Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 535; <em>Chadbourne </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>199 Mass. 574; <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Haverhill, Georgetown &amp; Danvers Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
