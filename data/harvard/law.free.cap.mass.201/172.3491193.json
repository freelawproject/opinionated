We treat counts five and six of the amended declaration as raising the question whether the following is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>completed contract either as a negotiable instrument or as a chose in action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\">\u201cDraft No. 14849 H.

L. c. 73, \u00a7 18, cl. 2, provides <em>inter alla </em>that a negotiable instrument \u201c must contain an unconditional promise or order, go pay a certain sum in money.\u201d It is a fundamental rule in the interpretation of written instruments that all words used iil-i-i must be given effect if reasonably possible, and they are to be given their ordinary and natural meaning, unless there is some necessity apparent for a different construction, <em>Cotting </em>v. <em>Boston, ante, </em>97. This applies as well to negotiable instruments as to deeds, wills or non-negotiable contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">\u2022If the words \u201c upon acceptance \u201d in the eighth line of the instrument as above printed could be eliminated, it would plainly be a foreign bill of exchange drawn by Giverna.ud, either individually or as agent, for and in behalf of the defendant insurance company upon the latter at its Hartford agency, payable at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Connecticut Trust and Safe Deposit Company. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>106 Mass. 561. <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>119 Mass. 189. But these words are in the instrument, and must be given a reasonably intelligible effect if possible. All the language employed may be examined for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning attributed by the parties to those in dispute. The paper was made with the intent that, when paid, it should operate as a settlement of claims for damage arising from a fire to property described in a policy of the defendant insurance company and as a cancellation of the policy. The signature is by one who describes himself as \u201c special agent.\u201d Reading this language in conjunction with the words \u201c upon acceptance \u201d seems to make the transaction plain. A fire had injured property insured by the defendant insurance company. The loss, for which it was responsible under the terms of its policy, had been tentatively \u2022 adjusted between the insured and a special agent of the insurance company, whose authority to make payment or sign an instrument fixing its liability was limited to the extent of requiring approval or ratification by the Hartford agency of the defendant insurance company. Therefore, the agent of limited authority drew the paper in suit directed to the agency, whose approval was required to give life to his adjustment, stating the amount of loss agreed upon, but making the vitality of the instrument dependent upon the act of approval or acceptance by that agency. Amplification of the words \u201c upon acceptance \u201d expressive of the same meaning would be \u201c upon acceptance of this contract by the agency department at Hartford, Connecticut, of the London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company of Liverpool, England, and not before.\u201d But the significance of all this is compressed into the words \u201c upon acceptance \u201d in view of the other language of the instrument. It is in effect a check drawn upon the account of the defendant insurance company in the Connecticut Trust and Safe Deposit Company which is not to be valid until countersigned by the proper officers of the defendant company at its Hartford agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">The defendant Givernaud is not liable. If the words <em>\u201c </em>upon acceptance \u201d had been omitted he would then have made the ordinary contract of the drawer, namely, absolutely to pay the face of the bill if not accepted by the drawee or if accepted and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>paid by him. But by inserting these words he made his whole liability contingent upon there being an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">Although no case exactly like this is to be found in our reports, it is within the familiar principle that contracts to be performed only upon condition are not negotiable instruments. <em>Grrant </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>12 Gray, 220. <em>Costelo </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>127 Mass. 293, and cases cited. The instrument, not having been accepted or approved by the Hartford agency of the defendant insurance company, never became a complete and operative contract. It was not a negotiable instrument, as above pointed out. Nor was it a chose in action upon which recovery could be had without acceptance -by the defendant insurance company. Hence there was nothing to assign. Indeed the plaintiff does not seriously argue that it was a completed chose in action.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The demurrers were rightly sustained, and in accordance with the terms of the report the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
