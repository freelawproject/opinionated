The evidence shows that the instrument sued on was obtained from the makers by fraud; that the makers thought that they were making a check payable to an actual existing payee; that as a matter of fact the instrument was not payable to bearer in terms or under R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 26, or to any payee, and was not, therefore, a complete negotiable instrument under which the plaintiff can recover against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-7\">\u201c 2. The evidence shows that the instrument sued on was not payable to bearer or to the order of an actual existing person, and is not, therefore, a negotiable instrument upon which the makers can be held liable in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-8\">\u201c 3. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration sets out that the New England Freight Directory indorsed the check and delivered the same to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff cannot, therefore, recover upon the instrument as payable to bearer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-9\">\u201c 4. There is no evidence in the case under which the makers of the instrument sued on are estopped to deny liability upon the instrument, and no evidence that they were negligent in making or issuing the instrument so as to be liable thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-10\">\u201c 5. The instrument is not payable to bearer under R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 26, and the plaintiff can recover only by proving a valid indorsement by the payee, if any, named in the check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-11\">\u201c6. Under the pleadings the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the genuineness of the indorsement of the payee, if any, named in the instrument sued on. This burden has not been sustained, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-12\">\u201c 7. On all the evidence, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-13\">The' judge refused to rule as requested, and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $25.54., The defendant Whitman alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-14\"><em>F. C. Chamberlain, </em>for the defendant Whitman.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-15\"><em>P. H. Kelley, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-16\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">It is sufficiently plain that the defendants issued and delivered the check to an impostor who falsely claimed to represent an association of \u201c freight handlers \u201d to which the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>fendants wished to make a donation. But while not conceded, the undisputed evidence would support a finding that the plaintiff was a holder of the check for a valuable consideration, without notice or knowledge of any facts which would impair its validity. If this were the only defense, it would follow that upon proof of the defendants\u2019 signature he could recover, although between the original parties the check was procured through fraud and misrepresentation, as the defendants would be estopped from denying the existence of the payee or his capacity to indorse. <em>Pettee </em>v. Prout, 3 Gray, 502. <em>First National Bank of Rochester </em>v. <em>Harris, 108 </em>Mass. 514. <em>Robertson </em>v. Coleman, 141 Mass. 231. <em>White </em>v. Dodge, 187 Mass. 449. <em>Fillebrown </em>v. Hayward, 190 Mass. 472, 480, and cases cited. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 25, 69, 74; c. 173, \u00a7 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">But, although there was evidence of the signature of the makers, the issuance of the check and the good faith of the plaintiff, the answer having aptly raised the issue, there could be no recovery without proof of the genuineness of the indorsement by the payee, for until this appeared the check would not have been negotiated, and the exceptions fail to disclose any testimony from which this essential fact could have been found. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Abington Savings </em>Bank, 196 Mass. 254. <em>True </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>138 Mass. 347. <em>Estabrook </em>v. <em>Boyle, 1 </em>Allen, 412. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>19 Pick. 99. R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The plaintiff, however, relies upon the well settled rule that where an instrument containing all the other elements of negotiability is knowingly made payable to the order of a fictitious or non-existing person, the instrument becomes negotiable without indorsement, and is to be treated as if in terms made payable to bearer. <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>19 Pick. 99. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>7 Cush. 111. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>150 Mass. 166,167, and eases cited. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Minet, </em>1 H. Bl. 569. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>2 H. Bl. 187, 288. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Farnell, 1 </em>Camp. 130,133, n., 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In England since the bills of exchange act of 1882, 45 &amp; 46 Viet. c. 61, \u00a7 7, cl. 3, proof of knowledge by the maker who issues the instrument that the payee is fictitious or non-existent is not required. A lawful holder may treat the instrument as payable to bearer, whenever it appears that the name of the payee is inserted merely as a pretense, without any intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that payment should be made in conformity with the promise, whether the name be that of an existing or a non-existing person. <em>Bank of England </em>v. <em>Vagliano </em>Brothers, [1891] A. C. 107, 153. <em>Clutton </em>v. Attenborough, [1897] A. C. 90. But under our negotiable instruments act, formerly St. 1898, c. 533, \u00a7 9, now R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 26, as well as at common law, while the same rule as to what constitutes a fictitious payee obtains, the bearer as such cannot recover unless it is shown that the maker knew of the fiction. <em>Gibson </em>v. Hunter, 2 H. Bl. 187, 288. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Mercantile National </em>Bank, 140 N. Y. 556. <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Bank State of New </em>York, 126 N. Y. 318. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Pomeroy National </em>Bank, 46 Ohio St. 512. If the e'ament of knowledge is wanting there is no estoppel, although the fact that the payee is fictitious may have been fully established. The issue is one of fact, upon proof of which, by force of the statute the instrument becomes payable to bearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">But, the plaintiff having declared only upon the check as payable to order, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether there was evidence which warranted a finding in his favor, as this issue was not open. The third, fifth and seventh requests, that upon the evidence the plaintiff could not recover, should therefore have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
