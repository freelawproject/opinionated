They there executed an indenture of separation by which they agreed to live apart, and the husband relinquished all rights in the property of his wife in possession, reversion or otherwise and agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>if his wife should die in his lifetime all her property should go to the persons and in the manner to whom and in which it would have gone if the husband had died in her lifetime. Under this agreement the testator\u2019s daughter and her husband separated and continued to live apart and had no intention of living together again. The agreement between them was a valid separation deed by the law of England, but there was nothing in the terms of the agreement, the law of England or the relation of the parties under the agreement to prevent them from abrogating the agreement at any time and resuming marital association of their own volition. The testator\u2019s daughter brought a bill in equity praying for the termination of the trust on the ground that there had been a \u201c permanent and legal separation \u201d from her husband upon which by the terms of the will the whole principal and income of the fund were to be paid to her free from any trust. <em>Held, </em>that the bill must be dismissed, as the separation of the plaintiff and her husband although legal was not permanent, a voluntary separation not being within the terms of the provision for the termination of the trust.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>It seems, </em>that a provision in a will that the testator\u2019s daughter shall have the full enjoyment of a fund theretofore held for her benefit upon procuring a separation or divorce from her husband, if made for the purpose of inducing such \u2022procurement without just cause, would be void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-6\">Nature of the contract of marriage and of the status created by it, discussed by Bealet, J.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">Bill in equity, called a petition, filed in the Probate Court for the county of Middlesex on April 16, 1908, by Oscalena Arville Coe, of Bognor in the county of Sussex in England, wife of Frank Ernest Coe of Hampstead in the county of Middlesex in England, praying for the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the four minor children of the plaintiff and her said husband and for the termination of a trust for the benefit of the plaintiff created by the will of Timothy E.

The domicil of both husband and wife was then and still is in England. Shortly after the plaintiff and her husband separated and in consequence of the differences between them which led to their separation, they entered into an agreement dated April 21, 1899, which agreement after reciting that unhappy differences had arisen between husband and wife and their consequent determination to live separate from each- other and reciting that there were four children of the parties, who are all defendants in these proceedings, provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">\u201c\u2018Now this Indenture witnesseth that in pursuance of the said agreement and in consideration of the premises and of the covenants hereinafter contained on the part of the said Frank Ernest Coe and Osealena Arvilla Coe his wife, the said Frank Ernest Coe hereby covenants with the said Osealena Arvilla Coe his wife, that the said Osealena Arvilla Coe shall and may at all times hereafter notwithstanding her coverture live separate and apart from the said Frank Ernest Coe as if she were a <em>feme sole </em>and shall henceforth be freed from the control and authority of the said Frank Ernest Coe and shall reside in such . place or places and in such manner as she shall think fit and that the said Frank Ernest Coe will not at any time hereafter require her to live with him or institute any legal proceedings or take any other steps whatsoever for that purpose and will not in any wise molest or interfere with the said Osealena Arvilla Coe in her manner of living or otherwise.

Coe \u201d the testator referred to, and meant the petitioner. It is commonly said that marriage is a civil contract, requiring only the free consent of parties capable of contracting, but, if this means that the law no longer regards marriage in its inception as a religious rite, after the relation of husband and wife has been entered upon, each spouse assumes toward the other and toward society in general certain duties and responsibilities, which cease to be mere private regulations and are matters which deeply concern the public welfare. The contract is for life, and cannot be repudiated or terminated at the pleasure of the parties, but can only be dissolved by the State itself. It follows that, after fulfilment of the Contract, marriage is a social institution, or status, in which, because the foundations of the family and the domestic relations rest upon it, the Commonwealth has a deep interest to see that its integrity is not put in jeopardy, but maintained. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 Gray, 209. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>155 Mass. 479. <em>Nolin </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>191 Mass. 283, 286, 287. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>51 Maine, 480. <em>Ditson </em>v. <em>Ditson, </em>4 R. I. 87. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>173 N. Y. 377. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Kreiger, </em>23 Wall. 137. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>125 U. S. 190. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grimley, </em>137 U. S. 147. <em>Sottomayor </em>v. <em>DeBarros, </em>5 P. D. 94. In its conservation the law has steadily refused to sanction the validity of testamentary provisions founded upon conditions precedent to their enjoyment by the legatee, which are intended to bring about the separation o'f husband and wife. If the testator\u2019s purpose was to induce a future separation or divorce of his daughter from her husband, upon the happening of which the fund with accrued income would immediately become payable to her, the condition for this reason would be void. <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>173 Mass. 393, 397. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>1 Eden, 140. <em>Wren </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>2 DeG. &amp; Sm. 49. <em>Cartwright </em>v. <em>Cartwright, </em>3 DeG., M. &amp; G. 982. <em>H. </em>v. <em>W., </em>3 K. &amp; J. 382. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>L. R. 12 Eq. 604. <em>Conrad </em>v. <em>Long, </em>33 Mich. 78. But, while the testator\u2019s intention is the only test, the language he employed is to be construed in the ordinary sense, and for this purpose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>condition, which is made dependent upon either one of two contingencies, is to be treated as a whole. If this is done, then, upon either the death of the husband or upon a divorce between them, whether obtained by her or by him, the fund vests in possession, but it would be a plain perversion of words to say, that the testator meant or intended that, in order to accelerate the enjoyment of the property, the petitioner should procure either her husband\u2019s death or a divorce. The testator refers only to a separation, which, under the laws of his domicil, whose provisions he may be presumed to have had in mind, could be grounded by her only on the husband\u2019s misconduct. He speaks of its permanency in the sense that the marriage status was to be ended, not by a breach of marital obligations, but by an irrevocable decree for an absolute divorce. It is as if, in making provision for her future welfare, he had said, \u201cIf my daughter becomes a widow,\u201d or \u201c If because of her husband\u2019s marital misconduct she lawfully obtains an absolute divorce, then the trust as to her is to be terminated, and she is to have her share of the property.\u201d The voluntary exercise by a legatee of a right which the law confers is not against public policy, and does not avoid a testamentary gift, the language of which may show the testator had in mind that such a contingency might arise. <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>173 Mass. 393. <em>Thayer </em>v. Spear, 58 Vt. 327. <em>Born </em>v. <em>Horstmann, </em>80 Cal. 452, 457, 459. But while the trust is valid, the petitioner asks that it may be terminated upon the ground that she has been permanently separated from her husband. The deed of separation between the spouses was a lawful and binding agreement under the law of their foreign domicil, by which it must be construed and its legal effect ascertained. <em>Polson </em>v. Stewart, 167 Mass. 211. <em>Electric Welding Co. </em>v. Prince, 200 Mass. 386. It can there be upheld and enforced, even if no circumstances existed when the deed was executed which would support either a decree for a dissolution of the marriage, or for a judicial separation. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>18 Ch. D. 670. But the existence and effect of foreign laws is a question of fact, and, under the finding of the single justice, neither the terms of the agreement nor the provisions of the domiciliary law as to the marital rights of parties thus separated severed the bonds of matrimony. If they chose, it was within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>their power to resume at any time conjugal relations, and upon reconciliation the deed would become a mere nullity. <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>1 Dow. 235. A voluntary separation not being within the terms of the will, the decree of the Probate Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
