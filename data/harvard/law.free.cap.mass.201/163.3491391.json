Jordan, Marsh &amp; Company, Gentlemen:\u2014In reply to the above I hereby agree to pay all bills of whatever amount which may hereafter be contracted at your house by Mrs. A. D. \u2022Wain wright upon a proper assignment of the same being made to me. John W. Beals.\u201d This was signed between October 22 and 26, 1898. Between September 30 and November 26, 1902, Mrs. Wain wright contracted bills at the plaintiff\u2019s store amounting to 1115.18, which the defendant refused to pay, although the plaintiff offered and was willing to make proper assignment as stated in the guaranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">In 1898, Jordan, Marsh and Company was a copartnership. In 1901 the plaintiff company, a corporation, was formed, which took over all the assets and liabilities of the copartnership and which is composed of the same persons that made up the co-partnership and carries on the same business at the same place and in the same manner as the copartnership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-7\">The bill in question was contracted subsequent to the date of the forming of the corporation. The only question involved is whether or not the above wording of the guaranty, written to Jordan, Marsh and Company, the partnership, makes the guarantor liable to Jordan Marsh Company, the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">The presiding judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-10\"><em>O. Ray, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-11\"><em>G.

The only ground on which the plaintiff corporation contends that the case at bar does not come within <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Small, </em>157 Mass. 221, is that the guaranty in question, as matter of construction, is not an offer to \u201cMessrs. Jordan, Marsh and Company.\u201d Its contention is that, by reason of the words \u201cat your house\u201d in the body of the guaranty, the fact that the guaranty is addressed to \u201c Messrs. Jordan, Marsh &amp; Company \u201d is overcome, and that, taking the guaranty as a whole, it should be construed to be an offer to the person or corporation who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>should be the proprietor of the Jordan Marsh Company store. We cannot adopt that construction of the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We have examined the authorities cited by the plaintiff. They do not help it.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
