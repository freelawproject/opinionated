Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated March 29, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-9\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hardy, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">The plaintiff testified on direct examination in substance as follows : That he was a liquor dealer in Boston, having a place of business near that of the defendant; that the defendant at the time of the transaction in question was the occupant and owner of a building at 64 Endicott Street, Boston; that some time in October, 1906, the plaintiff and the defendant met on the sidewalk and went into the defendant\u2019s private office, where only the plaintiff and the defendant were present; that at that time the following conversation took place: \u201c And he says 3 to me, \u2018 Get me a man to sell the building.\u2019 I told him, * I don\u2019t know anybody that wants to buy the building at the present time.\u2019 Then he says, \u2018 Then get a man to lease the building.\u2019 \u2018 Well,\u2019 I says, \u2018I might get you that.\u2019 I says, \u2018Mr. D\u2019Arcy, what do you want for the building? \u2019 He says he wants $2,000. I says, \u2018 Well, Mr. D\u2019Arcy, how much will you give me for it if I will get you a tenant ? \u2019 \u2018 Not a cent.\u2019 \u2018 Not a cent,\u2019 he says. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u2018Well,\u2019I says, \u2018do you think I am a baby, a fool or what?\u2019 \u2018 Well,\u2019 he says, \u2018 I will tell you what I will do with you,\u2019 he says; \u2018 whatever you get above $2,000 you can have it for yourself.\u2019 I says, \u2018 All right, that is business.\u2019 I says, \u2018 Will you please give me that in writing?\u2019\u201d That the defendant then wrote on a card, which was introduced in evidence, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">\u201c Oct. 26, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">\u201c All you get above two thousand dollars per year you may have as your commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">\u201c M.

D\u2019Arcy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-18\">That thereafter the defendant and Levenson and Sons executed a lease dated December 31, 1906, of the premises 64 Endicott Street for the term of five years, \u201c yielding and paying the rent or sum of Two thousand two hundred (2200) dollars yearly \u201d; that about two weeks after the Levensons moved into the building the plaintiff sent the defendant a bill for $1,000; and that after that he met him on the street when the defendant \u201cgave him a laying-out.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>On cross-examination the plaintiff testified that he knew that the defendant wanted to sell the property but did not know that he wanted to lease it before October 26,1906, except that he had tried to lease it for himself and had failed to do so. The plaintiff testified that he was not a real estate broker but did deal sometimes in real estate; that if anything handy came to buy, he bought it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">The question then was asked, \u201c Do you know what regular commission a broker would get for effecting a lease of that kind?\u201d Upon objection by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney the judge stated that he did not think the evidence was competent and that he would exclude it. The defendant\u2019s attorney then stated \u201c I offer it to show and I expect to prove by his answer that the regular commission for obtaining that lease would be very much less than the amount claimed by the plaintiff, that it would be $110.\u201d The defendant excepted to the exclusion of this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The plaintiff further testified that he never had talked with the Levensons at all about the matter before this time; that he was in the defendant\u2019s place half a dozen times that day but did not remember just at what time of day this conversation took place; that the plaintiff then went to the Levensons\u2019 and talked with them and got the offer that was put in evidence and took it back to the defendant the same day. He also testified that he knew the property was in the hands of other brokers. The plaintiff then was asked the question, \u201cDid you subsequently effect the sale of it?\u201d Upon objection this question was excluded, and the defendant\u2019s attorney stated, \u201c I expect to prove by the witness\u2019s answer to this question that he did effect a sale of the property shortly after this to the Levensons or one who acted for them.\u201d The defendant excepted to the exclusion of this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">The plaintiff further testified that at this conversation with the defendant, the defendant said that he wanted either a three or five years\u2019 lease; that nothing was said about getting $10,000 for a five years\u2019 term, and the only figures that were mentioned were $2,000; that the defendant said that the rent that he wanted to get was $2,000, and told the plaintiff that if he could get a higher figure than $2,000, he could have the difference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The defendant offered to prove that the regular commission for effecting such a lease, as the one in question would be one per cent, amounting to $110. This was excluded by the judge, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-5\">There was other testimony of the plaintiff and of the defendant in no way changing the facts stated above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to give the following instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">1. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">2. Upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than the sum of $200 and interest from the time of demand thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-9\">3. As a matter of law the meaning of the written offer made by the defendant to pay the plaintiff a commission is that the defendant would pay the plaintiff as a commission for effecting a lease of the property in question the difference between $2,000 and the yearly rental of the property according to the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-10\">4. The plaintiff is not entitled to recover in any event more than the difference between $2,'000 and the first year\u2019s rental under said lease, inasmuch as it appears that the defendant never received more than the first year\u2019s rental.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-11\">The judge refused to give these instructions, and the defendant excepted to the refusal. Thereafter the judge ruled that it was for the court alone to interpret the written contract, and that it was not a mixed question of law and fact. To this ruling the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-12\">The judge then directed the jury as follows : \u201c It seems to me and I rule, that there is no question for the jury to decide as a question of fact. It rests simply upon the interpretation of the contract, which it is the duty of the court to interpret. Therefore, I order a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,053.33. That means interest from the date of the writ up to the present time, added to $1,000.\u201d To this ruling and direction the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-13\">The jury returned the verdict as directed; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-14\"><em>A.

He was to get only the excess above that sum. But was he to have that excess for one year only, or was he to have it during the life of the lease? The true interpretation of the contract was a question for the court and not for the jury. <em>Globe Works </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>106 Mass. 207, 216, and cases cited. It is strongly argued by the defendant that the paper means simply that the plaintiff should get the excess of the annual rental to be named in the lease over the sum of $2,000, and that since the annual rental was $2,200 this excess was only $200 ; and that the construction urged by the plaintiff would make his compensation greatly in excess of the usual fee for such services, and is therefore unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The evidence shows that the writing was hastily made and delivered, and it may be that the defendant intended it to mean only what he now contends it means. But he wrote it; there was no fraud; and under the circumstances disclosed he must be held bound by its legal meaning, whatever that may be. We are of opinion that the contract was rightly interpreted by the judge. At the time the writing was made the period for which the lease should run was not of course fixed, although it is a fair inference that it was considered desirable to have it run from three to five years. And perhaps the longer lease was more desirable than the shorter. But however that may be, the writing seems to us to say that the defendant was to be satisfied with $2,000 a year and that the plaintiff might have the excess, and that this excess for the life of the lease should go to the plaintiff. Any other interpretation is forced and unnatural.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The evidence as to the usual commission for such services was rightly excluded. The action was upon a special contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>not upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>The evidence that subsequently the property was sold was also rightly excluded. The meaning of the contract could not be affected by any subsequent action of the defendant with reference to the property. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Gilson, </em>176 Mass. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">No material fact bearing upon the construction of the contract and essential to the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s action being in dispute, the1 judge rightly ordered a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Pratt </em>v. Langdon, 12 Allen, 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
