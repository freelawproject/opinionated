Richards at the time of his death. Richards died in 1852, leaving a will dated May 12,1851, and allowed October 5,1852. He left a widow, Hannah M., and six children : Sarah F., Hannah M., Reuben R., Nancy I., Amos J. F., and Clarissa E. The eldest, Sarah F., was then twenty-two years of age, and all were unmarried. Sarah F. Richards married Reuben Augustus Richards on January 25,1855, and died on February 22, 1856, leaving one child, Sarah Augusta Richards, who died at the age of six years in 1862. Her father, Reuben Augustus, survived, and died in 1893. The son, Reuben R. Richards, married on February 4, 1868, and died on July 11,1895, leaving two children, Reuben A. Richards and Sarah S. Buttrick, who are the demandants. The widow, Hannah M. Richards, died on October 16, 1906, leaving the other four children surviving her. On April 4,1861, the widow and the five children then living, namely, Hannah M., Reuben R., Nancy I., Amos J. F. and Clarissa E., all then being of age, conveyed the demanded premises by a deed in fee simple, with full covenants of warranty, to Sherman Bowers. The tenant by various mesne conveyances has all the title to the demanded premises thus conveyed to Bowers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-7\">The inventory of the estate of Jeremiah F. Richards was put in evidence, and from it it appeared that the personal property of the estate amounted to $4,503.06.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-8\">Upon the foregoing facts, the tenant requested the judge to rule that the writ of entry could not be maintained, and that judgment therein should be entered for the tenant. The judge refused to make this ruling, and ruled that on the death of the widow of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Jeremiah F. Richards the demandants took, not through their father, but as devisees under the will of their grandfather, an undivided one fifth interest in the demanded premises, and further ruled that the demandants were entitled to an undivided one fifth interest in the demanded premises, and ordered that judgment be entered for the demandants for such undivided one fifth interest. The tenant excepted to the refusal to rule and to the ruling made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">At the request of the tenant the judge reported the case for determination by this court, as stated above. If the refusal to rule and the ruling made were correct, judgment was to be entered for the demandants for an undivided one fifth interest in the demanded premises; otherwise, there was to \u2022 be judgment for the tenant, or such other disposition was to be made of the case as should seem meet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-7\"><em>T. O. Bachelder F. A. P. Fiske, </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-8\"><em>jB. B. Ware, </em>for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-9\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP4\">By the second clause of the will the widow took a life estate in the real estate of the testator; and by the \"third clause each of the children took an undivided sixth of the remainder in fee. Assuming in favor of the tenant that this interest in remainder was vested at the death of the testator, it nevertheless was liable in the case of each child to be divested by the happening of a contingency, and that contingency was the death of the child before the death of the life tenant. In case a child thus died, the estate which had been vested went (if the child was unmarried and without issue) to the testator\u2019s surviving children; but if such child left \u201c a child or children born in lawful wedlock,\u201d then it went to the latter. But any such grandchild was to hold his share of the estate \u201c in the same manner \u201d and \u201c by the same title \u201d as it would have been held by its parent if living. This means that the estate of any such grandchild was liable to be divested by its death before the death of the life tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Such seems to be the plain reading of the will; and the intention of the testator, as thus expressed, can be carried out without violating any rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">It follows that upon the death of the daughter Sarah, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>occurred in 1856, her interest, being one undivided sixth, in the' remainder passed by the terms of the will to her child Sarah, and upon the latter\u2019s death in 1862 the interest passed under the will to the testator\u2019s children then living, one of whom, Reuben, was tire father of the demandants. Upon the death of Reuben in 1895, his interest, now being one undivided fifth, became divested and passed under the terms of the will to his children, the demandants. They took, not as the heirs of their father Reuben, but under the will of their grandfather, the testator, and therefore their rights are not at all affected by their father\u2019s deed to Sherman Bowers in April, 1861, under which through mesne conveyances the tenant claims. The ruling given at the trial was correct, and the ruling requested by the tenant was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandants for an undivided one fifth interest in the demanded premises.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
