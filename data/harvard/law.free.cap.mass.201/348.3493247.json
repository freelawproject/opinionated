The bill of exceptions recites that there was evidence warranting the jury in finding that the highway was defective and had been so for a sufficient length of time prior to the accident to render the defendant liable, that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and that he was injured by reason of the defect in the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The defendant contends that the statutory notice of the time, place and cause of the injury was not properly served upon it, and that in consequence thereof it did not receive the notice of the accident to which it was entitled by law. It is not denied that the notice was sufficient if properly served. The questions raised relate solely to the competency of evidence admitted against the defendant\u2019s objection in regard to the matter of service, and to the instructions given by the presiding judge in reference thereto. We do not understand the defendant to contend that the instructions were wrong if the evidence objected to was properly admitted and if the question of service was one for the jury to pass upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The evidence tended to show that one Joyce went to the office of the city clerk \u201c for the purpose of serving a notice of the accident in question and found that both the city clerk and the'assistant city clerk were out,\u201d and that he thereupon \u201c handed the notice to one of the clerks in the office of the city clerk, who was engaged at a desk behind the office rail with his hat and coat off, and apparently was a clerk in the office; the said clerk came forward and Joyce asked him to hand the paper to the city clerk when he came in, and the clerk answered \u2018 all right.\u2019 \u201d It did not appear that Joyce informed the clerk of the nature of the paper. There was also evidence tending to show \u201c that it had been the custom to hand papers of all kinds to the clerks in the office of the city clerk in the absence of the city clerk and the assistant city clerk,\u201d one witness testifying that this \u201c had been the custom . . . for nineteen years,\u201d and another witness testifying that, while \u201c no clerk had received orders or been designated to receive notices in the absence of the city clerk and of the assistant city clerk,\u201d it was not an \u201c uncommon occurrence,\u201d as the acting city clerk testified, \u201c for notices to be delivered to clerks in the office in the absence of the city clerk and the assistant city clerk, and such notices were received and accepted by the city clerk,\u201d and \u201cno orders were ever issued by the city clerk or assistant city clerk that notices should not be received by clerks in the office in the absence of the city clerk and the assistant city clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We think that this evidence, including what was said by Joyce to the person who received the notice and his reply, was compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tent, and that it warranted a finding that such person was a clerk in the city clerk\u2019s office, and the further finding that the notice was received by the city clerk. <em>Mc Carthy </em>v.
