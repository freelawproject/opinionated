Writ dated April 20, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-3\">At the trial in the Superior Court before Stevens, J., the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-4\">The plaintiff was employed in the Navy Yard at Charlestown. On the morning of the accident he took a car running west to go to his work. When he reached the Navy Yard gate he found that it was 7.85 o\u2019clock. If he did not report for work at 7.30 o\u2019clock he had to wait until 8.30. For this reason he testified that what he did he did not do in a hurry. There were two railway tracks in the street in question, and the Navy Yard lies to the south side of the street. The cars run on the right, and consequently the plaintiff had to cross the east bound track to get to the Navy Yard on alighting from his car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">His story was that on alighting from his car he passed around the rear end of it and looked up before stepping on the rails of the other track; that he saw a car coming on the other track, to quote his own words, \u201c so rapidly that I didn\u2019t have a chance to stop or step back, and the only thing I could do in my judgment at that time to save myself, I had to make a leap for the other side of the track.\u201d He did not succeed in getting across \u201c clear of the other car,\u201d and was struck on the right leg by the fender. The plaintiff testified that he had been familiar with the tracks for six or seven years. The plaintiff testified that he looked up before stepping upon the other track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">In addition the plaintiff testified to a \u201c sign about the crosswalk,\u201d on which were the words \u201c Go slowly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">The plaintiff also testified, and made an offer of proof in corroboration of that testimony, that the \u00a3&lt; custom of cars \u201d running east is to \u201c slow up \u201d considerably or to come to a standstill in approaching a west bound car from which passengers are in the act of alighting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony and his offer of proof mentioned above, the judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>0. A. Parker, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-5\"><em>E. P. Saltonstall $ S. H. E. Freund, </em>for the defendant, were not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b184-6\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABY\">We are of opinion that as matter of law the plaintiff was guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury, and for that reason the judge was right in directing a verdict for the defendant. The case comes within <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 491, and cases there cited. See also <em>Holian </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 74; <em>Beirne </em>v. <em>Lawrence &amp; Methuen Street Railway, </em>197 Mass. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The plaintiff was not entitled to go to the jury on his right to rely and his reliance in fact on the sign \u201c Go slowly,\u201d and on the practice of the defendant in causing the other cars to \u201c slow down \u201d or stop under circumstances like those in the case at bar. He looked before he stepped upon the track, saw the car and yet went across. See <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Neither can the plaintiff invoke the doctrine of one put in sudden peril. If he was walking so fast that he could not stop when he saw the car, that was in itself negligence. A plaintiff cannot invoke the doctrine of sudden peril to extricate himself from the position into which he has come through his own negligence. He testified that being too late for the 7.30 gang of workmen he could not go to work until 8.30, and that having fifty-five minutes to spare he was in no hurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
