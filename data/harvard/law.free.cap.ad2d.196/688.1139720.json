As such, we reject any <em>Payton </em>claim. <em>(Payton v New York, 445 </em>US 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Generally, a defendant has no right to counsel for an investigatory lineup <em>(People v Hernandez, </em>70 NY2d 833, 835; <em>People v Hawkins, 55 </em>NY2d 474, 486, <em>cert denied </em>459 US 846). The present lineup was not court ordered <em>(cf., People v Thomas, </em>76 NY2d 902), and defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel during his interview and never requested counsel for the subsequent investigatory lineup <em>(cf., People v Coates, </em>74 NY2d 244). Although the prosecutor was contacted by defendant\u2019s attorney about an unrelated matter, the attorney never indicated that she would be representing defendant in this case, made no requests on defendant\u2019s behalf relative to the present investigation, and otherwise failed to announce her presence in this case <em>(cf., People v LaClere, </em>76 NY2d 670). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Thus, defendant\u2019s right to counsel had never attached with respect to the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The People\u2019s inadvertent untimely disclosure of a DD-5 constituting <em>Rosario </em>material does not require reversal. Since the report was found by the prosecutor after the court had adjourned for the day following the conclusion of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the relevant witness, the court\u2019s recommendation that counsel simply continue cross-examination using the report was the most appropriate remedy <em>(cf., People v Diaz, </em>169 AD2d 672, <em>lv denied </em>77 NY2d 994). Although defendant moved for a mistrial, he never requested an adverse inference instruction, and thus this is not a case where the court failed to exercise its discretion to impose an appropriate remedy <em>(cf., People v Wallace, </em>76 NY2d 953). The contents of the report, which were not inconsistent with counsel\u2019s defense strategy, did not prejudice defendant <em>(People v Martinez, </em>71 NY2d 937, 940; <em>cf., People v Thompson, </em>71 NY2d 918; <em>People v Goins, </em>73 NY2d 989).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved, without merit, or concern harmless error.
