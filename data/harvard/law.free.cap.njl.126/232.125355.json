All were reinstated after hearing by the Civil Service Commission. They sued for salaries due during the period the sheriff refused to permit them to perform their duties. The answers filed raise the same matters considered by us to have no merit in 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>229. The learned trial judge in a clear and concise memorandum\u2014 a model of excellence \u2014 ordered the answers struck and entered judgments for the sums due upon the annual salary basis fixed by the freeholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">The relators applied for <em>mandamus </em>consolidating their actions. The right being clear <em>mandamus </em>should go to require the raising of revenues, if sufficient funds are not on hand to pay the judgments. <em>Township Committee </em>v. <em>First National </em>Bank, 111 <em>N.
