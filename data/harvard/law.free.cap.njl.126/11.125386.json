We resolve it in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Conceding that it is not.retroactive, prosecutrices do not invoke chapter 126 of the laws of 1935 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>331; <em>R. S. </em>1937, 18:13-19), providing that, in the event of a reduction of the teaching staff \u201cdue to a natural diminution of the number of pupils in the district,\u201d the teacher so dismissed \u201cshall be and remain upon a preferred eligible list in the order of years of service for re-employment,\u201d in that order, \u201cwhenever\u201d a vacancy shall occur in \u201ca position for which such * * * teacher shall be qualified,\u201d with \u201cfull recognition\u201d for \u201cprevious years of service.\u201d Rather, they rely upon the statement contained in the opinion of this court on a prior adjudication of a kindred issue that, \u201cWhile in the interest of economy reduction in the number (of teachers) may be made, those having tenure should have a preference in reappointment where vacancies occur.\u201d <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>13 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>853. But that observation must needs be viewed in the light of the question before the court for deter<em>'mination </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>the right of the dismissed teachers to places held by \u201cspecial substitute teachers\u201d not under tenure, originally employed prior to the dismissal of prosecutrices \u201cin the guise of economy in the place of teachers having tenure,\u201d and retained under the new title following the judgment in <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Hoboken, </em>12 <em>Id. </em>345; <em>affirmed, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>401, directing the reinstatement of seven teachers dismissed with prosecutrices for the reason that the district board of education had continued that number of nontenure teachers in its employ, whose \u201ccontinuous employment\u201d in the face of that adjudication was characterized by this court (in the opinion first cited) as \u201cthe merest subterfuge to defeat the legislative purpose\u201d and the judgment itself. The subjectmatter of the second determination did not therefore involve subsequently occurring vacancies. In arguing to the contrary, prosecutrices plainly misconceive the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Moreover, the right now asserted by prosecutrices must be found in the statute, or it does not exist; and we are not cited to any enactment prior to the act of 1935, <em>supra, </em>which bestows the right. The rationale of the prior holdings, following <em>Seidel </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Ventnor City, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>31, was that the tenure rights conferred by the school law <em>(Comp. Stat. </em>1910, <em>p. </em>4763; <em>R. S. </em>1937, 18:13-16, <em>et seq.) </em>would be \u201clittle more than a gesture,\u201d if the local board of education were empowered, in the reduction of the teaching staff for reasons of economy, to select \u201cfor discharge teachers exempt by law therefrom,\u201d and retain \u201cthe non-exempt;\u201d and that, \u201cIf such reduction is to be made at all, and a place remains which the exempt teacher is qualified to fill, such teacher is entitled to that place as against the retention of a teacher not protected by the statute.\u201d Whether a teacher so dismissed shall have such preferment as respects an after-occurring vacancy, and, if so, the conditions upon which the right is exercisable, <em>e. g., </em>whether it shall subsist indefinitely or for a limited period, the qualifications of the teacher asserting the right as regards the standards then obtaining, and so on, are legislative and not judicial questions: and here the legislature did not exercise its authority in the premises until the adoption of the act of 1935, <em>supra, </em>and then gave it a prospective view only. This enactment evidences the legislature\u2019s comprehension of the sense of the pre-existing <em>law </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that such preference was not implicit in the prior statutes. As stated, the comment adduced from the opinion in the case of <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Hoboken, </em>13 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>853, was plainly not a contrary exegesis of the existing statute, so as to warrant the conclusion of legislative acquiescence therein from the nonexercise of the amendatory power.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Writ dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
