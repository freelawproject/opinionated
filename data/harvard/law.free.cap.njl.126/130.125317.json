The assessments were affirmed by the County Board of Taxation. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Board o\u00ed Tax Appeals reduced three of the assessments and affirmed the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">It is said that the latter tribunal \u201cerred in failing to make allowance for the marked decline in the values of real estate\u201d during the period from 1926 to 1939, and also \u201cin disregarding <em>bona fide </em>sales of adjacent comparable properties\u201d tending to show that tile assessments under consideration \u201cgreatly exceeded\u201d the \u201ctrue market value\u201d of the subject-matter; and that the reductions granted \u201cwere entirely inadequate.\u201d We entertain the view that the prosecutor has not sustained the <em>onus </em>of proof in this behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The evidence shows that the improvements consisted of \u201cwarehouses.\u201d Testimony was introduced by prosecutor that \u201ccomparable properties\u201d in the vicinity had been sold at prices ranging between $1.20 and $.47 per square foot; and the contention is made that the true value of the assessed lands does not exceed $1 per square foot. The assessments represent appraisements running from $3 to $3.76 per square foot. The municipality educed evidence of a \u201ccomparable\u201d sale of lands nearby in December, 1934, at the rate of $5.25 per square foot. Prosecutor discounts this sale on the ground that the lands are located \u201cat the exit of the Holland Tunnel,\u201d and were purchased by the Standard Oil Company for use as a gasoline station, and such a purchaser \u201cwould very likely pay much more than the property was actually worth in order to secure the location for itself.\u201d It is maintained that the assessed lands are \u201cnot adaptable for\u201d such use, and the sale thus invoked is \u201cisolated,\u201d and therefore not \u201ccomparable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">This sale cannot be so readily rejected. It would seem to be a more certain index of value than the sales adduced by prosecutor, for it reflects factors of Value more or less permanent that extend beyond the lands sold and embrace also the lands assessed. Under all the circumstances, we find in the evidence no basis for the conclusion that injustice has been done by the valuations under review. This question is one for the experienced judgment of the local taxing authority and the county and state tax boards; and we perceive no indication of a disregard, of the constitutional and statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>standard in the exercise of the authority committed to them. Compare <em>Colonial Life Insurance Company of America </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax </em>Appeals, decided this day, 126 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>126.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
