The clerk\u2019s docket and file indicate that there was a rule to show cause for a <em>certiorari, </em>returnable to the present term, but there is nothing to show that a state of the case was prepared as required by rule 154, much less lodged with the sergeant-at-arms as required either by paragraph (d) or paragraph f-3 of rule 155. Consequently there is nothing before the court for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The rule will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
