Zeller, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b180-12\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_c\">The rule directs the respondent director of public safety to show cause why he should not be commanded by <em>mandamus </em>\u201cto employ\u201d relator \u201cin the sanie capacity and in the same manner he was employed as chanceman prior to his illegal ouster on October 1st, 1938.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">On September 16th, 1938, respondent \u201cdispensed with * * * the services\u201d of relator and others as \u201cmembers of the Chance Force, or Chancemen,\u201d in the local police department. This order, so-called, was set aside on <em>certiorari </em>by Mr. Justice Parker; and the judgment was affirmed by our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>court of last resort. <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>266. The rationale of the holding is \u201cthat the position of chance-man * * * is a regular position in the department to the same extent as the other positions;\u201d and that \u201cchaneemen are not temporary employes, but are regular members of the department appointed for part time service,\u201d who \u201cserve such days as they are required, and get paid only when they work, but * * * are regular members of the department entitled to tenure and to keep their positions unless discharged after hearing on charges, to the same extent as the chief or any other member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Since the entry of that judgment, none of the chaneemen has been called to service; and it is the insistence of relator that, in \u201crefusing to reinstate and put\u201d him \u201cback to work as a chanceman,\u201d respondent has been guilty of an \u201carbitrary abuse of discretion,\u201d and the writ should go to avoid a \u201cdefect of justice\u201d \u2014 citing <em>State, ex rel. Nicolson Paving Co. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Newark, </em>35 <em>N. J. L. </em>396, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Essex, 23 Id. </em>214. The point is not well made. Relator has not sustained the <em>onus </em>of proof in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">It is shown that the chaneemen were originally \u201cdismissed\u201d from service for reasons of economy. It was found that the existing force of patrolmen was adequate for every public requirement, and there was no occasion for retaining the chaneemen. This is still the situation; and the result has been an annual saving of approximately $5,000. Thus it is that the failure of the respondent director to invoke the services of the chaneemen has been due to the lack of need therefor, and not to a refusal to comply with the judgment adverted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201cSpecial officers\u201d have been designated by the mayor for private service as watchmen, and so on; and it is said that this is indicative of a \u201cgrave public emergency,\u201d and that, in such situation, the \u201crefusal to re-employ relator and other chaneemen\u201d constitutes an abuse of discretion. The offered conclusion has nothing to sustain it. These appointees were merely given police authority for the more effective rendition of service essentially private. The fact that residents of the community have deemed it advisable to have such additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>police protection does not, without more, warrant the inference that the local police authority has been remiss in the performance of public duty. We have no reason to doubt respondent\u2019s assurances, as revelatory of good faith, that, should there be occasion therefor, the chancemen will be assigned to duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">It suffices to add that, while under the local ordinance the duties of chancemen are \u201ccontinuous,\u201d they serve only \u201cas necessity requires, to supply temporary vacancies in the regular force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The prerogative writ of <em>mandamus </em>is issuable only where there is a clear right to the performance of a ministerial duty, in essence mandatory and final and wholly free of the element of discretion, or to the exercise of a discretionary authority. <em>Librizzi </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>17. The instant case is not in either category.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The rule to show cause is accordingly discharged, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
