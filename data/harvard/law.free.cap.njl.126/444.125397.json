The building was erected pursuant to plans drawn prior- to February 3d, 1927, by the prosecutor, Bertram Ire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>land, an architect, who now stands indicted for manslaughter due to negligence and for creating a public nuisance by building an unsafe structure contrary to the code. He seeks to have us quash the indictment solely because of the two-year statute of limitation. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2:183-2. Ho act, other than the collapse of the building causing the death, is alleged subsequent to February 3d, 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">An architect, through neglect or violation of a building code by the preparation of defective plans for a building, which collapses due to his fault, is subject to indictment for manslaughter where an occupant has been killed through his neglect. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Geare, </em>293 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>997; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaydica, </em>203 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>243. A building likely to fall and injure persons because of inherent weakness is a nuisance. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>77 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>129.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Courts do not look with favor on prosecutions that have been long delayed. <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Pleading &amp; Practice, </em>\u00a7 316. But, in the instant case, the indictment was promptly found since the nuisance continued till there was an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u201cContinuous offenses (such as nuisances, carrying of concealed weapons, use of false weights, &amp;c.) endure after the period of concoctions and as long as the offense by the defendant\u2019s action or permission continues to exist.\u201d <em>Wharton, Id., </em>\u00a7 321; 22 <em>C. J. S. </em>357, \u00a7 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">That nuisances such as obstructions of highways are continuing offenses has been held in <em>Buckalew </em>v. <em>State, </em>62 <em>Ala. </em>334; <em>State </em>v. <em>Guilbert, </em>73 <em>Mo. </em>20; <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>94 <em>N. C. </em>896; <em>Nashville and D. R. Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 <em>Tenn. 55. </em>No authority to the contrary can be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">A public nuisance occurs when there is inconvenience and annoyance to the public by reason of any act or neglect. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>212. So it seems that since the death occurred within the two years of the indictment it is timely. The initial act of violating the building code constituted a continuing public nuisance, not to be barred because not discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The preparation of defective plans was the offense creating a public nuisance, and that nuisance continued till the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>lapse occurred. That one who creates a public nuisance is liable civilly till the nuisance be abated seems clear. <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Town of Dover, </em>125 <em>N. J. L. </em>288.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Likewise in an indictment for conspiracy under a statute, which makes an overt act necessary to complete the offense, it is enough if there is an overt act within two years even though the conspiracy was formed long before. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kissel, </em>218 <em>U. S. </em>601; <em>State </em>v. <em>Unsworth, </em>85 <em>N. J. L. </em>237, 242; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>93 <em>Id. </em>205.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">So also desertion in this state is a continuous crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Garris, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>608; Polygamy is a continuing one. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>248 <em>Mass. </em>15; 142 <em>N. E. Rep. </em>791. The two-year statute does not bar the prosecution of such offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A public nuisance is a wrong which continues until it is abated. The indictment, in short, alleges that the prosecutor in creating a defective building - to which the public would be invited created a continuing offense for which he could be held at the bar of a criminal court when a death resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The indictment does not offend the two-year statute of limitation. The writ will be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
