S. </em>1937, 11:1-1, <em>ei seq. </em>Prosecutors were then, and continued thereafter to be, chancemen designated under a local ordinance adopted in 1913, providing for the appointment of \u201csuitable persons not exceeding eight in number\u201d (increased to twelve by an amendment made in 1929) \u201cto be known as chancemen,\u201d with \u201call the powers\u201d and \u201cduties of regular patrolmen when called upon\u201d for service \u201cby the Mayor or Chief of Police,\u201d and entitled to \u201creceive while actually on duty the same compensation as regular patrolmen,\u201d and directing the local authority, \u201cwhen appointing regular patrolmen,\u201d to \u201cselect them from the list of chancemen.\u201d The mayor was also thereby empowered to appoint \u201csuch special policemen as he may deem necessary for the preservation of the peace and good order of the City,\u201d who were likewise entrusted with all the powers and duties of \u201cthe regular patrolmen,\u201d at compensation to be \u201cdetermined by the Common Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">On April 28th, 1938, the defendant Civil Service Commission, pursuant to the request of the mayor made on February 16th, preceding, and after due public notice, held an examination for the \u201cposition\u201d of \u201cpatrolmen\u201d in the police department, \u201copen to male citizens, resident\u201d of the municipality for \u201cat least two years,\u201d having a common school education, at least, and being not less than twenty-one nor more than thirty-five years of age, and thereafter certified an eligible list to the appointing power. On the prior April 1st, prosecutors protested the holding of the scheduled test on the ground that patrolmen should be appointed from \u201cthe now existing list of chancemen,\u201d some of whom were barred by age from taking the examination, but the Commission, on April 7th, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>1938, held that the cited statute did not so provide, and that the chancemen were eligible for such examination only if they met the prescribed qualifications. Nothing further was done, except that on February 3d, 1940, in a proceeding instituted by prosecutors in this court, they were classified as \u201cregular members of the police department, holding the position of chancemen.\u201d On September 15th, 1939, the defendant Rizzo, who was not a ehanceman, was appointed patrolman from the register of eligibles thus certified by the Civil Service Commission; and on May 17th, 1940, this writ was sued out to review the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">It is now maintained that, in virtue of the cited local ordinance and <em>R. S. </em>1937, 11:22-34, \u201cthe appointment of patrolmen is limited to chancemen;\u201d and the action of the Civil Service Commission in holding \u201can open competitive examination for position of patrolman\u201d before \u201cthe present list of chancemen was exhausted,\u201d and the appointment of Rizzo from the resulting eligible list, were therefore unlawful. It is said that, \u201cwhen more members\u201d of the police department \u201care needed, it is the duty of the Civil Service Commission to hold an examination, not for patrolmen but for chancemen, the lowest grade of officers in the department, and from which class promotions can be made to the office of patrolmen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>123 <em>N. J. L. </em>266, our court of last resort ruled that, under similar municipal action, the \u201cposition\u201d of \u201cehanceman is a regular position in the department to the same extent as the other positions,\u201d and that the occupants of such \u201care regular members of the department\u201d appointed for part time service, and \u201centitled to tenure and to keep their positions unless discharged after hearing on charges, to the same extent as the chief or any other member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The cited provision of the Civil Service act <em>(R. S. </em>1937, 11:22-34) provides that \u201cA vacancy in a position in the competitive class shall be filled, as far as practicable, by promotions from among persons holding positions in a lower grade in the department, office or institution in which the vacancy exists;\u201d and that \u201cpromotions shall be based upon merit, to be ascertained by examinations provided by the commission, and upon the superior qualifications of the person promoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>as shown by his previous service, due weight being given to seniority and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The determination of the question of whether it is \u201cpracticable\u201d to fill a vacancy by promotion \u201cfrom among persons holding positions in a lower grade,\u201d according to \u201cmerit, to be ascertained by examinations,\u201d involves the exercise of a sound discretion, guided by the central policy of the statute. Compare <em>Davaillon </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>380.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">But here there was no such exercise of discretion. The Civil Service Commission did not conclude that a promotional examination was impracticable in the circumstances; it proceeded on the hypothesis that the chancemen were not the holders of \u201cpositions in a lower grade.\u201d And now it is maintained on behalf of the commission that chancemen are not in a lower grade, since they \u201cperform the same duties as patrolmen when working,\u201d and therefore constitute \u201cmerely an auxiliary body,\u201d with \u201cno definiteness of employment.\u201d It is said further that a \u201cchanceman is an apprentice but the Civil Service act does not recognize an apprenticeship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">This contention is obviously faulty. By local regulation made before the adoption of the Civil Service act, chancemen were given a rank beneath that of patrolmen. There was no continuity of service; they were invested with the powers and charged with the duties of \u201cregular patrolmen\u201d only when \u201ccalled\u201d to service \u201cby the Mayor or Chief of Police.\u201d And the ordinance also enjoined the governing body, in the exercise of the authority to appoint \u201cregular patrolmen,\u201d to \u201cselect them from the list of chancemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Thus it is that the Civil Service Commission, in the conduct of this examination, did not observe the limitations of the statute. Yet its action constituted a merely irregular exercise of its statutory function, and not an excess of power that is to be denominated a nullity. In such circumstances, inexcusable delay operates as an estoppel against the assertion of the right to vacate the action; and this is the situation here. While laches, in its legal sense, ordinarily connotes delay injurious to another, the public interest demands that a challenge directed to the Civil Service Commission\u2019s exercise of this authority be interposed with reasonable promptitude. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Sound economy dictates that questions relating to the regularity of the exercise of such power be determined with reasonable expedition. The proper administration of the affairs of the commission and of the local government forbid undue delay in such matters. Compare <em>Glori </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners of Newark, </em>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>131; <em>Marjon </em>v. <em>Altman, </em>120 <em>Id. </em>16.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">The writ is accordingly dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
