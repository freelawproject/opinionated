The machine of the prosecutor company and the machine of the respondent company, it appears without contradiction, are the only machines which have been officially approved by the Secretary of State pursuant to the statute, <em>R. S. </em>19:48-2, and that both are regarded as of a high order.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">We cannot say that it reasonably appears that the action of the Board of Freeholders, sought to be reviewed, was not in good faith, upon reasonable investigation and the result of their considered judgment after due inquiry into the merits of both the prosecutor\u2019s and respondent\u2019s machines. Therefore, the application is denied, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
