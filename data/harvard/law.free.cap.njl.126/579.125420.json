S. </em>1937, 2 :27-206, as amended by chapter 233 of the laws of 1938. <em>Pamph. L., p. </em>536. While at common law this writ issued of common right for the removal of a civil cause from an inferior court of record, under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>statute it is essentially discretionary \u201cfor the correction of abuse.\u201d Abuse of the process resulted in drastic statutory limitation, and the writ has fallen into disuse. It is available \u201cwhen for any reason the Circuit Court or Court of Common Pleas cannot be relied on to do justice, or a change of venue is proper, but it ought only to be allowed for good cause shown.\u201d <em>Van Hoogenstyn </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>189; <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Monmouth Bank, </em>9 <em>Id. </em>101. Eemoval for the mere purpose of consolidation is not in the particular circumstances warranted in the law. The legislature has spoken on the subject of consolidation; and it is permissible only where the actions depend in the \u201csame court.\u201d The statute is not cumulative but exclusive of such pre-existing inherent authority as courts of general jurisdiction may have had at common law. <em>Bxpressio unius est exclusio alberius. </em>Compare <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Monmouth Bank, supra. </em>I have not been cited to any case before or after the adoption of this act in which there was a removal of a cause from an inferior court for the purpose of consolidation. It is not urged that essential justice demands the removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">It is to be noted that, by the act of 1938, <em>supra, </em>removal is accomplished by <em>certiorari </em>and, as auxiliary thereto, such other writs or process as may be necessary to effectuate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
