H. Fuller </em>asserted his lien on the judgment in the first suit, as attorney and counsel in that suit, for his fees and disbursements therein. He said that the statutes do not furnish an express rule for setting off judgments, and the Court would be governed by the analogy to a set-off of executions, in regard to which it is enacted by Revised Stat. c. 97, \u00a7 76, that the set-off shall not be \u201c allowed as to so much of the first execution as may be due to the attorney in that suit, for his fees and disbursements therein ; \u201d that in England the attorney has a lien for the fee paid by him to the barrister ; and that the word <em>attorney </em>is used by the legislature for attorney and counsel, and the intention was to protect from set-ofi all that is reasonably charged and expended by the person prosecuting the suit for the party, and not merely the taxable costs.

It is clear that the same rule is to be applied to these judgments as in the case of a set-off of executions. There the officer is to exclude from the set-off, only the bill of costs as it appears on the execution. He has thus a plain rule for his guidance. And this view of the question, we believe, is in conformity to the practice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
