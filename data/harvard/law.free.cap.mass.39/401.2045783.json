The bill also prayed for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">The articles of agreement referred to in the bill, were under seal, and contained the following provisions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">Shaw agrees and covenants with the plaintiff to complete a building erected and standing on the land in question for the manufacture of cotton, to furnish a suitable water-wheel for the building to carry the machinery for that purpose, and water sufficient to drive the wheel with sufficient force to carry all the plaintiff\u2019s machinery at all times, and to furnish a shaft, &amp;c. \u201c Said Shaw is to put said machinery in good repair and keep it in good repair for the space of one month : Also a shed suitably near the aforesaid building twenty by fifteen feet on the ground, for storing cotton and other goods : Also a road from the highway to said building kept in suitable repair, with liberty to pass and repass thereon at all times. All the buildings are to be kept in repair by said Shaw; and the buildings are to be suitably furnished with the aforesaid machinery by the first day of September next, ready for operation by the first day of September next. And if said Shaw shall fail to have said buildings, machinery and all which he is to furnish, ready for operation at the time aforesaid, he shall pay said Bacon, as liquidated damages, during the time he shall fail to have all ready for operation, the sum of five dollars by the day.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-11\">\u201c And said Shaw does hereby lease said building to said Bacon for the term of ten years from the said first day of Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tember, for the sum of fifty-five dollars by the year, to be paid annually. But said Bacon is to have the use of said building &amp;c., after they are completed, free of rent, for so long a time as shall intervene between the first day of June last and the time when said building, machinery, &amp;c. shall be ready for operation, and shall also use said building, free of rent, for the purposes of storing cotton and machinery and making repairs, from the date of this instrument.

The person redeeming must have a freehold estate at least. Revised Stat. c. 107, \u00a7 13 ; 1 Powell on Mortg. (Rand\u2019s ed.) 261. The plaintiff, if he redeems at all, must redeem the whole mortgage ; and as he would thereby disturb all the relations between the parties connected with the land, it would seem as if he should have some permanent interest to entitle him to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">The articles of agreement were not a lease, but only a contract between the plaintiff and Shaw for a lease after the building should be completed. A great portion of that which was the subject of the contract, was to be afterwards created, and not being in existence, could not be leased. 4 Bac. Abr. <em>Leases &amp;c.

Land will not pass as appurtenant to land ; <em>afortioH </em>not as appurtenant to buildings. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Banister, </em>4 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>R. 514; <em>Taylor </em>v.

We contend, that a grant of a <em>building </em>is-, <em>prima facie, </em>a grant of the <em>land </em>upon which it stands. The provision in the articles of agreement in regard to taxes, is evidence that the parties understood it to be a lease of land. The land does not pass as appurtenant to the building, but as parcel of the grant. 4 Com. Dig. <em>Grant, E </em>6, <em>E </em>9 ; <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Stapler, </em>5 Serg. 6 Rawle, 107 ; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>6 Greenleaf, 436 ; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>White, </em>7 Mass.

Olney, </em>3 Mason, 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-8\">The instrument in question was a present lease, and not an agreement for a lease. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Ashburner, </em>5 T. R. 163.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A3L\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXa\">delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a bill in equity, by the lessee for years of certain real estate, to redeem the same from the incumbrance of a mortgage made by his lessor to John Bowdoin, one of the defendants, and by him assigned to the other two defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The defendants demur to the bill; and the first question raised by the defendants\u2019 counsel is, whether a tenant for years has a right to redeem a mortgage made by his lessor. And we think it very clear, that he has such a right. It was so laid down by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>in <em>Keech </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Doug. 21, as an undisputed right. 2 Cruise\u2019s Dig. <em>tit. </em>15, c. 2, \u00a7 6, 7 But if this right were doubtful, it is now rendered certain <em>by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the Revised Stat. <em>c. </em>107, \u00a7 13, which provides, that any person lawfully claiming or holding under the mortgager may redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">It was then argued by the defendant\u2019s counse., that the instrument under which the plaintiff claims is not to be construed as a lease, but as an agreement for a lease ; and they rely on <em>Jackson </em>v. Delacroix, 2 Wendell, 433. In that case it was decided, and, as we think, correctly, that whether an instrument be a lease, or only an agreement for a lease, depends on the intention of the parties to be collected from the whole instrument. And, accordingly, it was held, that the instrument in that case, although it contained words of present demise, was to be construed as an agreement for a lease, such appearing to the court to have been the intention of the parties. But there is a material distinction between that case and the present. The instrument in that case contained an agreement for a future lease, after certain alterations and improvements of the building should have been made ; and by the <em>habendum </em>in the same instrument, the term was not to commence until after the completion of the alterations and improvements. These alterations and improvements bad never been made, but the old building had been taken down and a new building erected, and the lessee had never ent\u00e9red into the premises demised or intended to be demised. None of these circumstances, from which the intention of the parties was inferred in that case, exist in the present. There is no agreement for a lease at a future day. The term is to commence <em>in futuro </em>at a day certain. There are express and apt words of a present demise, and the bill avers, that the plaintiff entered in pursuance of the lease, and has ever since continued in the possession of the premises. Under these circumstances there can be no doubt, we think, that the parties intended, what the language of the instrument clearly imports, namely, a present demise to commence <em>in futuro. </em>Considering this as a valid lease, we think it clear that upon the facts stated in the bill the plaintiff is entitled to redeem.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">It is objected, that the land was not demised, but the buildings only, and that the plaintiff has only an easement in the land If this were so, still the plaintiff would be entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>redeem. But by the demise of the building, the land on whit h it stood clearly passed as incident to the demise. The exclu sive possession of the land was necessary to the enjoyment of the demise. Com.
