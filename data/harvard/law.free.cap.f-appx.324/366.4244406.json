In his sole issue on appeal, Carrasco-Flores raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 557-64 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008), which held that any disparity in sentencing between fast-track and non-fast-track jurisdictions is a function of Congressional policy and is not \u201cunwarranted\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Carrasco-Flores concedes as much but asserts that he wishes to preserve the issue for further review. Carrasco-Flores raised additional sentencing arguments in the district court, which he does not raise here. He also appealed the revocation of a previously-imposed term of supervised release, and the two appeals were consolidated. As the sole issue raised in his brief pertains to the foreclosed fast-track disparity argument, he has abandoned all other issues. <em>See United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 360 &amp; n. 30 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-23\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
