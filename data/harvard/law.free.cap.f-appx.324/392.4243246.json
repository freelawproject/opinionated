They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>contend that the BIA erred in denying Roberto\u2019s asylum claim because he established a well-founded fear that if he were removed to El Salvador, he would be persecuted on the basis of his political opinion regarding the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The Godinezes do not challenge the BIA\u2019s ruling affirming the denial of withholding of removal, cancellation of removal, relief under the CAT, or voluntary departure. They have therefore abandoned these issues. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff\u2019 Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We review factual findings of the BIA for substantial evidence and may not reverse its factual findings \u201cunless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). The petitioners have the burden of proving the compelling nature of the evidence. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). The Godi-nezes have failed to establish that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that Roberto has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 904 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
