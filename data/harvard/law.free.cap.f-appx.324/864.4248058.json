Finding Staley eligible for relief under Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court reduced Staley\u2019s sentence to the low-end of his amended guideline range, but denied his request to reduce his sentence further, finding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Staley argues that Bookeds remedial holding, rendering the guidelines advisory, applies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, thus authorizing the district court to reduce his sentence below the amended guideline range. Staley urges us to follow the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir.2007), holding that <em>Booker </em>already rejected, without exception, the government\u2019s proposal to apply the guidelines as advisory in one context, but mandatory in another. Staley additionally argues that the district court must apply the Sentencing Guidelines that are in effect at the time of resentencing, and, therefore, since the Sentencing Guidelines are currently advisory, the district court must consider the guidelines as advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">This Court has recently rejected Staley\u2019s argument that the district court has the authority to apply <em>Booker </em>in a \u00a7 3582 re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (holding \u201cthat <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings\u201d and that <em>\u201cBooker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). Therefore, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
