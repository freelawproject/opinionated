Morgan filed a \u00a7 2254 application asserting that his drug conviction was constitutionally flawed. The district court dismissed the application as successive. Morgan filed the instant Rule 60(b) motion requesting relief from judgment. On August 3, 2008, the magistrate judge entered an oral order addressing the motion. Morgan filed a notice of appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s order. Morgan now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) and leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-21\">If necessary, we must examine the basis of our jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to appeals from \u201cfinal decisions of the district courts.\u201d The magistrate judge\u2019s entry of an oral order on August 3, 2008, is not a final decision of the district court. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Morgan\u2019s motions for a COA and for leave to proceed IFP are denied without prejudice as unripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED AS UNRIPE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
