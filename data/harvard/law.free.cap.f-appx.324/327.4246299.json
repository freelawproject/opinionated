The contract between the parties was the document given to plaintiff at the boarding of the ship. By-signing it, he acknowledged receipt and agreed to its terms. That document included the provision that no claim for personal injury could be made unless filed within one year after the date of the injury. Plaintiff alleges an injury on July 17, 2004 but did not file suit until May 30, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">2. Plaintiff took and retained possession of the contract, receiving ample notice of the limitation period. There is no issue of unfairness by the defendant. See <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 595, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">3. Whatever complaint plaintiff has for any problem with regaining the deposit before -boarding and signing the contract is immaterial to the contractual limitation after it was accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-24\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
