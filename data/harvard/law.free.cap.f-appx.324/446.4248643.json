The district court determined that Freeman had not exhausted his state remedies as to all of the claims raised in his habeas application. The respondent concedes that the district court erred in dismissing the entire habeas application without giving Freeman an opportunity to amend his habeas application to dismiss his unexhausted claims, an issue on which we have granted a COA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. We neither make nor intimate any opinion as to which of Freeman\u2019s claims have been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">Freeman seeks to challenge this court\u2019s refusal to grant him Certificates of Appeal-ability as to other issues, but we do not consider these claims, as he allowed the time within which he could make such challenges to lapse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
