The district court concluded that Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines did not reduce his sentencing range, which was based on his career offender designation. After careful review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">Stevens pled guilty in 1999 to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Stevens was held accountable for at least 50 grams of crack cocaine, which set his base offense level at 32 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c). His qualification as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, however,elevated his base offense level to 37 and his criminal history category to VI. After subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility and timely notification of his intention to plead guilty, Stevens\u2019s total offense level was 34 and his sentencing range was 262 to 327 months of imprisonment. The court sentenced him to the low-end range of 262 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-24\">In April 2008, Stevens, through counsel, filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence. Stevens asserted that his base offense level should be reduced two levels under Amendment 706, thereby reducing his sentencing guidelines range. The district court determined that Amendment 706 did not affect Stevens\u2019s career offender sentencing calculation, and even if it did, Stevens\u2019s original sentence was reasonable and sufficient. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>district court denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Stevens now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion, and its legal interpretations <em>de novo. See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence that was based on a guideline sentencing range which the Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered. <em>See 18 </em>U.S .C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) by reducing the base offense levels for certain drug offenses. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1325 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, \u2014 S.Ct. - (2009). Amendment 706 had no impact on the career offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, however. <em>See id. </em>at 1330. Consequently, a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 if his sentence was based on the career offender provision under \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than on the amount of drugs attributable to him under \u00a7 2Dl.l(e). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Our independent review of the record confirms the district court\u2019s finding that Stevens was sentenced as a career offender. Because the court did not utilize his base offense level calculated under \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) to determine his guideline sentencing range, Stevens\u2019s sentence was not based on the amount of drugs involved. Consequently, Amendment 706 had no effect on Stevens\u2019s sentence and did not entitle him to a sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>(affirming the denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions because \u201calthough Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to the defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Stevens raises two new issues in his reply brief: (1) his sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and (2) the district court should have considered the racial disparity in the treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses discussed in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). We generally will not address issues raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1269 n. 2 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). In any event, both arguments are outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (concluding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam), <em>petition </em>for cert. filed (Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings because it only addressed the crack/powder disparity with respect to original sentencing proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">The sentencing range upon which Stevens\u2019s sentence was based is unchanged by Amendment 706 because he qualified as a career offender. The district court thus correctly concluded that Stevens was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
