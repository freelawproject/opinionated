Spigner moved to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-28\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence modification is inconsistent with the policy statements if a retroactive amendment applies to the defendant but \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"A_4n\">The district court correctly concluded that Spigner was ineligible for a reduction of sentence under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-42 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Spigner was sentenced based on a range determined by application of a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Amendment 706 does not affect his sentencing range. The district court also correctly ruled that a motion under section 3582(c)(2) is not a vehicle to challenge the application of the enhanced statutory minimum at Spigner\u2019s original sentencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (providing that \u201ca sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing,\u201d and that <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d) (emphasis in original). We affirm the denial of Spigner\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"ANr\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
