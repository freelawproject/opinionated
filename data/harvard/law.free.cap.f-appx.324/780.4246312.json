Prior to the instant appeal, Butler previously had appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his original application for \u00a7 3582(e)(2) relief, in case number OS-14961 <em>(\u201cButler </em>I\u201d), which this Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. After the mandate in <em>Btitler I </em>issued, on November 25, 2008, the district court <em>stia sponte </em>entered a second order denying Butler \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief after finding that he was sentenced as a career offender and that Amendment 706 did not reduce his guideline range. Butler now appeals from the district court\u2019s November 25 order, and two issues are before us: (1) the government\u2019s claim that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order <em>sua sponte </em>denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief; and (2) Butler\u2019s claim that the district court erred in refusing to reduce his sentence, on grounds that <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided and that the district court had discretion, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reduce his sentence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-23\">We review the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court <em>de novo. See Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">First, we reject the government\u2019s claim that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the November 25 order <em>sua sponte </em>denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to the consideration of cases and controversies, or, stated differently, cases that have not become moot. U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; <em>see also United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 288, 172 L.Ed.2d 150 (2008). Mootness is jurisdictional, and a case is not moot if the court has the ability to give the party meaningful relief. <em>Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">A district court has subject matter jurisdiction, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, if his sentencing range has been lowered by a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201cupon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on [the court\u2019s] own motion.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326 (noting that a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201con its own motion\u201d under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The record here reveals that the district court had jurisdiction to enter its November 25 order denying Butler relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Because Butler is still incarcerated, the issue of a sentence reduction was not moot, <em>see Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d at 1189, and under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider a reduction on its own motion, as it did here, <em>see Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1326.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">We likewise find no merit in Butler\u2019s argument the district court erred in refusing to reduce his sentence. As noted above, a district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Butler\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. In <em>Moore, </em>we held that career offenders whose guideline ranges are not affected by Amendment 706, such as Butler, are not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. In addition, contrary to Butler\u2019s assertion, <em>Booker </em>did not give the district court the discretion to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reduce his sentence in this case. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent jurisdictional basis for an ineligible defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>dant to receive a reduction). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">. We note that, because the district court previously denied Butler relief under Amendment 706 and that decision was final, in light of our dismissal of his related appeal in <em>Butler I, </em>the non-jurisdictional law-of-the-case doctrine may settle the issue of whether Butler was entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief in this case. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997) (discussing the law-of-the-case doctrine); <em>see also Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 48 n. 7, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (noting that \u201c[l]aw-of-the-case principles are not a bar to this Court's jurisdiction\u201d). However, because the parties do not expressly address this issue, we next proceed to discuss why Butler's substantive arguments are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
