On appeal, Edwards argues the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the guideline range because, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his range was merely advisory. Additionally, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district court erred by not considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a consecutive state sentence he served, his post-sentencing rehabilitation, and the disparity between powder and crack cocaine sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-22\">In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-23\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This authority is limited to those Guideline amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 that \u201chave the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 713 made Amendment 706, which is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Amendment 706 reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Therefore, a district court has discretion to reduce the sentence of a defendant whose sentencing range has been lowered by Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Any sentencing reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Commission\u2019s policy statements direct that a defendant is not entitled to a full resentencing during \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Section lB1.10(b)(2) also provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">(2) <em>Limitations and Prohibition on Extent of </em>Reduction.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">(A) <em>In General. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">(B) <em>Exception. </em>\u2014 If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate. However, if the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a further reduction generally would not be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">We recently held that a district court does not have the authority pursuant to <em>Booker </em>or its progeny to reduce in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context a defendant\u2019s sentence in a manner inconsistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190,-(11th Cir.2009). In <em>Melvin, </em>we concluded that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings and, therefore, the district court does not have the authority to sentence below the amended guideline range in resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014\u2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cFirst, the court must substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). Second, \u201cthe court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it \u201ccommits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Although the record does not indicate that the district court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in granting the sentence reduction, the district court sentenced Edwards to the minimum term permitted by the amended guideline range. In accordance with <em>Melvin, </em>the district court was not permitted to reduce Edwards\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range. Accordingly, we decline to review the reasonableness of Edwards\u2019s new sentence, and we affirm the 210-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
