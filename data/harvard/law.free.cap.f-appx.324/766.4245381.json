His motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines, which reduced certain base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">Barker pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of crack cocaine, in violation 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii). In preparing the pre-sentencing investigation report, the probation officer determined that Barker had a base offense level of 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3) and (c)(7). Barker\u2019s total offense level became 25 after the probation officer applied a 2-level enhancement for obstruction of justice and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The probation officer determined that Barker had a criminal history category of III which, when coupled with his offense level of 25, gave him an applicable guideline range of 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the probation officer found that Barker was subject to the statutory mandatory minimum penalty of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), which became his \u201cguideline sentence,\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">Before sentencing, the government filed a motion advising the court that Barker had provided substantial assistance to the government, entitling him to a reduction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The court adopted the PSI, granted the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and sentenced Barker to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Barker, through counsel, filed the present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, asserting that the court had authority to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706. Specifically, he argued that he was eligible for a sentencing reduction because, \u201cwhile his <em>guideline sentence </em>may have been the mandatory minimum of 10 years, his <em>sentencing range </em>has changed from that of 70 to 87 months to 57 to 71 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The district court denied Barker\u2019s motion. The court explained that Barker was not eligible for a sentencing reduction because \u201capplication of the guideline amendment results in no change to his sentencing range. Defendant was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, which determined his sentencing range. Because Defendant\u2019s sentencing range remains the same under the amended guidelines, he is not eligible for a reduction.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which similarly provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that a sentencing reduction is not permitted where the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">On appeal, Barker repeats the same general argument advanced in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, namely, that he was eligible for a sentencing reduction because Amendment 706 reduced his underlying guideline range. However, this argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008). In that case, we held that a defendant whose sentence is based on the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, rather than the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, and who receives a downward departure is ineligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1342 (\u201cBecause Williams was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaced his original sentencing guideline range, he was not sentenced according to the base offense level in \u00a7 2D1.1, even taking into account the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure. He thus would not fall within the scope of Amendment 706.\u201d). Accordingly, Barker was not eligible for a sentencing reduction, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
