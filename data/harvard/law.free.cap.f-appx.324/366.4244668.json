By filing such a motion, McHenry is challenging the district court\u2019s certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a), that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act requires a prisoner to exhaust his administrative remedies before he may file a \u00a7 1983 suit against prison officials. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir.2004). We review de novo a district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>Walker v. Epps, </em>550 F.3d 407, 410 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">With them motion for summary judgment, the defendants presented evidence that McHenry failed to complete the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s grievance process with regard to any of the grievances he submitted complaining of the events underlying his \u00a7 1983 complaint. McHenry presented nothing in district court, either in his response to the summary judgment motion or in his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion, to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he had exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">For the first time on appeal, McHenry has submitted copies of Step 1 and Step 2 grievances that he contends he submitted to prison authorities. McHenry argues that prison authorities interfered with his attempts to exhaust his administrative remedies by improperly returning the documents unprocessed. We \u201cwill not ordinarily enlarge the record on appeal to include material not before the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Flores, </em>887 F.2d 543, 546 (5th Cir.1989). In any event, the documents do not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether McHenry exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90-91, 93-94, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006) (holding that a prisoner must comply with all procedural rules to exhaust his administrative remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">McHenry has not established that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Thus, he has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a). McHenry\u2019s request for IFP status is denied. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution McHenry that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
