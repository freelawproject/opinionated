Weir pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of forty-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Weir argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which clarified which misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted in determining a defendant\u2019s criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). He also argues that the district court should reconsider his advisory sentencing guidelines range in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). This court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">The Sentencing Commission has stated in \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2) that unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(e). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court correctly denied Weir\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">Insofar as Weir argues that he is entitled to a reduction of his sentence because Amendment 709 is a clarifying amendment, this court has held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996). Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, the denial of the motion is AFFIRMED. Weir\u2019s motion for an eviden-tiary hearing and appointment of counsel for the purpose of oral argument are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
