Balcom contends that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion was error because the court should have treated the guidelines as advisory in his case under the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007); and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). He also argues that the court should have reevaluated his career-offender status because of Amendment 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-19\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment where a defendant has been sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-20\">A defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because the amendment would not lower the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (denying a reduction for defendant subject to career offender statutory minimum), cert. <em>denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(A) (noting that a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>dant is not eligible for a reduction if \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of [a] statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A6y\">The district court correctly denied Balcom\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 706 did not lower the guideline range that determined his sentence. Because his initial guideline range was below the statutory minimum, his guideline range became the statutory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (stating that \u201cwhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence\u201d). Thus, the term of life imprisonment he received was based not on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him but on the statutory mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a defendant sentenced the to statutory minimum was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 had no affect on his statutory minimum term of imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae1t\">Balcom\u2019s argument that Amendment 709 supports his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion also fails because that amendment is not included in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), and therefore it is not retroactively applicable. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that \u201camendments claimed in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions may be retroactively applied <em>solely </em>where expressly listed under \u00a7 lB1.10(c)\u201d). This is true even if we were to consider Amendment 709 as a \u201cclarifying\u201d one. <em>See id. </em>(noting that clarifying amendments, which are typically retroactive in the Eleventh Circuit, \u201cmay only be retroactively applied on direct appeal of a sentence or under a \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AXZ\">Balcom\u2019s final argument that the reasoning in Booker, <em>Kimbrough, </em>and Gall supports reducing his sentence is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009). <em>See id. </em>at 1192-93 (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to original sentencing proceedings and do \u201cnot address motions to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d). Although <em>Melvin </em>did not decide whether Gall applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, we conclude that it does not for the same reason we determined <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>did not in <em>Melvin: </em>because <em>Gall </em>involved an original sentencing proceeding under \u00a7 3553 and not a motion to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3852(c)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"Ava\">The district court did not err in denying Balcom\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aty\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-16\">. Balcom also filed a motion to file his reply brief out of time. Because the government does not oppose Balcom\u2019s motion, it is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
