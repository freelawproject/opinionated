The district court granted De La 0 a certificate of appealability on his claim that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by excluding the testimony of his DNA expert, Dr. Paul Goldstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Federal habeas relief may not be granted upon any claim that was \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court\u201d unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) &amp; (2); <em>see Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and rulings on issues of law de novo. <em>Hardeman v. Quarterman, </em>516 F.3d 272, 274 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">A state court\u2019s evidentiary rulings justify the granting of habeas relief only if they violate a specific constitutional right or render the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Johnson v. Puckett, </em>176 F.3d 809, 820 (5th Cir.1999). Even if an evidentiary ruling is found to be a constitutional violation, the applicant must show actual prejudice; i.e., that the trial error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In determining whether an erroneous evidentiary ruling had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict, we consider the following: (1) the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony; (2) whether the testimony was cumulative; (3) whether there was evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony; and (4) the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>Cupit v. Whitley, </em>28 F.3d 532, 539 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">The highest state court to consider this claim ruled that the exclusion of Dr. Gold-stein\u2019s testimony was erroneous but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>De La 0 was not entitled to relief because he had not shown a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict due to the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>De La O v. State, </em>127 S.W.3d 799, 803-04 (Tex.App.2003). The district court denied De La O\u2019s claim on the ground that the state court\u2019s denial of the claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Although the record shows that the testimony of Dr. Goldstein was at least somewhat important and that his testimony was not cumulative, \u201cthe strength of the prosecution\u2019s case is probably the single most important factor in determining whether the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Cupit, </em>28 F.3d at 539. The prosecution\u2019s case was very strong even in the absence of the DNA evidence. The victim\u2019s testimony painted a haunting picture of repeated and escalating sexual abuse committed by De La O. She testified that De La O provided her with gifts, money, cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. The victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by photographs showing her and De La O in compromising positions wearing little clothing. One photograph showed them kissing. Other photographs showed the victim smoking and drinking with De La O. De La O\u2019s daughter admitted that she told a friend and a school counselor that she thought the victim was De La O\u2019s girlfriend,- and she admitted that the victim would sleep in De La O\u2019s room. De La O\u2019s daughter conceded that the victim would pull up her shirt and pull down her pants around De La O, that the victim and De La 0 would spend time together alone in his room, and that the victim drank alcohol provided by De La O.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Given the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, De La 0 has not shown that the exclusion of Dr. Goldstein\u2019s testimony had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 539-42. De La 0 has not shown that the state court\u2019s finding of harmless error was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
