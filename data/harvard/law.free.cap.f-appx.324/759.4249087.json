On appeal, Delaney, who was sentenced under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, concedes that our precedent forecloses his argument, but, in order to preserve the issue, argues that the district court erred in denying his motion. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission has noted that a defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction where an \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering [his] applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">As Delaney concedes, his argument is foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009). Because Delaney\u2019s sentencing range was calculated under the career-offender provisions in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug quantity table in \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Delaney\u2019s sentencing range, and, thus, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
