He also moves for transcripts and the reporter\u2019s record at the Government\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-22\">On March 6, 2007, the Court issued a judgment dismissing Corral\u2019s direct appeal (no. 06-51554), reasoning that his notice of appeal did not evince an intent to appeal from any action of the district court. The judgment issued as the mandate on that same date. Because no extraordinary circumstances are presented by Corral\u2019s second attempt to directly appeal his guilty-plea conviction and sentence, the Court declines to recall the mandate in appeal no. 06-51554. 5th Cir. R. 41.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-23\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the motions filed by Corral are DENIED as moot, and the instant appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
