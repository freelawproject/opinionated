Based on Ford\u2019s motion to reduce her sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) due to the crack cocaine amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court reduced the aggregate sentence of 324 months to 262 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On June 24, 2008, Ford filed a pro se \u201cmotion to revisit sentencing in the interest of justice under newly defined law of the \u00a7 U.S.S.G.\u201d Ford asserted that her prior convictions did not qualify her as a career offender. The district court denied the motion as an unauthorized motion. On appeal, Ford has not shown a jurisdictional basis for her motion to revisit. Because Ford has appealed an unauthorized motion, we dismiss the appeal on the basis that the district court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
