First, Petitioners challenge the December 13, 2007 Order affirming and adopting the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying the Petitioners\u2019 application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT relief\u2019).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, the Petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s May 23, 2008 Order denying their motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-20\">First, the substance of the Petitioners\u2019 arguments on appeal challenges the BIA\u2019s December 13, 2007 Order adopting and affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. \u201cWe review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\" Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1373 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), in order to review a final order of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days after the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>of the order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). \u201c[The finality of a removal order] is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537.</p>\n<p id=\"AVUg\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal issued on December 13, 2007. The BIA\u2019s December 13, 2007 Order, affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, was a final order of removal. The Petitioners, however, did not file their petition for review until June 23, 2008, more than 30 days later. Thus, their petition as to the December 13, 2007 Order was not timely and, as such, we lack jurisdiction to review any issues resulting from alleged errors in that Order.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Tk\">Second, the Petitioners expressly challenge the May 23, 2008 Order denying their motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"A-T\">The Petitioners have abandoned any challenge to the denial of their motion for reconsideration because they advance no arguments in their brief regarding the May 23, 2008 Order, save a reference to it in the \u201cStatement of Jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (providing that an argument is deemed abandoned on appeal when not raised in the initial brief). Rather, the Petitioners\u2019 entire argument focuses on their underlying asylum and withholding of removal claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQIv\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, the Petitioners\u2019 petition is dismissed in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Arc\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-14\">. The Petitioners challenge only the BIA\u2019s Order affirming the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, not CAT relief. <em>See </em>Br. of Pet'r at 11 (''Statement of the Issue\"). As such, they have abandoned their claim for CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\"When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-22\">. The Petitioners reference the May 23, 2008 Order in the \"Statement of Jurisdiction\" in their brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"At0\">. Because the BIA\u2019s May 23, 2008 Order denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider is a separate final order, and because they filed the petition for review within 30 days of that Order, we have jurisdiction to review that Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A4Iq\">. Nonetheless, the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
