He argues that the within-guidelines sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable because the sentence is greater than necessary to fulfill the sentencing purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Relying on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he argues that the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is flawed because it is not empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">Regardless of whether a \u201cparticular Guideline is ... empirically-based,\u201d this court \u201cpresume[s] a sentence within the current version of the Guidelines to be reasonable, and the defendant must rebut that presumption to demonstrate substantive unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009). The district court imposed the 77-month sentence after commenting on Vasquez\u2019s continued disregard for the law after his last illegal reentry conviction. Given the district court\u2019s commentary, it cannot be said that the court failed to consider the factors of Section 3553(a). Vasquez has not rebutted the presumption that his sentence is reasonable. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
