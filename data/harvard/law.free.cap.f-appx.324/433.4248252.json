Rodriguez pleaded guilty to two counts of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. He was sentenced to 78 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Rodriguez completed his prison term and began serving his term of supervised release. The Government then sought to revoke Rodriguez\u2019s supervised release, alleging that Rodriguez had violated the condition that he not use a controlled substance. Rodriguez now appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-24\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s revocation decision for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cWhere there is an adequate basis for the district court\u2019s discretionary action of revoking [supervised release], the reviewing court need not decide a claim of error as to other grounds that had been advanced as a cause of revocation.\u201d <em>United States v. McCormick, </em>54 F.3d 214, 219 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995)(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-25\">Rodriguez\u2019s admitted use of cocaine on three occasions were each a sufficient ground for the district court\u2019s discretionary revocation of Rodriguez\u2019s supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>see also McCormick, </em>54 F.3d at 219 &amp; n. 3. Rodriguez does not contend that the district court was without authority to revoke under \u00a7 3583(e)(3) for his admitted use of cocaine. Accordingly, he is deemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Rodriguez\u2019s assertion that the district court failed to state any reasons for invoking its discretionary authority under \u00a7 3583(e) is belied by the record. Because the district court properly exercised its discretion to revoke Rodriguez\u2019s supervised release under \u00a7 3583(e), Rodriguez\u2019s arguments regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ing the applicability of \u00a7\u00a7 3583(g)(1) and (4), which were not the basis of the motion to revoke premised on Rodriguez\u2019s admitted use of cocaine, are irrelevant. <em>See McCormick, </em>54 F.3d at 219 &amp; n. 3. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED and its motion for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
