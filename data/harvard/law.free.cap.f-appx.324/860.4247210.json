The district court found that Amendment 706 applied to McKay, and reduced his original 387-month high-end guideline range sentence of imprisonment to a high-end amended guideline range sentence of 322 months. On appeal, McKay argues that the district court erred in determining the extent of his sentence reduction because it did not consider his request for a sentence below the amended guideline range and it failed to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who [was] sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, a district court must engage in a two-part analysis. \u201cInitially, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Next, the court must decide, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and in its discretion, whether it will impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">If the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under the first part of the analysis, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors under the second part of the analysis, regardless of whether it ultimately denies or grants the defendant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir. 2009). Still, the district court need not specifically articulate the applicability of each factor, \u201cas long as the record as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not err in rejecting McKay\u2019s request for a below-amended guideline range sentence because it lacked the authority to do so. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (2008) (stating that, generally, the court \u201cshall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that the district court erred in sentencing the defendant below the amended guideline range in violation of the applicable guidelines policy statements), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664). Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the district court took into account the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the extent of McKay\u2019s sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that the record demonstrated that the district court took into account the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors when the court briefly stated that it had reviewed the government\u2019s brief, and in its brief, the government had set out the pertinent factors and enumerated facts relevant to the factors). Accordingly, we affirm McKay\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
