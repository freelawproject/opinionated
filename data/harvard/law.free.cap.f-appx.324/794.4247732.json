The district court sentenced Jones within the amended guideline range, but Jones requested a further reduction of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac_\">The district court was not required to grant Jones a greater reduction of sentence. Jones argues that the record is insufficient to determine whether the district court applied <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1191-93 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam); United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (Mar.2008). Jones also argues that the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors, but the record establishes that the district court considered the sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">Jones\u2019s modified sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
