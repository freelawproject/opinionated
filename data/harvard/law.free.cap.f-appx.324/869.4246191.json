On appeal, Troup argues, through counsel, that the district court erred by finding that it could not reduce his sentence below the amended guideline range, as (1) <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), (2) \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is ambiguous as to which policy statements it refers, and (3) when read to mean that a district court cannot sentence below the amended guideline range, \u00a7 1B1.10 presents separation of powers concerns and violates <em>Kimbrough </em>and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991(b)(1), which requires the Sentencing Commission establish policies that assure that the purposes of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">In response, the government moves for us to dismiss the appeal due to a valid appeal waiver contained in Troup\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in \u00a7 IB 1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We review sentencing issues not raised before the district court for plain error. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). For us to correct an error under plain error review, there must be \u201c(1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights (which usually means that the error was prejudicial), and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Mangaroo, </em>504 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir. 2007). An error is not \u201cplain\u201d if the explicit language of a statute or rule does not resolve the issue, and neither the Supreme Court nor we have precedent directly resolving the issue. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The government\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal due to a valid appeal waiver contained in Troup\u2019s plea agreement is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The district court did not err in finding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>did not authorize it to sentence Troup below the amended guidelines. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>do not apply at resentencing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)). Additionally, the district court did not plainly err by not <em>sua sponte </em>finding \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ambiguous, or by not declaring \u00a7 1B1.10 invalid, as neither we nor the Supreme Court have held \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ambiguous or declared \u00a7 1B1.10 invalid. <em>See Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1322. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
