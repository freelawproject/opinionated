Buckius was indicted for failing to register as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a). Buckius moved to dismiss the indictment, and, after hearing argument, the district court declared 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250 facially unconstitutional, dismissed the indictment, and ordered Buckius released \u201c[f]or the reasons stated in this Court\u2019s Order filed on April 18, 2008 in <em>United States v. </em>Powers,\u201d 544 F.Supp.2d 1331 (M.D.Fla.2008). On appeal, the Government argues the district court erred in holding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a) facially unconstitutional as an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. Buckius argues, as an alternative ground to affirm, he cannot be prosecuted under SORNA because his travel occurred prior to the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity determination. We first address Bucki-us\u2019s alternative argument regarding the timing of his travel, then we address the constitutionality of SORNA issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">On March 5, 2008, a grand jury charged that Buckius \u201cdid knowingly fail to register and update a registration\u201d as required by SORNA between October 2006 and February 2008. The indictment alleges at some point in or about October 2006, Buckius traveled from Ohio to Florida. Buckius argues he cannot be prosecuted under SORNA because his travel occurred prior to the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity determination on February 28, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In <em>United States v. Dumont, </em>555 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2009), the defendant was prosecuted after the Attorney General\u2019s retroactivity determination, and his indictment covered the period \u201cfrom in or about February 15, 2007, continuing through on or about May 16, 2007.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. We concluded Dumont\u2019s obligation to register arose on February 28, 2007, and Dumont had three business days to fulfill this duty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\"><em>Dumont </em>applies here. Buckius\u2019s indictment covered the period through February 2008, and his obligation to register arose on February 28, 2007. Buckius failed to register within the following three business days, and was thus in violation of \u00a7 2250 as of March 6, 2008. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal cannot be affirmed on this alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">In <em>United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202 (11th Cir.2009), this Court held both the registration provisions set forth at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913 and the failure to register offense set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a) do not violate the Commerce Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1210-12. We concluded \u00a7 2250 falls within Congress\u2019s power to regulate \u201cboth the use of channels of interstate commerce and the instrumentalities of interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1210. We also concluded \u201cthe requirement that sex offenders register under \u00a7 16913 is necessary to track those offenders who move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\"><em>Ambert </em>controls here. The district court erred in dismissing the indictment against Buckius on the ground that SOR-NA exceeded Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the district court and remand for reinstatement of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
