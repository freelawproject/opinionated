Hale complains that the district court did not grant him a \u201ccomparable reduction\u201d under the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">Hale pleaded guilty in 1997 to conspiracy to distribute and the distribution of cocaine base within 1000 feet of a public school. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, 860. At the sentencing hearing, the district court determined that Hale had a base offense level of 36, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1 (1995), which the district court then increased by two levels for possession of a dangerous weapon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b), and reduced by two levels for Hale\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With a criminal history of VI, Hale\u2019s guideline range was between 324 and 405 months of imprisonment, but with three previous convictions for drug offenses, Hale faced a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for life. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). At the request of the government, the district court granted Hale a downward departure for his substantial assistance, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and sentenced Hale to 240 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">In 2008, Hale moved to modify his sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Hale argued that he was entitled to a two level reduction of his base offense level, which provided a sentencing range between 292 and 365 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (Supp. Nov. 1, 2007). Hale requested that the district court sentence him to 216 months of imprisonment. The government did not respond to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">The district court granted Hale\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 234 months of imprisonment. The district court determined that Hale\u2019s amended offense level was 35, his criminal history category was VI, the amended guideline range was between 292 and 365 months of imprisonment, and \u201c[t]he previous term of imprisonment imposed was less than the guideline range applicable to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>dant at the time of sentencing as a result of a departure or Rule 35 reduction, and the reduced sentence is comparably less than the amended guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\u201cIn a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 (11th Cir. 1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Hale\u2019s appeal fails because the only error of the district court favored Hale, and we cannot redress it. Hale was ineligible for a reduction of his sentence because he had been sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341\u201442 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). The government concedes that it failed to appeal or cross-appeal that error, and we may not <em>sua sponte </em>correct it. <em>See Greenlaw v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 2562, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">We AFFIRM Hale\u2019s reduced sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
