Because the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Zago\u2019s motion, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Zago, his wife, Silvia Luana Zago, and his two daughters, Andrea Carolina Zago and Alessandra Stephania Zago, were admitted to the United States as nonimmi-grant visitors. In March 2002, Zago, on behalf of himself, his wife, and their minor daughters, filed a timely application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Zago and his family sought relief based on their membership in a particular social group. Zago marked on his application that he had never belonged to or associated with a political party or other organization in Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Zago alleged in his application that he owned three bakeries in Lima, Peru, and was a upper middle class businessman. In 2000, a Peruvian terrorist group, Shining Path, left a letter at one of Zago\u2019s bakeries that contained papers mapping a route to his house, the floor plan of his daughters\u2019 private school, and routes to locations that his family frequented. The letter demanded that Zago pay Shining Path $50,000 and $900 monthly to assist their \u201carmed figfht].\u201d Zago reported the letter to the police, who advised him to hire private security. After Zago received additional letters and several threats in telephone calls and he and his wife were followed by suspicious vehicles, Zago hired three security guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Zago attached to his application four documents that supported his allegations: (1) a declaration from his mother, stating that the family left Peru because they were \u201cconstantly intimidated\u201d and she \u201cfelt that them lives ran danger\u201d; (2) a police report about its investigation of the threats; (3) a personal statement from Zago reciting the incidents that led his family to leave Peru; and (4) a declaration from Arnoldo Manuel Avila Espinoza, one of Zago\u2019s private security officers, that stated the officers had to protect the Zago family on two occasions. None of the documents referred to any political activity by Zago. The police report stated that the first letter from Shining Path said it was exacting money from Zago as the \u201cproduct of the share of war ... for the maintenance of [its] armed fight[,]\u201d and the failure to pay the money would lead to the \u201cexecution of a judgment of war against the traitors of the cause\u201d and end with \u201cexecution of the informer and that of [his] family.\u201d The report concluded that Zago had been targeted because he was a wealthy businessman and recommended that the police \u201cdetect\u201d and \u201ccounteract\u201d the threats that would be \u201cguarantee[d]\u201d to \u201call citizen requests!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">Zago also attached a written judgment by a Peruvian court entered on November 27, 2002, against three defendants for \u201cthe crimes of Terrorism, Kidnapping and Blackmail\u201d in violation of Peruvian criminal law. The judgment stated that the defendants were members of Shining Path and \u201cblackmailed and kidnapped many people ... in order to collect funds for their organization for subsequent resurgence.\u201d The judgment recited the attempted kidnapping of Zago and his wife, the subsequent investigation that led to the apprehension of the three defendants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>and the admission by the defendants that they targeted \u201cdifferent businessmen in the city\u201d to \u201ceoHect[ ] funds to satisfy their financial needs[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Before his evidentiary hearing, Zago submitted three other documents to support his application: a report submitted by the intelligence service to the Department of the Interior of Peru, four police reports, and a personal statement. The report of the intelligence service discussed the first extortion letter received by Zago and concluded that Zago had been \u201cselected as part of a businessman group in order to support the Shining Path terrorist armed struggle.\u201d The police reports recited language from four letters sent by Shining Path to Zago between late January and early April 2001. The letters stated: \u201cWe will kill you for default\u201d; \u201cA war judgment will be executed against traitors\u201d; \u201cThe quota payment is demanded\u201d; and \u201cYou are demanded to pay for the armed struggle subjection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In his statement, Zago provided further details about the first letter he received from Shining Path and the events that led Zago and his family to leave Peru. The demand letter stated that Zago \u201cbelonged to the oligarchy and so [he] was selected ... to contribute to the armed fight[.]\u201d Zago alleged that he discussed the matter with friend Walter Garces Gilardi, the Under-chief of Navy Intelligence, who cautioned him that the threat was genuine. Zago stated that he hired private security to protect him and his family, and his personal servants intercepted telephone calls that \u201cmade reference to the communist party\u201d and threatened to kill Zago \u201clike a dog\u201d if he did not \u201ccontribute to the party and the armed fight.\u201d Zago stated that he left Peru for a month, at which point the telephone calls \u201ccalmed down,\u201d but the callers stated they knew Zago had \u201cleft the country and asked if [he] would bring the money.\u201d After he returned, a group blocked Zago\u2019s route home and returned gunfire from Zago\u2019s security guards. When Zago left for the United States, his wife and daughters moved to the home of his wife\u2019s sister. Later, as Zago\u2019s wife and daughters drove to a family beach house, \u201ctwo cars with tinted windows tried to block their way,\u201d and his wife and daughters escaped when the security guards \u201cuse[d] their weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The government submitted a Profile of Asylum Claims from the State Department. The profile estimated that five percent of applications for asylum were filed by individuals who alleged that their \u201cmembership in the wealthy business and/or land-owning class puts them at particular risk from the Shining Path ... terrorist group[ ].\u201d The profile explained that \u201c[c]areful review of such applications often reveals that the terrorists\u2019 motivation in such attacks or mistreatment is aimed at extortion or ransom to finance their activities.\u201d The profile recommended that the victims relocate within Peru because \u201cthe threat in almost all such cases is localized in nature and the terrorists have little, if any, ability to track victims from one part of the country to another[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">At the hearing, Walter Garces Gilardi testified about his conversation with Zago and his recommendation that Zago contact the police. Garces stated that Shining Path threatened Zago because \u201che had money.\u201d When asked if that was the reason Shining Path targeted Zago, Garces responded that Zago \u201calso sold bread to the Navy ... [a]nd he collaborated with the local police.\u201d Garces opined that conditions had worsened in Peru since Zago fled; Zago could not relocate because Shining Path was a countrywide organization; and because Zago was a target of Shining Path, he would be killed if he returned to Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Zago testified that he was attacked because of his wealth and \u201chis social position in Peru within society.\u201d Zago explained that he was invited to public events at which political figures were present because he worked with \u201cthe municipality providing the bread to the schools[,]\u201d \u201cthe Navy,\u201d and with \u201cinternational\u201d companies \u201clike Nestle.\u201d Zago testified that \u201cas far as [he] kn[e]w, through [his] associations, several businessmen were going through the same situation.\u201d Zago knew of one \u201cperson\u201d who had \u201crequested] asylum in Chile[ ] [a]nd when he returned to spend Christmas in Peru, he was assassinated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">The immigration judge granted Zago asylum. The immigration judge ruled that Zago had \u201ccrossed the minimum threshold to establish that this is not merely an extortion case, but that the Shining Path does in fact have the intention to persecute [Zago and his family] for a little bit more than extortion, but rather, because they were members of the business community and also because of their refusal to cooperate with them and their denouncing these acts to the authorities.\u201d The immigration judge concluded that Zago and his family \u201cbec[a]me targets based on political opinion.\u201d The immigration judge found that Zago was a \u201cprominent business owner[ ] in Lima, who had ties to the government because of [his] way of making business with particular government entities\u201d that \u201cwas obviously well-known to the Shining Path, who singled [him] out, not only for war tax, but also ... to make [him] an example of [the] re-strengthening movement\u201d and Zago was \u201ctargeted\u201d because \u201cthat would easily provide an example to other business owners.\u201d The immigration judge ruled that Zago was eligible for asylum \u201cbecause of membership in a particular social group and because of also imputed political opinion for [his] refusal to cooperate with the terrorist group Shining Path.\u201d The immigration judge declined to address whether Zago was eligible for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The government appealed to the Board. The government argued that Zago was not eligible for asylum because he did not prove that he was targeted for criminal extortion, rather than on account of a protected ground. The government contended that Zago\u2019s membership in the business community did not qualify as a \u201cparticular social group\u201d and that Shining Path pursued Zago, not because of his political opinion or activities, but instead to further its own political objectives. The government argued that Zago did not establish he had well-founded fear of future persecution because the government of Peru was fighting Shining Path; Zago\u2019s extended family remained in Peru unharmed; and Zago\u2019s wife and daughters had not been harmed after he left Peru.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The Board sustained the appeal by the government and ruled that Zago and his family were not entitled to asylum because \u201cthe harm they fear is not due in part to a statutorily protected ground.\u201d The Board found that Zago and his family were \u201ctargeted because of their perceived wealth and [Zago\u2019s] social position as a successful businessman\u201d and not because of \u201ctheir political opinions\u201d or \u201cbased upon their membership in a particular social group.\u201d The Board concluded that \u201cwealthy businessmen and their families are not the kind of group\u201d that the Immigration Act protects, nor do they share a \u201ccommon, immutable chai\u2019acteristic,\u201d because its members \u201cwould manifest a plethora of different lifestyles, interest, cultures and political opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Zago moved the Board to reconsider. Zago argued that the Board focused improperly on his wealth; excluded evidence about his connections to the Peruvian gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>eminent; and reviewed <em>de novo </em>the decision of the immigration judge. Zago asserted that he was targeted based on a political opinion imputed by Shining Path and because of his prominence as a businessman. The Board denied Zago\u2019s motion because Zago and his family \u201craise[d] essentially the same arguments as were raised on appeal\u201d and the Board \u201cremain[ed] unpersuaded by [those] arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">After Zago petitioned this Court for review, the government requested that we remand the case for the Board to clarify what standard of review it applied to the findings of fact and legal conclusions of the immigration judge. We granted the motion. We vacated the order that denied Zago\u2019s motion to reconsider and \u201cremand[ed] for reconsideration in light of the Board\u2019s scope of review under 8 CFR \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i)[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">On remand, the Board explained that its ruling was \u201cconsistent with [its] limited scope of review.\u201d The Board stated that it reviewed the findings of fact of the immigration judge for clear error and reviewed <em>de novo </em>the decision \u201cas to whether the facts demonstrate harm that rises to the level of persecution and whether the harm was inflicted \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground.... \u201d The Board found no error in its \u201cprevious determination which, although different from the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusion, was nevertheless based on the facts presented and represented a legal conclusion that [Zago and his family] failed to establish the requisite nexus for asylum and withholding of removal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The issue before us is whether the Board abused its discretion when it denied Zago\u2019s motion to reconsider, not whether the Board erred when it sustained the appeal by the government and entered a final order of removal. An alien must petition for review of an order of removal \u201cno[ ] later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The Board ordered Zago removed on May 23, 2006 and, although Zago filed a motion to reconsider within thirty days, Zago\u2019s motion did not toll the deadline for filing a petition for review of the earlier order, <em>see Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Zago did not file a petition within thirty days of the final order of removal. Zago filed his petition for review within thirty days of the order that denied his motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Zago challenges the denial of his motion to reconsider on two grounds. First, Zago argues that the Board reviewed the decision of the immigration judge under an incorrect standard of review. Second, Zago argues that the Board ignored evidence that Shining Path targeted him based on an imputed political opinion that he supported the Peruvian government' and based on his membership in a particular social group of Peruvian businessmen. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">The Board did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Zago\u2019s argument that the Board had applied an erroneous standard of review. After the removal from this Court, the Board reviewed the findings of fact by the immigration judge for clear error and \u201cquestions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>from decisions of immigration judges de novo.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3). The Board explained that it had relied on the facts found by the immigration judge and reached a different legal conclusion about whether those facts established that Zago was persecuted on account of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The Board did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Zago\u2019s argument that the Board had ignored evidence that he had been persecuted based on an imputed political opinion. The Board was entitled to conclude that Zago was a victim of extortion. Shining Path never accused Zago of adverse political activities or demanded that he terminate government contracts or cease his affiliation with government politicians. <em>See Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 821-22 (11th Cir.2007). Shining Path referred to Zago as a member of the \u201coligarchy\u201d and as a \u201ctraitor,\u201d but these terms were interpreted by Zago and the Peruvian authorities to refer to Zago\u2019s elite social status as a successful businessman, not to any political activities. This interpretation was consistent with the report of the State Department that Shining Path extorted wealthy businessmen because of their income.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The Board also did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Zago\u2019s argument that the Board ignored evidence that he had been persecuted based on his membership in a social group. We defer to the definition by the Board of \u201cmembership in a particular social group\u201d as persons who have an immutable characteristic or common trait such as sex, color, kinship, or, in some cases, shared past experiences such as land ownership or military service. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006) (deferring to the definition applied by the Board in <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985)). Based on this definition, the common characteristic that defines a social group \u201cmust be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233. The Board was entitled to conclude that Shining Path targeted Zago because he had access to large amounts of money, not because of any protected characteristic he shared with other Peruvian businessmen. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\u201c[Ejvidence that ... is consistent with ... the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas ... does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Zago asserted in his application and in his testimony that he was targeted because of his wealth and social interaction with government officials, not for any social welfare or political activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AIL\">Zago\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
