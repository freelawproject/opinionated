She appeals the imposition of a two-level enhancement to her base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i). Davis argues that \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i) is inapplicable because, in providing social security numbers assigned to others in making applications for disaster relief benefits with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, she did not use one means of identification to produce another means of identification. The commentary to the Sentencing Guidelines indicates that a bank loan account number qualifies as another means of identification that can be obtained unlawfully pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i). In light of the similarity between that example and the instant application of the guideline, we hold that the district court did not plainly err. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 9(C)(ii)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
