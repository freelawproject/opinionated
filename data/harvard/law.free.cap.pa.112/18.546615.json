P. Beard, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">The following facts were found by the Auditor, J. W. Smith, Esq.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-11\">A. P. Beard, the father of the wards, died May 6th, 1864. James Brown, the accountant, was appointed guardian February 21st, 1865. He received from Theron Beard, the administrator, the'sum of thirty-two dollars, and from the United States pension office, from December 2d, 1867, to March 17th, 1876, the sum of $1,307.28.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-12\">The law gave'to-the widow, and after her re-marriage to the minor children, $8 per month, and $2 per month additional for each child under the age of sixteen. The pension ceased when the wards arrived at the age of sixteen years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-13\">\u2022 Ida Beard was born December 28th, 1856, and reached the age of sixteen December 28th, 1872. Jesse Beard was born May 9th, 1860, and reached the age of sixteen May 9th, 1876. Jane P. Beard, the mother of the wards, was married to H. C. Hammond April 14th,' 1866, and died September 1st, 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-14\">The account of Theron Beard, the administrator, shows .that the $32 was all\u2019that he paid the guardian, the balance of the estate, which was small, having been paid over to- the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>widow, and any claim on this account is understood to be abandoned by exceptants. The family was left by the death of A. P. Beard in straitened circumstances, the inventory amounting to a little over five hundred dollars, and the real estate being only ten acres, of which about three acres were cleared, and the balance covered with logs, brush and stumps. On this there was a small board house and small barn. The family lived here for a year after the marriage of Mrs. Beard to Mr. Hammond, when they moved on to a farm of 42-| acres, which Mr. Hammond and his \u2018two brothers bought, and oil which they paid $300 hand money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\">The three brothers worked this farm, and their father\u2019s farm, as tenants or croppers, under their mother, in partnership for six or seven years, when they sold it, and Mr. Hammond moved on to another farm. In the meantime they built a house on the place, and when it was sold there was either $1,100 or $1,300 apiece realized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">The guardian made the contract with the mother, before the pension was received, that she should have it for the support of the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">He did this by the advice of the late Judge Derickson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">After her death he made the same bargain with the stepfather, with the addition that he was to have the use of the ten' acres for fencing, clearing, paying taxes, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">The children lived with their mother until she died, and with Mr. Hammond afterwards \u2014 Ida, until she was 18 years \u25a0old, and Jesse until he was nearly 16 years old, when E. E. Holmes was appointed his guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-9\">The children were kept and clothed as farmers\u2019 children usually were, and went to school summer and winter, whenever there was school. They did such chores and housework as children of their ages can do. The witnesses give Ida credit for being an exceptionally good girl to work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-10\">The testimony shows that the new fenee and the clearing of the land was worth as much as the rent would amount to during the time Mr. Hammond had the use of it. The only question arising on these faets for the decision of the Auditor is whether this agreement to pay, and the payment of the whole of the pension for the support of the wards, was reasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-11\">At the most it was $1.50 per week for each ward. Several witnesses testify that they think Ida earned her board and clothing by her work. Several witnesses testify that the board and clothing of such children at that time was worth $3 per week each, and that the labor of the older one, when not in sehool, was worth $1.50 per week. The guardian testifies that he could not have hired the children kept elsewhere for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>pension. Mrs. Brown, an aunt of the wards, testifies that she proposed on the death of Mrs. Hammond, to take the children and keep them. This offer was made to Hammond, and there-is no evidence that it was communicated to the guardian. Mrs. Brown, then Mrs. Craven, had no children of her own, and made the offer out of affection for the children of her deceased brother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-4\">Under all the facts in this case, the Auditor does not think the payments so clearly unreasonable, that the accountant should be surcharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-5\">There is no evidence of bad faith on his part. There is no doubt but that he paid over the money as fast as he received it, and he has accounted for every dollar that came into his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">The Auditor thinks that such a trustee, who has acted in .good faith and on the advice of reputable counsel, should not be surcharged for a mistake in judgment, as to what was a reasonable allowance for the support of his wards, except on clear and satisfactory evidence that the payments were grossly excessive. The Auditor is of the opinion that the evidence in this case is not sufficient to justify a finding either of fraud or of that gross negligence in the management of the estate which would authorize a surcharge against the accountant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-7\">The Auditor therefore recommends that the exceptions be dismissed and the account confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-8\">Exceptions were filed to this report, which were sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-9\">The court, Church, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-10\">I find myself unable to agree with the conclusions of the Auditor in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-11\">He reports that the case was submitted to him without argument, and this fact may have caused him to reach a conclusion different from what it might otherwise have been.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-12\">Inasmuch as the account must be referred back to the Auditor for readjustment and re-statement, (and this must be done for each ward separately and not jointly, as was heretofore done), it is necessary only that I give briefly the principles upon which the account must be stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-13\">When Hammond married the widow of Beard, the latter had two children by her former husband \u2014 minors of ten and eight years of age, respectively. By that act of Hammond, those minor children became the inmates of his household, as did the mother \u2014 they became members of his family. 'Especially ought this to be the case, when the new husband and father actually moved on to and lived upon the very farm owned by the children, left them by their own father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-14\">A man marrying the mother of minor children takes' the children along with the mother. The step-father stands as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>them <em>in loco parentis. </em>He is responsible for their maintenance and education so long as they continue to reside with him. The minor child receives shelter, food, clothing, and education, and in return gives to such parent whatever services physical and moral such child can give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">No device nor expedient can be successful, which will enable the minor child by a widowed mother to assume toward a second husband the attitude of a creditor for.services rendered \u2014or of a debtor for food and clothing: Lantz <em>v. </em>Frey, 14 State Rep., 201; Ruckman\u2019s Appeal, 61 State Rep., 258; Douglass\u2019 Appeal, 82 State Rep., 169; Duffey <em>v. </em>Duffey, 44 State Rep., 402, and cases therein cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">These principles show good law, good morals and good common sense, and to the facts in this case are particularly applicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">The step-father had actually gotten himself a home upon the children\u2019s land, but demanded for himself and his wife the pittance the children were entitled to receive from the government, earned by the life-blood of their own father; and we find a complaisant guardian bartering away their whole income to one who was entitled to claim it neither in law nor in morals. It is certainly true that' many guardians fall far short in their duty towards their wards. They seem to have very queer conception of the sacredness of their trust. As guardians they should guard. Thus their very name is indicative of their profession, or of what it should be. Much of this shortcoming arises from ignorance rather than from a wilful disregard of their duty. The advice of a discreet and judicious counselor-at-law should be called in to inform ignorance; yet even then for palpable mistakes the law must furnish the remedy, and if a counselor gives ill-advice, it is malpractice upon the latter\u2019s part, for which he may be held responsible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">For gross negligence or misconduct on the part of a trustee, the latter cannot excuse and free himself by the shield of a lawyer\u2019s advice. The Auditor\u2019s report mentions the name of the lawyer giving this guardian the advice, that he could use up all the children\u2019s income in paying their own mother and step-father for the support that the latter should have freely bestowed upon them. I do not find the name of the lawyer in the testimony, but he no doubt was named to the Auditor. Whoever it might be that gave this guardian this advice, it was very poor and worthless counsel, and cannot here be used as a cloak to cover up the gross negligence of this guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">If the guardian were permitted to contract for the support of his wards at all, and -lie certainly could except with the mother and step-father, he must make a reasonable contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Under the evidence in this case, even if we view the step-father as a stranger, the sum the guardian agreed to pay for the support of the children was most extravagant. The oldest child (the daughter) at least earned her own living. She worked for her step-father as if for her own father, and certainly earned her own board, lodging and clothing. Her education was free. The boy soon began to earn the same board, lodging and clothing for himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">The $3 per week received by this step-father, together with the work of the children, to say nothing of the use of the children\u2019s land, undoubtedly kept the whole family; and this especially after the death of the mother of the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">In view, therefore, of the evidence as to the relationship of the parties, the services rendered by the children, and the surrounding circumstances of the case generally, together with the law. on the subject, I am irresistibly drawn to the conclusion : First, that the step-father was bound to keep these stepchildren without any other reward or recompense than their services and labor rendered to him; second, that the guardian exceeded his power and authority in making the contract with the step-father as set up'in his account; third, that even if the first two propositions are not true, the actual contract made by the guardian was a most unreasonable and improvident one ; and the sum he agreed to pay for his wards\u2019 support was most extravagant, and a wanton waste of his wards\u2019 money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">Inasmuch as the money alleged to have been wasted came from the Federal Government in the form of pension, I am unable to state how much of the amount the guardian received belonged to the mother. I believe that which was received by the guardian after the mother\u2019s re-marriage belonged to the children exclusively. This will have to be separated from that which by law belonged to the children and widow mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-7\">The latter, <em>i. </em>e., that received by mother and children before her marriage, if any there was, was probably rightfully paid out by the guardian. The former, <em>i. e., </em>that which belonged to the children, exclusive of the mother, must be accounted for by the guardian according to the principles laid down in this opinion. And the whole matter is referred back to the Auditor to re-examine the case, and re-state an account of this accountant as guardian of each ward separately. The restatement to be made on notice to the parties interested, or their attorneys, and according to the principles herein enunciated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-8\">The matter of the rent of the children\u2019s farm was substantially withdrawn by exceptants in the argument, and I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>not adverted to it. It may be renewed if it seem good to tbe exceptants so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">Tbe several exceptions filed on behalf of the wards are sustained in so far as they are met by this adjudication; and the report and all matters connected therewith are. referred back to the Auditor to proceed as herein directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">The Auditor re-stated the account in conformity with the opinion of the court. The guardian filed exceptions to this which were dismissed and the report confirmed. To this decree this appeal was taken by the guardian, assigning for error the decree confirming the report of the Auditor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-8\"><em>W.

Cas., 226, it was held that if a husband educate a wife\u2019s child by a former husband, he cannot recover compensation from such child when it comes of age.\u201d This case is cited in Chitty on Contracts by Russell, 6th ed., pp. 48, 144, and he says in such case no recovery can be had, \u201cunless there be an express promise to repay him,\u201d which is also stated as the law in 1 Story on Contracts, \u00a7 82 f. There was here a contract to pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-9\">The second question raised by these appeals is, was the step-father of sufficient ability to support these wards. For, even if he was legally bound to support them and yet was not of sufficient ability, then the guardian was justified in making the agreement to pay for their support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-10\">An allowance will not be made to a father for the maintenance of his minor children unless it appears that he is unable to support them: Rhone\u2019s O.

See Act of 29th of March, 1832, P. L., 192.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">In Nicholson\u2019s Appeal, 8 Harris, <em>54, </em>Judge Black, delivering, the opinion, says: \u201cThough there is nothing before us which makes it necessary to believe that the appellant is other than a most conscientious and upright man, he seems to have utterly misunderstood his duty. It matters little to an orphan child whether his interests are sacrificed and his prospects blighted by well meaning ignorance or by wilful malice. Either is within the definition of misconduct, a word which applies not to the motive but the act.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-8\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"ABs\">delivered the opinion of the court, April 5th, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">If this decree is affirmed the appellant will have had a severe experience as a guardian# of minor children. He received in all for his two wards the sum of $1,339.28, of which $1,307.28 was pension money from the United States. All of this money was paid out by the guardian for the maintenance and education of the wards. The court below has surcharged him with the sum of $1,886.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">It was not denied that the money had been paid out as above stated; nor that it had been expended under a contract made by the guardian for the support of the children; but it was alleged that the contract and the payments thereunder were improvident. Upon this point the learned judge below says: \u201c The actual contract made by the guardian was a most unreasonable and improvident one, and the sum he agreed to pay for his wards\u2019 support was most extravagant, and a wanton waste of his wards\u2019 money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">This is strong language. The children appear to have been about eleven and eight years of age when their mother died, and they were left in the sole charge of their step-father. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>pension to which they were entitled was $12 per month until the elder child reached the age of sixteen, and $10 per month from that time until the younger child arrived at the age of sixteen, when it ceased. This pension money was applied by the guardian to the support of the children as long as it was received from the government. As near as I can come at it, the payments amounted to about $1.35 per week for the clothing and maintenance of each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">This sum does not impress us as being extravagant. Circumstances, however, may make it so. A brief statement of the facts is therefore necessary to a proper understanding of the case. A. P. Beard, the father, died in the army on May 6th, 1864, leaving a widow and two children, Ida and Jesse, the minors in question, aged seven and four years respectively. James Brown, the appellant, was appointed their guardian February 21st, 1865. The mother of the minors was married to one H. C. Hammond April 14th, 1866, and died September 1st, 1868. It was not denied that the death of Mr. Beard left the family in very destitute circumstances. They had a lot of about ten acres of land, three acres of which were tillable, the rest covered with stumps, logs and bushes, and practically without fences. The improvements were of little value ; very small, very poor, and very much out of repair. The guardian, acting under the advice .of counsel, paid the pension money over to the mother for their support, as fast as it was received, taking therefor the receipts of the wife and her second husband. When their mother died, the guardian made a similar arrangement with the step-father, and paid the money over to him. In addition the guardian allowed him to occupy the land and house rent free upon condition of fencing the land and putting the property in repair. The latter appears to have been done. The land in its improved condition, with fences put up and the logs and stumps removed, was worth from $12 to $20 per year. The children appear to have had a comfortable home; were suitably clothed, and were sent to school whenever the schools were open. When not at school, they did sueh chores about the place as children of their age are accustomed to do in country places.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">It was urged that the step-father could not charge for their support for two reasons, viz: 1st. He stood in <em>loco parentis </em>to the children, and 2d. That they earned their support while with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">It is conceded that if there had been no contract between the step-father and the guardian the step-father would not have been entitled to compensation. The law in such a case, under all the authorities, would not imply a contract or a uromise to pay. But there was a special contract. Was it so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>improvident that the guardian must be surcharged with all the money he paid under it with interest thereon ? We think not. The step-father was under no legal obligation to support these children after their mother\u2019s death. He could have sent them away and thrown them upon their guardian for support. He testifies that he was unable to support them without the pension money. The guardian may have thought that in keeping them in a comfortable home, where they would be kindly treated, properly clothed and educated, for the small sum he ]iaid, he was making a good bargain. At any rate he made it, and made it in good faith, and we are not prepared to say it \u201cwas most extravagant and a wanton waste of his wards\u2019 money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We'are not unmindful of the testimony in regard to the services of the children. The learned court and Auditor differ widely upon this point. The Auditor finds: \u201c The children were kept and clothed as farmers\u2019 children usually were, and went to school summer and winter, whenever there was school. They did such chores and housework as children of their ages can do. The witnesses give Ida credit for being an exceptionably good girl to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The learned judge toolca radically different view of it. He sa}'-s: \u201c The oldest child (the daughter) at least earned her own living. She worked for her step-father as if for her own father, and certainly earned her own board, lodging and clothing. Her education was free. The boy soon began to earn the same board, lodging and clothing for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">I have examined the evidence with some care, and am inclined to the Auditor\u2019s view of it. It must not be forgotten that for a considerable portion of the time the cost of clothing, and in fact all the necessaries of life was exceptionally dear. And we must take the opinions of persons who were not members of the household as to the value of the children\u2019s services with some grains of allowance. They might be worth more to some persons than to others. In a household where their services were actually needed they would be worth more than to a poor family who could dispense with such services. What might be an accommodation to some persons might be a burden to others. I apprehend few families in humble circumstances would be willing to take such children, feed them, clothe them and send them to school whenever the schools were open, for such services as such children would render.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">We do not think this guardian has so grossly mismanaged this trust as to incur the severe punishment inflicted upon him by the court below. He has acted according to his best light, under the advice of counsel, and in good faith. The fact that- an- aunt of the children offered to take them from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the step-father and support them, was not communicated to the guardian. That the latter might have saved some money for the children by binding them out as servants, is possible. He did not do so; he preferred to keep them in their home, where they would have a better chance to receive some education, and we are not prepared to say that in applying the money to their support which the government gave for that purpose he was misappropriating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The decree is reversed at the cost of the appellees ; the exceptions are sustained; the first report of the Auditor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
