To convert a deed, executed prior to the Act of June 8th, 1881, absolute on its face, into a mortgage by parol testimony, such testimony must be clear and specific, of a character such as will leave in the mind the Chancellor no hesitation or doubt; and failing in this, the effort to impeach the legal character of the deed must be regarded as abortive.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b470-13\">2. A mortgage is essentially a pledge or security, and it is distinguishable \u00f1-om a trust in this only, that the property described in it is to revert to the mortgagor on the discharge of die obligation for the performance of which it is pledged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b470-14\">8. Where the intent is merely to pass the property as a pledge for the payment of a debt, the transaction may be regarded as a mortgage; but not so when the grantee has the power to sell the premises, though the proceeds are to be applied on the indebtedness of the grantor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b470-15\">4. Where a mortgagor or .trustee is liable to account to three jointly \u2019 and not to either severally, a bill in equity for an account filed by one alone should be dismissed for want of proper parties.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b470-16\">March 25th, 1886.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AIP\">Before Mercur, C.

Subsequently on July 1st, 1871, plaintiff negotiated a sale to the Wilkesbarre Coal and Iron Company, of the breaker, improvements and personal property for $157,000; and after this there was due to Samuel Bonnell, Jr. but a comparatively small sum of money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">11.

D. 1876, in fraud of the- rights of the plaintiff, conveyed the land to the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-10\">XV. The plaintiff avers that the defendant has been fully paid with interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-11\">The plaintiff prays:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-12\">1. That an account be stated of all the moneys received by the -defendant, Bonnell, from the plaintiff, together with the rents, issues and profits arising from said tract of land and received by him, as well as of the several sums of money advanced by him to the plaintiff, or paid by him for his account, and that it be ordered and decreed that the balance due shall be paid by one to the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-13\">2.

During all this time no claim was made by plaintiff or notice given of any such title as he now sets up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-9\">The answer of the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company, avers want of knowledge of the truth of the second, third and fourth sections of the bill, but is informed and believes that the sixth and seventh sections are utterly false and untrue. The sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate on January 7th, 1871, was not a friendly sale by arrangement, but was entirely adverse and hostile. No arrangement respecting.it was made with the plaintiff...... \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-10\">2. The conveyance by Pettibone to Bonnell, was not made in the interest of the plaintiff, Bonnell did not take the bill in trust or as collateral security, or under any'agreement with t the plaintiff whatever, nor did he sign any deed of trust, etc., and as more than five years have elapsed since such alleged contract was made or equity or trust accrued, they claim the benefit from such lapse of time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-11\">8. The defendant the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company says: It is not true that the plaintiff negotiated a sale to the Wilkesbarre Coal and Iron Company on July 1st, 1871, of the breaker, improvements and machinery, but that said Bonnell, Jr., was or pretended to be possessed as of his own absolute property, and was or pretended to be in actual possession of the real estate purchased by him from Payne Pettibone, and of the personal property on the same, and the said Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company, believing that the said Samuel Bonnell, Jr. was so possessed and entitled, and that the said real and personal property were free from all trusts and incumbrances agreed with said Samuel Bonnell, Jr. for the purchase of the breaker, with the improvements, etc., and for a lease of the coal under the tract, and neither the Wilkesbarre Coal and Iron Company, nor Lehigh and Wilkes- \u2022 barre Coal Company, had notice nor knowledge of any right of the plaintiff in the premises,.....nor had it notice nor knowledge that Samuel Bonnell, Jr. held the premises as mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>gagee or as collateral security, or under agreement to re-convey the same to the plaintiff, his heirs or assigns upon repayment of any indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">4. And they further say that the Lehigh and Wilkesbarr\u00e9 Coal Company purchased the reversion of the said Samuel Bonnell, Jr., in the said tract of land, without notice of any claims or alleged claim upon the part of the plaintiff'in the premises, and believing that the defendant, Samuel Bonnell, Jr., was the owner of the legal and equitable title to said property, and the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company paid the consideration money mentioned in said deed without any notice of the trusts and purposes set up in said bill, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">5. Admits that Receivers were appointed, but denies that any notice was received by them of the claim that the title was held by Samuel Bonnell, Jr., in trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">The answer of Samuel Bonnell, Jr., says :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-7\">1. I have no knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s ownership in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">2. I have no knowledge concerning the several transactions alleged in paragraphs 3 and 4 of plaintiff\u2019s bill. No knowledge of conveyances by Pettibone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-9\">3. I did not make any agreement with plaintiff and Pettibone, or any other agreement to compromise certain differences.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-10\">4. I was a personal friend of plaintiff and of his father. The plaintiff never consigned any coal to me, in New York or elsewhere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-11\">5. I deny that about December, 1870, or at any time, I entered into an agreement as alleged in paragraph 6 of plaintiff\u2019s bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-12\">\u2022 6. I deny that agreement referred to in paragraph 7 was ever made or consummated; the rest of the statements are true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-13\">7. Denies paragraph 8 of bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-14\">8. I deny that the title to the said property was vested in me as mortgagee, or as collateral security for the repayment to me by the plaintiff of any sum of money alleged to have been advanced......Such statements are false and untrue. I took the said conveyance in my own absolute and individual right, the plaintiff having no right, title or interest whatsoever therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-17\">9 and 10. Denies 9 and 10 of bill.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-18\">\u2022 11. Asserts that lease to Lehigh and Wilksbarre Coal and Iron Company was made in his own right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-19\">12. I deny that plaintiff dealt with the coal companies in these transactions; and, also, I deny that I gave the said companies or either of them any notice that I held the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>as a mortgage, or as collateral security, etc., etc. Such allegations are utterly false and untrue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">13. ' Admits.sale of land February 29tb, 1876, to Lehigh and. Wilkesbarre Coal Company. I deny that any agreement whatever existed between the plaintiff and me concerning said tract of land. The title to said tract of land was properly vested in me as sole owner, and as such I sold the same to the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company, having no notice whatever of the plaintiff\u2019s pretended claim and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">14. I deny, as I have before denied, that I advanced any money to the plaintiff on account of said tract of land, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">The testimony is very voluminous, the documentary evidence alone being more than 150 pages, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony 322 printed pages, and the defendant\u2019s 370 pages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">To summarize the contention between the parties, the plaintiff claims that although the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company are vested with a title to the land, which upon its face and by all that appears of record is perfectly valid, that he is entitled to an equity of redemption because Samuel Bonnell, Jr., their grantor, was a mortgagee, and that they had notice of this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">The cause was referred to Charles B. McMichael, Esq., as Master, who, after reciting the contents of the bill and answers as above, reported the facts and his conclusions of law as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">1. That the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be dismissed for want of proper parties, because if there is any equity in the plaintiff\u2019s case William L. Lance. Sr., and Walter W. Lance are mutually interested with William L. Lance, Jr., in the re-conveyance of the land by the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company, and in the account to be stated by Samuel Bonnell, Jr.,' and should be joined as parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\">2. The allegation made by the plaintiff in paragraph 6 of his bill that Pettibone, Samuel Bonnell, Jr., -and the plaintiff agreed that Payne Pettibone should cause or procure the premises to be sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, is not sustained by the evidence, but on the contrary the Master reports that the sheriff\u2019s sale of January, A. D. 1871, was adverse and hostile to'the plaintiff and the other Lances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-13\">3. That there was no agreement made <em>by </em>Samuel Bonnell,' Jr., to re-convey the land to William L. Lance, Jr., the plaintiff, his heirs or assigns, or to any one else for him, either in writing, by parol, or necessarily implied from the surrounding circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-14\">4. That Samuel Bonnell, Jr., however else he may have held the land, did not hold it as mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-15\">5. That William L. Lance, Jr., is not entitled to redeem the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>lands, nor is any equity of redemption vested in him in his own right, or as trustee for any one else, nor is any equity of redemption vested in any one else for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">6. The Lehigh and Wilkesb\u00e1rre Coal Company were purchasers, <em>bona </em>fide, and for value without notice of any preexisting equi tie's.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">7.

From a resum\u00e9 of the law upon this subject, as drawn from all the cases, the test, whether a deed is or is not a mortgage, is the existence or non-existence of a debt. If after the transaction no debt remain, there is no mortgage. When the relation of debtor and creditor is created by the transaction, or previously existed, and l\u00bby express language or fair implication continues, and the possession is retained by the vendor, and the value of the property is greatly in excess of the consideration paid, the transaction is always held to be a mortgage: Sweetzer\u2019s Appeal, 21 P.

S., 268; Danzeizen\u2019s Appeal, 23 Id., 65; Boynton <em>v. </em>Housler, 23 Id., 453; Heath\u2019s Appeal, 4 Out., 1; Bispham\u2019s Equity, 154; Colwell <em>v. </em>Woods, 3 Watts, 197; Conway\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Alexander, 7 Cranch, 218; Shines <em>v. </em>Baird, 5 Wr., 264; Russel\u2019s Appeal, 3 Har., 322; Wilson <em>v. </em>Shoenberger, 7 Casey, 299; Houncker <em>v. </em>Merkey, 6 Out., 462; Hartley\u2019s Appeal, 7 Id., 23; Davis <em>v. </em>Stone-street, 4 Ind., 101; Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7\u00a7 275 and 329; Stoddard <em>v. </em>Whiting, 46 N.

The law does not require proof so convincing as to leave no doubt, or that the evidence should be uncontradicted ; it is enough if it satisfy an unprejudiced mind beyond reasonable doubt: Spencer <em>v. </em>Colt, 8 Norris, 314; Ott <em>v. </em>Oyer, 10 Out., 6-17; Hartley\u2019s Appeal, 7 Id., 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">The plaintiff should have been permitted to amend his bill as shown in his ninth assignment of error.

It may be admitted that there are many things apparent on a critical examination of the evidence which would seem to favor the contention of the appellant, but when the whole body thereof is considered together, such a conclusion is seen to be illusory. To convert a deed, absolute on its face, into a mortgage by parol testimony, such testimony must be clear and specific, of a character such as will leave in the mind of a chancellor no hesitation or doubt, and failing this, the effort to impeach the legal character of the deed must be regarded as abortive. A mortgage is essentially a pledge or security, and it is distinguishable from a trust in this only, that the property described in it is to revert to the mortgagor on the discharge of the obligation for the performance of which it was pledged: Allegheny Railroad &amp; Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Casey, 29 P. F. S., 84. So we have it said in Danzeizen\u2019s Appeal, 23 Id., 65, that where the intent is.merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>pass the property as a pledge for the payment of a debt, the transaction may be regarded as a mortgage, but not so when the grantee has the power to sell the premises, though the proceeds are to be applied on the indebtedness of the grantor. In this, of course, we say nothing as to the various methods which may be adopted for the purpose of foreclosure or extinguishment of the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption. This may be accomplished by a bill in equity, by a <em>scire </em>facias, or by agreement of the parties, as that the mortgagee shall have the power to sell on default of payment, or performance of the obligation, whatever that may be, which the mortgage was given to secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">This, however, affects not the character of the instrument itself, for if it be not a vadium or pledge, whether living or dead, it is not a mortgage. It must be accompanied with a defeasance, otherwise it is a deed absolute or in trust. If, therefore, the alleged oral defeasance has not been proved, if it appears that Bonnell was not' merely to hold the land conveyed as a pledge, but was to have the power to sell it for the purpose of paying the indebtedness of Lance to him, and the liens against the property, it is clear that the <em>prima facie </em>character of the. deed is unaffected, and the trust, if any, attaches to the proceeds. It would also follow, that if Bonnell had thus, in himself, the power to sell, his vendee, the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company, must be regarded as vested with an absolute estate, and cannot be obliged to account. But that he had such power the evidence clearly demonstrates. The letter from Bonnell to Lance, previous to the conveyance from Pettebone, setting forth his, Pettibone's proposition, and inquiring whether, in case of his purchase of the property, he could sell it for a sum not less than $300,000, of itself shows what Bonnell\u2019s intention was in the acquisition of the land in controversy, and this same intention is also expressed in his letter to Mr. McClintock. But that the design of all the parties was that Bonnell should carry the property on his own credit until he could dispose of it by an advantageous sale, is clear from their subsequent conduct. The proposition to the president of the Wilkesbarre Coal and Iron Company, -as contained in the letter of Bonnell and Lance, dated June 23d, 1871, and the consummation of that proposition by the conveyance to the said company of the breaker, houses, improvements, and personal property, together with a lease of the coal, executed by Bonnell and witnessed by W. W. and W. L. Lance, can be explained on no other hypothesis than that above stated. Beside this, we have from the testimony of W. W. Lance the fact that the deeds for the surface lots, sold by him, were sent to Bonnell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>for execution, so that, without reference to the disposition of the money derived from such sales, it is obvious that he was regarded as the owner of the fee, and as the only one who had power to convey it. Moreover, his power to mortgage the property to Pettibone for the purchase money has not been questioned; on the other hand it seems to have been recognized by all the parties as the exercise of a legitimate power on part of Bonnell, and if so, he must have been regarded as something more than a mere mortgagee. If, then, this man had the power to sell the improvements, lease the coal, the equivalent of a sale, to execute deeds for the surface land, and to mortgage the estate, we cannot understand by what process of reasoning he could be deprived of the power to sell the reversion. Under such circumstances as these the question of notice is of no importance, for if the power to convey was vested in Bonnell, notice to his vendee would not reyoke that power; and if, indeed, it be admitted that this vendee had notice, prior to its purchase, of every act in the transaction between its vendor and the Lances, it would nevertheless have no other knowledge than that upon which it acted, that is, that he had the right to sell and convey the property which it was about to buy. It may be, and we are inclined to that opinion, that after - payment of his own claims, and the debts which were a charge against the property, Bonnell held the balance of the money raised from the sale, if any such balance there was, as trustee for the Lances. But for this he ought to account, and not his vendee. We also agree with the Master, that the bill before us is fatally defective for the want of proper parties. The evidence clearly reveals the fact that William L. Lance, Sr., and Walter W. Lance, were interested in the property with the appellant, hence the defendants, if liable to account at all, were so liable to the three jointly, and not to either severally: Gloninger <em>v. </em>Hazard, 6 Wr., 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The decree of the Court of Common Pleas is 4 affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
