The lien of the judgment was restricted from certain lands which have been called in these proceedings the coal lands. The judgment was revived in 1862, during the lifetime of David Cash, with the same restriction. David Cash died in 1864, intestate, leaving a widow, Mary A. Cash, and children, to wit, George P. Cash, Charles D. Cash, Fred. A. Cash, Louise, afterward intermarried with James Wood, the plaintiff, and since deceased, and Mary Cash, one of the defendants, now intermarried with Henry S.

In 1869 an amicable partition was made of the real estate, excepting the coal lands and the homestead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">At the time of the partition it was agreed between the children of David Cash that the \"Hewett judgment, then amounting to five thousand dollars, should be paid by them in equal proportions, to wit, one thousand dollars each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">' James Wood,'the present plaintiff, was then the husband of Louise and a party to the agreement stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">As the agent for his wife and as attorney for Mary, he paid their proportions of the Hewett judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-8\">\u2022 The judgment was revived against the administratrix of David Cash, 29th of August, 1872, for $1,758.95, with interest from June 5th, 1872. The last previous revival was June 20th, 1867.

From May 10th, 1873, Wood was substantially the owner of the judgment. He purchased the judgment, as he stated, for the purpose of protecting .his wife' and Mary from any further payment on account thereof, and for the purpose of enforcing the collection of the balance due thereon from George P., Charles D., and Fred.

Griswold; February 11th, 1874. Mrs. Louise Wood died November 8th, 1875, and James Wood was her sole devisee. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-12\">November 11th, 1875, Mr. Wood made an exchange of the iuterest'in the homestead which descended to his late wife, for certain-lands .of Mrs.'Griswold. ' \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-13\">The deed from Mr. Wood to Mrs. Griswold was drawn with a clause to the effect that nothing therein\u2019-contained should be construed in any wise to affect the- lien of the Hewett judgment. When it was offered to. Mr. and Mrs. Griswold the clause was objected to by .'them, because Mr. Wood had before stated to Mary that, as lie had bought the judgment-for her protection, it should be collected out of the boys (meaning-George,.-Charles and Fred.) and should not affect her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-14\">Mr. Wood explained that the. clause was inserted for his own protection- \u2014 that 'if he, the owner of the Hewett judgment, should make an unqualified conveyance of an interest bquiyLb\u2019y it, it would not-only amoqnt.to a release of the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>est conveyed but of the others who were bound.. -But Mr. Wood stated to Mr. and Mrs. Griswold that under no cireunistanees should they ever be called upon to pay a dollar of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">Mr. Wood was asked to give a writing to show this, whereupon he manifested grief that Mr. and Mrs. Griswold should not have sufficient confidence to trust his assurance already given, and upon this they were persuaded to accept the deed which otherwise would have been refused. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">By this means Mrs. Griswold became the owner of two interests in the homestead \u2014 one by descent to herself, the other the interest descended to Louise. As to the latter interest the lien of the Hewett judgment had expired before this <em>scire facias </em>issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\">In 1876, the descended interest of George P. Cash in the homestead was sold at sheriffs sale. It was bidden off by 'one Kirby under an arrangement with Mr, Wood, made for himself and Mr. Griswold, that they would pay Kirby $1,000 for the interest whatever it might bring. It was struck down to Kirby for $500,-and Mr. Wood and Mr. Griswold gave Kirby their note for $500, and tlie\u2019 sheriff a note for, $500. The morning after the sheriff\u2019s sale an agreement was made between Mr. Wood and \"Mr. Griswold, on behalf of Mrs. Griswold, that the sheriff\u2019s deed for the, interest of George should be made to her, and that she should pay the two $500.notes, which was accordingly done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-9\">In this conversation the Hewett judgment was mentioned, \u2022and Mr. Wood claimed that it was still \u00e1 lien ugoh the-interest of-'George. It was agreed that if Mrs. Griswold took this interest, there should be no liability for the Hewett judgment so far as she had gone, <em>i. e., </em>as to the three interests she held, including that of George, but Mr. Wood cautioned Mr. Gris-wold that as to any further interests which he might thereafter acquire in the horhestead, he must look out for-himself so'far as the Hewett judgment was concerned. It was also a part of the agreement that Kirby should assign to Wood a judgment he had agreed to assign to Wood and Griswold as a part of the agreement made at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and the judgment was so assigned,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">Charles D. Cash and Fred. A. Cash became \u2022 insolvent. In 1874, by. deeds of assignment, all of their property, real, personal and mixed, was assigned in trust for benefit of creditors. These assignments embraced their interests in the homestead and the coal lands.

Cash in the coal lands was sold for $2,650, and in the homestead for $905. All these interests were purchased by N. N. Betts in trust for James Wood and others.

The rights of Mrs. Griswold to contribution from Fred and Charles, and subrogation against their property on payment by her, together with the knowledge of this relation on the part of Mr. Wood, make out the relation of suretyship. Add to this his assurances and Mrs. Griswold\u2019s reliance upon them ; and her equities, upon the testimony of Wood himself, and independent of an express contract of release, are complete on his negligence: Gearhart <em>v. </em>Jordan, 1 Jones, 325; Lowrey <em>v. </em>McKinney, 18 P.F.S, 294; Martin\u2019s Appeal, 1 Out., 85; Craft <em>v. </em>Moore, 9 Watts, 451.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-13\">The burden of proof to show no injury to the surety is upon the creditor: Holt <em>v. </em>Bodey, 6 Harris, 206.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-14\"><em>Davies &amp; Hall and R.

She got the one fifth of the homestead (worth all she gave) for the land on the side hill, and now claims a release of her other property from the lien of Wood\u2019s judgment, which is worth as much more. How can this be done? What has she given for this alleged release ? It has often been decided that the words used in a release ought not to be extended beyond the consideration for which it was given: Rapp <em>v. </em>Rapp, 6 Barr, 45; McLarren <em>v. </em>Robertson, 8 Harris, 125; Lyman <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Mass. Rep., 234; Rich <em>v. </em>Lord, 18 Pickering, 322.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-6\">And we do not see any substantial difference between such principle and that involved in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVU\">2. The affidavit of defence in this case does not aver either fraud, accident or mistake, nor does the evidence show any. The deed to Mrs. Griswold is plain and unambiguous in all its parts, and she and her husband ought not to be allowed to destroy it and import a new and different agreement: Martin <em>v. </em>Berens, 17 P. F. S., 462-463; Rowand <em>v. </em>Finny, 15 Norris, 192; Hunter <em>v. </em>McHose, 4 Out., 38; Thorne, McFarland &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Warfflein, Id., 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-9\">3. Here is a ease of equitable defence set up, and supported only by the oath of- one of the defendants, and that contradicted by himself, as well as by defendant in error. And the defence must fail according to the rulings in Juniata Building and Loan Association <em>v. </em>Hetzel, 7 Out., 508; Kenny <em>v. </em>McClellan, 7 Phila., 655; Audenried <em>v. </em>Walker, 8 Norris, 127.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-10\">Mr. Justice Clark</author>\n<p id=\"AqN-\">delivered the opinion of the court, April 5th, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">At the trial of this cause, in the court below, the learned judge withdrew the evidence from the consideration of the jury, and gave- binding instructions to find for the plaintiff. The defendants, Mary C. Griswold and Henry S. Griswold, her husband, contended that the judgment should not be revived against them, for the reason that Mrs. Griswold had paid her part, and, by the agreement of James Wood, the present plaintiff, had been released as to the balance. The sole question, therefore, for consideration here is, whether or not there was any evidence in the cause directly showing a valid release of Mrs. Griswold, or from which such a release might be inferred; and in the determination of this question we are not to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses or the conflict in the evidence, or to be governed by the preponderance of the proofs. The question is, whether or not there was any evidence in the cause from which the disputed fact might be fairly inferred. It seems to be conceded that, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the amicabl\u2019e partition of the real est\u00e1te'in 1869, it was agreed, by and between the five h'eirs of'David Cash, deceased, that the judgment, tlipii' amounting to $5,000, should be paid by them in equal proportions;'and that, pursuant to that agreement, whilst .Hewitt was still the holder and owner of the judgment, James Wood, as the'-agent'for his wife, Louise, and- the\u2019attorney for Mary, had paid their'respective portions thereof. It is- also admitted that Hewitt, having declined to .release\u2019Louise and Mary, upon payment of- their shares,'from further responsibility to him, James. Wood afterwards, on the 10th May, 1873, through Charles Chaffee, purchased\u2019the judgmen t foi; the purpose\u2019of protecting hi-s wife, Louise,-.and her sister, Mary, from further- p\u2019ayment, and of enforcing the col.-leetion of the- balance froto the brothers,. George, Charles and Frederick, the'three, remaining .heirs. Mrs. Griswold testifies that Mr. Woo\u2019d -told- her, r\u00e9p\u00e9at\u00e9dly he'hadtlie judgment assigned to .him, and that he: held it to \u00a1protect her and Mrs. .Wood;-that it should no't- cost-either of th\u00e9m a dollar, that the. boys.\u2019had prpp.erty to -pay it, and their\u2019 property should pay it; that-his object in.\u2018buying .the \u00a1judgment was-to protect his wife and the witness. On the 20th.May.,:1873, and again on rthe 3d February, 1879,-the judg\u2019m\u00e9n-t was revived- against the administratrix ,of-.the\u2019.estate-,of ' the deceased,, ana against George, Charles,and Frederick,! only, the names o'f'Louise and -,-Mary having ,be,eiu entirely omitted in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">On the 8th N\u00f3vember, 1875; Louise Wood died, James Wood being, the sple',deyis,ee'of her' estate, auct on the 11th November, 1875, Mr; Wood made an exchange of his interest the- hoprestea.d;-(acquired, Under, the, will'of his deceased wife) for certain lands of Mrs. Griswold. The deed from Mr. IWoodi contained \u00a1ajclauge,fiis fijllows: -\u2022\u2018'This conveyance is in way to affect the lien of a certain judgment, originally.in the -name of -Gurdop Hewitt <em>v. </em>David Cash-, and now owned by the -said; party of.' the first part.\u201d Mrs. Griswold says slie .refused, to take the deed on account of the; abov\u00e9 .recited \u00a1.clause contained.iq it;, that Wood assured her'then, that under no, circumstances should the Hewitt judgment ever cost her a dollar; tha\u00a1t the boys had property, to pay it, and that he would-collect it put of their property. That her'aceeptance of the deed should,not; make, her in anyway liable; .that he ct\u00eduld not release her,, without \u00a1releasing, those: who should pay ,it; but undqr no. circumstances should she be held for it. She .asked him for a writing\u2019 to tins effect, but he took some of-,-fence at the'suggestion,,and she \u00bfaccepted, it without writing. Dn her cross-examination, she says Wood .told her -that this clause iutfip deed.,.\u201c.should not make any difference;\u201d \u00a1h should not affect filer property,\u2019) or \u201c make filer, liable for the He.wett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>debtwe were to hav\u00e9 it, she s\u00e1ys, \u201c j\u00fast as'the arrangement had been \u2014 that it should never cost us a dollar j that we would not be holdeh for the debt; that the boys had property to pay it, and their property should pay it.\u201d These statements of Mrs. Griswold were modified to some extent by Mr.'Wood, and \u2018in some particulars were denied; but with this we have -nothing'to do; we must, for'the purposes of this case, assume the facts to be as stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">What the contract is, in its'terms and extent, is ordinarily for the jury, under all the evidence; but, assuming it to have been what Mrs. Griswold and her husband say it was, its force and legal effect become a matter of law for the court. The agreement of the heirs, that each would pay their proportional -part of the judgment, did not of course, bind Hewett; nor after 'the assignment to Wood, did it oblige him, as the as-sign'ee, to collect the residue from those of the heirs in default. Jt is true that he purchased the judgment for the express protection of the gilds, and said that it should not cost them.a dollar, that the property of the boys'should pay it; but this ,was a.- merely voluntary promise without consideration, and lacks the essential requisites of a contract. .</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u2022The defendant,'Mrs.'Griswold, claims'in the first instance however, that her acceptance of the deed, dated 11th of November, -1885, under the circu hi stances stated, operated as a releas\u2019e 'of her liability on the Hewett judgment. We do not think so. ! What was .said at this time was expressly referable to the particular transaction then in hand; and it is plain, from the language employed, that the agreement, if any existed, was that, notwithstanding the saving clause written .the deed, the rights of the parties to th\u00e9 Hewett judgment were to remain as before ; that the clause in question, \u201cshould '.liot make any difference,\u201d or \u201caffect her property,\u201d or \u201cmake her liable for the Hewett debt;\u201d but she \u201c was to have- it just as the arrangement had been.\u201d If there had been no previous release of .the defendant\u2019s liability, none would, appear to have been then in contemplation of the parties; for it is admitted -that Mr. Wood told Mrs; Griswold at .the time that .he could mot release her,, assigning as a reason he could not release one ptarty without releasing all; there .is not only an absence of proof to establish any'such intention of the. parties, but to give .the transaction this effect would extend, the release beyond the \u2022consideration upon which its. validity necessarily'depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The effect of .the saving. clause, in the conveyance of this particular undivided interest, was the subject matter of the 'contract, and the words of an agreement are ordinarily intended to be applied to the thing about which the parties are contracting: Edelman <em>v. </em>Yerkel, 27 Penn. St., 26. Courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Equity, under the old practice, restrained general expressions when it was clear from the subject matter and the circumstances, that the words were intended to be used in a restricted sense, and the same power is exercised in our courts, where equity remedies are applied through common law forms. However general, therefore, the terms of a contract may be, it comprehends only those things, in respect of which it clearly appears the parties proposed to contract: Case <em>v. </em>Cushman, 3 W. &amp; S., 544. Nor should the words employed in a release be extended beyond the consideration; otherwise we make a release for the parties which they never intended or contemplated; Rapp <em>v. </em>Rapp, 6 Penn. St., 45; McLarren <em>v. </em>Robertson, 20 Penn. St., 125; Noble <em>v. </em>Burke, 5 Phil., 526; Wharton\u2019s Cont., 1037; Lyman <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Mass., 238. If the purpose of the plaintiff upon this writ of <em>scire facias </em>was to charge .Mrs. Griswold, as a terre tenant of the interest conveyed under the deed, in contravention of the agreement otherwise, a different question would be presented; but as it is, her interest as an heir only which is sought to be charged, to relieve her from responsibility, she must establish a general release, or a release as to that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">But the testimony of Henry S. Griswold as to the transaction between these parties in May, 1876, when the interest of George P. Cash was sold by the sheriff, is such, we think, as required a submission to the jury. Mr. Griswold, in the interest of his wife, and Mrs. Wood, in her own interest, attended that sale; it was arranged that one Kirby, who held a judgment against George P. Cash for some $500 or $600, should bid off the property as low as he could, and that Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Griswold would take it off his hands at $1,000. This arrangement was consummated; Kirby bid the property-off at $500. Wood and Griswold gave their note to the sheriff for the amount of Kirby\u2019s bid, and, although Kirby\u2019s judgment was not reached in the sale, they gave Kirby their note for $500, according to the arrangement. Mr. Griswold testifies :\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The next morning Mr. Wood saw me on the step \u2014 I think I went away the next morning on the morning train \u2014 on the front step of the homestead \u2014 and he told me he didn\u2019t know what he got an interest in that house again for \u2014 the homestead; that he didn\u2019t want it; would like to have me take it off his hands; and in the conversation that morning he stated to me that the Hewett judgment was a lien upon this interest that we had bought at sheriff\u2019s sale, and I agreed to take the interest that morning; we had bought George\u2019s interest; and agreed to give him \u2014 ; I told him there was an understanding that I supposed we were to have the balance of.the judgment; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>told him so that morning; he said he didn\u2019t know whether we were or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Q. What judgment? A. Balance of a judgment against\u2014 that Kirby held to make up the thousand dollars; I told him I didn\u2019t suppose we were going to give him the thousand dollars for the bid. and not get anything of the judgment, and I agreed to let Mr. Wood have the difference between the five hundred dollar bid and the thousand dollars that we paid for the property, and take it \u2014 take George\u2019s interest \u2014 but the Hewett judgment, Mr. Wood said, was a lien upon it; and he agreed, in consideration of the five hundred dollars balance of the judgment and my taking the interest, that so far as I had gone I should not be liable; but he said I must look out for myself if I got any more of the homestead \u2014 any other judgments came up that I bid off, I must look out for them, but so far as I had gone \u2014 why, the Hewett judgment should not be recovered against me.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Q. You say \u201cas far as I had gone ;\u201d had you any interest at that time? No; I had no interest; I had bid this off for my wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Q. Repeat what he said. A. He said that so far as the interest that I already had in taking these \u2014 including this interest that I had that morning agreed to take \u2014 I should not be liable, or my wife should not be liable \u2014 we should not be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Q. What were you to give him ? A. What did I give him ?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Q. Yes? A. I gave him the balance of the judgment that he should get from Mr. Kiilry.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Q. Do you know whether this judgment was assigned from Mr. Kirby to Mr. Wood ? A. I understand that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Q. To whom was the conveyance made ? A. The conveyance was made to my wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">If it be true, as we understand Mr. Griswold to say, that Wood and Griswold agreed jointly to take from Kirby the interest of George P. Cash at $1,000 ; if Griswold afterwards, in behalf of his wife, agreed with Wood to take that interest in severalty and pay the $1,000; if the Kirby judgment, with Griswold\u2019s consent, was transferred by Kirby to Wood \u2014 and in consideration thereof it was agreed that Mrs Griswold, as far as she had gone, that is to say, upon- the interests or shares in the homestead she then held, should not be liable for the Hewett judgment, the contract thus shown being founded in a sufficient consideration, would, without doubt, contain all the requisites of a valid release. The transaction, as it is stated, involved all the interests Mrs. Griswold then had in the homestead; this was the subject matter of the contract; the parties were not bargaining as to the effect of a saving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>.clause in the, conveyance-of 'a single share, but expressly for the release of all the shares Mrs. Griswold had. . w'e assume the facts to be as Mr. Griswold states tliem; his testimony is .contradicted by Mr. Wood, and the'averments of the\u2019affidavit ofdefence, it is\u2019argued,'are inconsistent with his evidence. But. we cannot \"weigh\u2019 the evidence; the truth must be \u00e1scer\u25a0tained and. established by another tribunal. Upon an examination of the whole case,-we ar\u00e9 of opinion that there was \u2022sufficient evidence to require a submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"Accl\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de .novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
