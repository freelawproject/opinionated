They came to defendant\u2019s car, which was a one-horse car, and was standing at the foot of -George\u2019s Hill; the driver was inside the car, a boy by the name of Solnack was on the front platform holding the reins. Young Biddle asked this boy, Solnack, permission to get upon the car. He replied : \u201cI can\u2019t let you on ; I don\u2019t own the car; \u201d and then added, \u201cWell, jump on.\u201d The boys jumped on. The car had gone but a short distance when the driver came to the door of it and finding the boys on the platform ordered them off. The boys did not get off, and a little further'on he came out again, and finding they had disregarded his order, he again ordered them off. Pie came out a third time, and said in a threatening manner, \u201cYou boys get off of here!\u201d The boy that was driving said to thp smallest boy, the one that was killed: \u201cWait, Clarence, I will stop for you;\u201d and he immediately began to tighten the brake, but the driver rushed at him, shoved him away from the brake, and just as he (Clarence) was going off, backward, the speed of the car increased with a jerk, as the brake was released, and flew round; and he was thrown under the wheels \u2014 crushed, and died, the speed of the car being such that both wheels passed over the centre of his body before it stopped.

R., 86 Pa., 146, Mr. Justice Gordon says : \u201c It was certainly correct to say \u2018that if a person not connected with the company travels by a passenger train, presumably he is traveling as a passenger, and for a considerationin other words he is presumed to have paid his fare, or to be ready to pay it when called upon. To presume otherwise would be to presume such an one was a trespasser; but this is an affirmative proposition, the proof of which rests upon the one alleging it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-7\">See also Company <em>v. </em>Brook, 7 P.

Even the boy Solnack knew better than that, and did what he could to prevent the accident. To discuss, therefore, evidence which throughout shows a reckless carelessness of which no man of ordinary discretion ought to have been guilty, would be to no purpose; hence, we may regard the case as fully disposed of when we have made a brief statement of the law which ought to have governed the court below. It was a mistake to hold that because the child was a trespasser it could therefore be ejected in a manner which endangered its life or limbs. In the case of the Pennsylvania Company <em>v. </em>Toomey, we held, per Mr. Justice Mercur, that such a disposition of a trespassing adult could not be allowed, and that ordinary care must be used to avoid injury even to a trespasser is fully established by the cases of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Lewis, 29 P. F. S., 33, the Hydraulic Works Co. <em>v. </em>Orr, 2 Norris, 332, and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, 8 Wr., 375. Moreover, we have two cases which, in point, rule the contention in hand; they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the Pittsburgh, Allegheny &amp; Manchester Passenger Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 24 P. F. S., 421, and. the same company <em>v. </em>Donahue, 20 Id., 119. In the first case a child had been permitted by the' clriver to ride upon the front platform, from which, without his knowledge, it attempted to leave the car whilst in motion, and was injured ; in the second the child was pushed or knocked from the platform by the driver, and in each case the company was held liable for the resulting injuries. Both children here mentioned were trespassers, for although, in the first case, the child was on the car by invitation of the driver, yet as he had no authority to give such invitation, according to the case of Duff <em>v. </em>The Allegheny Railroad Co., 10 Norris, 458, it was but a- trespasser. It is very true, as was held in the Hestonville Passenger Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Connell, 7 Norris, 522, and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, extra precautions are not required in anticipation of the intrusions of trespassers, even though they be children, but when they do so intrude and are known to be in an improper place, they must not be so wholly neglected as to endanger their lives or limbs. Any other doctrine would so illy accord with Christian civilization as to render its maintenance impossible. It follows from what we have said that the court below, instead of ordering a peremptory nonsuit, ought to have sent the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The judgment is reversed and a new <em>venire </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
