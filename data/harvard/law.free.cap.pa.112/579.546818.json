That Elizabeth Heilner obtained a judgment against L. F. Whitney\u2019s estate, and levied upon and is about to sell the aforesaid real estate. That A. W.

That a sheriff\u2019s sale will cast a cloud upon the title, and render the property unsalable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-13\">12th. That there is no adequate remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-14\">The prayer for relief asks that the defendants be restrained from clouding the title by a sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-15\">On filing this bill the court, June 29th, 1885, granted a preliminary-injunction as prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-16\">On the hearing of the motion to continue the preliminary injunction, the following facts appeared :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-17\">Charles Baber and wife, by deed dated December 1st, 1878, conveyed to Lawrence F. Whitney the undivided seventeen twenty-fourths (|-|) of certain lands near Pottsville, containing 45 acres. Consideration, $6,302.90.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-18\">By another deed, of same date, George B. Strauch conveyed the other seven twenty-fourths (t\u00ed) of the same lands to said Whitney. Consideration, $2,595.30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-19\">Isaac Lea <em>et al., </em>by deed of December 20th, 1873, eonvejmd the seventeen twenty-fourths (t\u00ed) interest in an adjoining tract, containing 34 acres and 40 perches, to said Whitney. Consideration, $3,396.45.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-20\">By another deed, of same date, George B. Strauch conveyed the other seven twenty-fourths (^) in said lands to Whitney. Consideration, $1,398.53.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-21\">These deeds were duly executed and acknowledged at or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>about the time of their dates, and were duly recorded on the 22d day of January, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">The deeds were in fee simple, absolute to Lawrence F. Whitney, his heirs and assigns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-7\">The lands were assessed in Whitney\u2019s name,-and so continued until after his death, and he paid the taxes thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-8\">Whitney took the exclusive possession and management of the land, put up improvements, laid out streets, divided the land into town lots, sold off lots and received the purchase money, and executed conveyances therefor, taking all securities for balances due in his own name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-9\">\u2022 Whitney, at that time, was a prominent broker and banker in Pottsvi\u00edle, a man of reputed wealth, and the title to this' land in him went far to increase and strengthen his credit in the community, so that when he died he left unsecured debts amounting to $25,000 (among them Mrs. Elizabeth Heilner in $5,000), besides a number of secured creditors. His estate proved utterly insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-10\">Whitney\u2019s alleged declaration of trust is dated April 1st, 1874 (over three months after the execution of said deeds), and was not acknowledged till February 27th, 1875 (a v\u00e9ar later.) The assignment from Schollenberger to Judge Walker is dated May 1st, 1877, two years later still. Neither were recorded until November 21st, 1878, two months and eleven davs after Whitney\u2019s death, which occurred September 10th, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-11\">This was the first notice to the world of any trust, or of any interest in Schollenberger or Walker in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-12\">In 1881, Lewis B. Walker, Esq., as assignee of Judge Walker, Schollenberger\u2019s first trustee, filed his petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Schuylkill County, praying for an order on Mrs. Whitney, the executrix and sole devisee of Lawrence F. Whitney, to convey this land to him. This application was resisted by Mrs. Whitney, and also by the unsecured creditors of Whitney\u2019s estate, who intervened, and the petition was finally dismissed by the Orphans\u2019 Court for want of jurisdiction. On appeal from that decision to the Supreme Court (No. 336, January Term, 1884), the ruling of the court below was affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-13\">Counsel for creditors attempted to resist the making of the decree sought for by Mr. Walker,, but this interference was strenuously objected to by Schollenberger and Walker' in the court below; and in the Supreme Court, on the hearing Walker\u2019s appeal, the counsel for the creditors asked to be heard, but his paper book and argument were suppressed by the court at the instance of Mr. Walker and his counsel. So, when Mr. Walker filed his bill in equity in the court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>(No. 1, January Term, 1884), against Hannah Whitney, as sole executrix, devisee and legatee of L. F. Whitney, deceased, he did not include the creditors of Whitney\u2019s estate, or make them parties, or take any notice of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">In the meantime suit was brought by Mrs. Heilner against Whitney\u2019s estate (No. 347, September Term, 1882), and judgment was duly obtained, October 14th, 1884, for $6,8\u00cd6.66. Execution was issued November 8th, 1884, and the land condemned, and subsequently advertised to be sold by the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-6\">The preliminary injunction was dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-7\">The defendants then filed a demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s bill, which on hearing was sustained and the plaintiff\u2019s bill dismissed by Pershing, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-8\">The plaintiff thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the court dissolving the preliminary injunction, and also the decree of the court sustaining the demurrer and dismissing his bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-9\"><em>L. B. Walker (Thomas H. Walker </em>and <em>John W. Ryon </em>with him), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApP\">1. It cannot be doubted that under certain circumstances the power of a court of equity to restrain an execution creditor from proceeding to sell may be properly invoked ; but as was said in Winch\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. S., 244, it is only where the creditor- is clearly and undeniabty proceeding, against right and justice, to abuse the process of the law to the injury of another, that equity intervenes to stay his hand: Taylor\u2019s Appeal, 12 Nor., 23.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-10\">2. The court erred in dismissing the bill under the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-11\">The Bill avers the ownership to be in Schollenberger\u2019s assignee, by decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County directing a deed for the land to be made by Mrs. Whitney to L. B. Walker, assignee, and that such deed was made. And the reply of the respondents does not deny this ownership by plea, answer or demurrer, and therefore under the pleading it is such a ease where the creditor is clearly and undeniably proceeding against right and justice to abuse the process of the law to an injury of another: Hunters\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wr., 194; Lyon\u2019s Appeal, 11 P. F. S., 15; Winch\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id., 244; Taylor\u2019s Appeal, 8 W. N. C., 192; 12 Nor., 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-13\">3. But this case differs from all others in the books in this respect: that the same controversy and claim has been already adjudicated upon and- settled by a court of competent jurisdiction, and Mrs. Heilner was privy to the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-14\">If Mrs. Heilner is a stranger she is not affected by the decree, but if she is a privy she is bound by it, for \u201c all. persons who are represented by the parties and claim under them, or in privity with them, are equally concluded by the same pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ceeding\u201d: 1 Greenleaf's Evidence, \u00a7 523; Peterson <em>v. </em>Lothrop, 10 Casey, 223; Giltinan <em>v. </em>Strong, 14 P. F. S., 242; Otterson <em>v. </em>Middleton, 6 Out., 78; Strayer <em>v. </em>Johnson, 43 Leg. Int., 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">Is Mrs. Heilner a privy to the decree against Whitney\u2019s estate ? She is a creditor who obtained a judgment against Whitney\u2019s estate after his death. She could only be successful in an action of ejectment through Whitney\u2019s title. Her claim is not adverse to Whitney\u2019s title, but under that title. Her claim has already been adjudicated upon, for Mrs. Whitney as executrix of the decedent is regarded as a trustee for creditors: Hess\u2019s Estate, 19 P. F. S., 272; and Mrs. Whitney\u2019s appearance in her representative character is the appearance of all Whitney\u2019s creditors: Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., \u00a7\u00a7 140, 141, 142, 150, 226; Newland <em>v. </em>Campion, 1 Vesey, Sr., 105; Peacock <em>v. </em>Monk, 1 Id., 127.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-7\"><em>A. W. </em>Schalck, for appellees, was not heard.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered May 3d, 1886.</p>\n<author id=\"A46\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AOY\">It is well settled as a general rule that ,a court of equity will not restrain by injunction a creditor from levying on land in which he avers that his debtor has an interest. It is true under the Act of 1850, which declares that the property of a married woman shall not be subject to levy \u00e1nd execution for the debts and liabilities of her husband, a sale of the wife\u2019s land by the husband\u2019s creditor may be enjoined where the title of the wife is clear, inasmuch as a sale would be in violation of a clear and express statutory prohibition: Reeser <em>v. </em>Johnson, 76 Pa. St., 313.</p>\n<p id=\"Alu\">We discover nothing' in the facts of this case, nor in the decree between.'other parties which is invoked, to take the case out of the general rule which denies to a court of equity the right to restrain a creditor from selling land on execution in which he thinks the defendant has an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
