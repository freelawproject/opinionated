Simoson, his wife, against Thomas Waddell and J. Frank Walter, doing business as Waddell &amp; Walter, to recover damages for the death of their son, W. T. S. Simoson, caused by the alleged negligence of the said defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-15\">Plea, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-16\">The following are the facts of the case as they appeared on the trial before BlOE, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-17\">\u2022 In 1882 the then firm of Waddell &amp; Walter were operating certain collieries in Luzerne county, one of which included the mine where the accident occurred by which W. T. S. Simoson, a son of the plaintiff, lost his life. This colliery embraced one mine worked by a shaft, up which the coal was brought to the breaker, and another, worked by a tunnel or drift in the side of the hill; the coal being taken over a trestle to the same breaker. The two mines were entirely distinct and separate and there was no connection between them. James Waddel was the general superintendent of the defendants\u2019, collieries; William Wallace was the inside foreman or mining boss of the mine operated by the shaft, and James Gallagher the inside foreman or mining boss of the other mines; John Schlager was the boss of the breaker, through which the coal from both mines passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-18\">Morris Simoson was an old miner and familiar with the manner and character of mining operations in that vicinity. His son, Wm. T. S. Simoson, was twelve years old in July, 1882; he had worked in.the mines before his employment by the defendaiits. He was employed by them in the last of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>July, 1882, as a slate-piclcer. Pie was a stout lad, tall for his age, being five feet, one inch in height, weighing about one hundred and ten pounds, and appearing to be fifteen or sixteen years of age. He was afterwards employed to \u201c sprag \u201d the cars at the head of the breaker. After that he applied to Gallagher, the inside foreman at the drift, for a place as driver boy, and such place being then vacant, was given to him. He had previously driven in the other mine. He began driving in the mine in which Gallagher was foreman about October 1st, 1882. On November 3d, 1882, he was killed by a fall of a \u201c slip \u201d or \u201c fault \u201d from the roof of the gangway at the edge of a breast. The negligence complained of was that the gangway \u2014 taken in connection with the width of the breasts opening out from it on both sides \u2014 was too wide to be safe without artificial supports or \u201cproppings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-4\">All the witnesses agreed that the \u201cslip\u201d or fault in the rock which fell, could not be discovered except by sounding the roof, and that what came down was merely this slip,\u2019 which lay in the solid rock that formed the roof, seventeen to eighteen inches in its thickest part and running down to an invisible or \u201cfeather edge\u201d at the side of the gangway. This gangway was eight feet high at the lower side and nine at the upper side. It was a counter-gangway, driven across the upper face of the breasts, opened up from a lower gangway, and from it other breasts had been opened and were being opened on the upper side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">It was started by Gallagher, the inside foreman, whose reputation for skill and care was not attacked or questioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">He regarded it as perfectly safe. He swore that he did not think props were necessary, and that they would not have prevented the coming down of the slip. That he had sounded the roof and found no indications of anything wrong, and that he had taken every method and precaution known to careful and skilful mining to ascertain the condition of the roof, and that he believed it to be entirely safe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-7\">Clinton -Opdyke, who was working in the mine, had sounded the roof with Gallagher and found it entirely safe. He had worked in the mine eight years, and in this gangway since it was opened. John Matthews was working a breast near the place where the \u201cslip \u201d fell. He was in his breast at the time of the fall, and was among the first to get to the place. He thought the place perfectly safe. John Welch had driven the gangway at the place of the accident, and within a week of its occurrence was pushing the same gangway further on. He regarded the condition of the roof as safe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-8\">It was proved that about a week or ten days before the accident, there had been a scale or light fall at the place where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the accident afterwards happened. Gallagher then, with Op-dyke, examined the roof and reported to James Waddell, the general superintendent, that it was safe. He testified that nothing had been neglected or omitted to be done which ought to have been done to make the place safe. It was also shown that after the fall of the slip the mine was robbed \u2014 that is, more coal taken from the sides and pillars at that place, and that the roof had remained and still remains intact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The defendant presented, <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-7\">4. There is no sufficient evidence in the case that the construction of the gangway in which the accident happened was either negligent or defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-8\">Answer. This point is answered in the negative. There is evidence consisting of the opinions of witnesses that it was not properly constructed, that the distances between the supports were too great. The sufficiency of the evidence is for the jury and not for the court. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-9\">5. Even if such construction was defective, the defendants having employed a competent person to drive such gangway, and no notice to them, or knowledge on their part of any defect therein being shown, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-10\">Answer. This is also answered in the negative. (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-11\">6. Again even if the gangway or adjacent breasts were constructed of too great a width, yet the plaintiffs cannot recover unless the jury finds that the width of such gangway and breasts caused or materially contributed to the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-12\">Answer. This-was explained upon the argument, and was amended, as <em>we </em>understood the counsel, to read substantially that the width of the gangway, even if too great, is not material, provided this defect, if it be one, did not cause or coritribute to the accident. As thus amended, the point is affirmed. As it stands originally it would have to be negatived, because it leaves out another phase of the case to which we have called your attention. (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-13\">8. The only negligence claimed by the plaintiffs being that in a gangway and breasts opening thereon, of the size shown by the map of Mr. Hartwell, it was the duty of the defendants to support the roof by timbers or other appliances, and the uncontradicted evidence being that Gallagher, the mining boss in charge, examined the roof, and found it, in his' judgment safe without such support, and so reported it to the general superintendent, the defendants are not responsible either for Gallagher\u2019s mistake in judgment or failure to discover the defect in the roof, or to guard against it..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-14\">Answer. We decline to charge a\u00bfs requested in that point; it is answered in the negative. (Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>9. That the defendants fulfilled the measure of their duty to their employes if they committed their work to careful and skilful bosses and superintendents who. conducted the same to the best of their skill and ability, and if the jury find from the evidence that such was the case and that the defendants had no notice or knowledge of the defective condition of the gangway at the time of the accident, then if the same was unsafe the plaintiffs cannot recover in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-4\">Answer. <em>We </em>decline to charge as requested in this point. If, however, you find the facts to be as stated by the point, and the defendants had no notice or knowledge of the defective condition of the gangway, or did not have their attention called to it, or would not have known it by the exercise of due care, then the,y would not be liable. The point needs, however, that qualification \u2014 namely, whether or not they ought to have known it by the exercise of' due care and prudence. (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-5\">10. That if the accident can be attributed to negligence or unskilful mining, then under the testimony the want of care was on the part of a co-employ\u00e9 of the deceased, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\">Answer. We decline to charge as requested in tha't point; because in our opinion the facts in the case do not warrant the submission of that point to the, jury. (Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-7\">-Verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of 11,336.75, and judgment thereon, whereupon the defendants took this writ, assigning for error the answer of the court to their points, as appears above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b584-8\"><em>J. V. Darling </em>and <em>H. W. Palmer (E. P. Darling </em>with them), for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Ce\">1. The fundamental error, as we conceive it to be, in the treatment of this case by the court below, was the instruction to the jury that the -condition of a counter-gangway in a mine was to be regarded as a \u201cstructure,\u201d which the mine owner or operator was obliged to furnish and maintain in a condition of reasonable safety, as he would a piece of dangerous machinery, such for example as a railroad locomotive, and that for the failure of the mine-boss under the Act of 1870 to support the roof of such gangway by sufficient props or other contrivances, the owner would be liable, even if the mine-boss had done everything that he thought necessary to make the place safe, and had considered the gangway and the roof supports entirely sufficient and safe and had so advised the owner, or operator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-9\">It was admitted that under ordinary circumstances a mine boss was a co-employ\u00e9 of \u2019a miner or person employed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>mine under him. But the distinction was sought to be made that this rule did not apply to an injury resulting from a failure on the part of such mine boss to open or maintain a gangway in such manner as would provide a safe place for the men under him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">The accident was the result either (1) of the negligence of Gallagher,, or (2) of a mistake of judgment on his part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\">Are the defendants responsible to this plaintiff for either?</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-8\">That a mining boss, under the' Mine Ventilation Act of 1870 is a fellow servant with the miners and laborers, is estab-. lished in this state beyond question: Lehigh Valley Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Jones, 5 Nor., 433; Del. &amp; Hudson Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Carroll, 8 Id., 374; Keystone Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Newberry, 15 Id., 246.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">To compare coal mining to the erection of a house or manufacture of a finished machine is, we submit, entirely impossible. In those cases the master may protect himself by purchasing the machinery from a safe and skilled maker, or by having his house built by a careful and skilled contractor, supplied with suitable material: Adesco Oil Co. <em>v. </em>Gilson, 63 Pa. St. 146; Walden <em>v. </em>Finch, 70 Id., 460.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-10\">But here, the prosecution of mining operations, necessarily conducted by a mining boss, and involving the exercise of his judgment and skill, if regarded as \u201cstructures,\u201d leaves the mine operator in the position of the guarantor, both of the skill and judgment as well as the care of his mining boss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-11\">That such a construction of the liability of persons engaged in operating anthracite coal mines cannot be supported, is further seen when the character and scope of the employment of the mining boss are looked at.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-12\">He is a statutory officer. It is provided by the Mine Ventilation Act of March 3d, 1870, \u00a7 8, P. L. Purd., 1180, as follows : \u201c The better to secure the ventilation of every coal mine and colliery and provide for the health and safety of the men employed therein, otherwise and in every respect, the owner or agent, as the case may be, in charge of every coal mine or colliery, shall employ a competent and practical inside overseer, to be called mining boss, who shall keep a careful watch over the ventilating apparatus, over the air-ways, the traveling-ways, the pumps and sumps, the timbering, to see as the miners advance in their excavations that all loose coal, slate or rock overhead is carefully secured against falling,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-14\">2. The answer of the court to the defendant\u2019s ninth point was error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-15\">The rule as to the liability of the master for defective, dangerous or unfit machinery,, appliances, tools or premises, is thus stated by a recent text-writer: \u201c Personal negligence is the gist of the action, and it must therefore appear, to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the master liable, that he knew, or from the nature of the ease ought to have known, of the unfitness of the means of labor furnished to the servant, and that the servant did not know, or could not reasonably be held to have known of the defect. Knowledge on the part of the employer and ignorance on the part of the employ\u00e9 are of the essence of the action; or in other words, the master must be at fault and know of it, and the servant must be free from fault and ignorant of his master\u2019s fault, if the action is to lie. The authorities all state the rule with these qualifications:\u201d Beach on Contr. Negligence, sec. 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-4\">3. \u201cIf any injury befalls an employ\u00e9 by reason of a defect which ordinary inspection and oversight would not, or did not, detect, ordinary care in the premises having been exercised, then the master is not liable: \u201d Beach on Contr. Negligence, sec. 133; Baker <em>v. </em>Allegheny Valley R. R. Co., 14 Norris, 211; Sykes <em>v. </em>Parker, 99 Pa. St., 468.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-5\"><em>W. H. McCartney (George H. Butler </em>and <em>Garrick M.

To neither of them do our adversaries interpose any dissent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\">. The first is, that the general rule of law is that a master who employs a laborer or operative in any particular department of work, is bound to keep and maintain the place where such work is being performed, in such condition that it is reasonably and adequately safe for the performance of such employment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-8\">The second is, that it is the duty of the master not to expose the laborer or operative, while conducting the master\u2019s business, to perils or hazards which may be guarded against by proper care and diligence on the master's part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-9\">The third is, that although the liability of the master is not that of a guarantor of the absolute safety of the place in which the laborer or operative is employed, still the master is bound, and it is his duty, to exercise the care which the exigencies and circumstances connected with the employment reasonably require: Hough <em>v. </em>Railway Co., 10 Otto, 213; Fuller <em>v. </em>Jewett, 80 N.

That the gangway in question was in an unsafe and dangerous condition, abundant warning had been given. There had been a fall of roof just previous to the occurrence of the fatal accident. Near the very point where the boy, Simoson, was killed a fall had come down on the track. A clearing away followed, but no props or supports were set up to prevent further falls. Death to an emploj\u2019-\u00e9 came at an early day afterwards ; and then, for the first time, that gangway was made secure.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b587-5\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"A7j\">delivered the opinion of the court, May 10th, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the case of the Lehigh Valley Coal, Co. <em>v. </em>Jones, 5 Nor., 432, as also in the Delaware &amp; Hudson Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Carroll, 8 Id., 374, it was held by this court that the mining boss is a co-employ \u00e9 with the other workmen engaged in a coal mine, and that, as a consequence, the owners of the mines are not responsible for damages resulting to a fellow workman from his negligence. Without overruling these cases, which in principle are sustained by many others, we cannot see our way clear to adopt the ruling.of the court below as to the case in hand. The competency of the defendants\u2019 mining boss does not seem to have been questioned; it was but alleged that he was negligent in not having the roof of the gangway properly secured by props or other appliances, which might have prevented the fall of the rock that killed the plaintiffs\u2019 son. But that the employer cannot be made responsible for damages resulting to a servant from the negligence of a fellow servant, is a principle as old as the common law. Moreover, as the defendants had complied strictly with the 8th section of the Act of 3d of March, 1870, in providing a practical and skilful inside overseer, or mining boss, and as the]' had thus fulfilled the duty imposed upon them by the General Assembly, it is not for this or any other court to charge them with an additional obligation. As was said by our brother Paxson, in the ease last cited.: \u201c It is too plain for argument that if the defendants have not violated said Act they are not responsible.\u201d To this doctrine we must adhere, and the more so that it is just and reasonable. The Act is one of great practical utility to the miner, and lays upon the proprietors of mines all the burthens they ought of right to bear. The]' must provide capable over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>seers for their works, and they must furnish what, by such overseers, is required for the safety and welfare of the men engaged in those works. More than this they cannot do, for upon the judgment and skill of these practical agents they must depend quite as much as any of the men who are engaged in their mines. Bosses, however well intentioned and skilful, cannot always be on the watch ; occasionally they will fail in judgment, and at times may even be negligent; but of this, the workman is quite as well aware as his employer, and in entering upon the employment of mining he must assume the risks that are ordinarily incident thereto, among which are those accidents that may result from the negligence of co-employ\u00e9s, of whom, as we have seen, the mining boss is one. It follows that the court below should have affirmed without qualification the fifth, ninth and tenth points of the defendants, and as these errors require a radical reversal of the case, we need not notice the remaining assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
