(Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-13\">In the general charge the court instructed the. jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-14\">. The contest here, as you have observed, is whether David Follweiler, at the time he made the assignment, was a resident of Schuylkill county or a resident of Lehigh county. If he was a resident of Schuylkill county, then inasmuch as the deed was not recorded in Lehigh county, a judgment entered in Lehigh county at the time the Jesse-FolLyveiler judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u2022was entered would have become a lien on the land in Lehigh county, and any one taking under that judgment would take a good title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">[It is admitted that Rebecca Follweiler, who bought at the sheriff's sale, knew that the assignment, had been made, and that these four acres were included in the assignment. It is admitted also that at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale notice was given by Mrs. Lutz that she had bought the property. It is also admitted that Mrs. Follweiler bought the title she now has with notice that Mrs. Lutz .had it by virtue of her deed from the assignees. The law says where a party thus has notice she cannot complain that the deed is not recorded, because the object of putting a deed on record is to give notice to the public that somebody else has a title, and where a party had actual notice of the other deed though not recorded, the law places him or her in the same position as if the deed'had been recorded. In order to simplify this case, the plaintiffs very sensibly admitted that they had notice. They are therefore in the same position as if the deed had been recorded in Lehigh county. The only question 'that then remains, as it seems to me now, and the main controversy in this case, is as to whether at the time'the assignment'was made, October 1 Oth, 1874, David W. Follweiler, the assignor, was a resident of Schuylkill county or not. If he, was a resident of Lehigh county then the deed of assignment was not recorded in the county in which the assignor resided, and it was void as to the creditors, and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover so far as this branch of the inquiry is concerned.]. (Fifth assignment of error.) , '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">Several surveyors have testified as to where the line separating Schuylkill and Lehigh is, in reference to the dwelling house on the tract of land which David Follweiler .owned. You no doubt understood that on the. Schuylkill side, the township is \u201c West Penn,\u201d and on the Lehigh side the town/ ship is called \u201c Lynn.\u201d The tract of land containing 195 acres,, it seems, is situated on top of the Blue Mountains. On the top, or somewhere, near the top, the county line runs between these two counties. One of the surveyors, Mr, Stoudt, testified that he run this line, and he described to you how and where he run it, and what land marks he found. He testified that he found the county line to be north of the house in which David Follweiler lived. You will remember that the witnesses agree in saying that there was a house on this property, which at one time was used as,a hotel; that it was built about the year 1869 or 1870, and that David Follweiler lived in it from 1870 to 1879, living in it in 1874. Mr. Stoudt says the county line ran north of this house, placing the whole of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the dwelling house in Lehigh county, and ran through the' barn, which is situated further to .the north than the house.\u2019 Are you satisfied from his testimony that the line as he ascertained it is the correct line? If it is, then'David Follweiler at the time he made the assignment resided-in Lehigh county,' and then,the assignment, not being recorded in Lehigh, would be void as to the plaintiffs, if Jesse Follweiler was a creditor in 1874. Then, without further inquiiy, you will find in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">[\u2019Squire Creitz, another surveyor, says he run the line with \u2019Squire Weiss, who was also a surveyor, -and both of them have told you what land marks they found, and how they run this line. If I am not wrong, \u2019Squire Weiss agrees with \u2019Squire Creitz in this, that they found the county line ran through this house in which David Follweiler lived at the time he made this assignment, cutting the larger part of the house into Lehigh county. What weight' do you attach to their testimony? Do you believe that that is the line rather than that which Stoudt says is the line? 1 If you find the line, as stated by Creitz and Weiss to be the correct line, you have the fact that the house in which David Follweiler lived at the time of the assignment was on the line, and then another question will arise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">We have not been informed as to how David Follweiler occupied this house. It was said that he-kept a hotel, and that the north end of the house, the end towards Schuylkill county, was divided into two rooms, one in front, and one in the rear, and that the front room was used as a bar room while-the hotel was kept, and that the door into that room was on-the Lehigh county side. How the other rooms were used we do not know, nor where David Follweiler ate or slept. We have the bare question of an assignor, if you take that to be the true line, living on the county line and recording the deed in one of the counties, and the county in-which the smallest portion of the house was located.. This presents a question of some difficulty in the opinion of the dourt. The first impression would be to say that where a house is located on the county line, and the man occupying makes an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, the deed must be recorded in both counties in order to be valid. That view, in my opinion, would be untenable, because that would be legislating; that would be adding by the court to the provisions of the legislature in reference to this subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">Another view which is most strenuously urged by the plaintiffs is, that because the portion of this house in the' county of Schuylkill is so small, it must be said as a matter of law that the recording in Schuylkill county was ineffective, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and that taking the line as Creitz gives it, we must assume that David Follweil.er was a resident of Lehigh county. . I-cannot assent to that,-gentlemen. In my opinion! where the dwelling house of a party owning real estate and making an assignment, is located on the county line, his residence is ambiguous, uncertain and doubtful; and either for the purpose of the Act of Assembly referring to assignments, and for some other legal purposes, in my opinion he may determine and elect in which of the districts his residence shall be. It is not simply a matter of intention, undivulged, but acts done by the assignor, which demonstrate unmistakably in which of the two counties he regarded himself as a resident. We cannot say to you that you are to regard David Follweiler, at the time he made this assignment, as having been a resident of one county or the other. If you find his house, was on the line, you may regard that he had the right to elect in which county he would be treated and regarded as a resident.] (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">When I say he might elect, I do not mean simply that he might choose and do nothing in consequence of it, but if it is proved unmistakably that lie regarded and held himself out as a resident of ^he county of Schuylkill, and acted upon it, you will find that he was .a resident of the county of Schuyl-. kill, in which event the defendants would-be entitled to your verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">[It has been said in your hearing that it is proved David Folhveiler obtained a license from the court of Schuylkill county, and that a hotel was kept by him. Whether that is distinctly proved I do not recollect. The testimony on that point is for you. Witnesses testified that he voted repeatedly, in West Penn- township, Schuylkill county, before 1874, and while he lived in this new house. If you find that the line is not .the line as testified to by Stoudt, but the line is that which Creitz testified to and passed through the house, and if David Folhveiler, by his acts demonstrated that he regarded and treated himself as a resident of West Penn township, Schuylkill county, at the time of the assignment, you may find that the assignment was recorded as required by law and find in favor of the defendants. If you find the line as testified to by Mr. Stoudt to be the true line, then Mr. Folhveiler undoubtedly lived in Lynn township, in which event the plaim tiffs are entitled to a verdict, provided it is found that Jesse Follweiler was a creditor in 1874 when this assignment was made. If you find in favor of the plaintiffs, you will describe the tract of land, which description can be taken when you' bring in your verdict.

In answering this we would first say, that the facts that he, in the deed of assignment, describes himself as a resident of Schuylkill county, and that all the proceedings in the trust were in those courts, are in themselves <em>prima facie </em>evidence that he did live there, and of the regularity of, the proceedings, and must be overcome by the weight of testimony on the part of him who disputes the fact. But we are not without authority to sustain the position taken by the court below. In Story on Conflict of Laws, 8th ed., \u00a7 44, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the following: \u201cTwo things must then concur to constitute domicile: first, residence; secondly, the intention of making it the home of the party. There must be the- fact and the intent.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">In \u00a7 45 the author says: \u201c It is sometimes a matter of no small difficulty to decide in what\" place a person has his true or proper domicile, his residence is often of a very _equivocalnature, and his intention as to that residence is often still more obscure, both are sometimes to be gathered from slight circumstances of mere presumption and from equivocal and conflicting acts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">In Hindman\u2019s Appeal, 85 Penna. St., 468, it is said: \u201cIt was said in Abington <em>v. </em>North Bridgewater, 23 Pickering, 170 supra, \u2018it depends not upon proving particular facts, but whether all the facts and circumstances taken together tending to show that a man has his home or domicile in one place overbalance all the like proofs tending to establish it in another.\u2019 Applying this rule, which we believe to be a correct one, we think all the facts and circumstances proved clearly preponderate in favor of his domicile in Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">In Carey\u2019s Appeal, 25 Smith, 201, Gordon, J., says: \u201c Now applying these principles to the testator\u2019s case, and we find not one circumstance either of fact or law wanting to fix his domicile in Rhode Island. He resided there not only long enough for this purpose, but also for that of citizenship. It was the only place in the world where he had a permanent home. There was the abode of his family. In that most solemn instrument that man can set his hand to, his last will and testament, he describes himself as a citizen of that State ; it is there he pays taxes and there he votes. A more perfect combination of fact and intention is not conceivable. From whatever standpoint we view this residence we find it labelled domicile in unmistakable characters.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-9\">See also Guier <em>v. </em>O\u2019Daniel, 1 Binney, 349, n., Rush, P.

Jess\u00e9 Follweiler was present at the public sale when Mrs. Lutz purchased. Rebecca Fftllweiler, wife of Jesse, purchased at the sheriff\u2019s sale with full notice of Mrs. Lutz\u2019s title from the assignee. We submit that under the authorities Jesse Follweiler, the creditor, misconceived his remedy, and if it be admitted that Mrs. Follweiler had notice of the unrecorded title of Mrs. Lutz, then no title passed to her as purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale held by virtue of an execution on this judgment. Jesse Follweiler, as a creditor, had his remedy, whilst the estate was in process of settlement, and whilst the property remained unconverted and undistributed, if he intended honestly and fairly to contest the validity of the assignment by reason of the non-recording thereof. After the conversion and distribution of the estate he was too late to enforce his remedy in the manner he now attempts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-4\">On this point we beg leave to cite a few authorities: Stewart <em>v. </em>Minn., 5 W. &amp; S., 108; Weaver <em>v. </em>Samuel, 7 Pa.

This fact created doubt as to the county in which he actually resided.
