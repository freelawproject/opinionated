California courts have wrestled with the degree of force necessary to establish the kidnapping of an unresisting infant or young child, and our Supreme Court has concluded that the requisite force \u201cis simply the amount of physical force required to take and carry the child away a substantial distance for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent.\u201d <em>(In re Michele D. </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 610 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 59 P.3d 164].) The Legislature then codified this holding in Penal Code section 207, subdivision (e) (hereafter section 207(e)). Defendant, Michael Jiovanni Dalerio, deceived a nine-year-old child into voluntarily accompanying him and then physically escorted the child a substantial distance before attempting to kill her. In the published portion of our opinion, we conclude that this conduct constitutes a kidnapping under section 207(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The nine-year-old victim testified that on the morning of July 9, 2004, she saw defendant outside the home of her neighbors, minors Desiree and Dillon. When she asked defendant, whom she knew, if Desiree and Dillon were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>home, he told her they were in the park looking at a deer. When the victim walked to the park she saw defendant at the park gate, riding his bicycle. He rode his bicycle alongside her and the two talked as they continued into the park around the softball field and up onto a fire road. Defendant told her that Desiree and Dillon were with their mother looking at a deer he had sheltered. Once on the fire road, they passed a bridge and defendant told her to turn into the woods. When they reached the wooded area, he set his bicycle against a rock and led the way up a trail to a place he claimed her neighbors were located.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">After walking a short distance, they stopped. For five to 10 minutes while the victim followed him, defendant appeared to be looking for her neighbors. Defendant then placed one hand on the back of the victim\u2019s neck and the other over her mouth and said, \u201cDon\u2019t scream or I\u2019ll break your neck.\u201d The victim lay down on the ground and defendant started choking her. Before she lost consciousness, the victim urinated on herself. When she regained consciousness, she was holding a wet sock in her hand and was unable to locate one of her shoes. She put the sock back on her foot and walked down the trail toward her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Craig L. testified he saw the victim walking with her head down, leaves in her hair, a dirty shirt and one shoe missing. When Craig L. asked if she had fallen off her bicycle, she mumbled that her bike had broken the previous week. She then moved her hair back from her face and he noticed a gash over her eye. He asked her whether she was alone and whether she had been there all night. To these questions she answered in a monotone, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just woke up.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Craig L. took the victim to the Brooktrails Fire Department. The fire chief noted she was extremely confused and had blood on her face and a considerable amount of bruising. He contacted the sheriff\u2019s department and two deputies responded and met with the victim. Although she continued to appear disoriented, she was able to tell them her name, date of birth and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The victim was eventually transported to Howard Hospital where she was examined. As a result of the attack, she suffered abrasions of her face, burst capillaries in her eye, swelling of her lip and around her eye, and abrasions with small burst blood vessels along the back of her neck consistent with strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">On October 7, 2004, the victim and several law enforcement officials took 15 to 20 minutes to walk the path taken by the victim during the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Interview with Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On the day of the incident, the victim reviewed a photographic lineup and identified defendant as her assailant. When Detectives Alvarado and Bailey interviewed defendant after his arrest, he told them he slapped and punched the victim a couple of times because she \u201cwas real mean\u201d to his son and disrespected him by telling him to \u201cfuck off and shit.\u201d When the victim started screaming, he took her \u201cup into the woods . . . and then slamm[ed] her down,\u201d took one shoe and sock off her and put the sock in her mouth to quiet her. Although defendant claimed he did not remember what happened next, he ultimately said he \u201capparently . . . choked\u201d the victim. Before leaving the area, he threw branches and leaves on top of her. He believed he may have killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The jury convicted defendant of attempted murder with deliberation and premeditation (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, 189)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (count one) and kidnapping (\u00a7\u00a7 207, subd. (a), 208, subd. (b)) (count two) and found true a special allegation that defendant inflicted great bodily injury during the commission of the kidnapping (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the attempted murder conviction, the court sentenced defendant to a prison term of life with the possibility of parole and imposed a consecutive term of 14 years for the kidnapping.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant argues (1) the court erred in denying his motion under section 1118.1 for judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping charge; (2) imposing separate punishments for the kidnapping and attempted murder convictions violates section 654; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the attempted murder was committed with premeditation and deliberation. We reject each contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">I. <em>The Trial Court Properly Denied Defendant\u2019s Section 1118.1 Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, defendant moved under section 1118.1 for an entry of judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping and attempted murder charges. The court denied defendant\u2019s motion as to both offenses; defendant appeals the court\u2019s ruling as to the kidnapping charge only.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Section 1118.1 provides in relevant part: \u201cIn a case tried before a jury, the court on motion of the defendant. . . , at the close of the evidence on either side and before the case is submitted to the jury for decision, shall order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more of the offenses charged in the accusatory pleading if the evidence then before the court is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In ruling on a motion for acquittal under this provision, the trial court must consider whether from the evidence presented, including all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, there is any substantial evidence to support a finding of each element of the offense charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffman and Marlow </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 89 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 96 P.3d 30].)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We employ the same test on appeal: We review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether there is evidence which is reasonable, credible and of solid value, such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This inquiry does not require the reviewing court to ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Cuevas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 252, 260-261 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 135, 906 P.2d 1290] [application of sufficiency of evidence test in reviewing trial court\u2019s ruling on a section 1118.1 motion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In our review, we apply the corpus delicti rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\u201c 1 \u201c \u2018The corpus delicti of a crime consists of two elements!:] the fact of the injury or loss or harm, and the existence of a criminal agency as its cause.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018In any criminal prosecution, the corpus delicti must be established by the prosecution independently from the extrajudicial statements, confessions or admissions of the defendant.\u2019 [Citations.] Such independent proof may consist of circumstantial evidence [citations], and need not establish the crime beyond a reasonable doubt [citations].</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the corpus delicti rule is to assure that \u2018the accused is not admitting to a crime that never occurred.\u2019 [Citation.] The amount of independent proof of a crime required for this purpose is quite small; we have described this quantum of evidence as \u2018slight\u2019 [citation] or \u2018minimal\u2019 [citation]. The People need make only a prima facie showing \u2018 \u201cpermitting the reasonable inference that a crime was committed.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] The inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>need not be \u2018the only, or even the most compelling, one . . . [but need only be] a <em>reasonable </em>one .. ..\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 279, 301-302 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 793, 949 P.2d 890].)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Defendant argues there was no proof, independent of his statement, that a kidnapping occurred because, according to the victim, she accompanied him into the wooded area of the park voluntarily. Therefore, he contends, the trial court should have granted his section 1118.1 motion. We conclude the victim\u2019s testimony was sufficient to justify denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\u201cGenerally, to prove the crime of kidnapping, the prosecution must prove three elements: (1) a person was unlawfully moved by the use of physical force or fear; (2) the movement was without the person\u2019s consent; and (3) the movement of the person was for a substantial distance. (\u00a7 207, subd. (a).)\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Jones </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 455, 462 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 358], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In <em>In re Michele D., </em>the defendant, who was 15 years old, accompanied a woman and her 12-month-old daughter, Cameron, to a market. The defendant and the mother alternated pushing the baby in her stroller. At some point the defendant and the mother headed to different areas of the store, with defendant pushing Cameron in the stroller. When the defendant did not return, the police were called and found the defendant and Cameron approximately a mile and a half away. The defendant was accused of kidnapping. <em>(In re Michele D., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 603-604.) The Supreme Court recognized that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not satisfy the literal requirements of the kidnapping statute in that \u201cforce,\u201d as that term is conventionally understood, was not used to effect the illegal movement. Nevertheless, the court held, \u201c[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the Legislature did not intend. . . . [Citation.] The fact that the Legislature may not have considered every factual permutation of kidnapping, including the carrying off of an unresisting infant, does not mean the Legislature did not intend for the statute to reach that conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 606.) Recognizing that no prior California case had established the \u201cquantum of force necessary to establish the force element of kidnapping in the case of an infant or small child,\u201d the court set that standard as follows: \u201c[T]he amount of force required to kidnap an unresisting infant or child is simply the amount of physical force required to take and carry the child away a substantial distance for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 610.) This rule is now codified in section 207(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Defendant presents two arguments for distinguishing the facts of our case from the acts criminalized in section 207(e). First, he argues section 207(e) pertains only to <em>\u201cinfants and small </em>children,\u201d and not to the nine-year-old victim in this case. Second, he contends that <em>In re Michele D. </em>\u201cretained an element of force,\u201d \u201ca physical talcing,\u201d which is absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><em>Parnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 392 [173 Cal.Rptr. 906] <em>(Parnell), </em>cited with approval in <em>In re Michele D., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at page 609, is instructive on each contention. In <em>Parnell, </em>the defendant and an accomplice persuaded a seven-year-old boy to enter the defendant\u2019s car on the pretext they would give him a ride home. Once inside the car, the boy sat between the two men. After the child stated that they had passed his home, the men told him they would call his parents and ask if he might spend the night. After arriving at a rented cabin 20 miles away, and staying there for several nights, the defendant told the boy he had appeared in court and obtained custody of him. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 398.) Though no force or fear was utilized to accomplish this abduction, the kidnapping conviction was affirmed. The court stated the kidnapping of a minor could be accomplished \u201ceven if unaccompanied by force so long as it was done for an improper purpose, because a minor \u2018is too young to give his legal consent to being taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 402-403, fn. 3, quoting <em>People v. Oliver </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 761, 764-765 [12 Cal.Rptr. 865, 361 P.2d 593].) \u201c[The victim] was not informed of [the defendant\u2019s] intent to permanently take him from his home and, even if he knew, it is questionable whether he could have appreciated the significance of a permanent severance from his home and family. [His] near passive conduct should not be construed as consent; rather, it more logically evidences the inability of a minor to give a knowing consent.\u201d <em>(Parnell, </em>at p. 403, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The same reasoning applies here. A nine year old certainly qualifies as a \u201cyoung child,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, due to defendant\u2019s deception, the victim was no more able to appreciate her peril than the <em>Parnell </em>victim. Moreover, once the victim encountered defendant at the park entrance, he directed her to a wooded area, physically escorting her to this remote location, where he tried to murder her. This is not a situation where an adult engages in a deception to persuade a child to meet him later in a secluded spot and commits a crime when the victim appears. Section 207, subdivision (b) proscribes the movement of a child under the age of 14 procured by deception alone, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>when that deception is for the purpose of committing any act defined in section 288.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 207(e) requires a taking and that component is satisfied where, as here, the defendant relies on deception to obtain a child\u2019s consent to walk with him and then, through verbal directions and his <em>constant physical presence, </em>takes the child a substantial distance for an illegal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><em>People v. Oliver, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d 761, relied on in both <em>Parnell </em>and <em>In re Michele D. </em>supports this conclusion. In <em>Oliver, </em>the defendant was charged with kidnapping a two-year-old infant and thereafter committing a lewd and lascivious act with the child. The only evidence of \u201cforce\u201d was testimony that the defendant was observed walking down an alley, leading the victim by the hand. <em>(Oliver, </em>at pp. 763-764.) In fact, the Supreme Court stated that the victim went \u201cwillingly\u201d with the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 764.) The court held that where a defendant is charged with kidnapping a child \u201ctoo young to give . . . legal consent to being taken,\u201d it is both necessary and sufficient to show that the child was taken \u201cfor an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 764, 768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Defendant argues, unpersuasively, that <em>Oliver </em>and <em>Parnell </em>should be distinguished because each involved a physical taking: In <em>Oliver, </em>the accused held the child\u2019s hand and, in <em>Parnell, </em>a vehicle was utilized to transport the child. But, since the children in <em>Oliver, Parnell </em>and here did not resist, the use of the car in <em>Parnell </em>and the handholding in <em>Oliver </em>are simply immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Thus, under section 207(e), evidence that a defendant deceives a young child into walking with him a substantial distance away from public view, leaving her particularly vulnerable to his attack, is sufficient to satisfy the corpus delicti rule in a kidnapping case. The evidence submitted by the prosecution in its case-in-chief justified denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal without consideration of his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Jones, P.

If such a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence offered by the prosecution is not granted, the defendant may offer evidence without first having reserved that right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> Section 207, subdivision (a) defines kidnapping in relevant part as follows: \u201cEvery person who forcibly, or by any other means of instilling fear, steals or takes, or holds, detains, or arrests any person in this state, and carries the person into another country, state, or county, or into another part of the same county, is guilty of kidnapping.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\"> Section 207(e) is expressly limited to situations where the victim of the alleged kidnapping is an \u201cunresisting infant or child.\u201d The language comes directly from <em>In re Michele D., </em>but one can plausibly argue that <em>In re Michele D. </em>only intended the rule to apply to infants and young children, because it articulated the rule in response to the need for a standard setting the level of force necessary to establish a kidnapping of an \u201cinfant or small child.\u201d <em>(In re Michele D., supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 610.)
