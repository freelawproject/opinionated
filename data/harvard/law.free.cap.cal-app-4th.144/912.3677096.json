J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcO\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address an issue of first impression and hold that Penal Code section 12101, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (possession of live ammunition by minor) is violated only once by a minor who simultaneously possesses three different types of ammunition. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we hold there was sufficient evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding the minor was holding the ammunition for the benefit of a criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The minor, Carleisha P, was declared a ward of the juvenile court, pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602. The petition was sustained after the juvenile court found true three allegations that Carleisha had been in possession of live ammunition (\u00a7 12101, subd. (b)). The juvenile court also found true allegations that Carleisha had been holding this ammunition for the benefit of a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rule of appellate review <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103], the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Los Angeles Police Officer Brian Coleman was assigned to a gang enforcement unit. On May 8, 2005, he and his partner were patrolling near 55th Street and Budlong Avenue. This was an area claimed by the Five Deuce Hoovers, a gang also known as the 52 Hoovers. The officers saw Carleisha standing on the sidewalk, wearing an orange long-sleeved shirt underneath a white T-shirt. The 52 Hoovers identify with the color orange. A few days earlier, Coleman had learned Carleisha was on probation and had an outstanding warrant. Coleman and his partner arrested Carleisha on the warrant. She told them \u201cshe was a Rolling 60 Neighborhood Crip member with a moniker of La-La Blue.\u201d Asked if Carleisha had mentioned \u201cany other association with gangs,\u201d Coleman testified, \u201cShe stated that she had family that associated with the Five Deuce Hoovers and that she [lives] in that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Coleman contacted Carleisha\u2019s probation officer, who verified she had a gang search condition attached to her probation. The police officers then went to Carleisha\u2019s house, which was just down the block. There, Carleisha\u2019s mother directed the officers to the bedroom Carleisha shared with two sisters. On the top shelf of the bedroom closet, officers found a .30-caliber M-l rifle. Next to it was a rifle magazine containing .30-caliber bullets. Also on the closet shelf was a small baggie containing two .38-caliber bullets and one .357-caliber bullet. Inside the same closet, police found several items of orange clothing, as well as a pair of orange and blue tennis shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">On a door leading from this bedroom into a bathroom, police found a laminated Miller Genuine Draft wall poster, on the back of which there was gang graffiti. The graffiti contained a positive reference to the 52 Hoovers and negative references to various other gangs. Coleman testified the negative references \u201cincluded the number 40 crossed out with a \u2018K\u2019 at the end and \u201855K,\u2019 crossed out, \u201858K\u2019 crossed out and I believe \u201860K\u2019 crossed out. [|] Q And what does that signify? [1] A Through my training and experience and seeing numerous [sz'c] gang graffiti, it represents 40 Killer, 55 Neighborhood Crip Killer, 58 Neighborhood Crip Killer and Rolling Sixties Neighborhood Crip Killer.\u201d Coleman explained the significance of the cross-outs: \u201cIt\u2019s a derogatory writing . . . meaning that they don\u2019t approve of that gang or their rival gang and these gangs are rival gangs in the area neighboring the Five Deuce Hoovers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Coleman testified the \u201cHoovers are a type of Crip gang,\u201d but that \u201cNeighborhood Crips and Hoovers generally do not get along . . . .\u201d He had seen situations in which \u201cpeople [who] have lived in two different areas have associated with one gang and moved to a new area . . . controlled by another gang, and they . . . started associating with the new gang in the new neighborhood that they live in. [][] And also if they have family members that are from a different gang, they might be rivals, but as family members, they still associate with one another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Detective Andrew Paredes testified he had been working the gang detail for the last five years. Specifically, he had been assigned to work on the Hoover sets, one of which was the 52 Hoovers. He described the usual gang participants as including: (1) \u201can O.G.,\u201d who is \u201ca person that\u2019s in charge that puts in his work that\u2019s been in the gang for a while, meaning years, usually older\u201d; (2) \u201csoldiers,\u201d who \u201cput in the work for the gang, meaning dealing the drugs, carrying the weapons\u201d; and (3) \u201cassociates\u201d who, while not actual members of the gang, \u201chang out with the gang\u201d and assist \u201cthe other gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>members by hiding stuff [and] by committing crimes.\u201d Asked, \u201cNow, this particular gang, 52 Hoover, what types of crimes do you know them to commit?\u201d, Paredes testified: \u201cThey commit a lot of crimes. They commit crimes for [vz'c] murder, drive-by shootings, robberies, kidnappings, shoot <em>[sic] </em>robberies, bank robberies, weapons violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The prosecutor then asked Paredes a hypothetical question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">\u201cQ Now, let me pose a series of facts to you, and I\u2019d like to get your opinion regarding those facts. H] If there\u2019s an associate of the Hoovers, a person who admits to be an associate of the 52 Hoover gang and they keep an assault rifle ... in their closet in their bedroom, would you have an opinion as to what that person is having that rifle in their closet for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">\u201cQ And what would your opinion be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">\u201cA My opinion, where an individual is an associate, basically they\u2019re putting in work for the gang. They\u2019re trying to become gang members; so in this way, they\u2019ll put work in. [][] The other gang members will use this individual by giving them the guns to store the guns, to hide the guns, hide narcotics. So they have these weapons for their enterprise, their protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-9\">\u201cQ Let me put one additional fact in there. [][] Specifically if the associate is a female, would that add to the equation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-10\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-11\">\u201cQ How?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-12\">\u201cA Basically, these gang members out there use these females if it isn\u2019t for using them for sex, they\u2019re using them to hide narcotics, to hide weapons. So a lot of times, when we stop them out there, the females will have narcotics on them or they\u2019ll have guns. There\u2019s certain places that we can\u2019t search them and then there might not be a female out there to assist us to search them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-13\">\u201cQ And would it be your opinion that... the person who [had the] assault rifle in their bedroom[] . . . let\u2019s say you take also the fact that besides this person admitting they\u2019re an associate, that they also have a\u2014let me show you this poster, People\u2019s 3A, that poster represents gang\u2014any type of gang involvement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>\u201cA Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">\u201cQ Can you tell us what would your opinion be regarding that poster?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">\u201cA In my opinion ... if this individual had this, this person is definitely a gang member, because basically what it is, it\u2019s telling me you got the Hoover sign with the index middle finger showing the \u2018H.\u2019 You got the rival gang being crossed out, 40 Killer, Five Killer, Five Eight Killer, 60 Killer, you got all\u2014all their enemies they got crossed out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">\u201cQ Now, if that was also found in . . . the room[,] along with the admission and this weapon, would you have an opinion as to what this weapon was possessed for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">\u201cA In my opinion, weapon[\u2019]s being possessed for the gang, individual\u2019s storing the gun or the rifle in their closet... in furtherance of the gang to sell their narcotics, to have protection for rival gang members or if . . . they\u2019re going to go do a drive-by shooting at a rival gang.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Paredes testified he had experience dealing with both the 52 Hoovers and the Rolling 60 Neighborhood Crips, and that the two gangs are \u201csupposed to be\u201d enemies. Asked, \u201c[I]f someone was ... a Neighborhood Crip and they move into 52 Hoover territory, ... if those individuals had family members who are also 52 Hoover, is it uncommon for them to associate with 52 Hoover since they live in their territory and have family members that are also from that set?\u201d, Paredes testified: \u201cThat\u2019s a common thing, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">The prosecution put into evidence two minute orders showing prior convictions sustained by two persons, Carl Lynks and Troy Washington. Lynks had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon in May 2002; Washington had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in March 2004. Paredes testified he was familiar with these men and that they were both Five Deuce Hoover gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">One of Carleisha\u2019s sisters testified she had seen the Miller beer poster in their bedroom. The poster did not belong to Carleisha; a visitor to their house had left it behind about eight months before police found it. She never saw the poster hanging up on the bathroom door: \u201cNo, it was never hanging anywhere. It was always rolled up . . . .\u201d The sister also testified she had never before seen the rifle police found in the bedroom closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>3. <em>Juvenile court\u2019s findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The juvenile petition alleged in count 1 that Carleisha had been in possession of an assault weapon in violation of section 12280, and it alleged in counts 2 through 4 that she had been in possession of live ammunition in violation of section 12101. The petition further alleged Carleisha had committed these acts for the benefit of a criminal street gang. The juvenile court concluded Carleisha had been in possession of the gun found in her bedroom, but that there was insufficient evidence to prove the gun was an assault weapon. Accordingly, the juvenile court dismissed count 1 of the petition. The juvenile court found there was sufficient evidence to prove Carleisha had committed three violations of section 12101, subdivision (b)(1), because she was in possession of three different kinds of live ammunition. The juvenile court also found Carleisha had been holding this ammunition for the benefit of the 52 Hoovers.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">1. There was insufficient evidence to prove the gang enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">2. Carleisha violated section 12101, subdivision (b), once, not three times.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">[[..................................]]</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">2. <em>Multiple convictions for possessing three kinds of live \u201cammunition\u201d were improper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Carleisha contends that, by finding she had committed three violations of section 12101, subdivision (b) (minor in possession of live ammunition), the juvenile court improperly split a single offense into multiple crimes. We conclude this claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">Section 12101, subdivision (b), provides, in its entirety: \u201c(1) A minor shall not possess live ammunition. [][] (2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply if one of the following circumstances exists: [f] (A) The minor has the written consent of his or her parent or legal guardian to possess live ammunition. [][] (B) The minor is accompanied by his or her parent or legal guardian, [f] (C) The minor is actively engaged in, or is going to or from, a lawful, recreational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>sport, including, but not limited to, competitive shooting, or agricultural, ranching, or hunting activity, the nature of which involves the use of a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Carleisha contends her simultaneous possession of more than one bullet constituted only a single violation of this statute. The Attorney General contends there were three violations because Carleisha was in possession of three different <em>types </em>of ammunition: the .38-caliber and .357-caliber bullets found in the plastic bag, and the .30-caliber bullets found in the rifle magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">This issue presents a question of first impression regarding the appropriate unit of prosecution under section 12101, subdivision (b). \u201cA single crime cannot be fragmented into more than one offense. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rouser </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1065, 1073 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 563]; see, e.g., <em>People v. Lyons </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 245, 275 [324 P.2d 556], disapproved on other grounds by <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 32 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468] [defendant committed crime of receiving stolen property only once where he received watch and fur coat at same time, even though items had been stolen from different victims].)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The Attorney General argues the result here should be the same as the result in drug cases, where the simultaneous possession of different kinds of illegal drugs properly results in multiple convictions. The Attorney General cites the well-established rule that \u201cpossession of narcotics under different classifications of the Health and Safety Code may be charged and punished as separate crimes notwithstanding a simultaneous possession constituting but one transaction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schroeder </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 217, 228 [70 Cal.Rptr. 491] [defendant properly convicted separately for possessing morphine and opium]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Seaberry </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 507, 508 [510, 67 Cal.Rptr. 182] [defendant committed \u201ctwo violations of [former] Health and Safety Code, section 11911, for possessing for purpose of sale two restricted dangerous drugs, seconal and Benzedrine\u201d because these \u201care different and distinct types of drugs\u201d]; <em>People v. Lockwood </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 75, 82-83 [61 Cal.Rptr. 131] [defendant\u2019s simultaneous possession of codeine and opium properly resulted in two convictions for violating former Health and Safety Code section 11500]; <em>People v. Lopez </em>(1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 344, 351 [337 P.2d 570] [defendant\u2019s \u201cpossession of each of the three different and distinct types of narcotics [heroin, marijuana and amidone], even at the same time, constituted three separate offenses\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>But the result in these drug cases depends on the fact the drug statutes themselves classify prohibited drugs by types. That is, multiple convictions are proper because individual drug statutes enumerate and proscribe multiple kinds of illegal drugs. (See, e.g., Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11054, 11055, 11056.) Unlike these drug statutes, however, section 12101, subdivision (b), only proscribes the possession of \u201clive ammunition\u201d without making any further classification. And the Legislature has certainly demonstrated elsewhere that further classifications could be made. (See, e.g., \u00a7 666.7, subd. (j)(l) [\u201cammunition . . . designed primarily to penetrate metal or armor\u201d]; \u00a7 12020, subd. (a)(1) [\u201cany ammunition which contains or consists of any flechette dart\u201d]; \u00a7 12020, subd. (b)(6) [\u201cTracer ammunition manufactured for use in shotguns.\u201d]; \u00a7 12316, subd. (a)(1)(A) [\u201creloaded ammunition\u201d]; \u00a7 12301, subd. (a)(1) [\u201ctracer or incendiary ammunition\u201d]; \u00a7 12320 [\u201chandgun ammunition designed primarily to penetrate metal or armor\u201d]; \u00a7 12581 [\u201c \u2018Blowgun ammunition\u2019 \u201d]; \u00a7 12601, subd. (b)(10) [\u201cindustrial ammunition\u201d]; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 12001, subd. (b) [\u201c[s]mall arms ammunition of .75 caliber or less\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Carleisha argues the word \u201c \u2018[a]mmunition\u2019 is a noun that by its nature embraces the plural,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe simultaneous possession of three live rounds can only give rise to one violation of the statute.\u201d The Attorney General disagrees: \u201c[Appellant\u2019s argument on statutory construction is unconvincing because, contrary to her assertion, <em>\u2018ammunition \u2019 does not \u2018by its nature embrace the plural.\u2019 </em>The Wikipedia Encyclopedia states that \u2018ammunition\u2019 is a \u2018generic military term meaning (the assembly of) a projectile and its propellant.\u2019 Hence, <em>one bullet can be \u2018ammunition.\u2019 </em>Because appellant was in possession of three different types of bullets, or three different types of ammunition, she was properly charged and convicted of three violations of section 12101, subdivision (b)(1).\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">But the question is not whether \u201cammunition\u201d <em>can </em>mean a single bullet. Carleisha does not claim otherwise. Rather, she is arguing the word means <em>both </em>one bullet <em>and </em>more than one bullet; i.e., that although \u201cammunition\u201d is a grammatically singular noun, it embraces <em>both </em>singular and plural meanings. The relevant question, therefore, is whether the Attorney General is correct in asserting the word \u201cammunition\u201d does not inherently embrace the plural. We conclude, based on our analyses of the word\u2019s definition and grammar, its common usage and its legislative usage, that the Attorney General is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The ordinary dictionary definition of \u201cammunition\u201d includes the plural.

Thus, count nouns \u201chave singular and plural forms,\u201d \u201ccan use a, an, or one as a modifier,\u201d and \u201ccan use \u2018many\u2019 as a modifier.\u201d Mass nouns, on the other hand, \u201care uncountable by a number\u201d and have to be \u201cquantified by a word that signifies amount,\u201d which is why it is incorrect to say \u201cfour woods, one rice, three courages.\u201d \u201cTo measure or classify mass nouns [a speaker must] use \u2018of\u2019 after a measurement: a foot of wood, a pound of rice, an ounce of courage, a bar of chocolate, a piece of music, a bag of money.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Our Supreme Court regularly uses the word \u201cammunition\u201d in a way that embraces both the singular and the plural, adding a measurement word if the context calls for quantification.

(See, e.g., \u00a7 189 [first degree murder includes murder \u201cperpetrated by means of . . . ammunition designed primarily to penetrate metal or armor\u201d]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714, subd. (a) [\u201cdesign, distribution, or marketing of firearms and ammunition is not exempt from the duty to use ordinary care and skill\u201d]; Fish &amp; G. Code, \u00a7 2010 [\u201cthe commission may . . . adopt regulations relative to the ammunition capacity of shotguns for taking mammals or birds\u201d]; Fish &amp; G. Code, \u00a74181.5 [\u201cRifle ammunition used shall have expanding bullets; shotgun ammunition shall have only single slugs.\u201d]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 50081, subd. (a) [\u201clocal agency shall furnish each newly hired police officer . . . with a service revolver or other suitable pistol, holster, belt and ammunition\u201d]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 69927, subd. (a)(4) [\u201ccosts of ammunition, batons, bulletproof vests, handcuffs, holsters, . . . uniforms, and one primary duty sidearm\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cammunition\u201d in section 12101, subdivision (b), appears to be consistent with this practice. One of the few decisions to construe this statute is <em>In re Khamphouy S. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1130 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 882]. In the course of finding sufficient evidence to prove that ammunition found in the minor\u2019s possession was \u201clive,\u201d <em>Khamphouy S. </em>had this to say: \u201c \u2018Live ammunition\u2019 as contemplated by the Legislature under this statute consists of any material (i.e., projectiles, shells, or bullets) in the present state of being capable of being fired or detonated from a pistol, revolver or any firearm. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">In subdivision (b)(2) of section 12101, the Legislature set forth exceptions to the prohibition on possessing live ammunition. One exception arises if the minor has \u201cwritten consent\u201d from a parent or guardian \u201cto possess live ammunition\u201d (\u00a7 12101, subd. (b)(2)(A)). We doubt the Legislature thought minors were going to get written permission to possess only a single bullet. Another exception arises if the minor \u201cis actively engaged in ... a lawful, recreational sport, including, but not limited to, competitive shooting, or agricultural, ranching, or hunting activity, the nature of which involves the use of a firearm\u201d (\u00a7 12101, subd. (b)(2)(C)). We doubt the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>thought a competitive shooting event or a hunting trip would involve only single bullets. Carleisha\u2019s reading of subdivision (b)(1) is consistent with the apparent meaning of subdivision (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In sum, we conclude that, consistent with its technical meaning, ordinary usage and general legislative usage, the word \u201cammunition\u201d in section 12101, subdivision (b), prohibits the possession of <em>any quantity </em>of live ammunition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, a minor\u2019s possession of one or more bullets, whether of the same or different types, constitutes only a single offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">3. <em>Rule of lenity applicable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Even if we were not confident in this conclusion, we would hold the statute was at least ambiguous on this point and apply the rule of lenity in Carleisha\u2019s favor. \u201cWhen ... the language of a penal law is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, we construe the law \u2018as favorably to criminal defendants as reasonably permitted by the statutory language and circumstances of the application of the particular law at issue.\u2019 [Citations.] This \u2018protects the individual against arbitrary discretion by officials and judges and guards against judicial usurpation of the legislative function which would result from enforcement of penalties when the legislative branch did not clearly prescribe them.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robles </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1106, 1115 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 120, 5 P.3d 176]; see also <em>People v. Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 622 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713] [\u201cAlthough it is the policy of this state to have courts construe penal laws as favorably to criminal defendants as reasonably permitted by the statutory language and circumstances of the application of the particular law at issue [citations], that policy generally comes into play only when the language of the penal law \u2018is susceptible of two constructions\u2019. . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Applying the rule of lenity, we would hold that, because the proper unit of prosecution under section 12101, subdivision (b), is ambiguous, Carleisha\u2019s conduct violated the statute only once. Hence, we agree with Carleisha that the juvenile court improperly found she violated section 12101 three times because the evidence showed she violated the statute only once.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part. We reverse two of the findings that Carleisha violated section 12101, but we affirm the third such finding. We also affirm the finding that she violated this statute for the benefit of a criminal street gang. We remand this case to the juvenile court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Croskey, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 14, 2007, S148650.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-11\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 912.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\"> Merriam-Webster defines \u201cmass noun\u201d as \u201ca noun (as <em>sand </em>or <em>water) </em>that characteristically denotes in many languages a homogeneous substance or a concept without subdivisions and that in English is preceded in indefinite singular constructions by <em>some </em>rather than <em>a </em>or <em>an </em>. . . .\u201d (Merriam-Webster Dict.
