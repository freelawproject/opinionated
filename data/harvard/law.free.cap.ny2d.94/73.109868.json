The issue before us is whether 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a) immunizes the municipality from liability for monetary damages. Under that section, immunity extends to any claim against a municipality \u201carising from the regulation of cable service.\u201d We conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 claim arises from the regulation of cable service, and therefore uphold dismissal of the complaint against the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Defendant Town of Woodstock (the municipality) granted non-party Kingston Cablevision, Inc., a franchise for the construction and operation of a cable television system. In the franchise agreement, Kingston Cablevision agreed to provide public access capability to the municipality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement further provided that \u201c[r]ules and regulations for use of the public access capability shall be promulgated by [the municipality].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In accordance with that provision, the municipality promulgated regulations (the Regulations) and delegated management of the channel to defendant Woodstock Public Access Committee (the WPAC), a body consisting of five people chosen by the municipality\u2019s Town Board. Among the Regulations is a provision prohibiting the presentation of material that constitutes libel, slander or invasion of privacy. The municipality\u2019s Regulations further provide that \u201c[w]hen program violations are brought to the attention of the WPAC, it may take such steps that are necessary to comply with WPAC regulations, and applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Shortly after the public access channel began broadcasting, Ronald Rybacki produced and appeared in his own weekly television program on its airwaves. Plaintiff Elizabeth Caprotti, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>who had briefly dated Rybacki, alleges that he used his program to wage a vicious campaign of harassment against her by repeatedly defaming her and her three sons \u2014 also plaintiffs in this action \u2014 on television. Plaintiffs assert that despite their complaints to members of the municipality\u2019s Town Board and WPAC, the municipality refused to stop Rybacki\u2019s defamatory broadcasts, and thereby willfully failed to comply with the Regulations, The nature of these allegations is not in dispute. Indeed, Rybacki reportedly was prosecuted criminally for harassing the plaintiffs, and an order of protection was issued against him prohibiting him from discussing plaintiffs on the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Plaintiffs sued the municipality, members of its Town Board, the WPAC, members of the WPAC, the channel\u2019s station manager (collectively, the municipal defendants) and Rybacki, seeking compensatory and punitive damages for common-law defamation. Rybacki defaulted, and a judgment was entered against him. Supreme Court held that 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a) clothed the municipal defendants with immunity from liability for monetary damages, and the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed. We agree with the reasoning of the courts below, and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Statutory Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (the 1984 Act) was the first comprehensive Federal statute regulating the cable television industry. A stated, primary purpose of the legislation was to \u201cassure that cable communications provide and are encouraged to provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 521 [4]). In keeping with that aim, Congress sought to insure that cable companies devote portions of their systems to programming over which the companies had no editorial control, thereby providing the public with additional avenues of information (s<em>ee, </em>Note, <em>Denver Area Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC And The Public Forum Status Of Cable Access Channels, </em>63 Brook L Rev 955, 961-962 [Fall 1997]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The 1984 Act furthered the objective by empowering a local municipality, as franchisor, to require that a cable operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>company establish \u201cpublic access channels\u201d (i.e., channels that are operated by the local municipality and are not controlled by the cable operator). <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress envisioned that public access channels would become \u201cthe video equivalent of the speaker\u2019s soapbox or the electronic parallel to the printed leaflet\u201d (HR Rep No. 98-934, 98th Cong, 2d Sess, at 59, reprinted in 1984 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News 4655, 4696).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">By placing municipalities in the regulatory arena, however, the 1984 Act exposed them to numerous lawsuits brought by cable companies asserting that their First Amendment rights were violated when they were not awarded municipal cable contracts <em>(see, </em>S Rep No. 102-92, 102d Cong, 2d Sess, at 48-49, reprinted in 1992 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News 1133, 1181). Thus, when Congress restructured the 1984 Act and passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in 1992, it included section 555a (a), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">\u201c[i]n any court proceeding * * * involving <em>any claim </em>against a franchising authority or other governmental entity * * * <em>arising from the regulation of cable service </em>or from a decision of approval or disapproval with respect to a grant, renewal, transfer or amendment of a franchise, <em>any relief, </em>to the extent such relief is required by any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, <em>shall be limited to injunctive relief and declaratory relief </em>\u2019 (47 USC \u00a7 555a [a] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The issue before us is whether plaintiffs\u2019 tort claim, which is predicated on the municipal defendants\u2019 decision to allow Ry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>backi to continue broadcasting defamatory speech, \u201caris[es] from the regulation of cable service\u201d and is therefore defeated by the immunity provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">By its plain and unconditional terms, section 555a (a) grants a local municipality broad immunity from monetary liability that arises out of \u201cany\u201d of the municipality\u2019s regulatory decisions involving cable television. We hold that the municipal defendants made a regulatory decision when they allowed Rybacki to continue on the air in the face of persistent complaints. Although we are mindful of the undisputed defamatory nature of Rybacki\u2019s broadcasts, our role is not to decide whether the municipality\u2019s decision was a good one; our focus is limited to whether the municipality \u201cregulat[ed]\u201d cable service, and we conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">By statutory grant, the municipality is vested with authority to address allegedly defamatory programming <em>(see, </em>47 USC \u00a7 531 [b]). Based on that authority, the municipality promulgated what it aptly called \u201cRegulations.\u201d By deciding to permit Rybacki to continue his broadcasts on their public access channel, the municipal defendants were engaged in \u201cregulation\u201d of cable service to no less a degree than had they stopped him.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Nothing in section 555a (a)\u2019s legislative history diminishes the breadth of the immunity conferred by the statute\u2019s plain terms. We agree that, as plaintiffs point out, the immunity provision was motivated by the need to protect local franchising authorities \u201cfrom being pressured into making unmeritorious franchising decisions by the threat of expensive damages litigation by cable companies\u201d <em>(see, </em>138 Cong Rec H6487, H6530 [July 23, 1992]). Indeed, the original provision passed by the Senate immunized local franchising authorities from monetary liability solely \u201cin cases where the franchising authorities are charged with violating a cable operator\u2019s First Amendment rights arising from actions authorized or required by [the 1984] act\u201d (HR Conf Rep No. 102-862, 102d Cong, 2d Sess, at 98, reprinted in 1992 US Code Cong <em>&amp; </em>Admin News 1231, 1280). The scope of the statute\u2019s immunity was, however, significantly broadened during the course of the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In the end, Congress expanded the Senate\u2019s original proposed immunity provision by adopting the significantly broader House amendment. The final version thus extends municipal immunity to \u201cany claim * * * arising from the regulation of cable service <em>or </em>from a decision of approval or disapproval with respect to a grant, renewal, transfer or amendment of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>franchise\u201d <em>(see, </em>HR Conf Rep No. 102-862, <em>op. cit., </em>at 99 [emphasis added]). If Congress was concerned exclusively with immunity from suits by aggrieved cable operators, it would not have deliberately enacted the additional sphere of immunity from any claims \u201carising out of the regulation of cable service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The dissent would allow plaintiffs to maintain a defamation action for money damages, concluding that the right to such relief is not preempted by the 1984 and 1992 Acts. We disagree and rest our determination on the plain language of section 555a (a), which except for declaratory and injunctive relief, expressly precludes \u201cany claim against a franchising authority or other governmental entity * * * arising from the regulation of cable service.\u201d Unlike the Federal statutes at issue in cases cited by the dissent, section 555a (a) leaves no room for guesswork or interpretation. Preemption is not implied; it is express. The statute unambiguously preempts \u201cany relief, to the extent that such relief is required by any provision of* * * State, or local law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">At least one other municipality has successfully invoked section 555a (a) under facts analogous to these. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, in <em>Coplin v Fairfield Pub. Access Tel. Comm. </em>(111 F3d 1395, 1408 [1997]), held that section 555a (a) immunized a municipality from monetary liability in a lawsuit arising out of the municipality\u2019s regulatory decision concerning programming content on its public access channel. In <em>Coplin, </em>however, the municipality decided to ban, rather than continue, a program that aired allegedly defamatory statements <em>(see, Coplin v Fairfield Pub. Access Tel. Comm., supra, </em>at 1400). Like the municipal defendants here, the municipality in <em>Coplin </em>was sued because of the manner in which it regulated its public access channel\u2019s programming <em>(see, Coplin v Fairfield Pub. Access Tel. Comm., supra, </em>at 1400). For purposes of our analysis, we see no meaningful distinction between <em>Coplin </em>and the case at bar. If cable television may be likened to a faucet of public information, one regulates the faucet no less by deciding to let it run than by turning it off.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-10\">. In 1984, Congress enacted the Cable Communications Policy Act (Pub L No. 98-549, 98 US Stat 2779 <em>et seq. </em>[codified as amended in scattered sections of 47 USC]), which expressly permits a \u201cfranchising authority\u201d (i.e., a local municipality empowered to grant a cable television franchise) to include in its franchise proposal to a cable operating company a statement that the municipality reserves channels for public, educational or government use (47 USC \u00a7 531).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. A \u201ccable operator,\u201d is the entity that \u201cprovides cable service over a cable system and * * * owns a significant interest in such cable system\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 522 [5]). In the case before us, non-party Kingston Cablevision, Inc., is a \u201ccable operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">In the pleadings and in their brief, plaintiffs refer to the municipality as the cable operator. If we were to consider the municipality as the operator, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>would not avail plaintiffs, considering that the municipality as \u201coperator\u201d would be covered by the immunity provision of section 558, which provides that \u201ccable operators shall not incur * * * liability for any program carried on any [access channel] * * * unless the program involves obscene material\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 558). We base our decision, however, on the immunity provision of section 555a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\">. <em>See, </em>47 USC \u00a7 531 (b). The 1984 Act authorizes municipalities to require cable operators to provide two types of \u201caccess channels\u201d: (1) leased access channels (47 USC \u00a7 532), and (2) public access channels (47 USC \u00a7 531). Leased access channels are channels that cable operators lease commercially to unaffiliated third parties. On the other hand, public access channels are managed independently by local municipalities. A local municipality is granted a public access channel as a quid-pro-quo for the cable operator being allowed to use the public rights-of-way to construct its cable system (see, Note, 63 Brook L Rev, <em>op. cit., </em>at 960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\">. Pub L No. 102-385, 106 US Stat 1460 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 47 USC).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-7\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD5\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. Defendants are the Town of Woodstock, its Town Board and Public Access Committee, and the manager of the Town\u2019s public access cable television station. They do not contest the allegations of the complaint that for four years (between 1991 and 1995) Ronald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Rybacki produced and hosted a weekly two-hour television program on the Woodstock public access cable channel in which he regularly and repeatedly defamed and vilified in obscene terms plaintiffs Elizabeth Caprotti and her three sons. Just within the period of 90 days prior to the filing of plaintiffs\u2019 notice of claim, Rybacki made nine defamatory statements, characterizing Caprotti as a drug addict and a bisexual, who even indulged her addiction and sexual practices in the beauty shop she operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Defendants do not dispute that Caprotti repeatedly complained to them about Rybacki\u2019s attacks and remonstrated with them to take him off the air. Nor is it disputed that defendant had the legal power, under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (47 USC \u00a7\u00a7 521-573) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Cable Acts) and the Public Access Committee\u2019s own regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold Rybacki\u2019s use of the public access channel for his constitutionally unprotected expressions <em>(see, </em>47 USC \u00a7 531 [b], [c]; <em>Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium v Federal Communications Commn., </em>518 US 727, 761-762; <em>McClellan v Cablevision of Conn., </em>149 F3d 161, 168 [2d Cir]). Nevertheless, defendants concede that they declined to take Rybacki off the public access channel or otherwise control his defamatory communications and, thus, Caprotti was compelled to endure the personal anguish, public humiliation and economic loss of beauty shop clientele from his televised attacks over that lengthy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Defendants do not contest that, by knowingly enabling Rybacki to spread his defamatory lies over the Town\u2019s public access cable channel, they facilitated Rybacki\u2019s publication of the libels and, therefore, are joint tortfeasors under New York common-law principles of defamation <em>(see, Youmans v Smith, </em>153 NY 214, 218-219; <em>Anderson v New York Tel. Co., </em>35 NY2d 746, 750 [Gabrielli, J., concurring]; <em>see also, Hartmann v Winchell, </em>296 NY 296, 304 [Fuld, J., concurring]).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The majority, however, has accepted the sole defense advanced here to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 State tort damage causes of action, that 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a), added to the Cable Acts\u2019 statutory scheme by the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, immunizes defendants from liability for monetary damages. Thus, the majority holds that section 555a (a) of the Cable Acts expressly preempts plaintiffs\u2019 damages claims. In <em>doing </em>so, the majority ignores principles of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>interpretation the Supreme Court has imposed in applying the Supremacy Clause (US Const, art VI, cl [2]) in express preemption cases.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The majority impliedly concedes that its expansive reading of section 555a (a) finds no support in the legislative history, merely finding that the legislative history fails to \u201cdiminish [ ] the breadth of the immunity conferred by the statute\u2019s <em>plain </em>terms\u201d (majority opn, at 78 [emphasis supplied]). It leaves no doubt regarding its exclusive reliance on the plain meaning doctrine in finding express preemption. \u201cWe * * * rest our determination on the plain language of section 555a (a)\u201d (majority opn, at 79). The majority supports its ruling with a Federal Circuit Court decision <em>(Coplin v Fairfield Pub. Access Tel. Comm., </em>111 F3d 1395 [8th Cir]) which is demonstratively distinguishable in two key respects and, if anything, supports the opposite conclusion. Application of the plain meaning doctrine to find that Federal law has expressly preempted plaintiffs\u2019 State tort damage causes of action is, in my view, contrary to United States Supreme Court canons of construction in this sensitive area of constitutional federalism. Indeed, in its most recent major preemption case, <em>Medtronic, Inc. v Lohr </em>(518 US 470), the Court expressly rejected exclusive reliance on a plain meaning approach. \u201cAlthough our analysis of the scope of the pre-emption statute must <em>begin </em>with its text * * * our interpretation of that language does <em>not occur in a contextual vacuum. </em>Rather, that interpretation is informed by two presumptions about the nature of pre-emption\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 484-485 [emphasis supplied, internal citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Both of the presumptions outlined in <em>Medtronic </em>are directly applicable here. First, as already discussed, we deal here with a claim of express preemption of a New York common-law remedy for tortious conduct. The Supreme Court has recognized that a State common-law tort remedy may well be considered to fall within the historic police powers of the State <em>(see, Cipollone v Liggett Group, </em>505 US 504, 518; <em>Taylor v General Motors Corp., </em>875 F2d 816, 823 [11th Cir], <em>cert denied </em>494 US 1065). Especially when this is the case, <em>Medtronic </em>teaches that</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u201c[i]n all pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has \u2018legislated * * * in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>field which, the States had traditionally occupied\u2019 * * * we \u2018start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the <em>clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u2019 \u201d (Medtronic, Inc. v Lohr, supra, </em>at 485 [emphasis supplied, internal citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">This presumption not only applies to militate against a congressional intent to preempt at all, but also to limit and narrow the scope of any intended supersession of State law <em>(see, id., </em>at 485; <em>Cipollone v Liggett Group, supra, </em>at 518, 523).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The second proposition articulated in <em>Medtronic </em>is that \u201c \u2018the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every preemption case\u201d <em>(Medtronic, Inc. v Lohr, supra, </em>at 494, quoting <em>Retail Clerks Infl. Assn, v Schermerhorn, </em>375 US 96, 103). To discern the existence and the scope of any congressional intention to preempt State law, a court must look not only at the statutory language, but the legislative framework, the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole and a \u201creasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers and the law\u201d <em>(Medtronic, Inc. v Lohr, supra, </em>at 486).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Based upon the analysis required by the United States Supreme Court in a case such as this, defendants have failed to demonstrate that plaintiffs\u2019 common-law damages remedy for defamation by these joint tortfeasors was expressly preempted by 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a). The text is manifestly far from plain, and its ambiguity works heavily against preemption <em>(see, Cipollone v Liggett Group, supra, </em>505 US, at 533 [Blackmun, J., concurring in part with Kennedy and Souter, JJ.]; <em>id., </em>at 548 [Scalia, J., concurring in part with Thomas, J.]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">\u201cIn any court proceeding * * * involving any claim against a franchising authority or other governmental entity * * * <em>arising from the regulation of cable service or from a decision of approval or disapproval with respect to a grant, renewal, transfer, or amendment of a franchise, </em>any relief, to the extent such relief is required by any other provision of Federal, State or local law, shall be limited to injunctive relief and declaratory relief\u2019 (47 USC \u00a7 555a [a] [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Taken literally, plaintiffs\u2019 damage claims do not \u201carise [] from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the <em>regulation </em>of cable service.\u201d Rather, their injuries arose from the <em>absence </em>of defendants\u2019 regulation of Rybacki\u2019s defamatory expressions. The majority overcomes this semantic hurdle by broadly interpreting the statutory phrase \u201cregulation of cable service\u201d to include \u201c \u2018any\u201d of the municipality\u2019s regulatory decisions involving cable television\u201d (majority opn, at 78), whereby, then, a decision <em>not </em>to regulate becomes \u201cregulation.\u201d To bolster its conclusion that regulation includes nonregulation, the majority interposes the \u201cany\u201d in the statute as a modifier of \u201cregulation.\u201d While the majority\u2019s expansive interpretation is not conclusively foreclosed by the text, it certainly is not compelled. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court, in another express preemption context, specifically rejected the contention \u201cthat the absence of regulation itself constitutes regulation\u201d <em>(Freightliner Corp. v Myrick, </em>514 US 280, 286).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Also of significance, while the text of section 555a (a) refers to \u201crelief * * * required by any other <em>provision </em>of Federal, State or local law,\u201d there is no specific exclusion of common-law remedies. \u201cCourts finding no express preemption agree that the absence of any explicit reference to common-law actions in the preemption clause leads to a no-express preemption conclusion\u201d <em>(Drattel v Toyota Motor Corp., supra, </em>92 NY2d, at 46).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Furthermore, neither the context nor the legislative history of section 555a (a) supports extending its statutory immunity to damage claims by private individuals who are not themselves subject to regulation by a franchising authority. Thus, the immediately preceding section, 47 USC \u00a7 555, gives <em>cable operators </em>access to the courts to seek relief from various adverse determinations by franchising authorities. The statutory scheme of the 1984 Cable Act left the primary means of regulating cable operations, facilities and services in the hands of local franchising authorities <em>(see, Time Warner Entertainment Co. v Federal Communications Commn., </em>93 F3d 957, 963 [DC Cir]). Local franchising authorities were given the power to establish and enforce requirements for facilities and equipment for the operation of a cable system (47 USC \u00a7 544 [b] [1]) and to regulate cable television service rates for subscribers in the absence of competition among operators (47 USC \u00a7 543 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Thus, the Cable Acts contemplate or provide for a variety of regulatory activities by franchising authorities beyond the determination to grant or deny a franchise to a prospective cable operator. Franchising authorities are also given some power to regulate the content of all cable programing through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>franchise agreement and their regulations respecting \u201ccable services [that] are obscene or otherwise unprotected by the Constitution\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 544 [d] [1]). Therefore, to that degree, franchising authorities can also exert regulatory control over cable television performers, programmers and producers. It is all of these cable industry participants who section 555a (a) was intended to bar from suing for damages \u201carising from [their] regulation\u201d by franchising authorities, not private parties who are not subject to any regulation under the Cable Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Further fortifying the conclusion that 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a) was not intended to preempt State defamation claims is the provision in a companion section which specifically and expressly directs that <em>\u201ccable operators </em>shall not incur any such <em>liability </em>[for defamation] for any program carried on any [public access] channel * * * unless the program involves obscene material\u201d (47 USC \u00a7 558 [emphasis supplied]). Congress singled out cable operators, but not franchising authorities, for immunity from liability for defamations over public access channels because \u201cthe bill otherwise <em>prohibits the operator\u2019s editorial control over all such channels\u201d </em>(H Rep No. 98-934, 98th Cong, 2d Sess, at 95, reprinted in 1984 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News 4655, 4732 [emphasis supplied]; 130 Cong Rec S14285, reprinted in 1984 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News, at 4738 [\u201cThe Senate * * * adopts the explanation * * * contained in House Report 98-934\u201d]; <em>see, </em>47 USC \u00a7 531 [e]). As already shown and not disputed, however, franchising authorities <em>are </em>given the power to assert \u201ceditorial control\u201d to prevent defamatory communications over public access channels. Congress therefore had every reason to leave franchising authorities accountable in damages for failing to exercise control over defamations on public access channels. It is quite apparent that the omission of franchising authorities from immunity for defamation liability in section 558 was intentional. The inclusion of cable operators but omission of franchising authorities in the only section of the Cable Acts dealing specifically with immunity from defamation liability adds a powerful <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>argument against the majority\u2019s application of section 555a (a) to give franchising authorities immunity from State defamation liability <em>(see, </em>McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The legislative history reveals that the congressional intent behind 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a) as originally proposed and finally enacted was identical. In the original Senate version, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>intended to prevent coercive damage suits under 42 USC \u00a7 1983 and State civil rights laws, arising out of \u201cany action expressly authorized [by law] * * * including a franchising authority\u2019s decision to grant or deny a franchise, renew or not renew a franchise, to approve or deny the transfer of a franchise, amend or not amend a franchise, or <em>otherwise regulate a cable operator\u201d </em>(S Rep No. 102-92, 102d Cong, 2d Sess, at 49-50, reprinted in 1992 US Code Cong &amp; Admin News 1133, 1182-1183 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">While the subsequently enacted House of Representatives version of section 555a (a) contains more generalized language than the Senate bill, the purpose, as articulated by its sponsor, then Representative Charles Schumer of New York, was the same: \u201cto protect local authorities from being pressured into making unmeritorious franchising decisions by the threat of expensive damages litigation by cable companies\u201d (138 Cong Rec H6487, H6530 [July 23, 1992]). Thus, the more generalized language of the House bill can best be read as intended to insure that the singular purpose of both Houses of Congress be effected \u2014 to prevent \u201cstrike\u201d damage suits against local franchising authorities by disgruntled persons or corporate entities in the cable television industry who are subject to franchising decisions \u201cor otherwise regulate [d]\u201d by those municipal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Limiting the scope of statutory immunity from money damage liability to claims asserted by cable operators, producers and programmers of the cable industry who are subject to regulation by franchising authorities is consistent with the interpretation of section 555a (a) by every Federal court that has addressed that provision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cSo far as we can tell, Congress gave local franchising authorities protection in order to insulate their decisionmaking from the threats of suits for damages brought by <em>disappointed cable operators\u201d (Time Warner Entertainment Co. v Federal Communications Commn., supra, </em>93 F3d, at 980 [emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201cWe conclude that section 555a (a) promotes Congress\u2019s substantial interest <em>in having municipalities regulate cable operators </em>without fear of potentially overwhelming damage awards\u201d <em>(Jones Intercable v City of Chula Vista, </em>80 F3d 320, 326 [9th Cir; emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cCongress found that claims against municipalities for civil damage liability <em>related to their regulatory activities of the cable industry </em>were posing \u2018a potentially crippling burden\u2019 * * *. Elimination of that exposure is thus designed to <em>preserve the municipal franchising and regulations scheme </em>envisioned by the 1984 Act\u201d <em>(Daniels Cablevision v United States, </em>835 F Supp 1,11-12 [D DC; emphasis supplied]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Coplin v Fairfield Pub. Access Tel. Comm, (supra, </em>111 F3d 1395), relied upon by the majority, is not to the contrary. First, the plaintiff in <em>Coplin </em>brought a damage action under a Federal statute, 42 USC \u00a7 1983, allegedly for violating his constitutional rights to free speech when the talk show he produced and hosted was suspended by the local public access television committee for its libelous content. In contrast to the instant case, the plaintiff in <em>Coplin </em>did not assert any State common-law cause of action for damages. Thus, the court in <em>Coplin </em>could, if it wished, apply the plain meaning doctrine to 47 USC \u00a7 555a (a), free from the federalism-based constitutional constraints imposed by the Supreme Court where, as here, State common-law remedies are claimed to be superseded. Second, <em>Coplin </em>was a producer and programmer on the public access channel, and as such he was subject to content regulation by the franchising authority. Thus, dismissal of his section 1983 damages action was completely consistent with a reading of section 555a (a) limiting its application to bar damage suits by persons or entities subject to regulation by a franchising authority, and adversely affected by such regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Since, in my view, defendants have completely failed to demonstrate any \u201cclear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d to preempt plaintiffs\u2019 State common-law defamation damages action, I vote to reverse and reinstate the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith and Wesley concur with Judge Rosenblatt; Judge Levine dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion; Judge Ciparick taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Defendants have not contended and could not contend here that implied preemption applies, either by way of congressional occupation of the field or because State tort law conflicts with Federal law (see, <em>Drattel v Toyota Motor Corp., </em>92 NY2d 35, 42). Thus, the sole issue is express preemption under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
