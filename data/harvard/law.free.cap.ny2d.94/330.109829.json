Standard of review: a court does not credit conclusory allegations and mischaracterizations. (Le<em>on v Martinez, </em>84 NY2d 83; <em>Credit Alliance Corp. v Andersen &amp; Co., </em>65 NY2d 536; <em>Kliebert v McKoan, </em>228 AD2d 232.) II. The exact same Guardian policy language at issue here repeatedly has been held by State and Federal courts to be unambiguous.

IV. In any event, the Guardian illustrations at issue here have also been held to be unambiguous and bar appellants\u2019 claims. <em>(Frith v Guardian Life Ins.

The Court below properly affirmed dismissal of appellants\u2019 General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims because no deceptive practice was alleged. <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20; <em>S.Q.K.F.C., Inc. v Bell Atl. TriCon Leasing Corp., </em>84 F3d 629; <em>Marcus v AT&amp;T Corp., </em>138 F3d 46.) VI. As to numerous other claims, appellants\u2019 alleged reliance on representations that are directly contradicted by the unambiguous policy (and illustration) is unreasonable as a matter of law. <em>(Bango v Naughton, </em>184 AD2d 961; <em>Ponzini v Gatz, </em>155 AD2d 590, 75 NY2d 946; <em>SKR Resources v Players Sports, </em>938 F Supp 235; <em>Great Neck Saw Mfrs. v Manhattan Life Ins.

Appellants fail to allege a breach of fiduciary duty or negligent misrepresentation. <em>(Meagher v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>119 Misc 2d 615; <em>Dornberger v Metropolitan Life Ins.

The advertising, marketing and sale of life insurance profoundly aifects consumers and is subject to the strong remedial protections of General Business Law \u00a7 349. <em>(Matter of State of New York [Abrams] v Ford Motor Co., </em>74 NY2d 495; <em>Karlin v IVF Am., </em>93 NY2d 282; <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>In re Houbigant, Inc., </em>914 F Supp 964.) III. The increasing complexity of today\u2019s state of the art insurance products requires a flexible application of fiduciary duty principles. <em>(United States v Brennan, </em>938 F Supp 1111; <em>Penato v George, </em>52 AD2d 939; <em>Schmidt v Bishop, </em>779 F Supp 321; <em>Scott v Dime Sav.

Co., </em>961 F Supp 506; <em>Meagher v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>119 Misc 2d 615.) IV. MONY\u2019s insurance agents, by virtue of their training, expertise and superior knowledge of MONY\u2019s vanishing premium life insurance policies, occupy a special relationship sufficient to support the class\u2019 negligent misrepresentation claim. <em>(International Prods.

IV. An objective test under General Business Law \u00a7 349 for determining whether a particular practice constitutes deceptive conduct should not be abandoned. <em>(Varela v Investors Ins.

They allege, in essence, that they purchased their insurance policies based on defendants\u2019 false representations that out-of-pocket premium payments would vanish within a stated period of time. Plaintiffs have asserted several theories of liability, two of which merit our review. One is based on plaintiffs\u2019 claims that defendants violated General Business Law \u00a7 349 by engaging in deceptive marketing and sales practices; the other is based on common-law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"AEF\">A. The Gaidon-Guardian Action</p>\n<p id=\"AIx\">In the mid-1980s, plaintiff representatives of a purported class each purchased a life insurance policy from defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each policy was a \u201cWhole Life Policy With Specified Premium Period.\u201d The policies contained provisions setting forth the periods for which premiums were to be paid. These periods varied from policy to policy and ranged from 10 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Plaintiffs allege that they bought their policies on the strength of false representations made to them by a Guardian sales agent. They assert that as part of the company\u2019s standard marketing presentation, the agent prepared a personalized \u201cvanishing premium\u201d illustration for each plaintiff. Using this device, the agent allegedly represented to each plaintiff that he or she would have to pay annual premiums out-of-pocket for only the first eight years of the policy, assuring each of them that the policy\u2019s dividends would thereafter cover the premium costs. Plaintiffs contend that the illustrations were premised on dividend projections that Guardian knew or should have known were untenable. Specifically, they allege that Guardian, in the mid-1980s, artificially inflated its current dividend rates despite waning profits because it wanted to continue depicting competitive vanishing dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">On a separate page, accompanying each illustration, however, limitations such as the following appeared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">\u201cFigures depending on dividends are neither estimated nor guaranteed, but are based on the [current year\u2019s] dividend scale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201cThe [current year\u2019s] dividend scale reflects current company claims, expense, and investment experience * * * and taxes under current laws. Actual future dividends may be higher or lower than those illustrated depending on the company\u2019s actual future experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">After deciding to purchase the policy each plaintiff signed an application. Several weeks later Guardian delivered the policies. Each policy contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">(1) \u201c[a] participating policy shares in Guardian\u2019s di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>visible surplus.

The MONY policies, like Guardian\u2019s, set forth premium payment schedules covering a stated number of years. MONY presale illustrations were accompanied by \u201cLimitations\u201d pages similar to those in Guardian:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cThis illustration shows the surrender of values dependent in whole or in part on dividends paid by the Company.

The Appellate Division, citing its decision in <em>Gaidon (supra), </em>affirmed, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Vanishing Premium Life Insurance: The Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The cases before us are not unique. They involve allegations and practices of a national scope that have generated industry-wide litigation <em>(see, </em>7 Holmes, Appleman on Insurance 2d \u00a7 49.19). In resolving this case, we consider the various types of cash value life insurance that are marketed, and the import of \u201cvanishing premiums\u201d in that setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">All the policies in the appeals before us. provide \u201cwhole life\u201d or \u201cuniversal life\u201d insurance \u2014 each a form of \u201ccash value\u201d life insurance. Cash value life insurance combines \u201cpure\u201d life insurance with an investment component that creates a potential accumulation of money in the policy (Downes and Goodman, Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms, at 81 [4th ed]; <em>see also, </em>Black and Skipper, Life Insurance, at 177-78 [12th ed] [discussing \u201cdual nature\u201d of cash value life insurance]). In a cash value policy, the carrier typically invests accumulated money and pays returns to the policyholder in the form of dividends or interest (Downes and Goodman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 81).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">When cash value insurance first emerged, insurance companies invested accumulated money exclusively in conservative securities with fixed interest rates, such as municipal and corporate bonds <em>(see, </em>Fischel and Stillman, <em>The Law and Economics of Vanishing Premium Life Insurance, </em>22 Del J Corp L 1, 4 [1997]). Commentators point out that because interest rates \u201csoared\u201d in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the economics of these cash value life insurance policies became unattractive to investors who sought to take advantage of the high interest rates <em>(see, </em>Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 5; Multi-State Life Insurance Task Force and Multi-State Market Conduct Examination of The Prudential Insurance Company of America, Executive Summary, http://www.naic.org/nj7prusum.htm). In the mid-1980s, the life insurance industry reacted to its diminishing market share by designing policies, like the ones here at issue, in which policyholders\u2019 accumulated money is tied to the current rate of interest <em>(see, </em>Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Carriers marketed interest rate-sensitive insurance under a host of premium payment options, including the \u201cvanishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>premium\u201d plan (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 6). Under this plan, the policyholder pays higher-than-normal premiums in the early years of the policy, resulting in a quicker accumulation of premium dollars for investment purposes (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 6-7; Black and Skipper, <em>op. cit., </em>at 112). These policies are marketed on the premise that enough cash value will accumulate so that at a fixed date future administrative and insurance costs will be covered and the policyholder relieved of any further out-of-pocket premium obligations (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 6-7).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In the late 1980s, however, sharply declining interest rates \u201cupset the economics\u201d of these widely marketed policies (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 7). Accumulated cash values became insufficient to pay expected future insurance and administrative costs. By the early 1990s, many consumers who purchased such policies were required to continue out-of-pocket payments to keep their policies in force (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 7). And the lawsuits followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">General Business Law \u00a7 349 As Compared With Common-Law Fraudulent Inducement</p>\n<p id=\"AOr\">A. General Business Law \u00a7 349</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In addressing the primary issues in these appeals, we must examine the components of both General Business Law \u00a7 349 and common-law fraudulent inducement. Although a person\u2019s actions may at once implicate both, General Business Law \u00a7 349 contemplates actionable conduct that does not necessarily rise to the level of fraud. In contrast to common-law fraud, General Business Law \u00a7 349 is a creature of statute based on broad consumer-protection concerns <em>(see, Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20, 24-25). Although General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims have been aptly characterized as similar to fraud claims <em>(e.g., Dornberger v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>961 F Supp 506, 549 [SD NY 1997]), they are critically different in ways illustrated by the cases at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">As this Court noted in <em>Oswego (supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 24), General Business Law \u00a7 349 was enacted initially to give the Attorney General enforcement power to curtail deceptive acts and practices \u2014 willful or otherwise \u2014 directed at the consuming public. Owing to the \u201cever-changing types of false and decep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>tive business practices which plague consumers in our State,\u201d the Governor signed the measure into law (NY Dept of Law, Mem to Governor, Bill Jacket, L 1963, ch 813). In 1980, the Legislature took a significant step to expand the statute\u2019s enforcement scheme by allowing a private cause of action (General Business Law \u00a7 349 [h]).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">As a threshold matter, in order to satisfy General Business Law \u00a7 349 plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be predicated on a deceptive act or practice that is \u201cconsumer oriented\u201d <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 24-25). We hold that they are. In contrast to a private contract dispute as to policy coverage <em>(e.g., New York Univ. v Continental Ins. Co., </em>87 NY2d 308), the practices before us involved an extensive marketing scheme that had \u201ca broader impact on consumers at large\u201d <em>(e.g., Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Turning to the other components of section 349, \u201ca plaintiff must allege that the defendant has engaged \u2018in an act or practice that is deceptive or misleading in a material way and that plaintiff has been injured by reason thereof \u201d <em>(Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>94 NY2d 43, 55 [quoting <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 25]). This Court has defined a \u201cdeceptive act or practice\u201d as a representation or omission \u201c \u2018likely to mislead a reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances\u2019 \u201d <em>(Karlin v IVF Am., </em>93 NY2d 282, 294 [quoting <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26]). We hold that plaintiffs have adequately alleged that defendants violated the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Plaintiffs have alleged, in essence, that defendants lured them into purchasing policies by using illustrations that created unrealistic expectations as to the prospects of premium disappearance upon a strategically chosen \u201cvanishing date.\u201d This vanishing date, plaintiffs allege, was misleading, as based on the premise that interest rates would continue at a high, unprecedented rate for, in some cases, 20 or more years \u2014 a premise that defendants allegedly knew to be unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is supported by the Attorney General, who has submitted an <em>amicus </em>brief asserting that the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of section 349 was too restrictive. He urges that a matter-of-law finding that the practices were not deceptive or misleading would undermine the State\u2019s power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>redress consumer practices that do not rise to the level of common-law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In seeking to uphold the dismissal of the section 349 claims, defendants argue, in substance, that the illustrated vanishing dates were not deceptive. They have directed our attention to the policies\u2019 merger clauses, which seek to confine their representations to the four corners of the policies. They also point to the above-quoted disclaimer language stating that illustrated dividend/interest rates \u201care neither guarantees nor estimates of future results\u201d or that such rates may be \u201chigher or lower * * * depending on the company\u2019s actual future experience.\u201d Defendants\u2019 contentions are compelling when resisting plaintiffs\u2019 claims of fraud, but they cannot, on this record, justify dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 section 349 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">To begin with, the merger provisions \u2014 for whatever other importance they may carry \u2014 are not determinative of plaintiffs\u2019 section 349 claims, which are based on deceptive business <em>practices, </em>not on deceptive contracts. Moreover, the disclaimers, though more particularized than the merger provisions, do not speak to the true, unrevealed relationship between dividend/ interest rates and the vanishing dates as represented. Consumers vary in their level of sophistication and their ability to perceive the connection between a fluctuation in dividend/ interest rates and a vanishing date, or to make the necessary arithmetic adjustments. The issue before us is not whether, as a matter of law, reasonable consumers would be misled in a material way, but whether that prospect is enough to create a question of fact in the <em>Goshen </em>appeal, or to state a claim in <em>Gaidon. </em>It is, in both cases, for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Defendants made vanishing dates the centerpiece of their sales presentations. They allegedly marketed vanishing premium policies by tying depicted vanishing dates to a milestone in the policyholder\u2019s near future (such as the policyholder\u2019s proposed retirement age or the year when a child was expected to go to college), and thereby created the expectation of a firm, personalized timetable. The very goal of the marketing scheme was to convince prospective purchasers that the vanishing date would in fact conform to the individualized projections. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants were aware that the premiums were unlikely to vanish as projected because they allegedly knew or should have known that the opposite was true: dividend/interest rates were not sustainable at the illustrated level. In the face of that unlikelihood, defendants created these expectations with illustrations based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>unrealistic dividend/interest forecasts and without disclosure or disclaimer revealing that fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Further, and in spite of this alleged knowledge, defendants allegedly trained sales agents to make presentations in ways that would arguably deceive and mislead prospective policyholders. The record contains a sales training videotape that is revealing. It instructs agents how to \u201ccause the vanish to occur whenever your client wants to see it.\u201d Also, vanishing premium policies were marketed with slogans such as \u201cPay one and done,\u201d \u201c4 Pay/No Pay,\u201d \u201cPay One Vanish,\u201d \u201cAccelerated Vanish,\u201d and \u201cHow to get lifetime insurance protection with payments that are . . . going, going, gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The <em>Gaidon </em>action was determined solely on the pleadings. Plaintiffs have alleged that Guardian was aware of the unlikelihood that the then current dividend rate could be maintained. This awareness, plaintiff alleges, was based not only on the general state of the economy, but on Guardian\u2019s transactions and on its heightened knowledge of its own financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In <em>Goshen, </em>plaintiffs also have produced affidavits averring that the company\u2019s current dividend rate, as depicted at the time of the illustration, was based in part on non-recurring transactions that skewed any projection of MONTs ability to maintain the then current dividend/interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Insisting that they have engaged in no deceptive conduct, defendants have challenged plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. Defendant MONY, for example, asserts that \u201c[t]he regulatory * * * repercussions of engaging in the sort of pervasive misconduct to which plaintiffs allude would be swift and severe.\u201d In this context we note that in 1997 and 1998 the New York State Superintendent of Insurance issued several regulations aimed directly at the marketing scheme before us. One regulation banned outright the use of \u201cvanishing premium\u201d language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201cWhen using an illustration in the sale of a life insurance policy, an insurer * * * shall not * * * use the term \u2018vanish\u2019 or \u2018vanishing premium,\u2019 or a simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>lar term that implies the policy becomes paid up, to describe a plan for using non-guaranteed elements to pay a portion of future premiums.\u201d <em>(See, 11 </em>NYCRR 53-3.2 [b] [8].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Further, section 53-3.3 (a) (13) provides that where pre-sale illustrations depict reinvestment of non-guaranteed dividend/ interest to pay off premiums,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\u201cthe illustration must <em>clearly </em>disclose that a charge continues to be required and that, depending on actual results, the premium payer may need to continue or resume premium outlays. Similar disclosure shall be made for premium outlay of lesser amounts or shorter durations than the contract premium. <em>If a contract premium is due, the premium outlay display shall not be left blank or show zero unless accompanied by an asterisk or similar mark to draw attention to the fact that the policy is not paid up\u201d </em>(11 NYCRR 53-3.3 [a] [13] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Most pointedly, the Superintendent of Insurance has required carriers to dispel any false impression that dividend/ interest rates would continue for all the years shown in a life insurance illustration. The regulation is designed to insure that prospective purchasers, during high interest eras, will no longer be led or misled to believe that their out-of-pocket obligations will be reduced or eliminated. Section 53-3.3 (b) (5) thus requires pre-sale illustrations to include the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\u201cThis illustration assumes that the currently illustrated non-guaranteed elements will continue unchanged for all years shown. <em>This is not likely to occur, </em>and actual results may be more or less favorable than those shown\u201d (11 NYCRR 53-3.3 [b] [5] [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Contrary to the suggestions of our dissenting colleague, the actions of the Superintendent of Insurance are independent of our conclusion that plaintiffs have pleaded a valid section 349 claim.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They merely match and fortify our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In all, we conclude that plaintiffs in the <em>Gaidon </em>action have adequately pleaded a General Business Law \u00a7 349 cause of action and that plaintiffs in <em>Goshen </em>have presented sworn assertions sufficient to raise a question of fact as to a General Business Law \u00a7 349 deceptive practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">B. Common-Law Fraudulent Inducement</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">A practice may carry the capacity to mislead or deceive a reasonable person but not be fraudulent. That distinction separates plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claims from their section 349 claims. Fraud is wrongful enough to occupy a civil classification just short of criminal conduct. Over the years fraud has generally been defined by behavior involving intentional, false representations and other connotations of scienter such as willfulness, knowledge, design and bad faith <em>(see, e.g, Channel Master Corp. v Aluminium Ltd. Sales, </em>4 NY2d 403, 407-408; <em>Reno v Bull, </em>226 NY 546, 550).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">To state a claim for fraudulent inducement in an insurance context, plaintiffs must allege a \u201cmisrepresentation or material omission\u201d by defendants that induced plaintiffs to purchase the policies, as well as scienter, reliance and injury <em>(New York Univ. v Continental Ins. Co., </em>87 NY2d 308, 318, <em>supra; see also, Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>94 NY2d 43, 57, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The parties\u2019 arguments for and against plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claims mirror those made in connection with section 349. Notably, plaintiffs stress that the illustrations were one-sided misrepresentations designed to deceive and mislead purchasers by projecting only the brighter prospects while concealing predictably bleaker ones. They assert that they have met the \u201cmisrepresentation or material omission\u201d threshold for fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>alleging that the illustrations painted a purposefully distorted landscape using false, untenable interest rate projections and further, that defendants intentionally diverted funds to conceal the artificially inflated nature of the dividend picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that they intentionally and artificially inflated dividends is largely conclusory and incompatible with the constraints of a highly regulated industry. Contending further that there was no misrepresentation or falsification that could give rise to a fraud claim, defendants submit that the dividend/interest rates projected in the illustration tables were, in fact, those being paid out to policyholders at the time of the sales presentations. Additionally, defendants claim that the projections were illustrations only, that they were based on the continuation of an <em>existing </em>state of affairs and cannot be construed or characterized as guarantees. They also argue, in substance, that any claim of fraudulent concealment or omission is necessarily defeated by the disclaimer language in the illustrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We recognize that a number of courts have gone so far as to sustain fraud charges as adequately pleaded in vanishing premium cases (see, <em>e.g., Greenberg v Life Ins. Co., </em>177 F3d 507 [6th Cir 1999]; <em>Myers v Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>5 F Supp 2d 423 [ND Miss 1998]; <em>Nepomoceno v Knights of Columbus, </em>1999 WL 66570, 1999 US Dist LEXIS 1366 [US Dist Ct, ND 111, Feb. 8, 1999, Civ A 96 C 4789], <em>supra; Grove v Principal Mut.

Defendants are correct in asserting that plaintiffs have not met the threshold element to support a fraud claim \u2014 \u201cmisrepresentation or material omission.\u201d The elements of fraud are narrowly defined, requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ing proof by clear and convincing evidence <em>(cf., Vermeer Owners v Guterman, </em>78 NY2d 1114, 1116). Not every misrepresentation or omission rises to the level of fraud.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An omission or misrepresentation may be so trifling as to be legally inconsequential or so egregious as to be fraudulent, or even criminal; Or it may fall somewhere in between, as it does here.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">By stating that the illustrated dividend/interest rates are not guaranteed and that they may be higher or lower than depicted, defendants made a partial disclosure. They revealed the possibility of a dividend/interest rate decline, but did not reveal its practical implications to the policyholder. Although they did not guarantee that interest rates would remain constant, they failed to reveal that the illustrated vanishing dates were wholly unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We conclude that although defendants\u2019 sales practice, as pleaded, falls within the purview of General Business Law \u00a7 349, it does not constitute a \u201cmisrepresentation or material omission\u201d necessary to sustain a cause of action for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Because the Appellate Division dismissed the entire Gaidon/ Guardian complaint on the merits, it is now necessary for that Court to consider which plaintiffs would be legally entitled to bring a claim under General Business Law \u00a7 349. Accordingly, in Gaidon, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by reinstating the General Business Law \u00a7 349 cause of action, and remitting the case to that Court for consideration of issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that Court. As so modified, the order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In <em>Goshen, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, without costs, by reinstating the General Business Law \u00a7 349 cause of action and remitting the case to Supreme Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\">. Named plaintiffs are Frank Gaidon, Frank DeHamer, Nicholas De-Hamer and Kathleen Warner, along with Allen Glass and Barbara Gaidon, as trustees of two different trust funds that at different times owned the life insurance policy on Frank Gaidon\u2019s life. Frank Gaidon, himself, never owned the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Guardian moved to dismiss in a pre-answer motion, made before plaintiffs sought class certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\">.

Guardian allegedly informed Frank Gaidon that he would be required to pay premiums for the rest of his life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b414-13\">. The complaint included causes of action for fraud, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and imposition of a constructive trust, declaratory and injunctive relief, reformation, violation of General Business Law \u00a7 349 and violation of Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 2123 and 4226.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b414-14\">. Supreme Court held that, with the exception of the Gaidon trustees, all plaintiffs lacked standing to assert any claims against Guardian. Specifically, the court determined Frank Gaidon lacked standing because his policy was owned by trusts and not Gaidon himself. The court further ruled that Frank and Nicholas DeHamer and Kathleen Warner lacked standing because they signed releases as part of forms Guardian required them to sign to cancel their policies. Supreme Court then dismissed the Gaidon trustees\u2019 fraudulent inducement claims and General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims, holding that Guardian did not make the alleged misleading or fraudulent representations directly to the trustees; rather, that its sales agents interacted only with and made representations to Frank Gaidon himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-13\">.

We are not persuaded by the assertion in the dissent that defendants are, as a matter of law, relieved of General Business Law \u00a7 349 liability for having based their illustrations on the then \u201ccurrent dividend scale\u201d (see, dissenting opn, at 355 [discussing 11 NYCRR 219.4 (n)]). Section 219.4 (n) was promulgated to preclude insurance companies from depicting speculative interest rates above those currently paid by the carrier. It certainly does not mandate that a carrier project a premium payment plan that it allegedly knows to be unsustainable, while revealing nothing as to the improbability of the projection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">.

My dissent is respectfully tendered solely with regard to the \"revival and reinstatement of the General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims. I agree with the lower courts, including their rulings that these particular claims are no more sustainable or cognizable on these records than any of the other standard claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">I dissent also because the precedential implications of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Majority holding, as proposed, are beyond the intent, enactment and interpretation of this remedial statute. In particular, I conclude that no deceptive act or practice, which would mislead a reasonable consumer, has been alleged in these cases under this statute. I would therefore affirm the Appellate Division orders outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In the <em>Gaidon </em>action, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 was granted, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint containing their causes of action for violations of General Business Law \u00a7 349. The standard applied in this case is whether a pleading and its factual allegations manifest any cause of action \u201ccognizable at law\u201d <em>(Guggenheimer v Ginzburg, </em>43 NY2d 268, 275). Dismissal is appropriate when evidentiary material is considered where an alleged material fact \u201cis not a fact at all and * * * no significant dispute exists regarding it\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 275).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Here, the complaint must sufficiently set forth a \u201cforbidden type of deception\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 275). While the failure to disclose information may be found \u201cless than candid, it cannot, as a matter of law, be found deceitful\u201d when there is no evidence in the record to refute defendant\u2019s assertions <em>(see, St. Patrick\u2019s Home for Aged &amp; Infirm v Laticrete Intl., </em>264 AD2d 652, 655). The failure of a pleading to present a deceptive act or practice, under the sweep and provenance of General Business Law \u00a7 349, should render the asserted claims deficient on the face of, and at the outset of, the dispute brought to a court <em>(see, id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Defendants moved in the <em>Goshen </em>action for summary judgment. Thus, reviewing the pleadings as well as the evidentiary materials, plaintiffs must present a triable issue of fact to defeat the motion. I conclude, as did the courts below, that no genuine triable issue of fact is presented on this record, and summary judgment was appropriately granted to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">In the instant cases, plaintiffs essentially charge that the use of illustrations by defendants\u2019 sales agents, depicting time lines at which premium payments might \u201cvanish,\u201d misled the consumers within the meaning of the statute. Additionally, in <em>Goshen, </em>plaintiffs claim that defendant MONY knew the use of the \u201cvanishing premium\u201d sales promotion was not viable and that the company attempted to conceal this awareness from the plaintiff class. The <em>Goshen </em>plaintiffs submitted affidavits purporting that the dividends illustrated by MONY were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>sustainable. In my view, on these records, the allegations do not measure up to cognizable causes of action necessitating a trial on the General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">In 1970, the Legislature enacted section 349 of the General Business Law to \u201cstrengthen the consumer protection powers of the Attorney General by enabling him to obtain injunctions against all deceptive and fraudulent practices affecting consumers and by clarifying his powers to obtain restitution for defrauded consumers in such proceedings\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1970, chs 43 and 44, 1970 NY Legis Ann, at 472). Consumers were given a protection for an \u201chonest market place\u201d enforceable by the Attorney General <em>(id., </em>at 472). Section 349 tracked the actions of the FTC with respect to interpretation and enforcement of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 USC \u00a7 45), in that agency\u2019s effort to eradicate or penalize deceptive acts and practices <em>(see generally, Matter of State of New York v Colorado State Christian Coll, of Church of Inner Power, </em>76 Misc 2d 50, 54).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">In 1980, the New York Legislature enhanced this State\u2019s protective mechanism. It gave a private right of action to allegedly wronged consumers to pursue consumer fraud claims personally (General Business Law \u00a7 349 [h]). This powerful tool was to \u201csupplement the activities of the Attorney General in the prosecution of consumer fraud complaints\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1980, ch 346, 1980 NY Legis Ann, at 147). Moreover, the enactment of this statutory remedy was not to deprive plaintiffs of any common-law remedies <em>(see generally, Schuster v City of New York, </em>5 NY2d 75, 85 [statutory remedy is \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">I am not persuaded that support exists to justify a further enhancement of General Business Law \u00a7 349 to make it a \u201ccatch-all\u201d remedy. It should not be construed as providing all-encompassing redress. To interpose such a procedural and remedial disincentive against aggrieved persons pursuing longstanding traditional remedies at common law, as well as other statutory and regulatory measures affecting a gigantic industry like insurance \u2014 and precedentially all others \u2014 is a remarkable step and development that I do not believe is warranted or intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Section 349, unlike other States\u2019 deceptive practice statutes, does not supply a definition of \u201cdeceptive acts or practices.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Noting the undeniable remedial nature of section 349, this Court proportionately recognized the potential for overbreadth inherent in the interpretation and application of the statute. <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank </em>(85 NY2d 20) announced the test which should determine whether defendants here violated section 349. The standard is whether \u201cdefendant is engaging in an act or practice that is deceptive or misleading in a material way\u201d and whether \u201cplaintiff has been injured by reason thereof\u2019 <em>(id., </em>at 25). While I agree with the Majority\u2019s acknowledgment of the appropriate test, my application of it results in an affirmance and resolution against the groundbreaking availability of New York\u2019s General Business Law \u00a7 349. Based on the Majority\u2019s holding, a wide expansion of the theory underlying this statutory remedy will henceforth be operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Yet, to avoid the possibility of \u201cexcessive litigation\u201d (class or individual) under General Business Law \u00a7 349, this Court evoked \u201c \u2018an objective definition of deceptive acts and practices, whether representations or omissions, limited to those likely to mislead a reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances\u2019 \u201d <em>(Karlin v WF Am., </em>93 NY2d 282, 294, quoting <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 26; <em>contrast, </em>Note, <em>New York Creates a Private Right of Action to Combat Consumer Fraud: Caveat Venditor, </em>48 Brook L Rev 509, 548).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The judicial framework and resolution can be determined as a matter of law or fact <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 26). Particularly in omissions cases, the statute does not require businesses to \u201cguarantee that each consumer has all relevant information specific to its situation. The scenario is quite different, however, where the business alone possesses material information that is relevant to the consumer and fails to provide this information\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The capacity and potential of the material to qualify as a misleading act that deceives must be assessed in individual cases and circumstances. The determination of the deceptiveness of the conduct that bears on the reasonableness of the consumer should not be bifurcated between the sales materials and the contract policies themselves, as the Majority\u2019s analysis does. That is a commercially unrealistic segmentation that artificially skews the statutory reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Deception requires a misrepresentation of fact under the whole set of dealings of the parties <em>(see generally, State of New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>York v Unique Ideas, </em>85 Misc 2d 258, <em>affd in part, mod as to damages </em>56 AD2d 295, <em>mod as to damages </em>44 NY2d 345). The language of the policies, which included statements that premiums are regularly due, cannot be so facilely cast aside in determining whether a misrepresentation of fact was alleged which would mislead a reasonable consumer, acting reasonably, into buying that policy. The reasonableness of the consumer viewpoint in my judgment of the statute, ought to be evaluated in light of all the facts before the consumers \u2014 the sales promotion, the written illustrations expressing no guarantees, and the policies excluding extraneous facets from the sales transaction and agreement. In other words, the integrated transaction determines the availability of the statute, not just the initial contact, sales pitch or some predicate facet.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Thus, application of <em>Oswego\u2019s </em>standards to plaintiffs\u2019 General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims demonstrates, as a matter of cogent, even compelling, record dealings, that plaintiffs fail to propound cognizable claims or a triable issue of fact under the statute. The complaints, and the accompanying submissions in <em>Goshen, </em>simply do not allege a sustainable basis or theory that plaintiffs were materially deceived and harmed by defendants\u2019 actions \u2014 that is, by the entire array of interrelated steps leading to the purchase of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In <em>Gaidon, </em>the asserted deceptive act is that defendant Guardian, through its sales presentations and policy illustrations, misrepresented that payment of premiums only during the first several years of the policy would suffice to carry out the cost of the policy for the life of the insured. Plaintiffs allege that this illustrative sales promotion induced purchase of the policies and falls within the limitless statute. Yet, the express terms of the policy plainly indicate the duration of the required premium payments; and the written policy illustrations used by defendant Guardian specifically stated they were neither part of the actual insurance policy, nor that the dividends were guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Moreover, to the extent that plaintiffs in <em>Gaidon </em>argue that they pleaded a cognizable section 349 claim based on defendant Guardian\u2019s use of misleading dividend scales in its illustrations, plaintiffs\u2019 argument is baseless. The illustrations accord with applicable official regulations which require that \u201c[i]f dividends are illustrated, they must be based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>insurer\u2019s current dividend scale and the illustration must contain a statement to the effect that they are not to be construed as guarantees or estimates of dividends to be paid in the future\u201d (11 NYCRR 219.4 [n]). The Majority\u2019s conclusion\u2014 that the use of standard, officially approved and authorized illustrations amounts to a deceptive practice under General Business Law \u00a7 349 \u2014 is a breakaway proposition with troubling precedential implications and a fundamental unfairness by changing the rules of trade after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Similarly, in <em>Goshen, </em>the certified class members sought to recover under General Business Law \u00a7 349 based on their understanding of written policy illustrations that premium payments would only have to be paid for a limited number of years. Defendant MONY utilized different versions of the written illustrations. All illustrations, however, included statements that they were not valid without a \u201cLimitations and Definitions\u201d form, which, at minimum, cautioned any potential purchaser that only the policy itself with the application is the entire contract. The policies then repeated the same admonition that they alone constituted the entire agreement of the parties. To wholly sideline these pervasively employed integration clauses in these circumstances is a discretely portentous precedential development. That alone justifies my dissenting expression as fair notice to the Bench and Bar, and as an incentive for legislative consideration of some reasonable limitations on the sweep of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">As an additional argument, the plaintiff class in <em>Goshen </em>urges that MONY executives knew that the \u201cvanishing premium\u201d concept was not viable, given inevitably uncertain predictions about future economic conditions. But that unpredictability is a known constant to the world at large, not just to insurance executives.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\"><em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund (supra, </em>at 26) further teaches another axiom: MONY was not required to \u201cguarantee that each consumer has all relevant information specific to its situation.\u201d The sales nomenclature of \u201cvanishing premium\u201d does not even denote a type of life insurance policy (see, Fischel and Stillman, <em>The Law and Economics of Vanishing Premium Life Insurance, </em>22 Del J Corp L 1, 7). Rather, the \u201cvanishing premium\u201d notion is a marketing technique and advertising device based on a <em>proposed </em>financing spread sheet which provides \u201ca vanishing-premium option or rider to the basic life insurance policy\u201d (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 7, n 28). The illustrations \u201care based on <em>projections </em>of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>outside economic factors which may or may not come true\u201d (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 7, n 28 [emphasis added]). Consumers know as a matter of common sense and knowledge, or ought to be reasonably charged with knowing that truism. Besides, they were informed of this very point in writing\u2014 <em>twice </em>at least. The illustration materials themselves and the actual policies so declare. They are unassailable documentary proofs, not wispy disappointment claims that the deals did not turn out as hoped for or expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The point at which the premium payment obligation \u201cvanishes,\u201d as advertised through the illustrations, does not imply, moreover, that the policyholder will never again have an obligation to pay premiums. Rather, the illustrations project that the policy may be \u201cself-perpetuating,\u201d at a point when future premium payments should be paid up using the generated policy dividends (Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 7, n 28). Reasonable consumers should not be allowed to infer \u2014 by operation of law through interpretive judicial rulings, statutes and regulations \u2014 that external economic factors would remain static and that the cessation of cash premium payments would be a certainty, for lack of which statutory liability is primed. That consequence defies history and fair dealing on a common sense landscape.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they were deceived into believing that the premium payments would inevitably cease at a fixed point in time is, moreover, contradicted by all the available documentation. Courts should not ignore the explicit language of the insurance contracts and the reasonable understanding and expectation concerning the ineffability of extrinsic economic and market forces. Everyone should be charged with the plain fact that only the unknowable future could ultimately shape and control these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Next, the use of interest rate assumptions in the policy illustrations should not be deemed realistically to have the capacity to mislead prospective policyholders. That is a too far-out legal fiction. The probable level of future interest rates is, again, most certainly and most commonly known and appreciated as something not solely within an insurance company\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s ability to forecast <em>(see, </em>Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 14). Even Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board hedge their \u201cbets\u201d and just do their best. Furthermore, any general information defendants had involving market projections was the type of information plaintiffs, indeed anyone, \u201ccould reasonably have obtained\u201d <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank , supra, </em>85 NY2d, at 27), on their own, through financial advisors or via the \u201cInternet\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Plaintiffs argue \u2014 and the Majority adopts \u2014 the proposition that defendants created a misleading impression of these policies by not revealing their potential downsides. This aspect, as that syllogism sets the stage for the future, helps to drive the General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims in these cases. My simple answer' is that the entire insurance industry, by its nature, insures many things. But to derive an insurance obligation out of this new \u201cpros and cons\u201d balancing technique is a far-reaching concept and legal responsibility, bound to confound any rate or risk underwriter. Risk projections and re-allocation on this basis constitute a major shift for any type of sales-oriented business. By court decree instead of market forces they must, when emphasizing the positive aspects of their policies or products, also provide minimizing features and negatives <em>(contrast, </em>Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">To hold, even in part, that giving a product its best sales \u201cface,\u201d even with some \u201cpuffery\u201d and artfully spun advertising, is actionable under General Business Law \u00a7 349 pushes this consumer protection statute into uncharted and unintended territories. \u201cPuffing\u201d defenses \u2014 a seller\u2019s claim that no reasonable person would believe some sales promotion to be literally true \u2014 should have some reasonable place in the General Business Law \u00a7 349 universe as to who bears the risk of the bargain <em>(see generally, </em>Pitofsky, <em>Beyond Nader: Consumer Protection and the Regulation of Advertising, </em>90 Harv L Rev 661, 677). If not, this statute launches limitless liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Reasonable consumers acting reasonably recognize sales pitches and ordinarily discount them accordingly. In addition, to acknowledge that consumers understand that future interest rates will affect their future premium rates is reasonable and even respectful of individual intelligence, personal accountability and good common sense <em>(see, </em>Fischel and Stillman, <em>op. cit., </em>at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Based on the records of these cases, I agree with the lower courts that plaintiffs failed to show that defendants engaged in materially misleading or deceptive acts or practices. The alleged representations made by defendants were not \u201clikely to mislead a reasonable consumer acting reasonably\u201d <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26). Prospective market forces predominantly control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>here, and a remedial rescue by statute or judicial gloss on a statute \u2014 after the economic facts inexorably unfold under their own power \u2014 ought not become the benevolent standard for shifting fault, reallocating risk and relieving individuals of some measure of reasonable responsibility and private accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In sum, I would wholly affirm the orders of the Appellate Division in the actions entitled under <em>Gaidon </em>and <em>Goshen. </em>While I agree with the Majority rationale and result on plaintiffs\u2019 common-law fraud claims, I respectfully dissent for the reasons given and conclude that plaintiffs have not propounded cognizable or triable General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur with Judge Rosenblatt; Judge Bellacosa dissents in part and votes to affirm in a separate opinion; Judge Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In <em>Gaidon v Guardian Life Ins. </em>Co.: Order modified, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In <em>Goshen v Mutual Life Ins.
