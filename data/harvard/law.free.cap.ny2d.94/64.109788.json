Relying on Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 43 (d) and Education Law \u00a7 522 (2), TRS determined that petitioner could not combine the time of service in each system in the calculation of his retirement allowance because he sought to do so within three years of his retirement date. Since petitioner did not transfer employment within three years of retiring, we conclude that these statutes do not bar petitioner\u2019s receipt of a combined retirement allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">From 1958 to 1971, petitioner was seasonally employed primarily as a lifeguard by the Long Island State Park Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. For the 31 years leading up to January 1994, petitioner also served as a full-time public school teacher. In 1994, petitioner applied to NYSLERS to have the time accrued from the State parks employment transferred to TRS. NYSLERS informed petitioner that he was a member of NYSLERS as of June 1958, but because his State parks service overlapped with his service as a teacher, his entire period of service in NYSLERS was not available for transfer. Rather, only five years and seven months of service credit \u2014 corresponding to time that preceded his teaching position \u2014 could be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Petitioner was later advised by TRS that a transfer of five years and seven months of service credit had been completed. However, his pension checks did not reflect the credit for his time with the State parks. TRS explained that transfers were \u201crestricted if the request to transfer is within three years from the date of retirement.\u201d This meant that petitioner received separate pension calculations based on his time served in NYSLERS and in TRS. Had the five years and seven months been added to the 31 years of TRS service credit, petitioner would have been entitled to approximately $7,000 in additional annual pension payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Petitioner\u2019s current CPLR article 78 proceeding challenges the determination as contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and violative of the guarantee under the Federal Constitution of equal protection of the laws. Essentially, petitioner argues that the word \u201ctransfer\u201d as used in Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 43 (d) and Education Law \u00a7 522 (2) relates to a change of employment. Because petitioner did not change jobs within three years of retirement, he claims the three-year restriction in the statutes does not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Supreme Court disagreed and held that TRS\u2019s \u201cinterpretation * * * was rationally based and in accordance with the intent of the Legislature.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed. Although it held that deference to agency interpretation was not warranted because this case involved pure statutory interpretation, it nonetheless concluded that many uses of the word \u201ctransfer\u201d in the operative statutes refer to \u201ctransfers from one service or retirement system to another rather than from one job to another\u201d (250 AD2d 31, 35). We granted leave to appeal, and now modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As an initial matter, we agree with the Appellate Division regarding our standard of review. Deference need not be accorded the agency interpretation of the statutes in this case. The central statutory question here does not implicate \u201cknowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices or * * * evaluation of factual data,\u201d which would limit the scope of our review <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459). Instead of drawing \u201c \u2018upon the special competence [of] the agency\u2019,\u201d the question of what \u201ctransfer\u201d means within the context of these statutes is one \u201cof pure statutory reading and analysis, dependent only on accurate apprehension of legislative intent\u201d <em>(Matter of Gruber [New York City Dept. of Personnel </em>\u2014 Sweeney], 89 NY2d 225, 231-232; <em>see also, Matter of SIN, Inc. v Department of Fin., </em>71 NY2d 616, 620).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">With this in mind, we first focus on the statutes themselves <em>(Matter of 1605 Book Ctr. v Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>83 NY2d 240, 244; <em>Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669, 674-675). Both employ similar language. Section 43 (d) of the Retirement and Social Security Law, in describing transfers of \u201cmembers\u201d between systems, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201cNo such contributor [the employee making a transfer from one retirement system to another], however, shall be entitled on retirement within three years of the date of his transfer, to a greater or lesser pension for such service rendered before his transfer than he would have received had he remained under the pension provisions of the first retirement system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Section 522 (2) of the Education Law, in describing the transfer of \u201ccontributions\u201d between retirement systems, provides that \u201ctransfer\u201d comes</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u201cwith the condition that no such contributor shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>be entitled on retirement within three years of the date of his transfer to a greater pension for such service rendered before his transfer than he would have received had he remained under the pension provisions of the first retirement system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Thus, an employee who \u201ctransfers\u201d within three years of retirement cannot combine the time credited in both retirement systems into one. Taken in isolation, these excerpts could indicate that \u201ctransfer\u201d means transfer of credits between systems and not the transfer to another job. Statutory phrases should not, however, be read in isolation. Effect should be given to all words of a statute, particularly where the relevant language forms part of an integral statutory scheme, as is true of the statutes at issue. These statutes, viewed in their entirety, point to the conclusion that \u201ctransfer\u201d as used in section 43 and section 522 properly contemplates a change of employment within three years of retirement, not a transfer of service credits alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Education Law \u00a7 522 further provides that the employee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201cshall be credited in the <em>system to which he is transferring </em>with all service allowed to him in the first system. Such contributor, notwithstanding any other provision of law, shall on retirement <em>after three years of service in the second retirement system </em>be entitled to a pension based on a final average salary earned during any five consecutive years of service\u201d (Education Law \u00a7 522 [2] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">This passage confirms that it is not just the service credits that are doing the \u201ctransferring\u201d but the employees themselves. The employee must transfer \u201cservice\u201d to another system, that is, work at another job, and indeed, must perform \u201cthree years of service\u201d in that other system before the agency can calculate the basis of the retiring employee\u2019s pension. Even more convincingly, Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 43 (a) requires that any transfer \u201cmay be effectuated only if the member has accepted a position in another branch of the state or municipal service\u201d (see <em>also, Matter of Smith v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>99 AD2d 302, 303 [Levine, J.], <em>affd on opn below </em>64 NY2d 838 [Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 43 dealt generally with transfers of pension rights \u201cwhen an individual <em>changes employment </em>from or to State service\u201d] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The three-year restriction merely provides a moderate limitation on the much larger beneficial purpose of Education Law \u00a7 522 and Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 43, which were designed to generally allow an employee to gain the retirement benefits of public service and reduce burdens imposed by changes of employment. Many employees might not be willing to change jobs at the expense of reduced retirement benefits <em>(see, </em>Budget Report, at 4 [b], Bill Jacket, L 1971, ch 905 [amending Retirement and Social Security Law \u00a7 43 (d)]). As a result, we cannot escape the conclusion that the Legislature intended \u201ctransfer\u201d in the context of these statutes to encompass changes of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Any conceivable ambiguity about the meaning of \u201ctransfer\u201d is dispelled by the legislative history and TRS\u2019s own statements about the statutes <em>(Matter of Petterson v Daystrom Corp., </em>17 NY2d 32, 38). The legislative documents supporting the various amendments over the years contain statements indicating that these statutes were directed at changes of employment and that the three-year limitation was tied to such job transfers. For example, in amending the precursor to section 43 (d) in 1922, the Senate memorandum in support stated, \u201cThe amendment * * * provides for the transfer of a member\u2019s contributions and reserves from one fund to another fund on his transfer from one service to another service\u201d (Senate Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1922, ch 592). According to the Joint Legislative Committee to Study the Employees\u2019 Retirement System in a 1955 memorandum to the Governor, the proposed amendments \u201cmake it clear * * * when a person transfers from one system to another under this section [section 43], he comes into the second system as a new member\u201d (1955 NY Legis Ann, at 84, 86).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Likewise, two years later, the TRS itself supported an amendment to section 522 to \u201cconform the provisions of the Education Law applying to the New York State Teachers Retirement System with the provisions of the Retirement and Social Security Law\u201d (Mem to Governor, NY St Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, 1957 NY Legis Ann, at 176-177). TRS explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201cIn the past, <em>a member of one system upon transfer to a second system </em>would have to be in the second system five years before such person could retire with the allowance as computed under the second system. This bill will change this requirement from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>five years to three years\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 177 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Finally, the State Department of Civil Service noted that a 1971 amendment to section 43 \u201cwould continue the stipulation that the transferee <em>must work </em>a minimum of three years in the second system\u201d (Mem of President, Civ Serv Commn, Ersa H. Poston, Bill Jacket, L 1971, ch 905 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Notably, this was TRS\u2019s understanding when it sought legislation to eliminate the three-year restriction. TRS\u2019s memorandum in support of the bill it prepared and had introduced at its request explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cThese conditions were enacted at a time when it was feared public employees might be able to \u2018game\u2019 differences in the rules of public retirement systems relating to calculation of benefits by <em>changing employment on the eve of retirement </em>and transferring to the New York State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System in the hope that it would provide a better benefit in their particular circumstances\u201d (TRS Mem re Bill No. 95-10, An Act to Amend the Education Law and the Retirement and Social Security Law [Feb. 1995] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The language, history and purpose of section 43 of the Retirement and Social Security Law and section 522 of the Education Law thus indicate that transfers <em>of employment </em>within three years of retirement will limit an employee\u2019s ability to combine service credits from two retirement systems. Until an employee completes three years of service after becoming a member of the new system, the pension would be limited to what the employee would have had in the former system. Petitioner, however, did not change jobs within three years of retiring: he served continuously for 31 years as a teacher and was a member of the \u201csecond\u201d retirement system \u2014 TRS\u2014during that time. He indeed satisfied the requirement of three years of service in TRS before seeking to obtain the benefits of that system, and should, under the statutes at issue, be allowed to combine service credits earned in NYSLERS with those in TRS without the restriction of a separate calculation of pension benefits imposed by TRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Regarding petitioner\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees under 42 USC \u00a7 1988, they may be awarded only if petitioner\u2019s Federal equal protection claim is \u201csubstantial\u201d and arises out of the \u201ccommon nucleus of operative fact\u201d as that of the State law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>claim upon which petitioner prevailed <em>(see, Matter of Thomasel v Perales, </em>78 NY2d 561, 568-569; <em>Matter of Johnson v Blum, </em>58 NY2d 454, 458, n 2). There can be little question that the Federal claim springs from the same nucleus of facts as the State law claim. We conclude, however, that the equal protection argument in this case is insubstantial <em>(see, Matter of Thomasel v Perales, supra, </em>at 569). That is because the legislative classification between those who transfer between systems within three years of retirement and those who do not has several conceivable justifications \u2014 not implicating any Federal right \u2014 including TRS\u2019s <em>proffered </em>reason to prevent last minute \u201cgaming\u201d <em>(see, Maresca v Cuomo, </em>64 NY2d 242, 250). An award, of section 1988 attorneys\u2019 fees is therefore inappropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to petitioner, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
