Plaintiff consented to the photo shoot, but YM did not obtain written consent from her parent or legal guardian. YM used the photos to illustrate the \u201cLove Crisis\u201d column in its June/July 1995 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The column began with a letter to Sally Lee, YM\u2019s editor-in-chief, from a 14-year-old girl identified only as \u201cMortified.\u201d Mortified writes that she got drunk at a party and then had sex with her 18-year-old boyfriend and two of his friends. Lee responds that Mortified should avoid similar situations in the future, and advises her to be tested for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Above the column, in bold type, is a pullout quotation stating, \u201cI got trashed and had sex with three guys.\u201d Three full-color photographs of plaintiff illustrate the column \u2014 one, for example, shows her hiding her face, with three young men gloating in the background. The captions are keyed to Lee\u2019s advice: \u201cWake up and face the facts: You made a pretty big mistake;\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t try to hide \u2014 just ditch him and his buds;\u201d and \u201cAfraid you\u2019re pregnant? See a doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Plaintiff brought this diversity action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging, among other things, that YM violated sections 50 and 51 of the New York Civil Rights Law by using her photographs for trade purposes without obtaining the requisite consent. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they could not be held liable under the Civil Rights Law because the photographs had been used to illustrate a newsworthy column, the pictures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>had. a real relationship to the article and the column was not an advertisement in disguise. Plaintiff conceded these facts but argued that the \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d exception did not apply because the column and pictures together created the false impression that plaintiff was the author of the letter. The District Court denied summary judgment, holding that the newsworthiness exception does not apply where the juxtaposition of a photograph to an article creates a substantially fictionalized implication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court dismissed plaintiffs additional claims for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligence. Following trial on the Civil Rights Law claim, the jury awarded plaintiff $100,000 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, arguing that the newsworthiness exception barred recovery under the Civil Rights Law. The Second Circuit observed that New York had, in older cases, recognized a \u201cfictionalization limitation\u201d on the newsworthiness exception <em>(see, e.g., Spahn v Julian Messner, Inc., </em>21 NY2d 124, 127). The court noted, however, that our more recent cases have held that, where a photograph illustrates an article on a matter of public interest, the newsworthiness exception bars recovery unless there is no real relationship between the photograph and the article, or the article is an advertisement in disguise <em>(see, e.g., Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., </em>77 NY2d 138, 141-142). Uncertain whether <em>Finger </em>\u201csignaled the end of the fictionalization limitation,\u201d the Second Circuit <em>sua sponte </em>certified to us the following two questions, which we accepted for review (93 NY2d 948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201c1. May a plaintiff recover under New York Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51 where the defendant used the plaintiffs likeness in a substantially fictionalized way without the plaintiffs consent, even if the defendant\u2019s use of the image was in conjunction with a newsworthy column?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u201c2. If so, are there any additional limitations on such a cause of action that might preclude the instant case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We answer the first question in the negative, and therefore need not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">New York does not recognize a common-law right of privacy <em>(see, Roberson v Rochester Folding Box Co., </em>171 NY 538; <em>see also, Wojtowicz v Delacorte Press, </em>43 NY2d 858, 860). In response to <em>Roberson, </em>the Legislature enacted Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51, which provide a limited statutory right of privacy. Section 50 makes it a misdemeanor to use a living person\u2019s \u201cname, portrait or picture\u201d for advertising or trade purposes \u201cwithout having first obtained the written consent of such person, or if a minor of his or her parent or guardian.\u201d Section 51 \u2014 relevant here \u2014 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201cAny person whose name, portrait, picture or voice is used within this state for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade without the written consent first obtained as above provided [in section 50] may maintain an equitable action * * * to prevent and restrain the use thereof; and may also sue and recover damages for any injuries sustained by reason of such use\u201d (internal footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">This Court has consistently restated several basic principles concerning the statutory right of privacy. First, recognizing the Legislature\u2019s pointed objective in enacting sections 50 and 51, we have underscored that the statute is to be narrowly construed and \u201cstrictly limited to nonconsensual commercial appropriations of the name, portrait or picture of a living person\u201d <em>(Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., supra, </em>77 NY2d 138, 141; <em>see also, </em>Prosser, <em>Privacy, </em>48 Cal L Rev 383, 402-403). Second, we have made clear that these sections do not apply to reports of newsworthy events or matters of public interest <em>(see, e.g., Howell v New York Post Co., </em>81 NY2d 115, 123; <em>Stephano v News Group Publs., </em>64 NY2d 174, 184). This is because a newsworthy article is not deemed produced for the purposes of advertising or trade. Additionally, these principles reflect \u201cconstitutional values in the area of free speech\u201d <em>(Howell v New York Post Co., supra, </em>81 NY2d, at 123).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Third, this Court has held that \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d is to be broadly construed. Newsworthiness includes not only descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tions of actual events <em>(see, e.g., Freihofer v Hearst Corp., </em>65 NY2d 135 [details of matrimonial action]; <em>Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., </em>304 NY 354 [halftime show at football game]) but also articles concerning political happenings, social trends or any subject of public interest <em>(see, Beverley v Choices Women\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>78 NY2d 745, 752; <em>Stephano v News Group Publs., supra, </em>64 NY2d, at 184). Significantly, the fact that a publication may have used a person\u2019s name or likeness \u201csolely or primarily to increase the circulation\u201d of a newsworthy article \u2014 and thus to increase profits \u2014 does not mean that the name or likeness has been used for trade purposes within the meaning of the statute. Indeed, \u201cmost publications seek to increase their circulation and also their profits\u201d <em>(Stephano v News Group Publs., supra, </em>at 184-185). Whether an item is newsworthy depends solely on \u201cthe content of the article\u201d \u2014 not the publisher\u2019s \u201cmotive to increase circulation\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 185; <em>see also, Freihofer v Hearst Corp., supra, </em>65 NY2d, at 141).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Applying these principles, courts have held that a wide variety of articles on matters of public interest \u2014 including those not readily recognized as \u201chard news\u201d \u2014 are newsworthy <em>(see, e.g., Stephano v News Group Publs., supra, </em>64 NY2d, at 179-186 [picture of plaintiff wearing leather bomber jacket in column about \u201cnew and unusual products and services\u201d]; <em>Abdelrazig v Essence Communications, </em>225 AD2d 498 [picture of plaintiff in \u201cAfrican garb\u201d concerned \u201cnewsworthy fashion trends in the Black community\u201d], <em>Iv denied </em>88 NY2d 810; <em>Creel v Crown Publs., </em>115 AD2d 414 [picture of plaintiffs illustrating guide to nude beaches]; <em>Lopez v Triangle Communications, </em>70 AD2d 359, 360 [\u201cmake-over\u201d pictures in Seventeen magazine]; <em>Rand v Hearst Corp., </em>31 AD2d 406, 407-411 [quotation on book cover comparing author to plaintiff], <em>affd </em>26 NY2d 806; <em>Stern v Delphi Internet Servs. Corp., </em>165 Misc 2d 21, 22-27 [lewd photograph of plaintiff used in connection with promotion for internet news service]; <em>Welch v Group W. Prods., </em>138 Misc 2d 856 [use of television commercial in connection with Clio awards]; <em>Namath v Sports Illustrated, </em>80 Misc 2d 531, 533-535 [photographs of plaintiff in promotional material], <em>affd </em>48 AD2d 487, <em>affd </em>39 NY2d 897; <em>Ann-Margret v High Socy. Mag., </em>498 F Supp 401, 405 [partially nude photograph of plaintiff]).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Consistent with the statutory \u2014 and constitutional \u2014 value of uninhibited discussion of newsworthy topics, we have time and again held that, where a plaintiff\u2019s picture is used to illustrate an article on a matter of public interest, there can be no liability under sections 50 and 51 unless the picture has no real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>relationship to the article or the article is an advertisement in disguise <em>(see, Howell v New York Post Co., supra, </em>81 NY2d, at 123; <em>Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., supra, </em>77 NY2d, at 143; <em>Arrington v New York Times Co., </em>55 NY2d 433, 440, <em>cert denied </em>459 US 1146; <em>Murray v New York Mag. Co., </em>27 NY2d 406, 409). That has been so even where a plaintiffs photograph, when juxtaposed with an article, could reasonably have been viewed as falsifying or fictionalizing plaintiffs relation to the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In the recent case of <em>Finger, </em>for example, defendant used a photograph of plaintiffs Joseph and Ida Finger and their six children to illustrate an article on caffeine-aided <em>in vitro </em>fertilization. Plaintiffs sought damages for defendant\u2019s use of their photograph, arguing that none of their children were conceived through <em>in vitro </em>fertilization, and that they did not participate in the caffeine-aided fertility project. While this Court was made well aware of the false impression potentially created by defendant\u2019s use of the photograph, we nevertheless upheld dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 Civil Rights Law claim, repeating once again that the article was newsworthy, that there was a real relationship between the photograph and the article, and that the article was not an advertisement in disguise <em>(see, </em>77 NY2d, at 142-145).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Similarly, in <em>Arrington, </em>the New York Times Sunday Magazine used the plaintiff\u2019s photograph without his consent \u201cas the most prominent illustration of a feature article entitled \u2018The Black Middle Class: Making It\u2019 \u201d (55 NY2d, at 437). Plaintiff alleged that the article expressed views with which he did not agree and that illustrating the article with his photograph was \u201c \u2018distorting\u2019 * * * not only of black persons of \u2018middle class\u2019 status generally but also <em>of himself, </em>as its supposed exemplar, in particular\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis added]). He complained that \u201cothers quite reasonably took the article\u2019s ideas to be ones he shared\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 438). And, in his brief to this Court, Arrington argued, citing <em>Binns v Vitagraph Co. </em>(210 NY 51), that \u201cto the extent that publication of [his] photograph * * * conveys the impression that he shares the views stated in the * * * article, it is pure fiction\u201d that is \u201cprohibited by the statute\u201d (plaintiff\u2019s brief, at 19). Still, we rejected plaintiffs allegation that he was entitled to recover under the Civil Rights Law, concluding that the newsworthiness exception applied as a matter of law. We declared that plaintiffs contention that the article portrayed him in a \u201cfalse light\u201d was not cognizable, and that it would be \u201cunwise\u201d for the courts \u201cto essay the dangerous task of passing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>on value judgments based on the subjective happenstance of whether there is an agreement with views expressed on a social issue\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 441-442).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Again in <em>Murray, </em>plaintiffs photograph, taken while attending a St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade in green regalia, appeared on the cover of the defendant\u2019s magazine. \u201cDirectly above that photograph\u201d was the caption, \u201cThe Last of the Irish Immigrants\u201d <em>(Murray v New York Mag. Co., supra, </em>27 NY2d, at 408). The article discussed \u201ccontemporary attitudes of Irish-Americans in New York City\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 409). Although the <em>Murray </em>plaintiff was \u201cnot of Irish extraction\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 408), we ruled that defendant was entitled to summary judgment, because the article was newsworthy and not advertising in disguise, and because a genuine relationship existed between the \u25a0 photograph and the article <em>(id., </em>at 408-410).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Thus, it is clear that a Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51 claim does not lie where a plaintiffs photograph is used to illustrate a newsworthy article. There are two limitations: first, there must be a real relationship between the article and the photograph <em>(see, e.g., Thompson v Close-Up, Inc., </em>277 App Div 848 [\u201cno connection\u201d between photograph and article on dope peddling]), and second, the article cannot be an advertisement in disguise <em>(see, e.g., Beverley v Choices Women\u2019s Med. Ctr., supra, </em>78 NY2d, at 752-753 [calendar was advertisement in disguise]). Of course, a Civil Rights Law claim may lie if a plaintiffs picture is used purely for trade purposes, and not in connection with a newsworthy article <em>(see, Brinkley v Casablancas, </em>80 AD2d 428 [Civil Rights Law action lies for defendants\u2019 distribution of pin-up posters without plaintiffs consent]).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Applying these settled principles, we answer the first certified question in the negative. Plaintiff concedes that the \u201cLove Crisis\u201d column was newsworthy, since it is informative and educational regarding teenage sex, alcohol abuse and pregnancy \u2014 plainly matters of public concern. Further, she concedes that the photographs bore a real relationship to the article, and there is no allegation that the article was an advertisement in disguise. Given these facts, <em>Finger, Arrington </em>and <em>Murray </em>dictate that plaintiff may not recover under the Civil Rights Law, regardless of any false implication that might be reasonably drawn from the use of her photographs to il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>l\u00fastrate the article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Notwithstanding these precedents, plaintiff contends that an action lies under the Civil Rights Law where a photograph, juxtaposed with an article, creates a \u201csubstantially fictionalized\u201d implication. In support of this assertion, plaintiff cites two cases: <em>Spahn v Julian Messner, Inc. </em>(18 NY2d 324, <em>vacated </em>387 US 239, <em>adhered to on remand and rearg </em>21 NY2d 124 [1967]), and <em>Binns v Vitagraph Co. </em>(210 NY 51 [1913], <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In <em>Spahn, </em>defendants published a book entitled The Warren Spahn Story about the life of plaintiff, a famous baseball player. The book, however, was largely fiction. As was found by the trial court, the book was replete with imaginary incidents, invented dialogue, dramatized portrayals and manipulated chronologies. There was no effort and no intention to follow the facts of plaintiff\u2019s life. Defendants conducted little research, and never interviewed plaintiff, his family or any baseball player who knew him. This Court upheld a jury verdict granting plaintiff an injunction and damages pursuant to Civil Rights Law \u00a7 51, stating that although an unauthorized, truthful biography of plaintiff would be newsworthy, the protection of the newsworthiness doctrine did not extend to this \u201csubstantially fictitious biography\u201d (18 NY2d, at 328-329). On remand from the United States Supreme Court to consider the First Amendment implications of the verdict, this Court adhered to its decision, stating that it was \u201cunnecessary\u201d to protect the \u201cknowing fictionalization presented here\u201d (21 NY2d, at 129).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Similarly, in <em>Binns, </em>defendant produced a film about plaintiffs role in rescuing the passengers of a shipwrecked boat. Although based on a true occurrence, the details were manufactured, and the story was \u201cmainly a product of the imagination.\u201d This Court held that defendant\u2019s conduct was actionable under section 51, stating that although a truthful \u201crecounting or portraying [of] an actual current event\u201d would be protected, the film was designed to amuse the audience rather than to \u201cinstruct or educate\u201d <em>(see, Binns v Vitagraph Co., supra, </em>210 NY, at 56-59).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The District Court and the Second Circuit perceived a tension between the <em>Finger-Arrington-Murray </em>line and the older <em>Binns-Spahn </em>cases, in that the older cases held that the substantially fictionalized use of a plaintiffs name or likeness may be actionable, while the newer cases \u2014 without citing <em>Binns </em>or <em>Spahn </em>\u2014 focus on the existence of a \u201creal relationship\u201d and whether the work is an advertisement in disguise. Thus, the Second Circuit certified the present questions to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We see no inherent tension between the <em>Finger-ArringtonMurray </em>line and the <em>Binns-Spahn </em>line. <em>Finger, Arrington </em>and <em>Murray, </em>which are directly on point, state the rule applicable here. All three cases involved the unauthorized, and allegedly false and damaging, use of plaintiffs\u2019 photographs to illustrate newsworthy articles. Because the photographs illustrated newsworthy articles, because there was a real relationship between the photographs and the articles, and because the articles were not advertisements in disguise, we concluded that none of those plaintiffs stated a Civil Rights Law claim. Nor does plaintiff here.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">By contrast, <em>Binns </em>and <em>Spahn </em>concerned a strikingly different scenario from the one before us. In those cases, defendants invented biographies of plaintiffs\u2019 lives. The courts concluded that the substantially fictional works at issue were nothing more than attempts to trade on the persona of Warren Spahn or John Binns. Thus, under <em>Binns </em>and <em>Spahn, </em>an article may be so infected with fiction, dramatization or embellishment that it cannot be said to fulfill the purpose of the newsworthiness exception. Here, by contrast, the \u201cLove Crisis\u201d column was concededly newsworthy. Thus, this case is controlled by <em>Finger </em>\u2014 not by <em>Binns </em>or <em>Spahn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The dissent argues that <em>Binns </em>and <em>Spahn </em>permit a plaintiff to recover if the plaintiffs name or likeness is used in a substantially fictionalized way \u2014 including where, as here, the use of a plaintiffs picture in juxtaposition to a newsworthy article creates a false implication <em>{see, </em>dissenting opn, at 449-454). This, however, conflicts with our holdings in <em>Finger, Arrington </em>and <em>Murray </em>that the use of a photograph to illustrate a newsworthy article does not state a claim under the Civil Rights Law \u2014 regardless of any false impression created by the use of the photograph \u2014 so long as the article is not an advertisement and there is a real relationship between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>photograph and the article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For that same reason, the dissent is wrong to assert that our discussion in <em>Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc. (supra, </em>304 NY 354, 359-360), which mirrors the analysis in <em>Binns </em>and <em>Spahn, </em>controls the result here <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 450-451). Simply, neither <em>Binns, Spahn </em>nor <em>Gautier </em>concerns the use of a photograph to illustrate a newsworthy article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Further, contrary to the dissent, it cannot be fairly argued that fictionalization was not at issue in <em>Finger, Arrington </em>and <em>Murray (see, </em>dissenting opn, at 454-455). Rather, as noted, the nub of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints in all three cases was that the use of their pictures in the articles created a false impression about them in the minds of readers. The fictionalization issue was squarely addressed in the <em>Finger </em>briefs <em>(see, </em>plaintiff\u2019s brief, at 5, 10-13; defendant\u2019s brief, at 3, 28-33), as well as in the <em>Arrington </em>briefs <em>(see, </em>plaintiff\u2019s brief, at 19). Indeed, in his brief to this Court, Arrington cited <em>Binns </em>for the proposition that \u201cfiction\u201d was actionable under sections 50 and 51 <em>(see, id.). </em>In response, defendant argued that, under <em>Murray, </em>Arrington could not recover because the picture bore a real relationship to the newsworthy article <em>(see, </em>defendant\u2019s brief, at 11-25). We rejected the very same claim in <em>Arrington </em>that plaintiff raises here: that the Civil Rights Law allows recovery where the juxtaposition of a photograph to the text is distorting in its implication that plaintiff is the subject of the article. Thus, it is clear from <em>Finger, Arrington </em>and <em>Murray </em>that when a plaintiff\u2019s likeness is used to illustrate a newsworthy article, the plaintiff may not recover under sections 50 and 51 even if the use of the likeness creates a false impression about the plaintiff. This holding applies equally in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Also contrary to the dissent, our result would be the same whether plaintiff were Jamie Messenger or a famous person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>like Shirley Temple <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 452-453). The test is not whether plaintiff is a public or private figure. Rather, the analysis centers on whether the photograph bears a real relationship to a newsworthy article and is not an advertisement in disguise. Where those requirements are met, there is no cause of action under the Civil Rights Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Notably, if the newsworthiness exception is forfeited solely because the juxtaposition of a plaintiff\u2019s photograph to a newsworthy article creates a false impression about the plaintiff, liability under Civil Rights Law \u00a7 51 becomes indistinguishable from the common-law tort of false light invasion of privacy. One form in which the false light invasion of privacy tort \u201cfrequently appears is the use of the plaintiff\u2019s picture to illustrate a book or an article with which he has no reasonable connection, with the <em>implication that such a connection exists\u201d </em>(Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 117, at 864 [5th ed] [emphasis added]). New York does not recognize such a common-law tort <em>(see, Howell v New York Post Co., supra, </em>81 NY2d, at 123-124).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Accordingly, the first certified question should be answered in the negative, and we need not address the second.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">. Plaintiff also sought to introduce evidence that the article itself was substantially fictionalized in that the letter had in fact been invented by YM\u2019s editorial staff. The District Court, however, barred plaintiff from exploring this subject at trial, holding that the only inquiry relevant to plaintiffs Civil Rights Law \u00a7 51 claim was whether the juxtaposition of the photographs to the article \u2014 not the article itself \u2014 -was substantially fictionalized. The fictionalization alleged was that the use of the photograph in conjunction with the article conveyed the false impression that plaintiff was the author of Mortified\u2019s letter and had the experiences described in it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">. We have not been asked to, and do not, pass on the question whether a reasonable reader could conclude that plaintiff was the person identified as \u201cMortified,\u201d given that the pictures were obviously contrived and she was not' identified as the author of the letter <em>(see, University of Notre Dame Du Lac v Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>22 AD2d 452, 455 [reasonable viewers would know that \u201cthey are not seeing or reading about real Notre Dame happenings or actual Notre Dame characters\u201d], <em>affd </em>15 NY2d 940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\">. As is evident from its opening, the dissent misinterprets our decision. We do not hold that the newsworthiness exception forecloses liability under the Civil Rights Law whenever <em>\u201cthe words of the column </em>project an abstractly newsworthy subject matter\u201d (see, dissenting opn, at 448). Rather, we hold only that there is no Civil Rights Law action for a photograph illustrating a newsworthy article if there is a real relationship between the photograph and the article, and the article is not an advertisement in disguise. Our holding follows settled law and neither marginalizes nor immobilizes the statutory remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. Because <em>Gautier </em>remains good law, there is no significance to the <em>Murray </em>Court\u2019s use of an ellipsis to pass over a citation to <em>Gautier </em>in a quote from <em>Dallesandro v Holt &amp; Co. </em>(4 AD2d 470, 471, <em>appeal dismissed </em>7 NY2d 735) <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 455). Indeed, <em>Dallesandro </em>cited <em>Gautier </em>for an uncontested general principle, and the <em>Murray </em>Court\u2019s use of the ellipsis did not alter the meaning of the <em>Dallesandro </em>passage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b522-7\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A08\">(dissenting). I respectfully disagree and would answer the first question in the affirmative. Under the analysis of the Per Curiam opinion, no matter what <em>the published photographs </em>of plaintiff depict or connote, if <em>the words of the column </em>project an abstractly newsworthy subject matter, then the judicially created newsworthiness exemption forecloses the remedy of Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a750 and 51. This latest extension marginalizes the statutory authorization that was enacted expressly to supply potential redress for aggrandizing uses of a person\u2019s \u201cportrait or picture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">We all agree that the courts have properly created a newsworthiness exception to liability pursuant to the Civil Rights statute. The courts have, however, also harnessed a runaway newsworthiness exemption with exceptions. Part of the puzzle here is whether there are two exceptions \u2014 advertisement in disguise and no \u201creal relationship\u201d \u2014 or three \u2014 also a distinctive \u201cmaterial and substantial falsification\u201d prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">A recent decision of this Court fosters the vexing implication that only two exceptions to the newsworthiness exemption exist because the case happens to mention only two <em>(Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., </em>77 NY2d 138). That, in part, may explain the Second Circuit Court\u2019s quandary as to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u201csubstantial falsification\u201d facet is still viable to mitigate a functionally sweeping newsworthiness immunization against the invocation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">If the \u201cfictionalization exception\u201d remains part of New York law, as I contend, then despite the newsworthiness of part of the published column \u2014 which might otherwise operate to block this plaintiffs invocation of the remedial statute against defendants \u2014 Messenger\u2019s victory before a Federal jury could be sustainable. If, on the other hand, the \u201cfictionalization exception\u201d is rendered a \u201cdead letter\u201d \u2014 and newsworthiness reigns \u2014 then Messenger\u2019s Federal lawsuit is equally comatose.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50 provides that anyone using a picture of a living person for the purposes of trade, without having first obtained the written consent of such person, or a parent or guardian, commits a misdemeanor. Civil Rights Law \u00a7 51 adds the civil damages teeth. These complementary provisions were enacted in response to early judicial reluctance against recognizing a common-law right of privacy, coupled with a judicially expressed encouragement for a legislative solution <em>(see, Roberson v Rochester Folding Box Co., </em>171 NY 538 [1902]).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The Legislature acted in 1903. It also left the courts with a hefty burden of substantive interpretation that continued through the whole 20th Century, and now into Year 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly after the statutory framework came into being, this Court examined the fictionalization of a plaintiff\u2019s exploits and found defendants liable under the statute <em>(Binns v Vitagraph Co., </em>210 NY 51 [1913]). The Court also warned of the difficulties of \u201cthe practical enforcement of any rule which may be adopted in construing and enforcing the statute so far as it relates to purposes of trade;\u201d it encouraged further legislative ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tion to clarify the key phrase <em>(Binns v Vitagraph Co., supra, </em>at 58-59). No new enactment ensued, and the courts have continued the struggle to apply the definition of \u201cpurposes of trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">A comprehensive exegesis emerged in 1937 in <em>Lahiri v Daily Mirror </em>(162 Misc 776 [Sup Ct, NY County, Sheintag, J.]). An important feature of the opinion includes an observation that \u201cthe emphasis [in cases where liability pursuant to the statute was found] was placed on <em>dramatization </em>rather than information\u201d <em>(Lahiri v Daily Mirror, supra, </em>at 781 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Courts continued to use the \u201cdramatization\u201d feature to distinguish between the statute\u2019s availability or inertness. When \u201cthe total dominant impression conveyed is basically not a true picture or representation of the actual salient facts,\u201d and when the \u201carticle read as a whole, together with the headings <em>and the pictorial representations that accompany it, </em>constitute a sensationalized version of facts embellished with matters drawn from the author\u2019s imagination,\u201d the material may go \u201cfar beyond the scope of proper immunity pertaining to the publication of current or past news;\u201d there, the complaint should not be stricken <em>(Sutton v Hearst Corp., </em>277 App Div 155, 156-157 [1st Dept 1950], <em>Iv denied </em>277 App Div 873, citing <em>Binns v Vitagraph Co., supra </em>[emphasis added]). Also, when the photograph of a plaintiff was juxtaposed next to an article about a subject (e.g., dope peddling) with which the plaintiff had no connection, the use has been deemed for purposes of trade <em>(Thompson v Close-Up, Inc., </em>277 App Div 848 [1st Dept 1950]).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Shortly after these Appellate Division decisions, this Court ruled on a statutory privacy claim stemming from the televised projection of a plaintiff who had performed during the halftime show of a professional football game. After the Court found that the telecast of the plaintiff\u2019s act had not been used for advertising purposes, this Court plumbed the definition of \u201cuse for purposes of trade\u201d with respect to television, which, \u201c[l]ike other media * * * may have either a trade aspect or an informative or news aspect\u201d <em>(Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., </em>304 NY 354, 359 [1952]). The Court noted that use of a name or picture \u201cin connection with an item of news or one that is newsworthy, is not a use for purposes of trade within the meaning of [the statute]\u201d <em>(Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., supra, </em>at 359). It cautioned, however, that there must be a \u201clegitimate\u201d connection between the item of news and the use of a name or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>picture in order to remove the use from the realm of \u201ctrade\u201d <em>(Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., supra, </em>at 359, citing, <em>inter alia, Lahiri v Daily Mirror, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The Court also discretely emphasized that simply because a public figure or a presently newsworthy person is the proper' subject of news or informative presentation, the newsworthy \u201cprivilege does not extend to commercialization of his personality through a form of treatment distinct from the dissemination of news or information\u201d <em>(id,., </em>at 359, citing, <em>inter alia, Binns v Vitagraph Co., </em>supra; <em>Sutton v Hearst Corp., supra). </em>Alluding particularly to <em>Sutton, </em>the Court underscored the fact that the question was whether the story \u201cas presented to the reader\u201d was \u201cso embellished in the telling that it was no longer a factual report\u201d <em>(Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., supra, </em>at 360). If the story was so dramatized, its newsworthiness immunity from the operation of the statute is forfeited and lost <em>(see, id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The precedential value of <em>Gautier, </em>amidst the nuanced history of this statute in relation to the interpretive precedents, is \u2014 or should still be \u2014 a matter of greater qualitative, yet not controlling, value than the majority allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">This Court enunciated a fictionalization exception to newsworthiness immunity, consistent with the seminal <em>Gautier </em>analysis, when it found that a substantially fictionalized biography constituted an unauthorized exploitation of the plaintiffs personality \u201cfor purposes of trade\u201d <em>(see, Spahn v Julian Messner, Inc., </em>18 NY2d 324 [1966], <em>adhered to on rearg </em>21 NY2d 124). The Court recognized that even a public figure\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d may be \u201cfictionalized,\u201d and as such, the baseball star\u2019s story was found to have exploited his persona for commercial value <em>(see, id., </em>at 328).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">On reargument of <em>Spahn </em>in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Time, Inc. v Hill </em>(385 US 374) decision, this Court stood by its initial decision with respect to the fictionalized account of the professional athlete\u2019s life. The Court, of course, also necessarily imbued the authoritative interpretation of New York substantive law with the requisite constitutional speech protections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">\u201c[B]efore recovery by a public figure may be had for an unauthorized presentation of his life, it must be shown, <em>in addition to the other requirements of the statute, that the presentation is infected with mate</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>rial and substantial falsification </em>and that the work was published with knowledge of such falsification or with a reckless disregard for the truth\u201d <em>(Spahn v Julian Messner, Inc., </em>21 NY2d 124, 127 [1967] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Court found that the use of \u201cinvented dialogue\u201d to supply \u201ca dramatic portrayal attractive to the juvenile reader\u201d in a manner \u201ccustomary\u201d for the type of book involved did not entitle the defendants to publish such \u201cknowing fictionalization,\u201d which was \u201cdestructive of an individual\u2019s right * * * to be free of the commercial exploitation of his name and personality\u201d <em>(Spahn v Julian Messner, Inc., </em>21 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 127-129). Thus, if there was any doubt after <em>Gautier </em>that the courts should make a fictionalization/falsification examination in a \u201cpurposes of trade\u201d inquiry, <em>Spahn II </em>provided enduring insights. The quoted language offers significant relevance, not the ephemeral distinguishments proffered by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The protection for exploited persons against falsification or fictionalization for public figures was also extended to private individuals in <em>Pagan v New York Herald Tribune </em>(32 AD2d 341 [1st Dept 1969], <em>affd without opn </em>26 NY2d 941 [1970]). The Appellate Division opinion summarized pertinent law regarding when the use of a name or picture falls outside the statute\u2019s meaning of \u201cpurposes of trade\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cWhere a picture of an individual is published in a newspaper or magazine in connection with the presentation, <em>without false or misleading material, </em>of a matter of legitimate public interest to readers, and the picture bears a reasonable relationship to the presentation, the use of the picture in the publication is not actionable as a use for the purpose of advertising or trade within the prohibition of the statute unless the presentation is in effect an advertisement in disguise\u201d <em>(Pagan v New York Herald Tribune, supra, </em>at 343 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">If a Shirley Temple-like set of photos were used with this identical column, that would more than likely be actionable, as trading on the persona of a famous individual. The 14-year-old plaintiff adolescent, a private person who cannot even legally give consent to the use of her photos, should have no less a remedy for someone trading on her persona and aspirations, the particular protection tendered by the statute. This contrast dramatizes the irony of a real tension, as I see it, between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>extant precedential lines and a growing atrophy of the Civil Rights statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">This Court more recently has had an opportunity to examine the Civil Rights Law in the context of a series of cases that analyzed essentially only the \u201cno real relationship\u201d exception. A magazine cover depicted a plaintiff, not of Irish extraction, in a St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade, with the title of the feature article, \u201cThe Last of the Irish Immigrants\u201d <em>(Murray v New York Mag. Co., </em>27 NY2d 406 [1971]). The opinion addressed only the question \u201c \u2018whether the plaintiffs photograph has some relevance to the article\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 408), but part of <em>Murray </em>has become the resounding sound bite for Civil Rights Law \u00a7\u00a7 50 and 51 jurisprudence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201c \u2018A picture illustrating an article on a matter of public interest is not considered used for the purpose of trade or advertising within the prohibition of the statute * * * unless it has no real relationship to the article * * * or unless the article is an advertisement in disguise\u2019. <em>(Dallesandro </em>v. <em>Holt &amp; Co., </em>4 AD 2d 470, 471, app. dsmd. 7 N Y2d 735; see, also, <em>Pagan </em>v. <em>New York Herald Tribune, </em>32 A D 2d 341, affd. 26 N Y 2d 941 * * *)\u201d <em>(Murray v New York Mag. Co., supra, </em>at 409).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">However, as sound bites are often misleading due to their lack of context, so too is <em>Murray\u2019s </em>extrapolation from <em>Dallesandro. </em>A careful tracing of the <em>Dallesandro </em>material that has popped out as \u201cthe quotable quote\u201d from <em>Murray </em>reveals that <em>Dallesandro </em>faithfully cited to and relied on the seminal whole-cloth of Gautier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cA picture illustrating an article on a matter of public interest is not considered used for the purpose of trade or advertising within the prohibition of the statute <em>(Gautier </em>v. <em>Pro-Football, </em>304 N. Y. 354, 359) unless it has no real relationship to the article <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Close-Up, </em>277 App. Div. 848), or unless the article is an advertisement in disguise <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Medical Soc. of State of N. Y., </em>7 Misc 2d 549)\u201d <em>(Dallesandro v Holt &amp; Co., </em>4 AD2d 470, 471).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">All the pieces are pivotal, in my view, for a plenary appreciation of the jurisprudence affecting the instant controversy \u2014 not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>just the latest cases, as the majority posits. As I have pointed out, <em>Gautier </em>emphasized separately the importance of dramatization or fictionalization when analyzing whether a use was \u201cfor purposes of trade,\u201d an inquiry distinct from, yet not divorced from, the real relationship issue. This citation to <em>Gautier </em>was not crucial in <em>Murray, </em>where the <em>only </em>question was whether the photograph was reasonably connected to the article (see, <em>Murray v New York Mag. Co., </em>27 NY2d 406, <em>revg </em>35 AD2d 557). But the faithful link to <em>Gautier </em>in <em>Dallesandro </em>has simply gotten lost along the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Additionally, <em>Murray </em>also extracts from <em>Pagan </em>a quotation pertinent to the <em>Murray </em>issue, to wit, \u201cthat picture was published * * * \u2018in connection with the presentation * * * of a matter of legitimate public interest to readers\u2019 \u201d (27 NY2d, at 409). Again, this excerpt summarized the state of New York law as far as was concerned in <em>Murray, </em>replacing with ellipses the material that, because of the limited nature of the inquiry in <em>Murray, </em>was not necessarily apt \u2014 unlike in the instant case. Indeed, the omitted language is key here \u2014 the presentation must be made \u201cwithout false or misleading material\u201d <em>(Pagan v New York Herald Tribune, </em>32 AD2d 341, 343, <em>affd without opn </em>26 NY2d 941, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The abbreviated use of excerpts from the line of precedents is understandable in <em>Murray </em>and more recent cases involving \u201creal relationship\u201d core problems <em>(see, Arrington v New York Times Co., </em>55 NY2d 433 [1982]; <em>see also, Stephano v News Group Publs., </em>64 NY2d 174, 184-185 [1984]). The truncated use, however, must be recognized and reconciled to provide a thorough understanding of the applicable principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The most recent and next significant Court of Appeals development analyzing the \u201cno real relationship\u201d issue is the case that seems to have sealed the Second Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 need to certify to this Court its uncertainties about the state of New York law <em>(Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., </em>77 NY2d 138 [1990]). In the briefs to this Court, the <em>Finger </em>plaintiffs urged one question only \u2014 \u201cwhether a real relationship existed between the photograph * * * and an article dealing specifically with caffeine enhanced in vitro fertilization.\u201d The plaintiffs only tangentially touched on the falsification question, while they relied primarily on <em>Arrington </em>and <em>Murray. </em>They urged that the story \u201cis of such a tenuous nature that it creates the false and misleading perception that [the] family was conceived using in vitro fertilization or\u2018caffeine enhancement techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Indeed, this Court considered the plaintiffs\u2019 argument as one of purely \u201c \u2018no real relationship\u2019\u201d <em>(Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., supra, </em>at 142; <em>compare, Davis v High Socy. Mag., </em>90 AD2d 374; <em>Lerman v Flynt Distrib. Co., 14:5 </em>F2d 123 [examining precedent of this Court that supports the substantial fictionalization premise and exception]). Since the <em>Finger </em>plaintiffs hinged the false perception argument on the premise that there was no real relationship, once the Court determined that a real relationship existed, the Court ended the analysis. It did not have to take the further step implicated point-blank in this case \u2014 to address the falsification issue. Because the majority essentially subsumes this step, I disagree with its analysis leading to the negative answer to the first certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The fact that <em>Finger </em>did not purport to address the falsification issue could support the argument that this third exception did not survive <em>Finger. </em>The answer, however, to the Second Circuit\u2019s question of whether <em>Finger </em>mutes the <em>Spahn </em>falsification exception may more reliably be found, I respectfully submit, by nimble, precise tracings to the authority sources found within <em>Finger </em>itself. <em>Finger </em>continues the scrunched <em>Murray-Dallesandro </em>snippet that replaced with ellipses <em>Dallesandro\u2019s </em>reference to <em>Gautier (Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., supra, </em>at 142). Intriguingly, however, <em>Finger </em>also cites to page 185 of the <em>Stephana </em>opinion. This important reference contains (1) the citation to the page in <em>Gautier, </em>which, citing to <em>Sutton, </em>issued the admonition against dramatization or fictionalization, and (2) the citation to <em>Pagan, </em>which extended the fictionalization concern to private persons. The failure to discuss <em>Spahn, </em>the most obvious fictionalization precedent, in <em>Finger </em>is thus explained away for me, though my over-all view is summed up by the majority as a misinterpretation. <em>Spahn, </em>unlike <em>Finger, </em>involved a public figure. The reference, instead, to a case that relied on <em>Pagan </em>is far more revealing. <em>Pagan </em>essentially tells us that if a purveyor is going to present the photograph of an individual, even in conjunction with a newsworthy item, the presentation must be legitimately made \u201cwithout false or misleading material\u201d <em>(Pagan v New York Herald Tribune, supra, </em>at 343). That is still good law and supports the affirmative answer I would give to the question posed in relation to this controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In any event, the substantive law question of this case was simply not the dispositive or necessarily implicated thrust in <em>Finger. </em>Thus, the instant case is also demonstrably distinguishable from <em>Finger </em>on its facts and import. In <em>Finger, </em>\u201c[n]ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ther the article nor the caption mentioned plaintiffs\u2019 names or <em>indicated in any fashion </em>that the adult plaintiffs used caffeine or that the children were produced through <em>in vitro </em>fertilization\u201d <em>(Finger v Omni Publs. Intl., supra, </em>at 140 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Here, the caption juxtaposed next to and across a large picture of Jamie Messenger, looking \u201chung over,\u201d states, \u201c7 got trashed and had sex with three guys * * * Even worse, 7 heard them laughing about it the next day\u201d (emphasis added). The smaller caption <em>within </em>the photograph with Messenger reads, <em>\u201cYou </em>made a pretty big mistake\u201d (emphasis added). Another caption within another picture of Messenger looking distraught reads, \u201cAfraid <em>you're </em>pregnant?\u201d (emphasis added). These captions, \u201cpull quotes\u201d and photographs leap off the page with the real relationship to the published material \u2014 which is not contested \u2014 but also with the substantial falsification of the photographs in the <em>kind, manner </em>and <em>degree </em>to which they were exploited. In <em>Finger, </em>there was <em>no </em>indication in any fashion that the plaintiffs in the associated picture had experienced what was described in the content of the article. In this case, that very linkage is soldered together and dramatized. In my opinion, that is what takes this case over tolerable lines and limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Here, a Federal court jury found that reasonable readers would think Messenger was unquestionably the subject and signatory of an ersatz letter. Despite the abstracted public-interest newsworthy quality of the editor\u2019s answer to the letter, the falsified connection \u2014 \u201c7 got trashed\u201d \u2014 personalizes the matter in a devastating fashion. Even though the column enjoys the academic quality of a newsworthy subject matter, its presentation publicly paraded plaintiff as the epitomized subject for sensationalized impact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That should not be immune from the statute\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">I am unable to discern support in this Court\u2019s developed line of analysis \u2014 until today \u2014 for the conclusion that this substantially fictionalized portrayal of Messenger\u2019s likeness is beyond the statute\u2019s ken just because something about it is newsworthy in a general way. That, as I understand it \u2014 or misinterpret it, as the majority characterizes my view \u2014 is the bottom line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the majority\u2019s negative answer transmitted to the Second Circuit. For me, New York law supports a more nuanced and generous approach to the applicability of this now largely immobilized statute that is functionally and realistically foreclosed by today\u2019s ruling (see, <em>Binns v Vitagraph Co., supra; Gautier v Pro-Football, Inc., supra, </em>citing <em>Sutton v Hearst Corp., supra; Spahn I, supra, </em>and <em>Spahn II, supra; Pagan v New York Herald Tribune, supra; Stephano v News Group Publs., supra; see also, Lerman v Flynt Distrib. Co., supra; Davis v High Socy. Mag., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In sum, the practical and theoretical consequence of the negative answer justifies a too-facile escape valve from the operation of the statute, one that is also unilaterally within the control of the alleged wrongdoer. The paradigm for editors is a \u201cnewsworthy\u201d homily to lovesick adolescents or any other audience; they then just have to use a journalistic conceit of tieing the advice to a purported letter to the editor, with an inescapable first person identification of the letter as originating with any adolescent in the photo array. When an aggrieved person like Messenger reaches for the statutory lifeline, the newsworthiness notion dissipates it into a dry mirage. That is not fair or right.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Strong New York jurisprudence and protection of constitutional speech guarantees \u2014 that I too support \u2014 are urged as overarching policy reasons for courts to be very circumspect with respect to claims under the Civil Rights statutes. That should not be a preemptive justification for courts to neutralize, in functional applications, a remedial statute that this Court nudged into existence. In the endeavor to live up to this Court\u2019s and New York\u2019s robust tradition of free speech and free press protections, statutory rights and reputations of individuals can also be proportionately safeguarded and legitimately redressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur in Per Curiam opinion; Judge Bellacosa dissents and votes to answer certified question No. 1 in the affirmative in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Following certification of questions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the questions by this Court pursuant to section 500.17 of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.17), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>briefs and the record submitted, certified question No. 1 answered in the negative and certified question No. 2 not answered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\">. A prescient Law Review note in 1990 suggested \u201cthat New York\u2019s continued refusal to recognize a common-law right to privacy is becoming increasingly troublesome as the twenty-first century draws near and the threat to individual privacy mounts with the emergence of new technologies capable of ever more intrusive applications. In addition, this Note will assert that this refusal to recognize a right to privacy is rendered all the more distressing by the fact that, despite the extraordinary number of privacy-related cases that have filtered through the New York courts, there is an undeniable paucity of decisions in which the courts have satisfactorily explained the reasoning behind this continued refusal to embrace a right so fundamental to American society\u201d (Note, <em>The Right to Privacy One Hundred Years Later: New York Stands Firm as the World and Law Around it Change, </em>64 St John\u2019s L Rev 315, 323).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">.
