After specifying the testimony to be read back and directing the court reporter to do so, the Trial Judge, with the consent of both parties, ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>sented himself from the proceedings during the actual reading. Prior to departing, the Judge informed the parties, the jury and the court reporter that he remained immediately available in chambers in the event any issue arose. Following the read-back, the Judge himself conducted the requested rereading of the charge to the jury. Although a Judge\u2019s absence from read-backs is not favored, in this case, the Judge\u2019s absence does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]) and related weapons offenses (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 265.03, 265.02 [4]). He was sentenced as a second felony offender to three indeterminate, concurrent prison terms of 25 years to life, 7V2 to 15 years, and 3V2 to 7 years on the respective convictions, all terms to run consecutively to an unrelated 35-year Federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">On appeal, defendant\u2019s counsel failed to raise the issue of the Trial Judge\u2019s absence during the readback proceedings. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the conviction and a Judge of this Court denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal (see, 190 AD2d 688, <em>Iv denied </em>81 NY2d 971). Thereafter, defendant petitioned the Appellate Division for a writ of error coram nobis, arguing that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to claim error in connection with the Trial Judge\u2019s absence during readbacks constituted ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. On March 22, 1999, the Appellate Division granted defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of error coram nobis, vacated its prior affirmance of the judgment of conviction, and reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence (259 AD2d 708, <em>vacating </em>190 AD2d 688). A Judge of this Court granted the People leave to appeal from so much of the Appellate Division order as reversed the conviction (93 NY2d 1019).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Citing this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Monroe </em>(90 NY2d 982), the People contend that a per se rule of reversal should not apply in this case because (1) the Trial Judge was absent only during the uncontested, mechanical reading of testimony already in evidence, (2) all substantive rulings regarding the readbacks were made by the Trial Judge, who in no way delegated his judicial duties to another, (3) the Trial Judge, though not physically present, retained supervision and control of the proceedings by remaining immediately available to rule on any issue and (4) no prejudice to defendant has been shown. Defendant, in turn, argues that, by absenting himself from the courtroom during the readbacks, the Trial Judge failed to exercise due supervision over the proceedings, thus depriving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>defendant of his constitutional right to a trial by jury. We agree with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">An integral component of a defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury is the supervision of a Judge. In any case where the Judge\u2019s absence from trial proceedings prevents performance of an essential, nondelegable judicial function, reversal is required <em>(see, People v Monroe, </em>90 NY2d, 982, 984, <em>supra; People v Toliver, </em>89 NY2d 843, 844; <em>People v Torres, </em>72 NY2d 1007, 1008-1009; <em>People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307, 311-312; <em>see also, People v Parisi, </em>276 NY 97, 100). Here, defendant\u2019s claim does not require reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Recently, in <em>People v Monroe </em>(90 NY2d 982, <em>supra), </em>we affirmed a judgment of conviction where, on five separate occasions during a three-week trial, the court permitted the jury to examine various exhibits outside the presence'of the court, the defendant and the attorneys. We rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the Trial Judge\u2019s absence from the examinations constituted reversible error. We reasoned that the jury examined the exhibits only after they were received in evidence and, before each viewing and at other times during the trial, the Trial Judge admonished the jury not to discuss the evidence or the case itself <em>(id., </em>at 984). Because the Trial Judge\u2019s admonitions to the jury were \u201csufficient to dispel the possibility of premature deliberation during the viewings,\u201d we concluded that \u201cthe viewings did not require any rulings or instructions and did not implicate any of the Judge\u2019s substantive roles in conducting the trial\u201d <em>(id.; see also, United States v Grant, 52 </em>F3d 448 [2d Cir]; <em>United States v Pfingst, 477 </em>F2d 177, 195-197 [2d Cir], <em>cert denied </em>412 US 941; <em>People v Sian Mai, </em>175 AD2d 692, <em>Iv denied </em>78 NY2d 1081). Thus, inasmuch as the defendant had failed to object to the Judge\u2019s absence during the examinations, the issue was unpreserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">By contrast, in <em>People v Ahmed </em>(66 NY2d 307, 310, <em>supra), </em>we concluded \u201cthat the absence of the trial judge, and the delegation of some of his duties to his law secretary during a part of the jury\u2019s deliberations, deprived the defendant of his right to a trial by jury.\u201d There, on two occasions during the jury\u2019s deliberations, the Trial Judge, due to illness, permitted his law secretary to reread requested portions of the court\u2019s charge to the jury. Additionally, after departing the courthouse, the Trial Judge continued to respond to jury requests through his law secretary. Finally, just prior to the verdict, the Judge\u2019s law secretary, by now serving functionally as Judge, received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>two notes from the jury which the Judge never considered. In these circumstances, we concluded that notwithstanding the parties\u2019 consent to the substitute procedures employed, the Trial Judge\u2019s absence from the proceedings constituted a significant departure from the constitutionally protected, common-law \u201cjudge and jury system\u201d and required reversal <em>(id., </em>at 311; <em>see, People v Torres, </em>72 NY2d 1007, <em>supra </em>[reversal required where Trial Judge, from outside courthouse, directed court officer to tell deadlocked jury to continue deliberating]).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The absence of Trial Judges from readbacks is disfavored. In this case, however, the Trial Judge\u2019s absence did not rise to the level of a \u201cmode of proceedings\u201d error requiring reversal despite defendant\u2019s consent <em>(see, People v Monroe, </em>90 NY2d, <em>supra, </em>at 984). The readbacks required no further rulings or instructions than those previously made by the court. Indeed, the record indicates clearly that all substantive rulings regarding the readbacks were made by the Trial Judge and no delegation of judicial authority occurred <em>(compare, People v Ahmed, </em>66 NY2d 307, <em>supra; People v Torres, </em>72 NY2d 1007, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed and the case remitted to that Court for further proceedings in accordance with CPL 470.25 (2) (d) and CPL 470.40 (2) (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed and case remitted to the Appellate Division, Second Department, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
