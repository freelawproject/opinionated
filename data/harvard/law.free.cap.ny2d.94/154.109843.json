The statutory scheme of the Public Authorities Law relating to the MTA supports the view that any limitation on interest rates in condemnation proceedings would be found in section 1267, not section 1276. There being none, Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501 would apply. II. The history of interest rates as affects condemnation proceedings fortifies the conclusion that Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5) does not apply to condemnation proceedings. <em>(Matter of City of New York [Bronx Riv.

The courts below answered 9% as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In June 1988, the MTA condemned certain easements across American Pen\u2019s property in order to construct a roadway accessing an electric substation. In accordance with EDPL article 3, the MTA appraised the property at $230,000 before the taking and $110,000 afterward, and offered American Pen $120,000, the amount it viewed as just compensation. American Pen rejected the offer. After the parties failed to reach agreement, the MTA acquired title to the easements pursuant to court order, and in April 1992 made a payment of $120,000 plus $35,619.29, representing 9% interest \u201cfrom title vesting date to the date of payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">American Pen then filed a claim against the MTA, alleging that the taking resulted in damages totaling $1,323,000. According to American Pen, the full value of its property was $1,350,000, and the postcondemnation value was only $27,000. Supreme Court, after a bench trial, accepted American Pen\u2019s valuation of the property, concluded that the taking reduced the value by 40% and ordered that the MTA pay an additional $420,000 plus interest. When American Pen sought 9% interest in its proposed judgment, the MTA countered that the applicable rate was 4% based on Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5). Supreme Court held that the MTA, as a public corporation, was \u201cbound by the 9% rate of interest\u201d and ordered payment of 9% prejudgment as well as postjudgment interest on the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The MTA appealed, alleging that both the award and the interest rate were excessive. After the MTA filed its notice of appeal, however, the parties settled the case for $400,000, reducing the principal amount of the award. In February 1998 \u2014 almost a decade after the taking \u2014 the MTA paid American Pen $280,000 (the principal amount of the settlement reduced by the advance payment), along with interest on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>settled, amount at a negotiated 6% rate, without prejudice to either party\u2019s position as to interest. On appeal, the MTA continued to argue for an across-the-board 4% interest rate, and American Pen pressed for 9%.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Appellate Division modified Supreme Court\u2019s order. The court concluded that because Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501 authorized 9% interest not only on judgments but also on \u201caccrued claims,\u201d prejudgment interest could be awarded at a rate as high as <em>9%, </em>and it ordered a hearing to determine whether 9% was reasonable under the circumstances (253 AD2d 366, 367). As to postjudgment interest, however, the Appellate Division opted for the 4% rate provided by Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5). The court concluded that by its terms, Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5) permitted application of a 4% maximum interest rate on \u201cjudgments\u201d against the MTA and that \u201cthe 4% rate [was] reasonable in this case\u201d <em>(supra, </em>253 AD2d, at 368).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On remittal, Supreme Court determined that \u201c9% [was] a fair rate of interest\u201d for the prejudgment portion of the award. The MTA appealed Supreme Court\u2019s judgment directly to this Court, bringing up for review the Appellate Division\u2019s prior order that the 9% rate applies to prejudgment interest awards in its condemnation proceedings. Because American Pen did not cross-appeal on the issue of the applicability of Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5) to postjudgment interest on condemnation awards, only the prejudgment rate is before the Court. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">To ensure that a condemnee obtains just compensation, the State is constitutionally required to pay prejudgment interest to compensate for delay in making payment and deprivation of use of the property <em>(Matter of City of New York [Brookfield Re-frig. Corp.], </em>58 NY2d 532, 536-537). \u201cThe amount of interest necessary to bring the payment into accord with the constitutional requirement is a judicial question, although the interest rate fixed by the Legislature will be deemed presumptively reasonable\u201d <em>(Adventurers Whitestone Corp. v City of New York, </em>65 NY2d 83, 87).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Against this backdrop, we examine the question of which statutory interest rate applies in this condemnation proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ing. On the one hand, Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501 states that the \u201crate of interest to be paid by a public corporation upon any judgment or accrued claim against the public corporation shall not exceed nine per centum per annum.\u201d The MTA is a public corporation. On the other hand, Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5) provides that the \u201crate of interest to be paid by the [MTA] upon any judgment for which it is liable shall not exceed four per centum per annum.\u201d We agree with Supreme Court and the Appellate Division that the 9% rate specified in Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">We begin by considering Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (5), which appellant urges applies to any and every claim against the MTA. Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 (\u201cActions against the authority\u201d) is a consent to suit provision authorizing suit against the MTA. It applies to all actions against the MTA for \u201cdamages, for injuries to real or personal property or for the destruction thereof,\u201d personal injuries or death <em>(see, </em>Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 [1], [2], [3]). It is generally for these types of actions, and not for constitutional claims for just compensation, that the Legislature mandated that interest rates for \u201cany judgment\u201d against the MTA not exceed 4%. Indeed, it is not Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276 but the New York State Constitution that enables condemnees to bring suit against the MTA <em>(see, </em>NY Const, art I, \u00a7 7 [a]). The State and its agencies are never immune from claims arising out of the exercise of their power of eminent domain. A consent to suit statute, such as Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276, is thus inapposite to claims for just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Significantly, in 1969 the Legislature itself acknowledged the unfairness of a presumptive 4% rate in the condemnation context, when it raised the interest rate applicable to municipal corporations in eminent domain proceedings from 4 to 6% <em>(see, </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 3-a [2]). The sponsor of the amendment explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\u201ca condemnee suffers an immediate loss in a condemnation when he receives 4% as interest on condemnation awards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cIt is inequitable to penalize a condemnee when by our law * * * the sovereign power seizing by eminent domain is required to pay just compensation.\u201d (Mem of Senate Sponsor Albert B. Lewis, Bill Jacket, L 1969, ch 1102; <em>see also, </em>L 1966, ch 921 [amending State Finance Law \u00a7 16 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>provide for a 6% interest rate on condemnation awards against the State in contrast to the 4% rate otherwise applicable]; 1966 Report of Committee on Land Acquisition Law and Procedures, at 162 [characterizing 4% interest rate applicable to condemnations as \u201coutmoded\u201d].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">By contrast to Public Authorities Law \u00a7 1276, Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501 entitles claimants to a presumptive 9% interest rate with respect to \u201cany judgment or accrued claim against\u201d a public corporation. When section 2501 was amended in 1982 to raise the applicable rate from 4% to <em>9%, </em>the bill\u2019s sponsor stated that since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201cthe mid-1970\u2019s the rate of interest in the private marketplace has exceeded these amounts often to a substantial degree. Those businesses and individuals that have legitimate claims against public entities have been placed in a tremendously unfair position in terms of being compensated in any sort of reasonable or just way for interest incurred or lost due to nonpayment or nonsettlement of just claims * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">\u201cWhatever fiscal impact there might be on the public is more than balanced off by the rectification of the gross injustice and inequity being placed on the private taxpaying claimant.\u201d (Mem of Assembly Sponsor Daniel B. Walsh in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1982, ch 681.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Additionally, Unconsolidated Laws \u00a7 2501 mirrors the statute applicable in condemnation proceedings against the State <em>(see, </em>State Finance Law \u00a7 16). Parity in the State rate and the rate generally applicable to its public corporations would be consistent with the underlying purposes of the EDPL, which are \u201cto assure that just compensation shall be paid to those persons whose property rights are acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain * * * [and] ensure equal treatment to all property owners\u201d (EDPL 101; <em>see also, Matter of City of New York [New Mun. Bldg.], </em>57 Misc 2d 156, 162 [differentiation between condemnors with respect to applicable interest rate was wholly arbitrary, \u201cunreasonable and palpably improper\u201d because, among other reasons, \u201cthe Constitution guarantees the same measure of just compensation to all own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ers of property\u201d], <em>affd, sub nom. Matter of City of New York [Manhattan Civic Ctr. Area], </em>32 AD2d 530, <em>affd </em>27 NY2d 518).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unreviewable or without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\">. The statutory interest rate is presumptive only and can be overcome by evidence that the rate would result in a denial of just compensation, or unfairness <em>(Adventurers Whitestone Corp. v City of New York, supra, </em>65 NY2d, at 87; <em>Matter of County of Nassau [Eveandra Enters.], </em>42 NY2d 849, 850; see <em>also, Rodriguez v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>91 NY2d 76, 81).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">. We recognize that a 6% interest rate applies in condemnation proceedings against municipal corporations, and that uniformity among property owners \u2014 an oft-stated goal of the Legislature \u2014 has not yet been achieved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
