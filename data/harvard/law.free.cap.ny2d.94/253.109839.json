The court below erred in affirming the decision of the lower court, because law enforcement personnel are covered by separate disability benefit systems with differing coverage and consequences. <em>(Matter of Sutka v Conners, </em>73 NY2d 395; <em>Matter of Cook v City of Utica, </em>88 NY2d 833; <em>Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527.) II. Because of their different standards for benefit entitlement, the municipal disability system of section 207-c and the Workers\u2019 Compensation disability system have distinct and disparate outcomes. <em>(Matter of Wilson v General Motors Corp., </em>298 NY 468; <em>Matter of Katz v Kadans &amp; Co., </em>232 NY 420; <em>Matter of Hughes v Trustees of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, </em>245 NY 201; <em>Greenberg v Voit, </em>250 NY 543; <em>Matter of Mausert v Albany Bldrs.

The principles of collateral estoppel do not apply to a municipality making a section 207-c eligibility determination after a Workers\u2019 Compensation award because party identity is lacking. <em>(Matter of Juan C. v Cortines, </em>89 NY2d 659; <em>Matter of 1616 Second Ave. Rest. v New York State Liq.

We answer the question in the negative and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>reverse the order of the Appellate Division that ruled against appellant Nassau County on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Petitioner Balcerak, a correction officer with the Nassau County Correctional Center, sustained injuries in an automobile accident in June 1996. Just before the accident, Balcerak had left the North Shore University Hospital, where he was assigned to a special duty \u201cmidnight shift.\u201d He later filled out an \u201cinjury sustained while on duty form\u201d requesting General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits. The County never paid him these benefits and eventually memorialized the functional denial of benefits in a letter to Balcerak dated September 9, 1997. In the interim, Balcerak applied for Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits. Although the County opposed this application, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board granted Balcerak this form of benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Approximately one month after the Board determination, Balcerak filed this CPLR article 78 petition. He pressed his claim against Nassau County for General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits, retroactive to the date of the accident. Supreme Court at first dismissed the petition, without prejudice, as premature. It noted that the County had not conducted a medical examination and had indicated that it was going to appeal the Workers\u2019 Compensation award. On renewal, after the County failed to appeal the Workers\u2019 Compensation determination, Supreme Court granted Balcerak\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Supreme Court concluded that the County was bound by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board finding that Balcerak was injured while on duty. The court further stated: \u201cThe County has offered no evidence to refute petitioner\u2019s medical evidence that he suffers a compensable disability * * * Under the circumstances, the petition must be granted as respondent [the County] has not shown a rational basis for its decision.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed, agreeing that the collateral estoppel rationale applied against the County. This Court granted leave to appeal to Nassau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">With respect to the estoppel issue, the County \u2014 and <em>amici curiae </em>that support it \u2014 argues that the Appellate Division erred because guiding precedent of this Court points to a conclusion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and the General Municipal Law are discrete, independent compensation systems. The County\u2019s proffered rationale also states that a favorable Workers\u2019 Compensation determination should not, therefore, automatically entitle an employee to the special, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>extra benefits provided through section 207-c of the General Municipal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Balcerak \u2014 and the <em>amicus curiae </em>that supports him\u2014 responds that the County should not be entitled to re-litigate the injury-in-performance-of-duty issue, when the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board has already determined that very issue. He argues that the standards to be applied with respect to both types of benefits are interchangeable; the issues, as his theory poses them, share an identity, and, therefore, the jurisprudential economies of collateral estoppel should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We agree with the appellant County that identity of issue is lacking here, and, thus, collateral estoppel should not be available <em>(see generally, Matter of Juan C. v Cortines, </em>89 NY2d 659; <em>Ryan v New York Tel. Co., </em>62 NY2d 494; <em>Schwartz v Public Adm\u2019r of County of Bronx, </em>24 NY2d 65). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board determination does not automatically preclude a municipality\u2019s discrete decision on a General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c application.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Contrary to Balcerak\u2019s arguments and to the reasoning in the lower courts, the two statutory systems do not necessarily examine and determine the same issue, in the same way, and under the same protocols, procedures and conditions. <em>Matter of Crawford v Sheriffs Dept. </em>(152 AD2d 382, <em>Iv denied </em>76 NY2d 704), is neither determinative, nor binding in any way <em>(see, Matter of Marchant v Mead-Morrison Mfg. Co., </em>252 NY 284, 298, <em>rearg denied </em>253 NY 534, <em>appeal dismissed </em>282 US 808).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Our precedents are plain that the party seeking the benefit of collateral estoppel \u2014 here, employee Balcerak \u2014 bears the initial burden of demonstrating identity of issue <em>(see, Matter of Juan C. v Cortines, </em>89 NY2d 659, 667, <em>supra; Ryan v New York Tel. Co., </em>62 NY2d 494, 501, <em>supra; Schwartz v Public Adm\u2019r of County of Bronx, </em>24 NY2d 65, 73, <em>supra). </em>Balcerak\u2019s arguments do not meet the test and burden. Initially, his theory highlights the fact that the Legislature, which could have utilized the same phrase to describe the requisite showing for entitlement to benefits under both statutes, instead chose to enact two different phrasings. The operational phrases, moreover, are not necessarily \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d though this interpretative tool is not alone determinative. On plain reading, the statutes not only start off expressed differently, but the legislative history and operational features also follow paths of differential interpretation and application.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c pertinently provides that a correction officer \u201cinjured in the performance of his duties\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>shall be paid by the employer the full amount of regular salary or wages for the duration of the disability and is covered for all medical treatment and hospital care necessitated by reason of the injury. The history behind a 1997 amendment to the provision \u2014 which added Nassau County probation officers to the list of municipal employees eligible for these special disability benefits \u2014 sheds light on the particular purpose behind allowing these special disability benefits to various recipients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cToday\u2019s probation officers find themselves performing many of the functions performed by their counterparts in the police and corrections services. Like other police and peace officers, probation officers are exposed on a daily basis to the risks and dangers involved in managing an increasingly violent criminal population. In addition, they are regularly exposed to * * * a high possibility of bodily injury that may result from the performance of their duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cHowever, probation officers do not receive comparable disability coverage either [sic] for injuries they sustain in the line of performance of those duties\u201d (Senate Mem in Support, L 1997, ch 675, 1997 NY Legis Ann, at 458-459).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">It is evident that General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits were meant to fulfill a narrow and important purpose. The goal is to compensate specified municipal employees for injuries incurred in the performance of special work related to the nature of heightened risks and duties. These functions are keyed to \u201cthe criminal justice process, including investigations, presentencing, criminal supervision, treatment and other preventative corrective services\u201d (Senate Mem in Support, <em>op. cit., </em>at 458).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, on the other hand, is the State\u2019s most general and comprehensive social program, enacted to provide all injured employees with some scheduled compensation and medical expenses, regardless of fault for ordinary and unqualified employment duties (Minkowitz, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 1, at 3-4). An injury means \u201caccidental injuries arising out of and in the course of employment\u201d, with certain exceptions that are not pertinent to the analysis of the instant problem (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7\u00a7 2, 10; <em>see also, </em>Minkowitz, Supp Practice Commentar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ies, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2, 1999 Pocket Part, at 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The practical and theoretical distinctions are not merely semantical. It is justifiable and understandable that police or correction officers may be eligible for Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits as a result of circumstances that might not entitle them to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits. For example, a police officer may be entitled to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits as a result of an injury during a Police Department team basketball practice because the nature of the activities may allow the injury to be considered as \u201carising out of and in the course\u201d of the employment <em>(see, Matter of Malan v Town of Yorktown, </em>110 AD2d 949, 950). That kind of injury, however, is not the heightened risk type intended to be deemed automatically as arising during the \u201cperformance\u201d of duties related to \u201cthe criminal justice process\u201d (Senate Mem in Support, L 1997, ch 675, 1997 NY Legis Ann, at 458). The General Municipal Law is designed to redress and compensate only the latter more generously than the Workers\u2019 Compensation schedule would.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Additionally, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 30 indirectly acknowledges that General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits are not automatically bestowed just because a Workers\u2019 Compensation award has been made. Section 30 provides that \u201cin case of\u2019 a General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c award, those benefits shall be credited against those given under Workers\u2019 Compensation. This provision guards against a presumption or collateral estoppel \u201ckicker\u201d that a General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c award should automatically be piggy backed on top of a Workers\u2019 Compensation award. Indeed, it cogently implies that the two types of benefits are to be considered and resolved discretely.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Furthermore, when the Legislature wishes to create presumptions in the social legislation field, it does so unmistakably. There are precise \u201cpresumptions\u201d set forth in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, which favor employees by granting easy initial access to benefits (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 21, entitled \u201cPresumptions\u201d). Significantly, the presumption formula is not repeated in the narrower but more generous General Municipal Law category <em>(compare, </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 21 [presumption that the claim comes within the provision of the law], <em>with Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527, 532 [section 207-c \u201cdoes not provide for automatic entitlement\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>This Court is therefore persuaded that no specific statutory-language or history has been presented or found that would lead to the conclusion that the eligibility determinations for these distinct types of statutory benefits should not stand and be resolved essentially on their own merits <em>(see, Matter of Cook v City of Utica, </em>88 NY2d 833; <em>see also, Matter of Sutka v Conners, </em>73 NY2d 395, 404). Rather, all the available authority, analysis and procedure point to the conclusion that no identity of issue inheres in determinations regarding these two types of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Even the manner and forum of resolution are significantly distinct. The plain wording and the legislative history of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c notably authorize a municipality itself, not any other independent entity like the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board, to make the determination whether the injury or illness is related to work performance in the line of duty <em>(see, Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, supra, </em>at 532; <em>see also, Matter of Cook v City of Utica, </em>88 NY2d 833, <em>supra). </em>That is an important distinction with a real legal significance that is entitled to respect and some effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In sum, the issue involving the entitlement to benefits in the General Municipal Law setting is not necessarily the same one decided in a Workers\u2019 Compensation determination. The latter forum features a more lenient and more inclusive standard of covered activity than is intended to be covered and compensated in a General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits universe. The burdens, procedures and prescribed benefits are also significantly distinct between the two statutory formulas. Thus, the General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c application should not be automatically predetermined by the very different Workers\u2019 Compensation Law procedure, analysis and outcome. This Court\u2019s determination today also avoids the undesirable and impractical ramification of engendering races to distinct forums for a General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c claim and a Workers\u2019 Compensation determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Since our decision resolves only the collateral estoppel issue, we remit the matter to the Appellate Division for review of the County\u2019s argument that Supreme Court also erred in finding that the County did not have a rational basis for its decision denying Balcerak section 207-c benefits, a question not yet addressed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the case remitted to the Appellate Division for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
