Rossi, </em>Syracuse, and <em>J. Scott Porter </em>for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlN\">I. The Commission\u2019s factual findings that Judge Mulroy engaged in intentional or reckless deception under oath, that he tried to subvert the judicial process to suit his own needs and that he is biased are not supported by the preponderance of the evidence. <em>(Matter of Sims, </em>61 NY2d 349; <em>Matter of Mogil, </em>88 NY2d 749; <em>People v Bouton, </em>50 NY2d 130; <em>People v Van Gaasbeck, </em>189 NY 408; <em>Matter of Agresta, </em>64 NY2d 327; <em>People v Zimmer, </em>51 NY2d 390; <em>Matter of D'Addario, </em>230 AD2d 509; <em>Matter of Canavan, </em>183 AD2d 186.) II. Because no Judge has been removed for uttering a racial or ethnic epithet off the Bench, removal is not warranted because Judge Mulroy\u2019s spoken misconduct was sporadic, was private, did not lead to the filing of any complaints, and did not affect in any way his ability to perform his judicial duties fairly and impartially. <em>(Matter of Quinn, </em>54 NY2d 386; <em>Matter of Kiley, </em>74 NY2d 364; <em>Matter of Skinner, </em>91 NY2d 142; <em>Matter of Mazzei, </em>81 NY2d 568; <em>Matter of Cohen, </em>74 NY2d 272; <em>Matter of Agresta, </em>64 NY2d 327; <em>Matter of Wait, </em>67 NY2d 15; <em>Matter of Shilling, </em>51 NY2d 397; <em>Matter of Romano, </em>93 NY2d 161; <em>Matter of Roberts, </em>91 NY2d 93.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b727-4\"><em>Gerald Stern, </em>New York City, and <em>John J.

Petitioner has engaged in serious misconduct which amply demonstrates his lack of fitness for judicial office. <em>(Matter of Agresta, </em>64 NY2d 327; <em>Matter of Fabrizio, </em>65 NY2d 275; <em>Matter of Cerbone, </em>61 NY2d 93; <em>Matter of Aldrich v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>58 NY2d 279; <em>Matter of Kuehnel v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>49 NY2d 465.) II. The three <em>amici </em>briefs provide no basis to reject the Commission\u2019s determination. <em>(Matter of Agresta, </em>64 NY2d 327; <em>Matter of Schiff, </em>83 NY2d 689; <em>Matter of Duckman, </em>92 NY2d 141.) III. Removal is the appropriate sanction. <em>(Matter of Duckman, </em>92 NY2d 141; <em>Matter of Reeves, </em>63 NY2d 105; <em>Matter of Schiff, </em>83 NY2d 689; <em>Matter of Roberts, </em>91 NY2d 93; <em>Matter ofAssini, </em>94 NY2d 26; <em>Matter of Collazo, </em>91 NY2d 251; <em>Matter of Shilling, </em>51 NY2d 397; <em>Matter of Sardino v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>58 NY2d 286.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b727-5\"><em>Mackenzie, Smith, Lewis, Michell &amp; Hughes, L.

The position of the Judicial Conduct Commission majority, if adopted, would unduly curtail the discretion of a Trial Judge to partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>pate actively in settlement discussions for the purpose of effecting plea bargains in pending criminal cases. II. The County Judges Association of the State of New York shares the concern expressed in the Mulroy brief and in the briefs of <em>amici </em>over the potential impact of this matter on judicial independence. <em>(Matter of Greenfield, </em>76 NY2d 293; <em>Matter of Duckman, </em>92 NY2d 141.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b728-5\"><em>Hancock &amp; Estabrook, L.

Hancock, Jr., </em>of counsel), for Onondaga County Bar Association Assigned Counsel Program, Inc., <em>amicus curiae.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A29\">I. The conduct for which Judge Mulroy has been found unfit to serve consists essentially of his exercise of \u201cpoor judgment in making a number of ill-advised and careless comments off the Bench.\u201d Imposing the most severe sanction of removal is plainly disproportionate to the seriousness of such conduct and is an unprecedented action which conflicts with past decisions of the Commission and of this Court. <em>(Matter of Duckman, </em>92 NY2d 141; <em>Matter of Agresta, </em>64 NY2d 327; <em>Matter of Schiff, </em>83 NY2d 689; <em>Matter of Kuehnel v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>49 NY2d 465.) II. Given the evidence that some or all of the charges grew out of the District Attorney\u2019s displeasure with one or more of Judge Mulroy\u2019s rulings, sustaining the sanction of removal would seriously erode the confidence of the litigants, their lawyers and the public in the independence of the judiciary in the criminal courts of Onondaga County. <em>(Matter of Duckman, </em>92 NY2d 141.) III. Taking all of the charges together, the conduct of Judge Mulroy does not warrant removal and accepting the Commission\u2019s recommended sanction would deprive the citizens of Onondaga County of an experienced, competent and fair Judge. <em>(Matter of Steinberg, </em>51 NY2d 74; <em>Matter of Boulanger, </em>61 NY2d 89; <em>Matter of Cohen, </em>74 NY2d 272; <em>Matter of Moynihan, </em>80 NY2d 322; <em>Matter of Embser, </em>90 NY2d 711; <em>Matter of Kane, </em>50 NY2d 360; <em>Matter of Shilling, </em>51 NY2d 397; <em>Matter of Gelfand, </em>70 NY2d 211; <em>Matter of Kuehnel v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>49 NY2d 465; <em>Matter of Esworthy, </em>77 NY2d 280.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b728-6\"><em>Frederick O\u2019Rourke, </em>Syracuse, and <em>Kate Rosenthal </em>for Syracuse Association of Defense Lawyers, <em>amicus curiae.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT0\">I. The integrity of the entire criminal justice system is undermined when one arm of the government is allowed to target Judges and subject them to unwarranted criticism of their decisions. II. The sanction of removal is inappropriate and unduly harsh under the facts and circumstances of this case. <em>(Matter of Skinner, </em>91 NY2d 142; <em>Matter of Duckman, </em>92 NY2d 141.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A-t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b729-4\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Petitioner, a Judge of the County Court, Onondaga County, asks us to review a determination of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, sustaining four of seven charges of misconduct and removing him from office (see, NY Const, art VI, \u00a7 22; Judiciary Law \u00a7 44). The Commission concluded that petitioner failed to maintain the \u201chigh standards of conduct\u201d necessary to uphold the integrity of the judiciary (22 NYCRR 100.1; see, Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 1); acted in a manner inconsistent with \u201cthe integrity and impartiality of the judiciary\u201d (22 NYCRR 100.2 [A]; see, Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 2 [A]); used his position to advance his own private interests (22 NYCRR 100.2 [C]; see, Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 2 [B]); failed to act in a \u201cdignified and courteous\u201d manner (22 NYCRR 100.3 [B] [3]; see, Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3 [A] [3]); engaged in conduct manifesting a bias based upon race, gender, age and national origin (22 NYCRR 100.3 [B] [4]; see, Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 1); and initiated an ex parte communication with an attorney for the purpose of resolving a pending case (22 NYCRR 100.3 [B] [6]; see, Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3 [A] [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the Referee found against petitioner on six of the seven charges. The Referee determined that petitioner, while attempting to influence a disposition, made derogatory racial remarks about a crime victim (charge I); displayed intemperate behavior and pressed a prosecutor to offer a plea for petitioner\u2019s own personal convenience (charge II); used vulgar language to characterize a criminal defendant\u2019s statements at sentencing (charge III); made disparaging remarks about Italian-Americans (charge IV); failed to disclose his relationship with a witness appearing before him (charge VI); and testified at a proceeding with reckless disregard for the truth (charge VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">A majority of the Commission sustained the Referee\u2019s findings with respect to charges I, II, IV and VII, dismissed the remaining charges and determined that petitioner should be removed. While all nine members present sustained charges I and IV, they divided on the remaining charges and on the issue of sanction. Three members found the evidence insufficient to support charge II and three members found the evidence insufficient to support charge VII. Two members voted for censure rather than removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Although petitioner admits some wrongdoing, he contends that the Commission failed to sustain its burden of proof on certain charges, and that the sanction of removal is excessive in light of his \u201c12-year unblemished\u201d record. Having reviewed the record de novo, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s determination is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and that, the sanction of removal is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">With respect to charge I, the evidence establishes that petitioner made derogatory racial remarks about a crime victim in an attempt to induce a plea offer. While attending a charity event, petitioner initiated a conversation with a prosecutor concerning a pending, four-defendant murder case. During that conversation, he urged the prosecutor to \u201cbe reasonable\u201d in offering pleas to two of the defendants, and that he should not worry about \u201cgiving away\u201d the case because no one cared, since the 67-year-old murder victim was \u201cjust some old nigger bitch.\u201d These words, as well as the context in which they were uttered, are indefensible. Petitioner\u2019s racially charged assessment of the case not only devalued the victim\u2019s life but also cast doubt on the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and, by itself, puts into question petitioner\u2019s fitness to hold judicial office <em>(Matter of Assini, </em>94 NY2d 26, 29-30).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Although petitioner admits the impropriety of his remarks, he asserts that they were private, isolated statements that were not intended to influence a disposition. He claims that the prosecutor was frustrated because another Judge had suppressed the confession of one of the defendants, and that he was concerned about having to offer a plea to a codefendant in exchange for his cooperation. In an apparent attempt to alleviate the prosecutor\u2019s concerns, petitioner asked him whether, in offering a plea, the District Attorney\u2019s office might be perceived as not caring about the victim. The Referee, however, having had the opportunity to assess petitioner\u2019s responses firsthand, rejected his rationalized version of the remarks and we, like the Commission, uphold that determination <em>(see also, Matter of Schiff, </em>83 NY2d 689, 692-693; <em>Matter of Esworthy, </em>77 NY2d 280, 282; <em>Matter of Agresta, </em>64 NY2d 327, 330; <em>Matter of Kuehnel v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>49 NY2d 465, 468-469).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Moreover, petitioner\u2019s disparaging remarks were not isolated. In 1996, petitioner was at a charity dinner when the Oneida County District Attorney, an Italian-American, greeted him and asked him how his reelection campaign was progressing. When petitioner complained about having to run against an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>opponent, the District Attorney replied, \u201csome of us have to run for office and others get it handed to them on a silver platter.\u201d Petitioner retorted, \u201cYou know how you Italian types are with your Mafia connections.\u201d Two people seated at petitioner\u2019s table witnessed the exchange. One, also an Italian-American, testified that she was offended by petitioner\u2019s remarks, while the other, a fellow Judge, admonished petitioner. Petitioner not only concedes the impropriety of his comments but also admits to having made similar ethnically charged comments to his opponent during an election campaign. He maintains, however, that the District Attorney\u2019s implication that he had not \u201cearned\u201d his position as Judge provoked the attack, which was nothing more than private banter. The Commission rightfully rejected petitioner\u2019s excuse, as such language, whether provoked or in jest, manifested an impermissible bias that threatens public confidence in the judiciary <em>(see, Matter of Esworthy, supra, </em>77 NY2d, at 282; <em>Matter of Agresta, supra, </em>64 NY2d, at 330).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Charge II arises from petitioner\u2019s equally unseemly conduct during jury deliberations in a rape case. Fearing protracted deliberations, petitioner began to engage in intemperate behavior on the Bench. In an outburst of profanity, petitioner declared that he detested Utica \u2014 where the trial was being held \u2014 and wished to return to Syracuse because it was \u201cmen\u2019s night out.\u201d He accused the prosecutor of \u201covercharg[ing]\u201d the case and pressed her to offer a plea to a misdemeanor charge so that he could \u201cget out of this fucking black hole of Utica,\u201d threatening to declare a mistrial if she refused. Although petitioner concedes that he failed to act in a dignified and courteous manner, he denies any attempt to coerce a plea offer. Instead, he maintains that his \u201cbanter\u201d reflected his concern over a possible error at trial. Once again, however, the Referee rejected petitioner\u2019s defensive version, and we uphold that determination. In any event, the \u201charm inured when [petitioner] indicated he would use his judicial powers to satisfy a personal [interest], a classic instance in which \u2018an appearance of such impropriety is no less to be condemned than is the impropriety itself\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Schiff, supra, </em>83 NY2d, at 693, quoting <em>Matter of Spector v State Commn. on Judicial Conduct, </em>47 NY2d 462, 466). As a Judge, petitioner was duty-bound to preserve the decorum of the courtroom <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 100.3 [B] [3]) and avoid abusing his judicial authority to advance private interests <em>(see, </em>22 NYCRR 100.2 [C]). His failure to do so is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Finally, as to charge VII, the evidence demonstrates petitioner\u2019s lack of candor during his testimony as a character witness in a criminal trial. Petitioner testified that he had discussed the defendant with two named attorneys when, in fact, he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\u201c[I]n view of the cumulative, serious judicial misconduct established here,\u201d we conclude that removal is an appropriate sanction <em>(Matter of Schiff, supra, </em>83 NY2d, at 695). Petitioner\u2019s judicial record cannot excuse racial epithets and ethnic slurs in the official and quasi-official context in which they were uttered, attempts to influence dispositions, intemperate behavior and false testimony. Recognizing that Judges \u201c \u2018must be held to a higher standard of conduct than the public at large,\u2019 \u201d we conclude that petitioner\u2019s pattern of misconduct warrants removal (M<em>atter of Assini, supra, </em>94 NY2d, at 31, quoting <em>Matter of Collazo, </em>91 NY2d 251, 255).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Accordingly, the determined sanction of removal should be accepted, without costs, and petitioner should be removed from the office of Judge of the County Court, Onondaga County.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur in Per Curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Determined sanction accepted, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
