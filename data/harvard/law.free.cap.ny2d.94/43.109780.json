Plaintiffs allege valid claims under General Business Law \u00a7 349. <em>(Oxman v Amoroso, </em>172 Misc 2d 773.) II. The trial court correctly determined that plaintiffs\u2019 fraud and General Business Law \u00a7 349 claims are not preempted by the Labeling Act. <em>(Cipollone v Liggett Group, </em>505 US 504; <em>Barnett Bank v Nelson, </em>517 US 25; <em>Laborers Local 17 Health &amp; Benefit Fund v Philip Morris, Inc., </em>7 F Supp 2d 277; <em>Burton v R.J.

The trial court, which is well informed about the factual, legal, procedural and administrative aspects of this litigation, should be given an opportunity to manage these cases as class actions. <em>(Central Wesleyan Coll, v Grace &amp; Co., </em>6 F3d 177; <em>In re School Asbestos Litig., </em>789 F2d 996; <em>In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, </em>333 F Supp 278.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-5\"><em>Shook, Hardy, Bacon, L.

The Court below properly held that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted by the Labeling Act. <em>(Cipollone v Liggett Group, </em>505 US 504; <em>Lacey v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>956 F Supp 956; <em>Allgood v R.J.

III. The fraudulent concealment and deceptive trade practices claims, while preempted by the Labeling Act, were also properly dismissed because, absent any allegation of injury which is distinct from the alleged deception, they are insufficient as a matter of law. <em>(Vermeer Owners v Guterman, </em>78 NY2d 1114; <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number><em>Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, </em>New York City <em>(Roy L.

B.A.T. Industries was deprived of the basic due process right to be heard when the Supreme Court denied its jurisdiction motion without holding a hearing on the issues presented or allowing it to respond to new allegations on which the court relied. <em>(Soto v Correa, </em>20 AD2d 694; <em>Saylor v Bastedo, </em>623 F2d 230; <em>Bank of Am. Natl. Trust Sav. Assn. v Herrick, </em>233 AD2d 351; <em>Benson v Syntex Labs., </em>161 Misc 2d 822; <em>Cato Show Print. Co. v Lee, </em>84 AD2d 947; <em>New Is.

II. Conspiracy jurisdiction violates due process and should not be adopted or ratified by this Court. <em>(International Shoe Co. v Washington, </em>326 US 310; <em>Keeton v Hustler Mag., </em>465 US 770; <em>Rush v Savchuk, </em>444 US 320; <em>Hanson v Denckla, </em>357 US 235; <em>Magic Toyota v Southeast Toyota Distribs., </em>784 F Supp 306; <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel.

Fund v Philip Morris Inc., </em>23 F Supp 2d 796.) III. The Supreme Court erred by finding jurisdiction based on allegations of an intra-corporate conspiracy, a conspiracy that cannot exist as a matter of law. <em>(Heller &amp; Co. v Novacor Chems., </em>726 F Supp 49, 875 F2d 856; <em>Pebble Cove Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v Fidelity N.

IV. The Supreme Court erred by failing to apply conspiracy jurisdiction in accord with New York\u2019s applicable evidentiary standards. <em>(Lamarr v Klein, </em>35 AD2d 248; <em>Lehigh Val.

The Court below properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment claim against Tobacco Institute (TI) because TI has no duty of disclosure to plaintiffs. <em>(Morin v Trupin, </em>711 F Supp 97; <em>Wall St. Transcript Corp. v Ziff Communications Co., </em>225 AD2d 322; <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v Joshi, </em>202 AD2d 318; <em>Beasock v Dioguardi Enters., </em>130 Misc 2d 25; <em>Howard v Poseidon Pools, </em>133 Misc 2d 50, 134 AD2d 926; <em>Heard v City of New York, </em>82 NY2d 66; <em>Gunsalus v Celotex Corp., </em>674 F Supp 1149; <em>East End Owners v Roc-East End Assocs., </em>128 AD2d 366.) II. Plaintiffs\u2019 General Business Law \u00a7 349 claim against TI was properly dismissed because TI neither manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>tures nor sells any product, and because plaintiffs were not injured by any TI statement. <em>(New York Pub.

II. Denial of class certification by the Court below should be vacated. <em>(Super Glue Corp. v Avis Rent A Car Sys., </em>132 AD2d 604; <em>Weinberg v Hertz Corp., </em>116 AD2d 1, 69 NY2d 979.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b124-7\">Wesley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">These consolidated appeals encompass five proposed class action suits. They are brought by plaintiffs alleging that defendants individually and collectively deceived them about the addictive properties of cigarettes and fraudulently induced them to purchase and continue to smoke cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The trial court determined that class certification was a statutorily authorized method to adjudicate the multiplicity of claims. After the court found that plaintiffs pleaded valid causes of action against defendants and that their claims were not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (15 USC \u00a7 1331 <em>et seq.), </em>it denied without prejudice defendant B.A.T. Industries\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The Appellate Division decertified the classes. It also concluded that certain claims were preempted by the Federal Act, and dismissed the remaining causes of action. In granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>leave to appeal, the Appellate Division certified the usual question to us: \u201cWas the order of this Court, which reversed the orders of the Supreme Court, properly made?\u201d We answer yes, and affirm the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Five class actions on behalf of New York consumers were filed against defendant tobacco companies and two other entities, the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute. In each of the suits, plaintiffs sought to represent a class of New York residents who, on or after June 19, 1980,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> became or continued to be nicotine dependent as a result of buying and smoking cigarettes in New York that were manufactured by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Plaintiffs allege that defendants used deceptive commercial practices to sell their cigarettes to New Yorkers and that they would not have bought these cigarettes had they known that nicotine is an addictive drug; that the tobacco companies controlled the level of nicotine in their cigarettes to cause or maintain nicotine addiction; and, that the companies secretly used chemicals to enhance the addictive propensities of nicotine. Plaintiffs also assert that the companies suppressed research indicating that nicotine is addictive. They seek only the reimbursement of the purchase cost of cigarettes that they claim they would not have bought, but for defendants\u2019 fraudulent and deceptive practices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In each case, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers moved to certify the class of addicted smokers alleged in the various complaints. In considering the requirements for class certification pursuant to CPLR 901 (a), the trial court determined that \u201ca claim which turns on proof of actual addiction would involve far too many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>subjective factors\u201d <em>(Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>175 Misc 2d 294, 300). The court concluded that issues regarding addiction are not part of the claims presented because \u201cthe central issue is whether plaintiffs and the class members can recoup the money they spent in a transaction that was purportedly riddled with fraudulent activities\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 301). The court <em>sua sponte </em>eliminated the need to prove an individual\u2019s nicotine \u00e1ddiction; redefined the proposed class definition to include plaintiffs and potential class members who purchased defendants\u2019 cigarettes while the defendants were allegedly engaging in a pattern of fraudulent activities; and,, as redefined, certified the classes. Plaintiffs have accepted the court-modified class definition for purposes of the litigation and their appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In a separate order, the trial court also determined that plaintiffs pleaded fraud with sufficient particularity and that their claims were not preempted by the Federal Labeling Act <em>(Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>176 Misc 2d 413). The court also denied without prejudice defendant B.A.T.\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The Appellate Division reversed both orders on a composite appeal of the entire matter <em>(Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>252 AD2d 1). After analyzing the requirements of CPLR 901 (a), the Court held that class certification was not justified under the statutory criteria. It also determined that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by the Federal statute, insofar as they allege fraudulent concealment and failure to warn of the dangers of nicotine. While it concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 claims alleging affirmative misrepresentation were not preempted by the Federal statute, the Court nonetheless dismissed those claims because they were not pleaded with the required specificity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">As a threshold matter, this Court must determine the breadth of its power to review the Appellate Division order decertifying the classes. Whether a lawsuit qualifies as a class action matter is a determination made upon a review of the statutory criteria as applied to the facts presented; it ordinarily rests within the sound discretion of the trial court (CPLR 901; <em>see also, Brown v State of New York, </em>250 AD2d 314, 320). The Appellate Division, as a branch of Supreme Court, is vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>with the same discretionary power and may exercise that power, even when there has been no abuse of discretion as a matter of law by the nisi prius court <em>(O\u2019Connor v Papertsian, </em>309 NY 465, 471).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The Appellate Division stated in its order granting leave to appeal and in its order of reversal that its ruling was made on the law; in deciding the appeal, however, it also undertook an exercise of its discretion (see, <em>e.g., Brown v City of New York, </em>60 NY2d 893, 894). Our approach to this case is to review whether the Appellate Division abused its discretion as a matter of law (see, <em>Weinberg v Hertz Corp., </em>69 NY2d 979, 981, citing <em>Herrick v Second Cuthouse, </em>64 NY2d 692, 693; <em>Brady v Ottoway Newspapers, </em>63 NY2d 1031, 1032-1033).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">CPLR 901 (a) sets forth the criteria a court must consider in deciding to certify a class action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201c1. the class is so numerous that joinder of all members, whether otherwise required or permitted, is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201c2. there are questions of law or fact common to the class which predominate over any questions affecting only individual members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201c3. the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\"><em>\u201c4. </em>the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201c5. a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">In reviewing the number of potential claims, the Appellate Division agreed with the findings of the trial court that each of the five classes would contain at least one million members (CPLR 901 [a] [1]). It then turned its attention to CPLR 901 (a) (2) and determined that individual issues would predominate throughout the classes. Notwithstanding Supreme Court\u2019s removal of addiction as an element of plaintiffs\u2019 pleaded theory of their cases, the Appellate Division found that individual proof of addiction remains at the core of proving \u201cinjury,\u201d for a claim under General Business Law \u00a7 349. The Appellate Division also noted that the dangers of smoking had been well documented and were generally known to the public. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the Court, this widely available information foreclosed any presumption of reliance and required individualized inquiry into whether each class member was unaware of that information with regard to their causes of action for false advertising under section 350 of the General Business Law and common-law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The Appellate Division also concluded that the proposed class actions would be unmanageable because of the individual issues of damages with respect to each of the five million plaintiffs. Moreover, because the named plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims failed to establish the elements of reliance and causation, the Appellate Division determined that they were inadequate to represent a putative class of all persons who purchased and smoked cigarettes in New York. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not \u201ctypical\u201d of the class (CPLR 901 [a] [3]). We are persuaded that the Appellate Division did not abuse its review and adjudicative powers in these respects, nor did it commit legal error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The Appellate Division next considered whether the named representative parties would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the classes (CPLR 901 [a] [4]). The Court concluded that plaintiffs had limited their claim for damages to the purchase price of cigarettes in order to shape a legally de minimis theory of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">\u201c[Plaintiffs] limit[ed] their claims to losses incurred after 1980, even though defendants have allegedly been defrauding the public since the 1950\u2019s, for no other apparent reason than to make this a \u2018negative value\u2019 suit where each member\u2019s damages are so small that only a class action would be worth the expense of litigation\u201d <em>(Small v Lorillard Tobacco Co., </em>252 AD2d 1, 11, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Moreover, the Appellate Division recognized a tension between the claims selected by the named plaintiffs and those of absent class members. The Court reasoned that the injury (the purchase price of cigarettes that they would not have otherwise purchased) of the redefined classes and the limitation of claims to losses incurred after 1980 could in effect preclude all New York smokers from bringing other possibly substantial claims for personal injury and emotional distress based on nicotine addiction. Because the named plaintiffs limited their theory in these significant ways, the Court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 claims inadequately represented a putative class of all persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>who purchased and smoked cigarettes in New York. The Appellate Division did not abuse its discretion nor did it commit an error of law in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Lastly, the Appellate Division examined the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of the class actions (CPLR 901 [a] [5]). The Court considered how a trial on the merits would be conducted and determined that the proposed class actions would be unmanageable because of the individualized nature of many of the issues. The Court expressed concern over the potential litigation logjam that would render the actions unmanageable.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In sum, within the range of this Court\u2019s review powers, we are satisfied that the Appellate Division properly weighed the relevant statutory factors and correctly fulfilled its intermediate appellate court role and powers. No cogent basis has been presented upon which this Court should disturb that Court\u2019s decertification-of-classes ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Since plaintiffs cannot proceed as class representatives, this Court must next resolve whether they can move forward on the remaining individual causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Section 349 (a) of the General Business Law encompasses deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this State. Section 349 governs consumer-oriented conduct and, on its face, applies to virtually all economic activity <em>(Karlin v IVF Am., </em>93 NY2d 282, 290). Generally, claims under the statute are available to an individual consumer who falls victim to misrepresentations made by a seller of consumer goods through false or misleading advertising <em>(Genesco Entertainment v Koch, </em>593 F Supp 743, 751).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">To state a claim under the statute, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant has engaged \u201cin an act or practice that is deceptive or misleading in a material way and that plaintiff has been injured by reason thereof\u2019 <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, </em>85 NY2d 20, 25, citing <em>Varela v Investors Ins. Holding Corp., </em>81 NY2d 958, 961; Givens, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 19, General Business Law \u00a7 349, at 565). Intent to defraud and justifiable reliance by the plaintiff are not elements of the statutory claim <em>(Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>proof that <em>\u201ca </em>material deceptive act or practice <em>caused actual, although not necessarily pecuniary, harm\u201d </em>is required to impose compensatory damages <em>{id. </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the Appellate Division incorrectly held that they must prove that they were addicted to nicotine in order to allege a cognizable injury and harm, as contemplated and prescribed by the statute. According to plaintiffs, addiction is not the injury; rather, plaintiffs assert that defendants\u2019 deception prevented them from making free and informed choices as consumers. Plaintiffs add that had they known that nicotine was addictive, they never would have purchased cigarettes. They posit that consumers who buy a product that they would not have purchased, absent a manufacturer\u2019s deceptive commercial practices, have suffered an injury under General Business Law \u00a7 349. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 definition of injury is legally flawed. Their theory contains no manifestation of either pecuniary or \u201cactual\u201d harm; plaintiffs do not allege that the cost of cigarettes was affected by the alleged misrepresentation, nor do they seek recovery for injury to their health as a result of their ensuing addiction (General Business Law \u00a7 349 [h]; <em>Oswego Laborers\u2019 Local 214 Pension Fund v Marine Midland Bank, supra, </em>at 26). Indeed, they chose expressly to confine the relief sought solely to monetary recoupment of the purchase price of the cigarettes. Plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action under this statute, as redefined by the trial court and as embraced by them, thus sets forth deception as both act and injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 flawed \u201cdeception as injury\u201d theory, the Appellate Division correctly pinpointed that addiction is inescapably the cornerstone of plaintiffs\u2019 legal claims. Because plaintiffs abandoned the addiction component of the legal theory of their cases, they therefore fail to demonstrate that they were \u201cactually harmed\u201d or suffered pecuniary injury by reason of any alleged deception within the meaning of the statute. They cannot have it both ways. Without addiction as part of the injury claim, there is no connection between the misrepresentation and any harm from, or failure of, the product.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to present a legally cognizable injury also renders their common-law fraudulent concealment claims insufficient on their face. To make out a prima facie case of fraud, the complaint must contain allegations of a representation of material fact, falsity, scienter, reliance and injury <em>(Vermeer Owners v Guterman, 78 </em>NY2d 1114, 1116). The circumstances constituting the fraud must be stated in detail (CPLR 3016 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The flaw in plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claim foretells the inadequacy of the common-law claims: an act of deception, entirely independent or separate from any injury, is not sufficient to state a cause of action under a theory of fraudulent concealment. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 common-law fraud claims also fail. As a result, there is no independent tort to provide a basis for liability under their concert of action, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting theories. These causes of action must fail as well <em>(Rastelli v Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>79 NY2d 289, 295-297 [concert of action]; <em>Alexander &amp; Alexander v Fritzen, </em>68 NY2d 968, 969 [conspiracy]; Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 876, comment <em>d </em>[aiding and abetting]).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We do not reach the remaining arguments in this case, as they are unnecessary to the full disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Ciparick, Bracken, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cardona<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Lawton<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concur; Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Levine and Rosenblatt taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Order affirmed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\">. B.A.T. is a British-based company with a subsidiary, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation, operating in the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">. Plaintiffs acknowledge that this date corresponds to the date that General Business Law \u00a7 349 \u2014 New York\u2019s consumer fraud statute \u2014 was amended to give individuals who are injured by reason of any violation of this section a private right of action to enjoin the unlawful act or practice and/or an action to recover damages or $50, whichever is greater (General Business Law \u00a7 349 M).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 original five causes of action were: (1) fraud/fraudulent concealment; (2) violations of General Business Law \u00a7 349; (3) violations of General Business Law \u00a7 350; (4) civil conspiracy; and (5) concert of action/ aiding and abetting. Plaintiffs are not appealing the dismissal of their claims brought under General Business Law \u00a7 350, for affirmative fraudulent misrepresentations and for injunctive relief. They therefore appeal only their claims of common-law fraudulent concealment, General Business Law \u00a7 349, civil conspiracy, and concert of action/aiding and abetting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. The Appellate Division also dismissed the complaint against B.A.T. based on the insufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Since we are affirming, there is no need to address or resolve B.A.T.\u2019s jurisdictional issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. The Attorney General, who appears as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of appellants\u2019 position, likens this case to a situation where a distributor asserts that its bottled water is from a pure and pristine mountain stream while in reality, it was only tap water. The Attorney General may be right that a plaintiff might have a claim for the higher price the consumer paid for the product as a result of the misrepresentation in that circumstance. That is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>not this case. Plaintiffs do not contend that the deception here caused an inflated price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b131-12\">.
