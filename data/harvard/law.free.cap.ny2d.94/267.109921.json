In nuisance abatement cases involving constitutionally protected establishments, the City standard of proof should be clear and convincing evidence. <em>(California ex rel.

Padlocking a constitutionally protected establishment for one year and permanently enjoining all of its expression is not the least restrictive means, or the most appropriate means, for dealing with the alleged problems. <em>(People ex rel.

An establishment, which recasts its business to conform with a zoning resolution and complies with the text of the ordinance, cannot be padlocked because a court decides that \u201cin its true aspect [it] remains a nonconforming adult video establishment.\u201d <em>(Young v American Mini Theatres, </em>427 US 50; <em>Matter of Raritan Dev.

Y. v City of New York </em>(91 NY2d 382), we held that New York City\u2019s amended zoning resolution regulating adult establishments did not violate their constitutional rights of free expression. This case arises out of New York City\u2019s enforcement of that zoning resolution. The issue is whether the courts below employed the proper definition of \u201cstock\u201d as used in the City\u2019s administrative guidelines interpreting the zoning resolution. We conclude that the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of \u201cstock\u201d included considerations beyond what the City\u2019s guidelines provide and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The City commenced this action against Les Hommes, a Manhattan book and video store catering to the gay male community, and its owner to abate an alleged nuisance based on a violation of its zoning resolution <em>(see, </em>Administrative Code of City of NY \u00a7 7-703 [k]; \u00a7 7-714). Under that resolution, in order to qualify as an \u201cadult establishment\u201d a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the business must include, as relevant here, an \u201cadult book store * * * adult theater, or other adult commercial establishment or any combination thereof\u2019 (Amended Zoning Resolution of City of NY \u00a7 12-10 [Definition of \u201cAdult Establishment\u201d]). To qualify as an \u201cadult book store,\u201d a business must have a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of its \u201cstock-in-trade\u201d in, among other things, printed matter or video representations depicting \u201cspecified sexual activities\u201d or \u201cspecified anatomical areas\u201d as those are defined in the resolution <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The City\u2019s zoning resolution further directs that in determining whether a book store has reached the \u201csubstantial portion\u201d threshold, the following factors \u201cshall be considered\u201d: \u201c(1) the amount of such [adult] stock accessible to customers as compared to the total stock accessible to customers in the establishment; and (2) the amount of <em>floor area </em>and <em>cellar </em>space accessible to customers containing such stock; and (3) the amount of <em>floor area </em>and <em>cellar </em>space accessible to customers containing such stock as compared to the total <em>floor area </em>and <em>cellar </em>space accessible to customers in the establishment\u201d <em>(id. </em>[italics in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>In response to an inquiry as to what constitutes a \u201csubstantial portion,\u201d the City Department of Buildings issued Operations Policy and Procedure Notice (OPPN) No. 4/98, and several weeks later superseded it with OPPN No. 6/98. Both imposed similar guidelines \u201cto clarify the meaning of the phrase \u2018substantial portion\u2019 \u201d (Dept of Buildings, Operations Policy and Procedure Notice No. 6/98, Aug. 13, 1998). With respect to \u201cadult establishments\u201d generally, if \u201cat least 40 percent of the floor and cellar area that is accessible to customers [is] available for adult\u201d use, then a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the business is devoted to adult use within the zoning resolution. In any event, if \u201c10,000 or more square feet of a commercial establishment * * * is occupied by an adult use, the commercial establishment is deemed to be an \u2018adult establishment\u2019 regardless of the overall size of the establishment\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">With regard to book stores particularly, \u201c [i] f at least 40 percent of the book store\u2019s total stock accessible or available (\u2018accessible\u2019) for sale or rent to customers is comprised of adult materials, then the book store has a \u2018substantial portion\u2019 of its stock in adult materials\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Furthermore, \u201c[a]n establishment also includes an adult book store if 40 percent of the establishment\u2019s floor area and cellar space accessible to customers contains stock in adult materials\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The City\u2019s zoning resolution became enforceable on July 28, 1998, when the United States Supreme Court denied an application for a stay in a related case, ending a series of stays that had been in effect to that date <em>(see, Amsterdam Video v City of New York, </em>146 F3d 99 [2d Cir], <em>request for stay denied </em>524 US 966, <em>cert denied </em>525 US 1067). Shortly thereafter, the City brought this action by order to show cause and sought a preliminary injunction, enjoining Les Hommes from using the premises as an \u201cadult establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u2022 After several days of hearings involving attempts by Les Hommes to comply with the zoning resolution, Supreme Court refused to grant a preliminary injunction. The court determined that with regard to its front room, Les Hommes had increased its stock of nonadult videos to comply with the 60:40 formula. With regard to the back room, which comprised rows of video booths with closing doors as well as two mini-theater areas with movie screens and viewing areas, the court determined that the City had met its burden of establishing that the video booths were showing adult videos, but that the exhibition of nonadult videos in the mini-theaters \u201cha[d] been confirmed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>city inspectors\u201d <em>(City of New York v Les Hommes, </em>order on motion for preliminary injunction, slip opn, at 22, index No. 402704/98 [with two related actions Nos. 402702/98, 402703/ 98] [Aug. 28, 1998]). Although the court was concerned the movies shown in the mini-theaters \u201ccould change overnight,\u201d the \u201cpotential of recidivism alone\u201d did not mean that the City had met its burden of proving the need for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The case then proceeded to trial on the issue of a permanent injunction. After several additional days of testimony, the court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the amount of stock dedicated to adult use remained the same. It determined that only 24% of Les Hommes\u2019s stock consisted of adult videos. However, several considerations, in the court\u2019s view, compelled the conclusion that Les Hommes was an \u201cadult establishment.\u201d Regarding the videos, it was significant to the court that the nonadult videos were offered only for sale, not for rent. That fact along with the \u201cterribly stable volume of non-adult videos\u201d that had \u201cbeen supplemented only modestly\u201d in several months, meant that compliance with the City\u2019s guidelines had only been \u201cfacial\u201d and was done \u201cto make a formalistic compliance with the 60/40 ratio.\u201d In essence, the court considered compliance to be a \u201csham,\u201d which meant that the nonadult videos could not be considered \u201cstock.\u201d As a result, the court permanently enjoined defendants from operating the premises for the purposes of conducting an adult use, with the proviso that defendants could apply to modify the judgment upon certain specified conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed, agreeing with Supreme Court that the sale by Les Hommes of the nonadult videos was a sham and that Les Hommes \u201cin its true aspect remains a non-conforming adult video establishment.\u201d (258 AD2d 284, 285.) The Court stated that because the presence of the non-adult videos did not affect the \u201cessential nature\u201d of Les Hommes as an adult video store, the entire front room was dedicated to adult stock and concluded that Les Hommes was an \u201cadult establishment.\u201d This Court granted defendants leave to appeal, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We agree with defendants that the definition of \u201cstock\u201d as used in the City\u2019s administrative guidelines does not include inquiry into whether a video is offered solely for sale or whether the inventory of such videos is stable, constantly supplemented or profitable. The City\u2019s own guidelines interpret the zoning resolution literally. Nowhere in the operative OPPN No. 6/98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>are factors other than amount of stock and floor space mentioned. Instead, the focus is solely on the appropriate percentages of stock and floor and cellar space, and the City drew these at 40%. As a result, the City\u2019s guidelines provide no support for the view that profitability or stability of the non-adult stock need be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The cases guiding our analysis in this area require that we show a healthy respect for the plain language employed and that it be construed in favor of the property owner and against the municipality which adopted and seeks to enforce it <em>(see, Matter of Raritan Dev. Corp. v Silva, </em>91 NY2d 98, 103; <em>Matter of Allen v Adami, </em>39 NY2d 275, 277; <em>Thomson Indus. v Incorporated Vil. of Port Washington N., </em>27 NY2d 537, 539; <em>440 E. 102nd St. Corp. v Murdock, </em>285 NY 298, 304). Given the City\u2019s precise guidelines, we cannot cast a wider net to capture unspecified considerations such as whether nonadult stock is stable or unprofitable. The lower courts improperly injected these considerations into the mix, even though the City\u2019s guidelines admit no such impediments to compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">There may indeed be situations where what a store is selling or renting cannot be considered stock under the City\u2019s guidelines. To the extent that the lower courts recognized this limitation, we would agree with them. Nonetheless, nothing in this record indicates that the nonadult videos sold by Les Hommes were not \u201cstock.\u201d The testimony was clear that the nonadult videos were prominently displayed on racks in the front of the store. Also, there can be little question that these videos were accessible and available. No evidence indicated that these videos could not be purchased upon demand. Indeed, 52 of these videos had been bought over several months. Reliance on a sale versus rental distinction was error. The administrative guidelines treat sales and rentals in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In the end, we must enforce the City\u2019s administrative guidelines as written. Either the stock is accessible or available, or it is not; either the appropriate amount of square footage is dedicated to nonadult uses, or it is not. Questions about whether the owner of Les Hommes had a good-faith desire to sell nonadult products, whether the \u201cessential nature\u201d of Les Hommes is adult or nonadult, or whether the volume of non-adult stock is stable or profitable are not part of the inquiry here, where we are only called upon to determine whether items are accessible or available as stock. We cannot rewrite the City\u2019s guidelines to include these additional considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>We need not and do not address appellant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
