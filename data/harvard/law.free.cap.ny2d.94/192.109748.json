There exists no State legislative authority for the County\u2019s charge of a mandatory contribution toward homeless shelter costs. It is, therefore, invalid as an impermissible exercise of agency power. <em>(Matter of Mondello v D\u2019Elia, </em>39 NY2d 978; <em>Matter of Garvey v Kirby, </em>94 AD2d 702; <em>Matter of Rosenfeld v Blum, </em>82 AD2d 559; <em>Matter of Leone v Blum, </em>73 AD2d 252; <em>Matter of Termini v Hackett, </em>80 AD2d 730; <em>Lovelace v Gross, </em>80 NY2d 419; <em>Matter of Heimbach v Metropolitan Transp.

The County\u2019s rule requiring monthly contributions that reduce disabled homeless persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to the same monthly income level as the non-disabled, violates Social Services Law \u00a7 209 providing a higher standard of need for the disabled. <em>(Matter of Lee v Smith, </em>43 NY2d 453; <em>Rice v Perales, </em>193 AD2d 1135; <em>Lovelace v Gross, </em>80 NY2d 419; <em>Tucker v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 1; <em>Rinaldi v Yeager, </em>384 US 305.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\"><em>Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General, </em>New York City <em>(Mark Gimpel, Preeta D.

Pursuant to Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a and 18 NYCRR part 352, which specify the standard of need for all public assistance recipients, appellant was properly required to contribute $427 of his Federal income toward the $1,800 per month costs of his temporary housing. <em>(Matter of Lee v Smith, </em>43 NY2d 453; <em>Matter of Rosenfeld v Blum, </em>82 AD2d 559; <em>Glasgold v Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>558 F Supp 129; <em>Matter of Garvey v Kirby, </em>94 AD2d 702; <em>Matter of Leone v Blum, </em>73 AD2d 252.) II.

This appeal is moot and should be dismissed. <em>(Matter of Anonymous [Boggs] v New York City Health &amp; Hosps.

The Social Services Law authorizes respondents to grant emergency housing assistance as a part of safety net assistance and requires that appellant use his available resources to reduce or eliminate his need for such assistance. <em>(Lovelace v Gross, </em>80 NY2d 419; <em>Fuller v Nassau County Dept. of Social Servs., </em>77 Misc 2d 677; <em>Matter of Crawford v Perales, </em>205 AD2d 307, 84 NY2d 987; <em>Matter of Green v Blum, </em>84 AD2d 840; <em>Glasgold v Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>558 F Supp 129; <em>Matter of Garvey v Kirby, </em>94 AD2d 702; <em>Matter of Rosenfeld v Blum, </em>82 AD2d 559; <em>Matter of Leone v Blum, </em>73 AD2d 252; <em>Matter of Termini v Hackett, </em>80 AD2d 730; <em>Matter of Wasservogel v Blum, </em>54 NY2d 100; <em>Matter of Dumbleton v Reed, </em>40 NY2d 586.) III. Rules for determining eligibility for emergency housing assistance do not violate section 209 of the Social Services Law with respect to aid for the aged, blind or disabled. <em>(Tucker v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 1; <em>Matter of Bernstein v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 437; <em>Dandridge v Williams, </em>397 US 471.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b269-5\">Levine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Respondent Commissioner of the Westchester County Department of Social Services (DSS) contracted with a private non-profit agency to provide shelter for petitioner Elias Rodriguez, a homeless person who is permanently disabled by mental illness. As a condition of continued receipt of that housing assistance, DSS required petitioner to use a portion of his Federal disability benefits to contribute to the cost of the shelter. DSS allowed petitioner to retain, out of his Federal benefits, a sum equal to the statutory standard of monthly need apart from shelter to which petitioner was found to be entitled under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a (2). The issue in this case is whether DSS could legally require petitioner to assign all but the retained portion of Federal benefits as a condition for the continued provision of housing assistance by way of direct payments to the residence on petitioner\u2019s behalf. We agree with Supreme Court and the Appellate Division that it can.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Petitioner began receiving the temporary shelter assistance in 1986. DSS paid Westhab, Inc., which operated the New Windham Residence in Yonkers, $1,800 per month to house petitioner. While residing at New Windham, petitioner began receiving $564 per month in Supplemental Security Income (SSI; see, 42 USC \u00a7 1382) and Social Security Disability (SSD; see, 42 USC \u00a7 423) from the Federal Government. He also received food stamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">DSS determined that petitioner\u2019s standard of monthly need was $1,937, $112 under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a (2) (a), plus $1,800 for shelter and $25 for energy costs under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a (2) (b). Since the $1,800 cost of petitioner\u2019s shelter plus the $564 he was receiving in Federal disability benefits exceeded petitioner\u2019s standard of monthly need by $427, DSS required petitioner to sign a \u201cVoluntary Assignment of Income\u201d agreement under which he would pay DSS $427 per month as long as he continued to receive \u201ctemporary emergency housing assistance.\u201d Petitioner agreed that he might forfeit his entitlement to temporary housing for any month he failed to make the contribution. He subsequently requested a fair hearing from respondent State DSS Commissioner, and an Administrative Law Judge rendered a decision upholding the actions of the County DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">In March 1997, petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul the fair hearing decision. Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>confirmed the decision and dismissed the petition. The Appellate Division affirmed (255 AD2d 589). We granted leave to appeal and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">As a threshold matter, DSS argues that this appeal is moot because petitioner is no longer receiving temporary housing assistance, never gave DSS any of his Federal benefits and has no property from which DSS could recover the value of the assistance rendered (see, Social Services Law \u00a7 104). Even if there is no live case or controversy before us, however, the appeal should be retained. The issue presented here will recur whenever DSS requires future recipients of housing assistance to sign the \u201cVoluntary Assignment of Income\u201d form. Moreover, it will typically evade review because of the relatively short time period in which a person would normally be expected to receive temporary emergency shelter (see, Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v [3]). Finally, the issue is both novel and substantial; it has significance for the administration of temporary housing assistance for disabled homeless persons receiving SSI or SSD. Thus, the exception to the mootness doctrine is applicable (see, <em>Matter of Hearst Corp. v Clyne, </em>50 NY2d 707, 714-715). We turn then to the substantive question presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The parties are in agreement that DSS paid the $1,800 per month under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v. The State and County DSS determined that the payments were a form of \u201csafety net assistance\u201d and could be offset by petitioner\u2019s available resources under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a (1). Petitioner\u2019s opposing position is premised on the contention that Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v creates or describes a separate and independent source of entitlement to \u201ctemporary emergency shelter\u201d that is not part of the safety net assistance program. We disagree with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Safety net assistance, which was called \u201chome relief\u2019 when petitioner first began residing at New Windham (see, L 1997, ch 436, pt B, \u00a7 141), is a type of \u201cpublic assistance\u201d (see, Social Services Law \u00a72 [19] [safety net assistance]; Social Services Law \u00a7 2 [former 18] [home relief]). Public assistance is required to be awarded \u201cless any [of the recipient\u2019s] available income or resources\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a [1]). Under regulations promulgated under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a, a homeless individual receiving temporary housing assistance must \u201capply for and use any benefits and resources that will reduce or eliminate the need for temporary housing assistance\u201d (18 NYCRR 352.35 [f]). In addition, DSS \u201cmust deny or discontinue a person\u2019s * * * temporary housing assistance if it determines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that the person * * * is required to, but is not applying income and/or using available resources to reduce or eliminate the need for temporary housing assistance\u201d (18 NYCRR 352.35 fel).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We agree with the courts below that petitioner\u2019s temporary housing was safety net assistance and that the offset conformed with 18 NYCRR 352.35 (f)-(g). Payments under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v are not a separate entitlement outside the definition of public assistance. Therefore, there is no basis for excluding them from the section 131-a (1) offset. Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v is located in Social Services Law article 5, New York\u2019s statutory scheme for providing public assistance. Consequently, section 131-v is subject to the \u201cgeneral provisions\u201d contained in title 1 of article 5, including Social Services Law \u00a7 131-a (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Moreover, payments under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v are simply one form of safety net assistance. The safety net assistance program provides non-cash assistance in the form of direct payments to a shelter operator <em>(see, </em>Social Services Law \u00a7 159). In 1991, the Legislature added Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v (L 1991, ch 695), which provides that \u201ca social services official may contract with a non-profit corporation or charitable organization to provide temporary emergency shelter\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v [1]) if \u201cno other suitable privately owned housing * * * is available, <em>other than a more expensive hotel or </em>motel\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v [2] [emphasis supplied]). Thus, Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v merely authorizes DSS payments to non-profit organizations which are able to provide cheaper housing than commercial boardinghouses. It does not create any new program to help the State\u2019s homeless population.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The legislative history of Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v further supports this interpretation of that provision. The Sponsor\u2019s Memorandum explained that emergency shelter to the homeless was already being provided under the home relief program at that time and that section 131-v was needed merely to \u201cauthorize local social services districts to place homeless households in accommodations provided by not-for-profit organizations at a cheaper cost than commercial hotels or motels\u201d (Sponsor\u2019s Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1991, ch 695, at 16, reprinted in 1991 NY Legis Ann, at 394). The Memorandum proceeded to give an example of the expected savings that would result from Westchester County\u2019s making payments under the home relief program to non-profit corporations instead of welfare hotels <em>(id., </em>at 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Thus, the Legislature considered payments under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v to be home relief, or safety net assistance as it is called in the present statutory nomenclature, and petitioner\u2019s argument that payments for shelter under Social Services Law \u00a7 131-v are not \u201cpublic assistance\u201d is without merit. Furthermore, the application of this offset to petitioner, a recipient of safety net assistance for 10 years, does not violate NY Constitution, article XVII, \u00a7 1, because under the requirements which DSS imposed, petitioner\u2019s aggregate benefits would not even have dropped below his monthly standard of need <em>(see, Matter of Bernstein v Toia, </em>43 NY2d 437, 449). Here, petitioner\u2019s Federal disability benefits were available to petitioner to pay for his shelter, and the portion of those resources exceeding the remaining components of his standard of need was properly applied to the $1,800 per month cost of shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Alternatively, petitioner argues that what he received could not be safety net assistance because Social Services Law \u00a7 157 (1) denies eligibility for safety net assistance to recipients of Federal SSI benefits. In <em>Matter of Lee v Smith </em>(43 NY2d 453), however, we held that the denial of home relief (the predecessor of safety net assistance) to recipients of SSI was unconstitutional <em>(id., </em>at 463). Consistent with that case\u2019s holding, the Department of Social Services regulations now provide that \u201c[sjafety net assistance must not be denied or discontinued solely on the basis that the applicant/recipient is in receipt of SSI\u201d (18 NYCRR 370.7). Thus, there is no valid statutory bar from treating petitioner\u2019s shelter benefits as public assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Petitioner makes the additional argument that DSS denied him \u201cadditional state payments\u201d as a disabled person under Social Services Law \u00a7 209. Even if we were to assume that petitioner was \u201celigible to receive additional state payments\u201d by reason of his disability under Social Services Law \u00a7 209 (1), he would only be \u201centitled to receive monthly an additional state payment in an amount equal to the difference between the monthly standard of need applicable [under section 209] * * * and the sum of [petitioner\u2019s] * * * supplemental security income benefit plus countable income\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 209 [4]). Countable income includes \u201ca person\u2019s income, in cash <em>or in kind, </em>both earned and unearned, which is not excluded by federal law or regulations or by regulations of the department [of Social Services] in determining the need of an individual for supplemental security income benefits or additional state payments\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 208 [6] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>[emphasis supplied]). Here, the sum of petitioner\u2019s SSI benefits and countable income, $1,937, exceeds his standard of need under Social Services Law \u00a7 209 (2). Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to any additional payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
