After the court denied the challenge for cause, defendants exercised a peremptory challenge against him. They exhausted all of their peremptory challenges before the jury was sworn, and were ultimately convicted of six counts of robbery in the first degree and two counts of attempted robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The Appellate Division reversed defendants\u2019 convictions and ordered a new trial, holding that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defendants\u2019 challenge for cause where the prospective juror expressed \u201ca heavy bias in favor of police testimony over layperson testimony\u201d <em>(People v Johnson, </em>255 AD2d 136). The court explained that the case \u201claw is clear that a prospective juror who expresses partiality towards the prosecution and cannot unequivocally promise to set aside this bias should be removed for cause. * * * The juror\u2019s responses fell short of this standard\u201d <em>(People v Sharper, </em>255 AD2d 139, 140-141). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">\n<em>People v Reyes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Defendant Rogelio Reyes was indicted for selling heroin.

I have different opinions about drugs, but heroin I think is one of the most dangerous drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201cAs you\u2019ve heard, my client was arrested for selling drugs, and as we have discussed, drugs are sold in every neighborhood now and affects our lives detrimentally. It\u2019s difficult living in a neighborhood where you walk outside and people sell drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">\u201cWe have children and it\u2019s disturbing they are sold so openly.

Can you honestly be fair and impartial in this case and base your decision only on the evidence you hear in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">Prospective Juror 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-18\">\u201cI can only try to do that. I\u2019ve listened to the evidence. There are a lot of emotional things involved. That may color my views about someone selling heroin or drugs for that matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-19\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-20\">\u201cYou think it\u2019s possible \u2014 understandably your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>emotional feelings would affect your ability to be impartial?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Prospective Juror 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201cIt\u2019s difficult. I wonder with a ten year old son how many years do I have left before I have to let him out on his own. I don\u2019t care how many envelopes they have selling drugs, ten or three thousand dollars worth. They are selling illegal drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">\u201cThis is really the time to express your opinion. It\u2019s important. My client is on trial for drugs and he has said, T didn\u2019t sell them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-9\">\u201cAny preconceived notions, or if you feel \u2014 now is the time to say it. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable here we can approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">\u201c[Prospective Juror 13], you said it would be difficult. I appreciate that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Later, the questioning turned to defendant\u2019s prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-13\">\u201c[Prospective Juror 2], do you think because my client has been convicted in the past of the crimes I discussed that he automatically is guilty of selling drugs?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Prospective Juror 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-15\">\u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-17\">\u201c[Prospective Juror 13], how do you feel about it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqT\">Prospective Juror 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-18\">\u201cDefinitely makes me wonder about his character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABn\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-19\">\u201cDo you think he\u2019s automatically guilty?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">Prospective Juror 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-21\">\u201cNot automatically.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-22\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-23\">\u201cWould it be difficult to be open-minded?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Prospective Juror 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">\u201cAgain, I would have to say [it] might be difficult.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFC\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\u201cI appreciate your honesty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201c[Prospective Juror 14?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Prospective Juror 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201cI don\u2019t think automatically it makes him guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">Defense Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">\u201cWould it be fair, do you think it\u2019s difficult to be fair and objective?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Prospective Juror 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-12\">\u201cMaybe slightly, to be honest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">There were no further questions of Prospective Jurors 13 or 14. Defense counsel challenged Prospective Juror 13, urging:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-14\">\u201cI have number 13 for cause * * *. She had very strong opinions about, first of all, the fact my client was charged with drugs and whether or not she could be fair, and I believe she said she would find it very difficult in light of the fact she has I believe an eight year old child who plays in the park, and they sell drugs there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-15\">\u201cAlso, she had [a] strong opinion about the fact that my client has a criminal conviction. She said I believe it would be very difficult for her to be fair and objective and consider this evidence, without forming an opinion based on the fact my client has prior convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-16\">\u201cThat would make it very difficult for her to be fair and objective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">The Trial Judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-18\">\u201cChallenge for cause as to [Prospective Juror 13] will be denied. In fact, I do believe while she was clearly candid talking about the difficulty she would face, she on balance indicated she could be fair in this case, that she would be open-minded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-19\">\u201cShe acknowledged the information, the fact the past conviction would have in evaluating the testimony, but she indicated she could be fair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Defense counsel next challenged Prospective Juror 14 for cause, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cNumber 14 * * * [a] Iso indicated that because my client has a criminal conviction in his past, it would be difficult for her to be fair and not strongly consider it in deciding whether or not he was innocent or guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The Trial Judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201cCause is denied as to [Prospective Juror 14]. She clearly indicated two times, I believe, she could be fair. Was candid in indicating it would be somewhat difficult, but she said she could be fair in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Defendant exercised peremptory challenges against both prospective jurors. He exhausted all his peremptories before completion of jury selection and was ultimately convicted. On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that the Trial Judge \u201cproperly exercised * * * discretion in denying defendant\u2019s challenges for cause\u201d and that the over-all responses of each venireperson \u201cnegated any substantial risk of bias\u201d (255 AD2d 228, 228-229). We now reverse and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Fundamental to our constitutional heritage is \u00e1n accused\u2019s right to trial by an impartial jury (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 <em>2; </em>US Const 6th, 14th Amends; <em>see also, Duncan v Louisiana, </em>391 US 145, 151-154). Indeed, nothing</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">\u201cis more basic to the criminal process than the right of an accused to a trial by an impartial jury. The presumption of innocence, the prosecutor\u2019s heavy burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other protections afforded the accused at trial, are of little value unless those who are called to decide the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence are free of bias\u201d <em>(People v Branch, </em>46 NY2d 645, 652).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">To safeguard the cherished right to an impartial jury, the former Code of Criminal Procedure authorized a challenge for cause where a prospective juror had a state of mind \u201cin reference to the case, or to either party,\u201d which satisfied the court \u201cin the exercise of a sound discretion that such juror [could not] try the issue impartially and without prejudice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>substantial rights of the party challenging\u201d (former Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 376 [2]). Such predisposition or bias, however, was not automatically a ground for exclusion where prospective jurors swore that they did not believe their opinion or impression would influence their verdict, and that they could render an impartial verdict according to the evidence. As this Court explained in <em>People v Culhane </em>(33 NY2d 90, 107), even rote recitation of an \u201cexpurgatory oath\u201d did not end the Trial Judge\u2019s responsibility to assure an impartial jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201c Tt is not enough to be able to point to detached language which, alone considered, would seem to meet the statute requirement, if, on construing the whole declaration together, it is apparent that the juror is not able to express an absolute belief that his opinion will not influence his verdict * * * The defendant [is] at least entitled to a certain and unequivocal declaration of their belief that they could decide the case uninfluenced by their previous opinions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In 1970, as part of the new Criminal Procedure Law, the Legislature adopted CPL 270.20, which consolidated, \u201cwithout substantial change,\u201d a number of provisions from the Criminal Code relating to challenges for cause, including section 376 (Commn Staff Notes, reprinted in NY Cons Law Serv, Book 7D, CPL 270.20, at 176; <em>see also, People v Culhane, supra, </em>33 NY2d, at 104, n 2, citing Denzer, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11A, CPL 270.20 [\u201cFor the most part (section 270.20) restates the prior law\u201d]). In simpler language than its predecessor, CPL 270.20 authorizes parties to seek dismissal of a prospective juror based on \u201cactual bias\u201d whenever \u201cHe has a state of mind that is likely to preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence\u201d (CPL 270.20 [1] [b]; Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 270.20, at 425). Most significantly for present purposes, the Legislature eliminated the \u201ctalismanic expurgatory oath\u201d requirement, giving Trial Judges both \u201cgreater flexibility and a greater responsibility\u201d in determining which venirepersons should be excused for cause <em>(People v Culhane, supra, </em>33 NY2d, at 104, n 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Three Court of Appeals decisions define the contours of the statute. In our first major application of CPL 270.20 (1) <em>(b) </em>\u2014 People <em>v Blyden </em>(55 NY2d 73) \u2014 involving an African-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>American defendant, a prospective juror who was a construction worker told the Trial Judge that because of Federal affirmative action programs he was \u201cagainst minorities,\u201d and did not know whether his feelings would affect his deliberations. In response to the court\u2019s thrice repeated question whether he could put aside his feelings, he said, \u2018Yes, I think I could,\u201d and \u201cI think I could.\u201d Asked if he had already made up his mind about the case, he answered \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">This Court nonetheless reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">\u201cWhen a question is raised regarding a prospective juror\u2019s ability to render an impartial verdict, it is still necessary that the prospective juror in unequivocal terms \u2018must expressly state that his prior state of mind concerning either the case or either of the parties will not influence his verdict, and he must also state that he will render an impartial verdict based solely on the evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201c[I]t is essential that all elements of the required statements be voiced, and that they be voiced with conviction. The mere words themselves, however, have no talismanic power to convert a biased juror into an impartial one, although they do nonetheless provide a minimum level of protection.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at 77-78, quoting <em>People v Biondo, </em>41 NY2d 483, 485 [applying former Code Crim Pro \u00a7 376], <em>cert denied </em>434 US 928.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Because question was raised as to the prospective juror\u2019s ability to be impartial, and he gave no unequivocal assurance that he could render an impartial verdict, we concluded that it was error not to excuse him.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Some two years later, in <em>People v Williams </em>(63 NY2d 882, 883-884), a burglary prosecution, two prospective jurors stated that \u201calthough they did not associate with blacks they <em>could </em>render a fair and impartial verdict,\u201d (emphasis added) and although \u201cthey did not approve of interracial marriages * * * they did not feel that the circumstance that defendant [an African-American] had had a white girlfriend * * * would interfere with their verdict\u201d or affect their ability to sit on the jury. Unlike in <em>Blyden, </em>the prospective jurors in <em>Williams </em>themselves never expressed doubt that they could serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>impartially. Both because the Trial Judge concluded that their statements did not constitute \u201cactual bias\u201d and because the prospective jurors asserted unequivocally that they could listen \u201cfairly and impartially and that their feelings would not affect their ability to sit on the jury,\u201d we concluded that it was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant\u2019s challenge for cause. We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201cmost if not all jurors bring some predispositions, of varying intensity, when they enter the jury box. It is only when it is shown that there is a substantial risk that such predispositions will affect the ability of the particular juror to discharge his responsibilities (a determination committed largely to judgment of the Trial Judge with his peculiar opportunities to make a fair evaluation) that his excuse is warranted. Were the rule otherwise, it would be difficult not to require the discharge * * * of every potential juror who disclosed anything but total absence of prejudice * * *, <em>notwithstanding his stated readiness to lay his feelings aside in the discharge of his duties as a juror\u201d (id., </em>at 885 [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Finally, in <em>People v Torpey </em>(63 NY2d 361, <em>rearg denied </em>64 NY2d 885), decided one month after <em>Williams, </em>we once again concluded that in cases of \u201cactual bias\u201d \u2014 that is, where a pro- - spective juror has a \u201cstate of mind that is likely to preclude him from rendering an impartial verdict\u201d \u2014 an unambiguous assurance of impartiality is required before a challenge for cause may be denied. We noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201cwhere there is a prima facie showing of actual bias, the Trial Judge should require the prospective juror to \u2018expressly state that his prior state of mind * * * will * * * not influence his verdict, and * * * that he will render an impartial verdict based solely on the evidence\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at 367, quoting <em>People v Biondo, supra, </em>41 NY2d, at 485).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">In <em>Torpey, </em>a prospective juror who had read that the defendant was a Mafia \u201chit man,\u201d indicated she \u201cprobably\u201d had a negative impression of him and that it \u201cprobably\u201d would not be fair to have someone with her frame of mind seated on the jury. Asked whether she was willing to put aside her impression and \u201cgive both sides a fair trial based on the evidence in this courtroom and nothing else,\u201d she responded, \u201cI think I can\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 365). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Concluding that this statement fell short of the required <em>unequivocal </em>statement of impartiality, we reversed defendant\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Torpey </em>made clear that the principles underlying <em>Blyden </em>and <em>Culhane </em>apply \u201cregardless of the cause of the prospective juror\u2019s actual bias\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 366). Indeed, where a juror\u2019s predisposition related not to the particular facts of the case but to a party \u2014 as in <em>Torpey </em>\u2014 \u201cthe evidence at trial might not address the basis of the juror\u2019s impression and thus may not alter this impression\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 368). Mindful of that risk, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201cthe test for whether such bias has been overcome by declarations is even stricter than where the juror has expressed an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. * * * [T]he prospective juror should be dismissed if there appears to be <em>any possibility </em>that his impressions * * * might influence his verdict\u201d <em>{id. </em>[emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Thus, from the statute and case law, the guiding principles are perfectly plain: when potential jurors reveal knowledge or opinions reflecting a state of mind likely to preclude impartial service, they must in some form give unequivocal assurance that they can set aside any bias and render an impartial verdict based on the evidence. Obviously, when potential jurors themselves openly state that they doubt their own ability to be impartial in the case at hand, there is far more than a <em>likelihood </em>of bias, and an unequivocal assurance of impartiality must be elicited if they are to serve. As the First Department put it in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Sharper, </em>the law \u201cis clear that a prospective juror who expresses partiality towards [one side] and cannot unequivocally promise to set aside this bias should be removed for cause\u201d (255 AD2d, at 140-141, <em>supra). </em>That bright-line standard is followed throughout the State <em>(see, e.g., People v Butler, </em>258 AD2d 368, 369 [1st Dept 1999]; <em>People v Taylor, </em>120 AD2d 325, 326 [1st Dept 1986]; <em>People v Zachary, </em>260 AD2d 514 [2d Dept 1999]; <em>People v Maddox, </em>175 AD2d 183 [2d Dept 1991]; <em>People v Burdo, </em>256 AD2d 737, 740-742 [3d Dept 1998]; <em>People v Butler, </em>221 AD2d 918 [4th Dept 1995], <em>Iv denied </em>87 NY2d 971; <em>People v Williams, </em>210 AD2d 914, 915 [4th Dept 1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Applying the law to the facts before us, we conclude that the Trial Judges erred in failing to obtain unequivocal assurances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>or excusing potential jurors for cause, when they openly acknowledged doubt that they could be fair in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In <em>People v Johnson </em>and <em>People v Sharper, </em>where defendants were challenging the competence of the police, Prospective Juror 7 first noted he had a friend in law enforcement and then expressed his own predisposition toward police officers. While at one point he \u201cguessed\u201d that he could fairly evaluate their testimony, when later asked if he would \u201ctend to favor the police testimony more than say a civilian\u2019s testimony,\u201d he responded \u201cI would.\u201d Asked again whether he would, he confirmed, \u201cYes.\u201d Surely, the cherished right to an impartial jury requires more than this.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Similarly, in <em>People v Reyes </em>\u2014 a prosecution for sale of heroin \u2014 Prospective Juror 13 acknowledged that, as a parent, she was particularly upset by drug abuse and could \u201conly try\u201d to be fair and impartial, but that \u201ca lot of emotional things\u201d could \u201ccolor [her] views\u201d about someone selling heroin. Asked a second time whether her emotional feelings would affect her ability to be impartial, she responded \u201cit\u2019s difficult\u201d and that, although defendant\u2019s criminal record did not <em>automatically </em>make him guilty, it \u201cmight be difficult\u201d for her to be open-minded. So too with respect to Prospective Juror 14, who said she \u201c[m]aybe slightly\u201d might have difficulty being fair and objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Significantly, in both instances the Trial Judge stated the applicable law correctly. As to Prospective Juror 13, in denying the challenge, he said that \u201cshe on balance indicated she could be fair in this case, that she would be open-minded. She acknowledged the information, the fact the past conviction would have in evaluating the testimony, but she indicated she could be fair.\u201d As to Prospective Juror 14, the court noted: \u201cShe clearly indicated two times, I believe, she could be fair. Was candid in indicating it would be somewhat difficult, but she said she could be fair in this case.\u201d Regrettably, in neither instance does the record support the Trial Judge\u2019s recollection that, having openly expressed their doubts, these potential jurors unequivocally represented that they could be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Finally, addressing the dissent, we are unanimous on the point that, in considering whether a challenge for cause should have been granted, we must look not to characterizations or snippets of the voir dire but to the full record of what the challenged jurors \u2014 sworn to speak truthfully \u2014 actually said <em>(see, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>dissenting opn, at 618, 620, 621). It is one thing, for example, to say that Prospective Juror 7 in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Sharper </em>\u201cstated that he would listen to the testimony of people who lived different lifestyles than he did, and give it the same credibility as he would give to testimony by those who lived the same lifestyle as he did\u201d (dissenting opn, at 617-618). It is quite another thing to see his actual words regarding police testimony: \u201c[W]ould [you] tend to favor the police testimony more than say a civilian\u2019s testimony?\u201d \u201cI would.\u201d \u201cYou would?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d It is precisely because of the importance of the actual colloquy that we have set out the relevant record as to each of the challenged jurors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Ultimately, the principle is a simple one, drawn from the statute, well articulated in our cases, and overwhelmingly understood and applied by courts across the State. When potential jurors themselves say they question or doubt they can be fair in the case, Trial Judges should either elicit some unequivocal assurance of their ability to be impartial when that is appropriate, or excuse the juror when that is appropriate. The \u201cworst the court will have done in most cases is to have replaced one impartial juror with another impartial juror\u201d <em>(People v Culhane, supra, </em>33 NY2d, at 108, n 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Accordingly, in <em>People v Johnson </em>and <em>People v Sharper, </em>the Appellate Division orders should be affirmed, and in <em>People v Reyes, </em>the Appellate Division order should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> We all agree as well that, in the important matter of seeking an impartial jury, a trial court must afford counsel a fair opportunity to question prospective jurors, but the court has discretion to restrict the scope of voir dire. That is the purport of the cases cited by the dissent at page 619 <em>(People v Jean, </em>75 NY2d 744, 745; <em>People v Pepper, </em>59 NY2d 353, 358-359; <em>People v Stanard, </em>42 NY2d 74, 81-82, <em>cert denied </em>434 US 986; <em>People v Boulware, </em>29 NY2d 135, 139, <em>cert denied </em>405 US 995). That, however, is not the issue before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b690-7\">Bellacosa, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJa\">(dissenting). We respectfully dissent. Our votes are to affirm in <em>People v Reyes </em>and to reverse and remit the cases to the Appellate Division <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.25 [2] [d]; 470.40 [2] [b]) in <em>People v Johnson </em>and <em>People v Sharper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">It is our view that the rulings by the respective trial courts during and concerning jury selection in these cases should be upheld. A remarkable fact drives our essential point home: several Judges and Justices at both appellate stages of review reasonably draw different interpretations from slices of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>transcripts. Thus, these cases are not, or at least should not be, susceptible to \u201cmatter-of-law\u201d resolution on these respective, idiomatic voir dire conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">This Court has prudently invested trial courts with expansive discretion governing the voir dire jury selection process. The operating rubrics derived from today\u2019s decision as applied to these cases, on the other hand, result in unwarranted nullification of otherwise properly tried cases that ended with jury verdicts of conviction. The practical \u201ckicker\u201d also unsettles the authority of Trial Judges to conduct and manage a fair, yet prompt, voir dire selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">CPL 270.20 (1) (b) allows a challenge for cause when a prospective juror \u201chas a state of mind that is likely to preclude him [or her] from rendering an impartial verdict based upon the evidence adduced at the trial.\u201d Generally, challenges under CPL 270.20 (1) (b) center on \u201callegations of actual bias\u201d where a juror expresses an unwillingness to judge a case impartially and on the evidence (Preiser, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 11 A, CPL 270.20, at 425). While this section no longer expressly contains an \u201cexpurgatory oath\u201d requirement \u2014 unlike its Code of Criminal Procedure predecessor \u2014 the majority rationale effectively reinstates that formality on a fairly generalized basis. The new regimen is not progressive for jury selection practices. The elliptical and contextual explorations, delved among the participants concerning whether a prospective juror\u2019s response is sufficient to dispel possible bias, are transformed into \u201cmatter-of-law\u201d determinations that trump the judgment-calls of the trial courts at the \u201cgive and take\u201d voir dire setting. A stricter and necessarily heightened review is superimposed long after trial, at a distanced appellate tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">It is also useful to look briefly but more particularly at what the challenged jurors \u2014 who were peremptorily excused and never served in the respective cases \u2014 did say in these cases. In <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Sharper, </em>the trial court\u2019s colloquy regarding the for-cause challenge to Prospective Juror 7, a doctor, focused on his possible desire to be excused because of his upcoming hospital rotation. Toward the end of the venire panel questioning, however, Prospective Juror 7 responded to defense counsel hypothesis concerning his possible verdict in the case. The doctor asserted he would vote not guilty and also stated that he would listen to the testimony of people who lived different lifestyles than he did, and give it the same credibility as he would give to testimony by those who lived the same lifestyle as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>did. He uttered other isolated and disquieting concerns, too, but our dissenting point of view is that the whole context and set of utterances ought to control, not potentially troublesome snippets.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Similarly, in <em>Reyes, </em>the prospective jurors simply attempted to answer counsel\u2019s probings in a forthright manner. Prospective Juror 13 was honest about how drugs had affected her everyday sensibilities as a parent, but subsequently indicated that she \u201ccould only try to be fair.\u201d In addition, when Prospective Juror 13 was asked whether defendant\u2019s prior convictions would make him automatically guilty of selling drugs, she answered that it would <em>not. </em>She added the acknowledgment that it might, however, be difficult to be open-minded. Prospective Juror 14 was asked the same question immediately thereafter and also responded that it would <em>not </em>make him automatically guilty. When pressed further by defense counsel if it would be difficult to be fair and objective, she replied \u201c [m] aybe slightly, to be honest.\u201d This response was the only basis for defense counsel\u2019s challenge for cause as to that juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">For the majority to overrule the trial court\u2019s balanced rulings on these exchanges and to conclude that the trial courts abused their discretion as a \u201cmatter of law,\u201d in concluding that these humanly forthright answers did not preclude fair and impartial jury service, diminishes this Court\u2019s \u201csubstantial risk\u201d standard of appellate review. The trial courts exercised the power this Court entrusted to them to conclude in these cases that all the contested jurors manifested enough assurances of ultimate impartiality \u2014 or at least that they did not pose a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d and threat of a biased assessment of the evidence against the defendants. Even if those courts acted \u201cimprovidently,\u201d there is no legal basis for this Court to displace their judgment-calls by way of the higher matter-of-law standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Voir dire jury selection is more akin to an art than a scientific process. A potential juror may be examined numerous times, by multiple questioners, over a period of several hours or even, as in the <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Sharper </em>cases, over days. Inquiries about particular subjects often occur in a piecemeal fashion, based on intuitive probings by counsel and the court, as well as queries raised by prospective jurors themselves. Prospective jurors frequently give elliptical answers or impressions in street vernacular, not by legal formulae and phrasings. They may also provide nuanced hedgings for a variety of human and psychological reasons. Today\u2019s decisions reinstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>formalistic prerequisites and superimpose a rigid review standard \u2014 otherwise widely eschewed as to many trial practices. The rubrics emanating from these cases switch the gears on this State\u2019s flexibly and empirically well-founded voir dire practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In <em>People v Williams </em>(63 NY2d 882), this Court instructed that, where a potential juror expresses racial biases, the trial court in its discretion must determine whether the potential juror would be able to discharge fairly the duties, if allowed to serve <em>{id., </em>at 884-885). The Court noted that \u201cthe only feelings of the jurors were expressed in the abstract, with no disclosure of particular personal conduct ever taken in consequence of such feelings * * * or any other indication of inability to lay personal predilections aside; and the jurors expressed their confidence that, notwithstanding their feelings, they could listen fairly and impartially\u201d <em>{id.). </em>The Court noted that most jurors bring some predispositions when entering the jury box. \u201cIt is only when it is shown that there is a <em>substantial risk </em>that such predispositions will affect the ability of the particular juror to discharge his responsibilities <em>{a determination committed largely to judgment of the Trial Judge with his peculiar opportunities to make a fair evaluation) </em>that his excuse is warranted\u201d <em>{id., </em>at 885 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The Court then found no error. Anticipating future practices, it added that were it to rule otherwise in cases involving racial bias, every potential juror who disclosed anything but the total absence of prejudice, notwithstanding the juror\u2019s stated readiness to lay personal feelings aside, would result in and require automatic excusal from jury service <em>{id.). </em>The results in the instant cases move the process down that previously eschewed slope.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Even in the general voir dire universe, this Court has consistently emphasized the broad discretion given to trial courts to manage this key preliminary stage of a jury trial. Indeed, we \u201crecognize [d] that we are dealing with an area of the law which does not lend itself to the formulation of precise standards or to the fashioning of rigid guidelines\u201d <em>(People v Boulware, </em>29 NY2d 135, 139, <em>cert denied </em>405 US 995). The Court further noted that \u201cit is the function of the trial court, involved and concerned with the quest for truth, to strike the balance, true, no less in the conduct of the <em>voir dire </em>than in the conduct of the trial proper\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 140; <em>see also, People v Jean, </em>75 NY2d 744, 745; <em>People v Pepper, </em>59 NY2d 353, 358-359; <em>People v Stanard, </em>42 NY2d 74, 81-82, <em>cert denied </em>434 US 986).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Thus, the determination of whether actual bias has been displayed and whether a prospective juror\u2019s uncertainties are unequivocal is responsibly and reliably allocated to trial court weighing. After all, Trial Judges have the advantage of seeing each potential juror\u2019s demeanor and body language in context of the whole of the questions and answers exchanged with the entire venire panel, as well as those uttered by the for-cause challenged individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Even assuming that a prima facie showing of actual bias was made with respect to each of the challenged jurors in these cases \u2014 a conclusion which we strongly dispute on these transcripts, read as a whole and carefully scrutinized from this final forum perspective \u2014 the trial courts remain vested with the discretion. They must weigh whether a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of possible bias was offset by the full give-and-take exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>People v Culhane </em>(33 NY2d 90), four prospective jurors were challenged for cause, primarily based on their impressions after having read newspaper articles and hearing radio reports regarding the crimes charged <em>(id., </em>at 96-97). The Court noted that Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 376, the statute in effect at the time, \u201cseverely limited the grounds for automatic disqualification\u201d and provided that \u201c \u2018actual bias\u2019 could be purged by the recitation of a statutory oath provided the court <em>in its sound discretion </em>was satisfied that the oath had dispelled the taint\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 102 [emphasis added]). In <em>Culhane, </em>a prima facie showing of actual bias was made as to the four prospective jurors, thus the Court turned to the oath requirements <em>(id., </em>at 106). The Court noted that the statutory oath requires the juror to declare a belief on whether a previously held impression or opinion will influence the verdict and whether the juror can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence (i<em>d., </em>at 106-107). Thus, \u201cto this extent the testimony must be taken as a whole,\u201d and if the oath has met these standards, the <em>trial court </em>must \u201cdetermine whether the prior opinion or impression has lost its sway over the mind of the juror\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 107).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Addressing the still-current CPL provision which had been enacted in the interim, the Court noted that \u201cthe new law gives the Trial Judge greater flexibility and a greater responsibility\u201d in determining which prospective jurors should be excused for cause, due to the abandonment of the expurgatory oath requirement <em>(id., </em>at 104, n 2). <em>Culhane </em>reinforced the broad discretionary powers vested in the trial court by statute and calibrated precedents, based in part on the better vantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>point of trial courts to evaluate voir dire exchanges as a whole and in the context of that front-line environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">While the majority today relies heavily on <em>People u Blyden </em>(55 NY2d 73), that case does not restrict the discretion entrusted to trial courts to provide balancing judgments in resolving these matters. Nor does <em>Blyden </em>come close to compelling the matter-of-law results, extrapolated out of these voir dire transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In <em>Blyden, </em>this Court referenced the important footnote in <em>Culhane, </em>quoted earlier, while agreeing that an expurgatory oath might still be useful as an extra reassurance to resolve doubt about a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality <em>(see, id., </em>at 77). <em>Blyden </em>establishes that when questions involving a juror\u2019s ability to render an impartial verdict are raised, the juror\u2019s statements as a whole and in context must indicate that he or she will be able to serve impartially and render a verdict based solely on the evidence <em>(id., </em>at 77-78). In the present cases, taking the exchanges as a whole and in context, there is no justification to go so far as to conclude that the trial courts violated their discretionary authority, as a matter of law, in their determinations that the responses by prospective jurors were overall satisfactory to withstand a for-cause challenge. Thus, <em>Blyden </em>is manifestly distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Very importantly, <em>People v Williams </em>(63 NY2d 882, <em>supra) </em>also distinguished <em>Blyden. </em>This Court unanimously underscored, with the benefit of common-law empirical perspective and applications in specific cases decided after <em>Culhane </em>and <em>Blyden, </em>that the determination whether a potential juror\u2019s responses are unequivocal should be left virtually exclusively to the trial court. <em>Williams </em>placed <em>Blyden </em>in context by noting that in <em>Blyden </em>the juror could do no more than state in response to the court\u2019s thrice-repeated question that he thought he could put aside his feelings about minorities <em>(id., </em>at 884). This Court pushes the <em>Blyden </em>envelope well beyond <em>Williams\u2019 </em>carefully circumscribed analysis. In realistic terms, today\u2019s matter-of-law modality conflates the intermediate appellate court mode of superintendence <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15-470.25).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">We offer another apt analogy from <em>People v Mackey </em>(49 NY2d 274). This Court used the common-law, experience-taught method to conclude that the exclusion of prior convictions was properly a matter of discretionary weighing \u2014 not a \u201cmatter-of-law\u201d modality \u2014 vested \u201cvirtually exclusively\u201d in the trial courts, fortified and supervised by the plenary review power of inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>mediate appellate courts. We noted that we could not \u201csay that the ruling of the pretrial Judge or that of the Trial Judge <em>* * </em>* constituted the clear abuse of discretion that would make it reversible error\u201d (id., at 281-282). <em>Mackey </em>concludes that \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, adherence to the ruling of the pretrial Judge is not such an exercise of discretion as, after affirmance by the Appellate Division, warrants reversal\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 282). That prudent and respectful allocation of judicial power not only has worked very well, it also applies, a fortiori, to the grey, arguable shadings presented by these voir dire transcripts <em>(see also, People v Gray, </em>84 NY2d 709).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The finely balanced set of rubrics that we propose based on this Court\u2019s precedential guideposts, leaving such matters to \u201ca discretionary determination for the trial courts and fact-reviewing intermediate appellate courts,\u201d makes a lot of good sense <em>(see, People v Mattiace, </em>77 NY2d 269, 274). Plenary review by intermediate appellate courts, with discretion and interest of justice powers should play a role in this Court\u2019s decisional choices about such cases. It is very important to point out the existence of that safeguard because it proportionately protects against unfettered, arbitrary and even improvident exercises of trial court discretion. As dissenters, we also agree that more prophylactic practices like exceptional expurgatory oaths or even more probing explorations should be undertaken at the trial level, when appropriate. On the other hand, formalisms that unnecessarily pinch trial court discretion should not be mandated as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The voir dire exchanges in these cases presented dynamic variables and, to be frank, some degree of uncertainty or unevenness. Could the trial courts have gone an extra mile to dispel any doubts and nail down a firmer commitment to impartiality? The answer is \u201cYes.\u201d Did they have to do so in order to avoid an appellate ruling labeling them abusers of trial court discretion, determined as a matter-of-law? The answer should be \u201cNo.\u201d The very fact that so many judicial officers have assayed these transcripts so differently (the Trial Judges, the Appellate Division Justices, the Court of Appeals Judges) logically demonstrates that these calibrations were matters of degree, not matter-of-law certainty. The rub of these cases can be appreciated by examining the fuzzy difference between a weighing exercise (discretion), contrasted to a matter-of-law template (more doctrinaire). In the end, the cases present issues that are quintessentially and rightly entrusted to a trial court\u2019s in-the-trenches balancing resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>After all is said and done, we dissenters, like our colleagues who comprise the majority, might have ruled differently or pressed the challenged jurors harder, were any of us serving as the trial court Judges. But that is not the test and standard for decision at this Court. Seeing with the benefit of hindsight what might have been done to provide a bit more reassurance does not render wrong the actions taken by these trial courts \u2014 at least as measured through the sharper prism of later appellate scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Rosenblatt concur with Chief Judge Kaye; Judge Bellacosa dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Wesley concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In <em>People v Johnson </em>and <em>People v Sharper: </em>Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In <em>People v Reyes: </em>Order reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
