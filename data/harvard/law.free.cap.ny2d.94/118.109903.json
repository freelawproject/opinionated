The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>below erred as a matter of law by granting irrebuttable effect to the affidavit of service in this case. <em>(Engel v Lichterman, </em>95 AD2d 536, 62 NY2d 943; <em>Vita v Heller, </em>97 AD2d 464; <em>People v Langan, </em>303 NY 474; <em>Nassau Ins.

The drastic sanction of dismissing plaintiffs complaint was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law since there was no showing of a willful disobedience to the court\u2019s conditional order. <em>(Dauria v City of New York, </em>127 AD2d 459; <em>Bassett v Bando Sangsa Co., </em>103 AD2d 728; <em>Newman v Chartered New England Corp., </em>63 AD2d 617; <em>Donner v 50 Tom Corp., </em>99 AD2d 504; <em>Wilensky v JRB Mktg. &amp; Opinion Research, </em>161 AD2d 761; <em>Applied Elec.

III. The lower court, affirmed by the court below, properly exercised its discretion to dismiss the complaint where plaintiff failed to comply with a conditional order of dismissal, and failed to show a reasonable excuse for the delay or a meritorious cause of action. <em>(Abreu v St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hosp.

We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint, and affirm the Appellate Division order so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">On July 26, 1995, plaintiff commenced a damages action for personal injuries arising out of a one-car accident six months earlier. Alleging that she was a passenger in a Honda that skidded off a Nassau County roadway in the Town of Oyster Bay, plaintiff sued the driver, Karl O. Pfeffer, as well as Honda, the County and the Town. As against Honda she claimed negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, strict products liability and failure to warn in connection with the automobile and its component parts, including the seat belts. Honda responded with a general denial, cross-claims and a host of discovery requests, including demands for expert witness disclosure, collateral source information, no-fault authorizations, medical information and certain records.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">On March 18, 1996, the parties convened before the court for a preliminary conference, resulting in an extensive Preliminary Conference Order fixing specific dates for discovery, to be completed within six months. The order was consented to by each party and signed by the Trial Judge. Most pertinently, the order required plaintiff to respond to Honda\u2019s interrogatories \u201cwithin 30 days following receipt of same.\u201d That very day Honda served plaintiff with its \u201cFirst Set of Interrogatories\u201d\u2014 34 pages, 92 questions. Having had no response, on September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>13, 1996 \u2014 roughly five months beyond the response date fixed by the Preliminary Conference Order \u2014 Honda moved to strike the complaint and dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claims against it, or to compel responses within 10 days. Honda alleged that without specificity as to the claimed defect in the automobile it could not adequately prepare its defense. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit opposing the motion, and that same day\u2014 December 10, 1996 \u2014 served its responses to Honda\u2019s interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Honda, however, persisted in seeking dismissal of the complaint, portraying plaintiff\u2019s responses as \u201cwoefully inadequate and totally unresponsive in clear violation of the Court\u2019s Order.\u201d In particular, Honda claimed that responses 43 through 56 offered no clue as to the claimed defect in the car. Interrogatory 43, for example, seeking specificity as to the purported design defect, was answered \u201cDefective design: Plaintiff alleges a defective design in the automobile, seatbelt and the seatbelt mechanisms and reserve their right to supplement this response prior to trial.\u201d Nearly identical responses followed with respect to the request for specificity as to failure to warn (Interrogatory 44), failure to inspect (Interrogatory 45), improper marketing and advertising (Interrogatory 46) and the defect that exacerbated plaintiff\u2019s injuries (Interrogatory 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">By order dated March 31, 1997, the Trial Judge granted Honda\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to comply with the Preliminary Conference Order unless plaintiff served further answers to interrogatories 43 through 56 within 20 days after service of a copy of the order on plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The court held that plaintiff\u2019s answers were \u201cnot responsive, lack any reasonable detail and improperly reserve the right to provide answers at a later time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Honda\u2019s Order with Notice of Entry, indicating service by mail on all other parties at their correct addresses, is dated June 6, 1997, and stamped \u201cFiled\u201d by the Nassau County Clerk on June 16, 1997. The Jurat on Honda\u2019s Affidavit of Service, however, reads \u201cSworn to before me this 6th day of April, 1997.\u201d During the month of June 1997, counsel for Honda twice wrote to plaintiff\u2019s counsel referencing the Trial Judge\u2019s order, the first letter beginning: \u201cAs you are now undoubtedly aware, Judge Kutner has ordered that plaintiff supplement [her] discovery responses.\u201d Nevertheless, plaintiff\u2019s counsel claimed the March 31, 1997 order was not actually served, as repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>sented, on June 6, 1997. Plaintiff made no further responses to Honda\u2019s interrogatories within 20 days after June 6, 1997.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">On October 20, 1997, the Trial Judge issued an order reserving decision on Honda\u2019s motion to strike the complaint until it received an explanation of when Honda served the court\u2019s March 31, 1997 order. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who was on vacation during the entire month of June, then submitted two affidavits \u2014 one from his partner who reviewed his mail during June, the second from his secretary who opened his mail\u2014 asserting that they did not see the March 31, 1997 order in the June mail. Honda responded with two affidavits of its own, the first from the secretary who mailed the Order with Notice of Entry and prepared the Affidavit of Service, attesting that \u201cApril\u201d was her typographical error; the second affidavit \u2014 to the same effect \u2014 was from the Notary Public who signed the Jurat.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On February 9, 1998, the Trial Judge granted Honda\u2019s motion to strike the complaint, noting that the court found Honda\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy in dates on the Affidavit of Service reasonable. The Appellate Division affirmed, with two Justices dissenting on the ground that a hearing was required to resolve the question of fact regarding service of the March 31, 1997 order. The double dissent on an issue of law brought the case to this Court (CPLR 5601 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Three familiar propositions of law resolve this appeal in Honda\u2019s favor. <em>First, </em>service of papers on an attorney is complete upon mailing (CPLR 2103 [b] [2]). <em>Second, </em>a properly executed affidavit of service raises a presumption that a proper mailing occurred, and a mere denial of receipt is not enough to rebut this presumption <em>(Engel v Lichterman, </em>62 NY2d 943, 944-945). Here, the denials of receipt by persons who reviewed plaintiffs lawyer\u2019s June mail were insufficient to create an issue of fact requiring a hearing. <em>Third, </em>when a party fails to comply with a court order and frustrates the disclosure scheme set forth in the CPLR, it is well within the Trial Judge\u2019s discretion to dismiss the complaint <em>(Zletz v Wetanson, </em>67 NY2d 711, 713).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Regrettably, it is not only the law but also the scenario that is all too familiar <em>(see, e.g., Tewari v Tsoutsouras, </em>75 NY2d 1, 10-11; <em>Reynolds Sec. v Underwriters Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>44 NY2d 568, 571-572; <em>Laverne v Incorporated Vil. of Laurel Hol</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>low, </em>18 NY2d 635, 637, <em>appeal dismissed </em>386 US 682). If the credibility of court orders and the integrity of our judicial system are to be maintained, a litigant cannot ignore court orders with impunity. Indeed, the Legislature, recognizing the need for courts to be able to command compliance with their disclosure directives, has specifically provided that a \u201ccourt may make such orders * * * as are just,\u201d including dismissal of an action (CPLR 3126). Finally, we underscore that compliance with a disclosure order requires both a timely response and one that evinces a good-faith effort to address the requests meaningfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\"> On July 23, 1997, plaintiff belatedly served additional responses to Honda\u2019s interrogatories. Honda asserts that plaintiff\u2019s responses are still inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
