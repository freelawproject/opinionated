Defendant was also indicted on one count of burglary in the second degree allegedly committed on April 7, 1995, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>one count of menacing in the second degree allegedly committed between February 27 and April 7, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The direct evidence of defendant\u2019s commission of the acts constituting the crimes charged in the indictment came from the testimony of the complaining witness. He and defendant were former lovers who had lived together in the victim\u2019s apartment until early February 1995. Some acrimony between them followed. The complaining witness testified that upon returning home during the evening of February 27, 1995, he found that defendant had entered his apartment without permission, waiting for his arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The witness then described defendant\u2019s forcible restraint, preventing flight, and commission of separate acts of forcible sodomy and sexual abuse that evening, and defendant\u2019s resumption of that conduct the following morning. He also described defendant\u2019s threatening telephone calls over the next several weeks, until defendant reentered his apartment on April 7, after which he was arrested. The complainant\u2019s testimony was sharply attacked on cross-examination. Specifically, he was pressed as to why he remained in his apartment until the morning of February 28, rather than fleeing and promptly contacting the police when defendant passed out from drinking during the evening of February 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Jury deliberations extended over two days. At one point the jury sent the court a note indicating inability to \u201ccome to any agreement or compromise except on one charge.\u201d Instructed to continue deliberations, they then asked whether they could consider reduced degrees of sodomy and were instructed that they could not. Ultimately, they returned a unanimous verdict convicting defendant of unlawful imprisonment in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 135.05), one count of burglary in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.25), two counts of sodomy in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.50) and one count of sexual abuse in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 130.65) regarding the events of February 27-28; menacing in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 120.14) with respect to the period between February 28 and April 7; and criminal trespass in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.15) for the April 7 incident. The jury acquitted defendant on all other counts, including the three remaining counts of sodomy in the first degree and the one remaining count of sexual abuse in the first degree, allegedly committed over the same time frame of February 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction in all respects (261 AD2d 182). It found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>verdict was not against the weight of the evidence..In doing so, the court rejected defendant\u2019s contention that, in exercising its statutory weight of the evidence review responsibility <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [5]; <em>People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490), it was required to take into account the implied inconsistency of the mixed verdict in terms of the jury\u2019s apparent crediting of the complaining witness\u2019s testimony concerning the sex crimes on which they voted to convict, and rejection of his testimony concerning those crimes on which they voted to acquit. A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">As set forth in CPL 470.15 (1), an intermediate appellate court \u201cmay consider and determine any question of law or issue of fact involving error or defect in the criminal court proceedings which may have adversely affected the appellant.\u201d A determination of whether a judgment of conviction is \u201cagainst the weight of the evidence\u201d is deemed to be on the facts (CPL 470.15 [5]) and is the exclusive province of an intermediate appellate court <em>(cf, </em>CPL 450.90 [Court of Appeals]; CPL 330.30 [trial courts]).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In <em>People v Bleakley </em>(69 NY2d 490, <em>supra), </em>this Court held that \u201cit is reversible error when the Appellate Division manifestly avoids its exclusive statutory authority to review the weight of the evidence in criminal cases\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 492). The Court in <em>Bleakley </em>articulated the standard to be employed by an intermediate appellate court in conducting weight of the evidence review, contrasting this task with legal sufficiency analysis. When assessing sufficiency of the evidence, the \u201ccourt must determine whether there is any valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which could lead a rational person to the conclusion reached by the jury on the basis of the evidence at trial\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 495, citing <em>Cohen v Hallmark Cards, </em>45 NY2d 493, 499). By contrast, \u201c[i]f based on all the credible evidence a different finding would not have been unreasonable, then the appellate court must, like the trier of fact below, \u2018weigh the relative probative force of conflicting testimony and the relative strength of conflicting inferences that may be drawn from the testimony\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>quoting <em>People ex rel. MacCracken v Miller, </em>291 NY 55, 62). As described by the United States Supreme Court, a court reviewing the weight of the evidence must engage in its own de novo review of the evidence, sitting as a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d <em>(see, Tibbs v Florida, </em>457 US 31, 42).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Defendant\u2019s sole argument before us is that the Appellate Division, in performing its statutory function independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>weighing the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of the convicted crimes, must take into account the implied inconsistency in a mixed verdict, when a jury\u2019s acquittals and convictions are based on the testimony of the same witness, and there is no reasonable basis in the record to explain the discrepancy in results. In this case defendant argues that, without any distinguishing facts or circumstances upon which to parse out the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial, it must be inferred that the jury unreasonably credited his testimony as to certain events and rejected it as to other acts or events. Therefore, defendant argues, the convictions cannot stand. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We find it instructive to begin our analysis with our jurisprudence involving legally inconsistent verdicts on multiple counts. In the seminal case of <em>People v Tucker </em>(55 NY2d 1), this Court considered two different approaches to reviewing inconsistent verdicts. The first approach, urged by the defendant in that case, was based essentially upon the very same rationale advanced by defendant here \u2014 that the record should be reviewed in toto, in search of some explanation for the apparent inconsistency, \u201cwhereupon the reviewing court can determine the logic or illogic of the verdicts and remedy the repugnancy when it exists\u201d <em>(id,., </em>at 6). Under the second approach, adopted by the Court in <em>Tucker, </em>a reviewing court would reverse a conviction \u201conly in those instances where acquittal on one crime as charged to the jury is conclusive as to a necessary element of the other crime, as charged, for which the guilty verdict was rendered\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Court\u2019s reasoning for rejecting the first, more expansive approach to reviewing mixed verdicts was that it would \u201crequire [] the court to intrude into the jury\u2019s deliberative process by speculating on how the jury perceived and weighed the evidence\u201d <em>(id.). </em>The Court elaborated on why this kind of speculation was inappropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201cThe problems of second-guessing are compounded by the possibility that the jury has not necessarily acted irrationally, but instead has exercised mercy. When the jury has decided to show lenity to the defendant, an accepted power of the jury, the court should not then undermine the jury\u2019s role and participation by setting aside the verdict\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">The <em>Tucker </em>holding was applied in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Goodfriend </em>(64 NY2d 695). In <em>Goodfriend </em>a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>was indicted for first degree rape and two counts of first degree sodomy, all arising out of a single occurrence. He was convicted of only one count of sodomy and acquitted of the two other counts <em>(see, id., </em>at 697). Rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the verdict was repugnant, this Court r\u00e9cognized that \u201cdefendant\u2019s acquittal on two counts did not necessarily negate an essential element of the remaining count\u201d <em>(id.). </em>The Court remarked that defendant\u2019s argument rested on the ground that the jury accepted as true a certain defense that would have been equally applicable to the count of which the defendant was convicted and concluded that \u201c [t]his type of speculation as to \u2018how the jury perceived and weighed the evidence\u2019 and whether it acted \u2018irrationally\u2019 was rejected in <em>Tucker\u201d (id., </em>quoting <em>People v Tucker, </em>55 NY2d 1, 7, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Although defendant correctly points out that the role of a court in determining legal repugnancy, as defined in <em>Tucker, </em>is different from that of an intermediate appellate court in conducting its weight of the evidence review, the rationale articulated in <em>Tucker </em>applies here as well. Just as in the context of a legal repugnancy inquiry, neither logic nor practical analysis requires a weight of evidence reviewing court to conclude that the jury unreasonably credited the complaining witness on some counts and rejected his credibility on others because, as pointed out in <em>Tucker, </em>there is always \u201cthe possibility that the jury has <em>not necessarily acted irrationally, </em>but instead has exercised mercy\u201d <em>(People v Tucker, supra, </em>at 7 [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Moreover, in performing its de novo review function as a \u201cthirteenth juror,\u201d there is no good reason why a court should resolve any inconsistency in favor of a defendant rather than the People who, after all, have no right of appellate review of jury acquittals in mixed verdicts. In <em>United States v Powell </em>(469 US 57), the United States Supreme Court, going further than we did in <em>Tucker, </em>held that even if a verdict is inconsistent to the point of repugnancy, there is no principled basis upon which to require a court to give the defendant the benefit of the consistency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201c[inconsistent verdicts \u2014 even verdicts that acquit on a predicate offense while convicting on the compound offense \u2014 should not necessarily be interpreted as a windfall to the Government at the defendant\u2019s expense. It is equally possible that the jury, convinced of guilt, properly reached its conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>sion on the compound offense, and then through mistake, compromise, or lenity, arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the lesser offense\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 65).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">For this reason, the Supreme Court has ruled that it is better to leave even a legally inconsistent jury verdict undisturbed <em>(see, id. </em>[\u201cFor us, the possibility that the inconsistent verdicts may favor the criminal defendant as well as the Government militates against review of such convictions at the defendant\u2019s behest\u201d]). The Court specifically rejected, \u201cas imprudent and unworkable\u201d any rule that would permit criminal defendants to challenge inconsistent verdicts on the ground that the verdict resulted from some error that worked against them rather than being the product of lenity. \u201cSuch an individualized assessment of the reason for the inconsistency would be based either on pure speculation, or would require inquiries into the jury\u2019s deliberations that courts generally will not undertake\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 66).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In sum, we are persuaded by the rationale of <em>Tucker </em>and <em>Powell </em>that we should not require an intermediate appellate court, as a part of its exclusive weight of the evidence review, to assume the basis for any implied inconsistencies in mixed jury verdicts.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> In so ruling, we do not mean to imply that, under no circumstances may an intermediate appellate court consider jury acquittals in performing weight of the evidence review. Nor should our ruling here be deemed to cast in doubt the propriety of consideration of such acquittals in some instances on legal issues such as the sufficiency of the evidence (see, <em>People v Yarrell, </em>75 NY2d 828, <em>revg for reasons stated by dissent </em>146 AD2d 819, 821-822) or errors in the admissibility of evidence (see, <em>People v Osorio, </em>75 NY2d 80).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
