The decision of the court below should be reversed because it is contrary to every reported decision on the issue herein, including a recent decision by this Court. <em>(Legnetto Constr. v Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>92 NY2d 275; <em>Jess F. Howes, Inc. v Hudson Val. Dist. Council of Carpenters, </em>146 AD2d 163; <em>Construction Pace Setters v United States Fid. &amp; Guar.

The decision of the court below should be reversed because it is contrary to the plain meaning and legislative intent of State Finance Law \u00a7 137. III. The decision of the court below effectively eviscerates the Statute of Limitations on payment bond actions brought under State Finance Law \u00a7 137 and possibly on any action seeking payment of monies allegedly due. IV. The court below erred in construing the relevant contractual provisions at issue. <em>(West-Fair Elec. Contrs. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>87 NY2d 148; <em>Huber Lathing Corp. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>132 AD2d 597; <em>Pal-con Indus. v Travelers Indem. Co., </em>114 AD2d 667; <em>Bartley Bros. Constr.

The decision of the court below should be reversed because it is contrary to public policy and will have a devastating effect on parties throughout the construction chain. <em>(Conesco Indus. v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Mar.

The decision of the court below should be reversed because it deprives the surety of any separate defense or setoifs to a payment bond claim and strips it of its fundamental right of subrogation. <em>(Pearlman v Reliance Ins. Co., </em>371 US 132; <em>Matter of Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v Parsons &amp; Whittemore Contrs.

The court below was correct in finding that the present action was timely, since it was properly commenced within a year from the date that final payment became due as determined through the alternative dispute resolution mechanism provided in Windsor\u2019s subcontract. <em>(Horwitz v American Druggists\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>112 AD2d 192; <em>William H. Lane, Inc. v American Druggists\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>111 AD2d 970; <em>Clyde-Savannah Cent.

Co. v Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp., </em>208 AD2d 63, 87 NY2d 927.) II. The surety fails to cite a single case on point standing for the proposition that final payment is due when a demand therefor is made, <em>regardless </em>of the fact that the claim is disputed and subject to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism before final payment can become legally due. Thus, there is no merit to the surety\u2019s claim that the opinion herein conflicts with prior decisions of the Court of Appeals and the other Appellate Division departments. <em>(Legnetto Constr. v Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>92 NY2d 275; <em>Jess F. Howes, Inc. v Hudson Val. Dist. Council of Carpenters, </em>146 AD2d 163; <em>Scaccia Concrete Corp. v Hartford Fire Ins.

Corp., </em>65 AD2d 262.) III. The surety is in error as to the alternative dates from which it would begin to measure the Statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Limitations in this case. (Jess <em>F. Howes, Inc. v Hudson Val. Dist. Council of Carpenters, </em>146 AD2d 163; <em>Carl A. Morse, Inc. v Rentar Indus. Dev.

The surety misrepresents the interplay between the various subsections of State Finance Law \u00a7 137. V. The surety\u2019s reliance on cases decided under the Federal Miller Act is misplaced, since the Miller Act provides for a different starting point for the Statute of Limitations than State Finance Law \u00a7 137. VI. The surety and the <em>amicus curiae </em>in favor of the surety are essentially advocating a change in the statute, rather than asserting an error on the part of the <em>court below </em>in applying the law. As such, it is improper to seek to have this Court in effect legislate a change which is contrary both to the policy and the explicit intent of State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (4) (b). <em>(Davidson Pipe Supply Co. v Wyoming County Indus. Dev. Agency, </em>85 NY2d 281; <em>Chittenden Lbr. Co. v Silberblatt &amp; Lasker, </em>288 NY 396; <em>Dutchess Quarry &amp; Supply Co. v Firemen\u2019s Ins.

The court below properly denied the surety from presenting its so-called separate defenses and, thus, relitigating the arbitration claims once again herein. <em>(Matter of Weinrott [Carp], </em>32 NY2d 190; <em>Rembrandt Indus. v Hodges Intl., </em>38 NY2d 502; <em>Matter of S &amp; W Fine Foods [Office Empls.

The order of the court below is contrary to the plain language and intent of State Finance Law \u00a7 137 and numerous decisions interpreting that statute. <em>(Legnetto Constr. v Hartford Fire Ins.

II. If permitted to stand, the order of the court below would increase bonding costs and drastically curtail available bonding capacity in New York. III.

The court below erred in determining the commencement of the one-year limitation period of State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (4) (b). II.

Also implicated is whether contractual provisions in a subcontract can effectively toll the statutory time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">We conclude that the one-year period starts to be counted as of the time when a subcontractor has demanded final payment from the general contractor with whom it contracted, and 90 days have passed since the subcontractor ceased work on the project. This time frame may not be extended or overridden by any provisions of the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">This controversy arises out of a public improvement contract for the construction of a health care facility at Green Haven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Correctional Facility. Eberhard Construction Company, the general contractor, held the prime contract with the State of New York. Plaintiff Windsor subcontracted with Eberhard to provide and erect all structural steel for the project, at a cost of $404,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Defendant General Accident provided the statutory payment bond for the project. The document stated that it was a Comptroller\u2019s Form Bond issued pursuant to State Finance Law \u00a7 137 and that \u201call rights and remedies on this bond * * * shall be determined in accordance with the provisions, conditions and limitations of said Section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Windsor started its work on the project on April 12, 1994. The State terminated its prime contract with Eberhard on March 28, 1995. This resulted in the termination of the subcontract with Windsor and in Windsor\u2019s cessation of work on the project. Windsor\u2019s president later asserted in an affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cPrior to the termination, Eberhard had already fallen behind in payments to Windsor. Following the termination, I contacted Eberhard on several occasions in an attempt to secure final payment, all to no avail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">On March 31, 1995, three days after the State terminated the contract with Eberhard, Windsor wrote to General Accident, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">\u201cAs of this date we are owed the amount of $211,192.00. Plus, we are awaiting charges from our erector for changing opening and delays.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">\u201cFor you [sic] convenience we have hereby attached a copy of our request for payment sent to Eberhard Construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">\u201cPlease regard this as a notice for payment. Please be kind enough to inform us as to when we can expect the monies due to us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">At all relevant times, Eberhard and General Accident denied owing Windsor additional compensation and rejected Windsor\u2019s payment demands. Indeed, Eberhard took the position that Windsor\u2019s failure to fulfill its obligations under the subcontract caused the State to terminate the prime contract with Eberhard.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">On April 19, 1995, Windsor filed a notice of mechanics\u2019 lien in the amount of $214,036.36, which Windsor indicated was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>due on March 1, 1995. The lien was discharged when Eberhard and General Accident posted a $250,000 bond, separate from the initial statutory payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On April 19, 1995, Windsor also filed a demand for arbitration against Eberhard, seeking the $214,036.36. Windsor immediately notified General Accident of the arbitration, and General Accident participated in the proceedings to the extent that it joined Eberhard in the attempt to prove Windsor had breached its subcontract; General Accident also asserted that Windsor was responsible for General Accident\u2019s own losses incurred as a result of its having to arrange to complete the project following the termination of Eberhard, its principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Windsor won an arbitration award against only Eberhard on April 2, 1996 in the sum of $231,678.20. Supreme Court confirmed the award and, on December 24, 1996, entered a $255,130.22 judgment against Eberhard. Unfortunately for Windsor, Eberhard was apparently insolvent by this time. Windsor, thus turned its recovery effort toward General Accident, which denied its demand for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In early 1997, Windsor sued General Accident, seeking $255,130.22, the amount of the judgment entered against Eberhard. General Accident raised the Statute of Limitations as an affirmative defense (State Finance Law \u00a7 137 [4] [b]), and Supreme Court granted summary judgment to General Accident on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The Appellate Division disagreed. It relied on specific provisions of Windsor\u2019s subcontract and found that none of the \u201cfinal payment\u201d provisions in the subcontract could operate to raise a time bar. As pertinent to this appeal, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed and granted that part of Windsor\u2019s motion seeking summary judgment on its first cause of action pursuant to the payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">This Court granted General Accident leave to appeal. We now reverse, reinstate the Supreme Court ruling, and dismiss Windsor\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (4) (b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-12\">\u201cNo action on a payment bond furnished pursuant to this section shall be commenced after the expiration of one year from <em>the date on which final payment under the claimant\u2019s subcontract became due\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Section 137 (3) of State Finance Law provides that anyone who has furnished labor or material pursuant to a subcontract made directly with the contractor and who is not paid within 90 days \u201cafter the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material was furnished * * * shall have the right to sue\u201d on the surety payment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Together, subdivisions (3) and (4) set the beginning and endpoint measurements for a lawsuit against a surety in these circumstances. They establish a date upon which the claim against a surety becomes ripe (State Finance Law \u00a7 137 [3]) and a date after which time has run out for an action on the claim (State Finance Law \u00a7 137 [4] [b]). The pinpointing of this latter date is the operative question in this case; it hinges on the definition of \u201cthe date on which final payment under the claimant\u2019s subcontract became due\u201d (State Finance Law \u00a7 137 [4] [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">This date is critical because the lawsuit must be started within one year from that fixed point. In this case, Windsor proffers as the date upon which this one-year period begins the date of the favorable arbitration determination. To so calculate this date, it relies on a combination of the final payment provision (\u201cwhen the Subcontractor\u2019s work is fully performed in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Architect has issued a Certificate for Payment covering the Subcontractor\u2019s completed Work and the Contractor has received payment from the Owner\u201d) and the arbitration clause (\u201c[a]ny controversy or claim between the Contractor and the Subcontractor arising out of or related to this Subcontract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration\u201d). We reject Windsor\u2019s contract-based calculation of the measuring date.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Our holding focuses principally on when the one-year limitations period begins to run, within the meaning of State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (4) (b). We conclude that it starts at a point when a subcontractor who has directly contracted with the general contractor has submitted an invoice for final payment (or given the functional equivalent thereof) and 90 days have passed since the subcontractor has ceased to work on the project. Contractual provisions between the subcontractor and general contractor cannot modify this starting-point date. The necessity to incorporate and satisfy all these considerations is supported by the statute, as well as precedent of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The language \u2014 \u201cdate on which final payment under the claimant\u2019s subcontract became due\u201d \u2014 stems from a bill recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>mended by the Law Revision Commission in 1962. The Commission suggested that an action upon the bond be commenced within one year after the date on which the claimant performed the last of the labor or supplied the last of the material \u201cexcept that if the beneficiary is a subcontractor of the contractor, action on the bond must be commenced within one year from the date on which final payment under the subcontract became due\u201d (1962 Report of NY Law Rev Commn, at 186). The initial bill introduced on the Commission\u2019s recommendation was withdrawn for study of criticisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In 1963, a new bill was recommended by the Commission. Like the original bill, it included a provision regarding suit against a surety \u201clike that of the [Federal] Miller Act * * * It adds an exception, however, under which, if the claimant is a subcontractor, the one year period runs from the date on which final payment under the subcontract became due\u201d (1963 Report of NY Law Rev Commn, at 105). In 1964, the 1963 recommendations of the Commission were adopted in substantially unchanged form and State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (4) (b) was enacted to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cNo action on a payment bond furnished pursuant, to this section shall be commenced after the expiration of one year from the date on which the claimant performed the last of the labor or furnished the last of the material for which such action is brought, except that if the claimant is a subcontractor of the contractor, no such action shall be commenced after the expiration of one year from the date on which final payment under the subcontract became due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Legislative history indicates that in 1980, this subdivision was amended into its current version, specifically to render the original \u201cexception\u201d for subcontractors universally applicable to all claimants (see, Mem of Assembly Member Goldstein, Bill Jacket, L 1980, ch 360). This change enabled secondary subcontractors (sub-subcontractors) to pursue an action based on a claim within one year after final payment is due, rather than within one year after they have completed their work, because the one-year period from completion of work was seen as too stringent a limitation on them <em>(see, id.). </em>\u201cFrequently these [secondary sub-] contractors finish their work more than a year before payment is due them and thus when payment is received they have no recourse should such payment not be to their satisfaction\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Direct subcontractors were not seen as typically having a problem with the point of final payment occurring too long after their date of final work on the project. Indeed, it appears that a subcontractor may even seek final payment <em>before </em>the subcontractor leaves the project site <em>(see, Legnetto Constr. v Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>92 NY2d 275 [final invoice sent to contractor on June 2, 1994; final performance of work on the project on July 30, 1994]). In such an instance, the combined operation of State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (3) and \u00a7 137 (4) (b) would shorten the subcontractor\u2019s time within which to sue on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">For example, if the claim cannot mature until 90 days after the date of last work performed, but final payment was demanded as due before this date of last work performed, then a claimant may lose at least 90 days of its statutory one-year limitation. This diminishment conflicts with the intent of the 1980 amendments, which, although they addressed a variation on this diminishment of time in which to sue, essentially sought to insure that all levels of subcontractors would have a full year in which they could sue on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Here, because the project was terminated by the State, Windsor\u2019s demand for final payment occurred virtually simultaneously with its date of final performance. Yet, its ability to sue the surety did not accrue until 90 days after its date of final performance. This case provides a prime reason for holding that both subdivisions (3) and (4) of State Finance Law \u00a7 137, are implicated in tandem.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>Legnetto </em>(92 NY2d 275, supra) provides helpful guidance with respect to the Statute of Limitations issue presented here. In that case, the parties disputed whether the subcontractor had adequately performed its work under the contract, and it was undisputed that the contractor had failed to pay the subcontractor the full amount due under the subcontract. Thus, the question whether the contractor would actually pay the subcontractor did not change the fact that final payment to the subcontractor had legally become due. At that point and circumstance, the statutory formula takes over and controls <em>(see, Sehuler-Haas Elec. Co. v Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>40 NY2d 883, 885; <em>see also, Sturdy Concrete Corp. v NAB Constr. Corp., </em>65 AD2d 262, 271, <em>appeal dismissed </em>46 NY2d 938),</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Here, Windsor\u2019s president asserted that Windsor considered final payment due as of at least March 31, 1995, yet Windsor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>did not sue on the bond until nearly two years later, on January 2, 1997. Windsor recognizes this bind and tries to wriggle out of it through a novel calculation. On its theory, the interplay of the final payment and arbitration provisions would allow Windsor to measure the one-year limitations period for lawsuit only after and from the arbitration decision in Windsor\u2019s favor. This is unpersuasive for interpretative and policy reasons, including that this approach would override the statutory formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Windsor\u2019s strategic actions belie the legal merit of its current position. Windsor itself was asserting that final payment was due, despite the fact that the final payment events delineated in the subcontract had not occurred and the project had been terminated. Windsor\u2019s \u201cnew logic\u201d falters over the premise that payment may become legally due to the subcontractor before it must be actually paid to the subcontractor. Additionally, the subcontract here provides that the arbitration provision \u201cshall not be deemed a limitation of rights or remedies which the Subcontractor may have under * * * applicable labor or material payment bonds.\u201d Thus, if courts are to look at the contract at all, that examination here further supports General Accident\u2019s assertion that the date when final payment becomes due is not determined by the date the arbitration is resolved. Indeed, the triggering date for the limitations period should not be pegged to so uncertain an event with its usual confirmation steps and review potentialities.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Instructively, in <em>Legnetto, </em>this Court refused to turn to the terms of the contract to determine whether the bond could be interpreted as having a Statute of Limitations greater than one year. The bond was silent as to its Statute of Limitations and because the bond itself did not contain provisions more ample than the statute, the specific limitations period provided by the statute was given full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">That is so here, too. The bond provided by General Accident clearly incorporates the one-year limitations period from the statute; the statute is also specifically referenced on the face of the bond. According to <em>Legnetto, </em>and contrary to the theory Windsor proposes and the rationale that the Appellate Division adopted, we must refuse to look beyond the face and terms of the bond to the contract provisions. To recalculate the Statute of Limitations\u2019 starting point and duration on that basis, as applied to this controversy, is not supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">We observe that this case yields the ironic result of a subcontractor being shut out from a timely lawsuit by the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>statute meant generally to protect the rights of subcontractors. However, the Legislature has clearly made a conscious policy decision with respect to public improvement projects. It defines and delimits the remedy by requiring prompt payment, pursuant to mandatory payment bonds, in a manner that is fair to claimants, as well as consistent and reasonably definitive as to the duration of the surety\u2019s litigation exposure <em>(see, </em>Budget Report, Bill Jacket, L 1980, ch 360 [State Finance Law \u00a7 137 (4) \u201cimpose(s) a * * * period of limitations, noncompliance with which bar(s) a claim on the payment bond]).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">There are also strong policy reasons for not reading contract clauses to interject an open durational set of events into this statute. That practice would undermine the essential purpose of the limitations period and would effectively circumvent the intent of the Legislature in this respect <em>(see generally, </em>Bill Jacket, L 1964, ch 700; Bill Jacket, L 1980, ch 360). We cannot, by adroit construction of the statute that sidesteps its purpose, as well as our guiding precedents, countenance a sympathetic escape hatch for a particular subcontractor\u2019s claim under these circumstances. That would unjustifiably damage the desirable definiteness fabric and principle of this statutory formulation. The adverse impact on the construction industry in forestalling prompt, fair resolution of disputes growing out of this vast, complicated commercial enterprise contraindicates the theory advanced by Windsor, and adopted by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Order reversed, with costs, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment denied and defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
