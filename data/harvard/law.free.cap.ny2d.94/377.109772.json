Fearing a heart attack, claimant went to a nearby hospital, where he was diagnosed with panic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>disorder. He remained hospitalized for five days, and did not return to work for several months. The issue on this appeal is whether claimant is precluded from receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the ground that his mental injury, caused by work-related stress, was a direct consequence of personnel decisions taken in good faith by his employer (see, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [7]). Because no A &amp; P personnel decision targeted claimant directly, we hold that section 2 (7) does not bar him from receiving benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Prior to his hospitalization, claimant had been employed by A &amp; P for 25 years and had managed the Goldens Bridge store for approximately two years. According to his testimony before a Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge, his panic disorder resulted from stress caused by changes in his working conditions during the preceding months. In June and July 1994, A &amp; P replaced two seasoned co-managers with two inexperienced individuals, and shortly thereafter reassigned the store\u2019s night crew to the day shift. The night crew had cleaned the store and re-stocked the shelves at a time when there were few customers. After reassignment, their work had to be completed during the day, creating pressure to unload trucks, re-stock shelves and clean the store quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Shortly after these changes were implemented, claimant began to work longer hours in order to maintain the store properly, frequently working seven days and in excess of 70 hours per week. He lost 35 pounds and had difficulty sleeping. Finally, on October 30, 1994, he went to the hospital with the symptoms described above. During claimant\u2019s absence from work, both replacement co-managers were fired for incompetence and the night crew was reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Claimant sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which A &amp; P opposed. Following claimant\u2019s testimony, a Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge disallowed the claim on the ground that claimant had failed to make out a prima facie case of compensable injury under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 (7). On administrative appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board Panel initially affirmed, but subsequently the full Board rescinded the decision and referred the case to the Panel for further consideration. In an amended decision, the Panel reversed, ruling that the exclusionary language of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 (7) did not preclude the claim. The Appellate Division affirmed, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">For purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, a mental injury is generally compensable to the same extent as a physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>cal injury <em>(see, Wolfe v Sibley, Lindsay &amp; Curr Co., </em>36 NY2d <em>505, </em>510). In 1990, however, the Legislature made a number of changes to workers\u2019 compensation, including amending Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 (7) to exclude claims for solely mental injuries that are based on work-related stress and \u201ca direct consequence of a lawful personnel decision involving a disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, demotion, or termination taken in good faith by the employer\u201d (L 1990, ch 924, \u00a7 1). Because there is no dispute that claimant\u2019s injury was solely mental and based on work-related stress, the only question for this Court to resolve is whether the injury was a direct consequence of one of the enumerated personnel decisions. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">A &amp; P argues that section 2 (7) precludes recovery because the replacement of claimant\u2019s co-managers and elimination of the night crew were lawful job transfers made in good faith. This argument is unavailing, however, as claimant\u2019s injury was not a <em>direct </em>consequence of these personnel decisions. The Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdirect consequence\u201d makes clear that the exclusionary language of section 2 (7) applies only when the personnel decision at issue is aimed at the claimant <em>(see, e.g., Dockum v Syroco, Inc., </em>260 AD2d 688, <em>Iv denied </em>93 NY2d 811 [claimant who suffered injuries from attempted suicide after he was fired barred from recovery by section 2 (7)]; Minkowitz, Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2, 1999-2000 Interim Pocket Part, at 6 [\u201can employer may engage in lawful, good faith personnel action against an employee even though <em>the employee </em>may be injured by the stress of such action since a mental stress claim is not compensable when caused by such lawful action by the employer\u201d] [emphasis added]). Here, claimant himself was not the subject of a \u201cpersonnel decision involving a disciplinary action, work evaluation, job transfer, demotion, or termination\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 2 [7]). Indeed, he was not the subject of any personnel decision at all. Although the personnel decisions made by A &amp; P regarding the store\u2019s co-managers and night crew contributed to claimant\u2019s injury, they did so only indirectly, by forcing claimant to work longer hours, take on more responsibility and manage a store that was not performing well.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Finally, although upper management criticized claimant during a number of store visits for not adequately handling the challenges presented by the changed work environment, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>is an affirmed finding with support in the record \u201cthat claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition was caused by ongoing job-related stress and not by a personnel decision which altered or threatened his job status\u201d (257 AD2d 912).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Accordingly, the decision appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Decision appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
