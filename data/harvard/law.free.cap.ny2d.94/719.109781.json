Resisting the directive, the employee filed a demand to arbitrate. The question before us is whether the employee can compel arbitration. For the reasons that follow, we hold that he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Schenectady County Correction Officer David Monroe had been receiving disability payments pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c when the County ordered him to submit to psychiatric examinations in connection with his stress-related condition. The psychiatrist who performed the evaluations concluded that Monroe could perform light duty work. On the strength of this recommendation, the County ordered Monroe to report for light duty at the Schenectady County Jail, beginning on April 20, 1998. The order described the light duty position as consisting largely of desk work.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">In letters to the County, Monroe protested the order, asserting that he was \u201cunable to return to work at the Schenectady County Jail.\u201d In support, he included letters from his psychologist and psychiatrist. Monroe\u2019s union representative also wrote to the County stating that \u201cthere seems to be a disagreement between the employee\u2019s doctor and the County\u2019s doctor on the employee\u2019s medical clearance for light duty.\u201d In response, the County stated that it had adopted a procedural format to administer employee disability benefits under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c (the 207-c Procedure), that \u201cthe proper route <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>for Mr. Monroe is to file a step 3 grievance pursuant to Article XI\u201d of that procedure, and that the grievance \u201cmust be filed within ten days of [Monroe\u2019s] receipt of the order to light duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Monroe did not file a step 3 grievance under Article XI. Instead, he filed a notice of arbitration asserting that an arbitrator should decide \u201cwhether or not David Monroe is fit for a light duty assignment as contended by the County\u2019s medical consultant * * * or whether he is not fit for light duty, as contended by Mr. Monroe\u2019s personal physician.\u201d Monroe never reported for light duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The County petitioned for a permanent stay of arbitration, arguing that Article XI of its 207-c Procedure governs disputes of this kind and that Monroe disregarded it. In sum, the County contended that Article XI provides for an administrative hearing and that there was no valid agreement or basis to ignore that procedure by submitting the issue directly to an arbitrator. Monroe filed a cross petition seeking to compel arbitration, claiming that the light duty order was immediately arbitrable under either Article VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or Article XI of the County\u2019s 207-c Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Supreme Court granted the County\u2019s petition, denied Monroe\u2019s cross petition and stayed the arbitration. It held, in essence, that a dispute as to an employee\u2019s ability to perform light duty is not arbitrable under the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law art 14), and that any attempt to subject it to arbitration is void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">At the Appellate Division, Monroe argued that public policy does not prohibit arbitration of this dispute and that without arbitration there is no adequate review of the County\u2019s determination of light duty eligibility. Rejecting this contention, the Appellate Division affirmed, holding that the power to issue a light duty order pursuant to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c (3) lies exclusively \u201cin the hands of the governmental authority\u201d and that \u201cthe legislative intent expressed was clearly not to authorize an arbitrator to make the determination.\u201d (261 AD2d 803, 805.) The Appellate Division further stated that the dispute over the issuance of the light duty order \u201cis not arbitrable by agreement of the parties in any event.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at 806.) We affirm, based solely on our conclusion that there was no agreement to submit the dispute in question directly to arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tion, because Monroe did not satisfy the conditions precedent under the 207-c Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">In <em>Matter of Board of Educ. (Watertown Educ. Assn.) </em>(93 NY2d 132), this Court addressed public sector arbitration under the Taylor Law <em>(see also, Matter of Blackburne [Governor\u2019s Off. of Empl. Relations], </em>87 NY2d 660; <em>Matter of Acting Supt. of Schools of Liverpool Cent. School Dist. [United Liverpool Faculty Assn.], </em>42 NY2d 509). We recognized that before a matter is arbitrable it must satisfy two tests: The claim must be lawfully fit for arbitration, i.e., no public policy, statutory or constitutional restriction places arbitration off-limits <em>(see also, Matter of City of Watertown v State of N. Y. Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., </em>95 NY2d 73 [decided today]). In addition, the parties must have agreed to refer the particular matter to arbitration <em>(see, Matter of Board of Educ. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], </em>93 NY2d, at 137-138, <em>supra, </em>citing <em>Matter of Acting Supt. of Schools of Liverpool Cent. School Dist. [United Liverpool Faculty Assn.], </em>42 NY2d 509, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">We need address the latter test only. Turning to the question of whether there was an agreement to arbitrate, the parties differ in their interpretations of Articles VI and XI of the County\u2019s 207-c Procedure. Monroe argues that he is entitled to arbitration under Article VI, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201cVI. LIGHT DUTY ASSIGNMENTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201cA. Light duty will consist of those duties of the employee\u2019s job class that are medically cleared for such employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">\u201cB. In the event that an employee\u2019s doctor and the County\u2019s doctor disagree on the employee\u2019s medical clearance for light duty, the following procedure shall be followed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">\u201c(1) The employee\u2019s doctor shall reference the light duty job description and then describe in detail, in writing, those elements of the light duty job description which the employee is physically unable to perform and the specific medical reasons that prohibit the employee from performing the duty or duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">\u201c(2) Only the duty or duties in dispute cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>assigned until such dispute is resolved. <em>Such dispute over said duties shall be submitted directly to arbitration\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Monroe relies heavily on subparagraph (B) (2)\u2019s reference to arbitration. The County, on the other hand, points out that arbitration comes into play under (B) (2) only when medical disagreements arise as to specific work assignments when the employee returns to light duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The County argues that because the essence of the dispute is Monroe\u2019s physical ability to return to light duty, the issue is governed not by Article VI, but by Article XI, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">\u201cXI PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF DECISIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">\u201cA. Any determination or decision of the Personnel Administrator or Sheriff pursuant to this article may be reviewed by a Medical Officer appointed by the County Manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">\u201cB. Procedure: <em>Within ten (10) days of receipt of * ** * an order to light duty </em>* * *, <em>the claimant or the union may file a Step 3 grievance regarding such decision </em>* * *. Such grievance shall be in writing and shall clearly specify the grounds thereof and be supported by all available medical documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\">\u201cC. Upon receipt of the Step 3 grievance, the County Manager shall appoint a Medical Officer and shall set a Step 3 hearing date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-12\">\u201cH. The decision of the Medical Officer may be reviewed in accordance with Article 16.3 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement [emphasis added].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">We agree with the County. Article XI sets forth a procedure to review \u201can order to light duty\u201d by allowing a claimant to file a step 3 grievance. Upon receipt of the grievance, the County Manager is obligated to appoint a Medical Officer who will conduct a hearing. An employee who is dissatisfied with the Medical Officer\u2019s determination may then seek review in accordance with Article 16.3 of the collective bargaining agreement, which provides for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">Monroe\u2019s interpretation fails to consider the context of Article VI as a whole and renders Article XI meaningless. Although the phrase \u201cclearance for light duty\u201d appears in Article VI, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>subparagraph (B), the procedures set forth in the remainder of Article VI confirm that this provision contemplates disputes over specific light duty assignments \u2014 as opposed to whether the order directing the employee to return to light duty is appropriate in the first place. Indeed, the title of Article VI, \u201cLight Duty Assignments,\u201d itself contemplates disputes <em>following </em>the employee\u2019s return to light duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The provisions of Article XI do not support Monroe\u2019s claim for arbitration. Because Monroe did not follow the step 3 grievance procedure, he did not satisfy a condition precedent for any arbitration under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> The County agreed to Article VI \u2014 entitled \u201cLight Duty Assignments\u201d\u2014 as part of its 207-c Procedure pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement with the Law Enforcement Officers Union Council 82.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
