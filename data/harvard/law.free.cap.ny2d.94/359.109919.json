The luxury-decontrol provisions of the Rent Stabilization Law require Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) to issue an order of deregulation when a tenant fails to timely respond to DHCR\u2019s income verification demand. <em>(Easley v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>1 NY2d 374; <em>38 Holding Corp. v City of New York, </em>179 AD2d 486; <em>Sullivan v Brevard Assocs., </em>66 NY2d 489; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v Lefkowitz, </em>41 NY2d 205; <em>Drinkhouse v Parka Corp., </em>3 NY2d 82; <em>Leepson v Division of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>171 Misc 2d 84, 245 AD2d 176; <em>Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669; <em>Matter of Nick v State of New York Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, Off. of Rent Admin., </em>244 AD2d 299; <em>Matter of Bazbaz v State of New York Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>246 AD2d 388; <em>Matter of Dowling v Holland, </em>245 AD2d 167.)

By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>reading a default excusal provision into the statute, the court below has improperly engaged in judicial legislation. <em>(Wait v Van Allen, </em>22 NY 318; <em>Bright Homes v Wright, </em>8 NY2d 157; <em>Nettleton Co. v Diamond, </em>27 NY2d 182; <em>Courtesy Sandwich Shop v Port of N.

DHCR\u2019s Statute of Limitations/forfeiture interpretation of the 60-day notice provision of Rent Stabilization Law \u00a7 26-504.3 is contrary to the statute\u2019s words. <em>(Matter of Ansonia Residents Assn. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>75 NY2d 206; <em>Seittelman v Sabol, </em>91 NY2d 618; <em>People v Donner, </em>106 Misc 2d 779; <em>Matter of Brusco v Braun, </em>84 NY2d 674; <em>Matter of Mennella v Lopez-Torres, </em>91 NY2d 474; <em>305 W. 18 Assocs. v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>158 AD2d 377; <em>Matter of McKinnon v Aponte, </em>196 AD2d 655.) II. DHCR\u2019s Statute of Limitations/ jurisdictional interpretation of Rent Stabilization Law \u00a7 26-504.3 (c) (1) is irrational and is not even followed by itself in practice. III.

The Legislature has approved the use of requests for reconsideration of deregulation orders in the luxury deregulation context. The clear language of the statute does not support DHCR\u2019s refusal to consider the evidence submitted by petitioner-respondent in her request for reconsideration. <em>(Matter of Mennella v Lopez-Torres, </em>91 NY2d 474; <em>Matter of Brusco v Braun, </em>84 NY2d 674.) II. DHCR had all the authority it needed to reconsider the deregulation order. Its refusal to consider the issue is arbitrary and capricious. <em>(Matter of Magnone v Halperin, </em>238 AD2d 207; <em>Matter of Cupo v McGoldrick, </em>278 App Div 108; <em>People ex rel.

We hold that DHCR has authority to accept late responses, and therefore we remit <em>Dworman </em>and <em>Sudarsky </em>to the Division for consideration of the reasons for the tenants\u2019 tardiness in providing the required information. In <em>Seymour, </em>however, we uphold DHCR\u2019s order deregulating the apartment, because DHCR did not abuse its discretion in finding that the tenant\u2019s own neglect \u2014 the reason tendered for the late filing \u2014 did not excuse her default.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>The luxury-decontrol provisions of the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1993 (L 1993, ch 253 [the Act]), amending the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 26, ch 4), ended rent stabilization for New York City apartments renting for $2,000 or more per month, if the occupants reported a combined annual adjusted gross income in excess of $250,000 for the previous two consecutive years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In order to determine which apartments qualify for deregulation, the Act sets out the following procedure:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On or before May 1 of the calendar year, the landlord sends the tenant an \u201cincome certification form\u201d (ICF), which the tenant must return to the landlord within 30 days (Rent Stabilization Law [Administrative Code] \u00a7 26-504.3 [b]). If the tenant fails to return the form, or if the landlord disputes the income amount reflected on the completed form, the landlord may then, on or before June 30, petition DHCR to verify the tenant\u2019s income <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-504.3 [c] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Within 20 days of receiving the landlord\u2019s petition, the Act continues, DHCR sends the tenant a notice of the proceeding, requiring the tenant to provide \u201csuch information as the division and the department of taxation and finance shall require to verify whether the total annual income exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars in each such year\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-504.3 [c] [1]). The notice \u201cshall require the tenant or tenants to provide the information to the division within sixty days of service,\u201d and must include \u201ca warning in bold faced type that failure to respond will result in an order being issued by the division providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this law\u201d <em>(id.). </em>If the tenant does not provide the required information, DHCR must \u201cissue, on or before December first of such year, an order providing that such housing accommodation shall not be subject to the provisions of this law upon the expiration of the current lease\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 26-504.3 [c] [3]).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Against this statutory background, we turn to the cases before us, none of which met the prescribed timetables for tenant response or agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\n<em>Dworman v DHCR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">In the first case, Leona Dworman and her husband, both retired, have not filed income tax returns since 1993. In March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>1995, Dworman\u2019s landlord sent her an IGF, which Dworman timely returned, certifying that her income was below $250,000 for the previous two tax years (1993 and 1994). The landlord filed a petition with DHCR challenging the IGF, and Dworman timely responded to DHCR\u2019s notice, stating that neither she nor her husband had sufficient income to file New York State tax returns for 1993 or 1994. More than a year later, on November 1, 1996, DHCR dismissed the landlord\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In March 1996, while the 1995 petition was still pending before DHCR, the landlord sent Dworman a second IGF. Once again, Dworman timely responded, stating that neither she nor her husband had sufficient income in the relevant tax years (1994 and 1995) to file an income tax return. In a petition received by DHCR on June 13, 1996, the landlord once again contested Dworman\u2019s certification. On August 13, 1996, DHCR sent Dworman notice of the petition and a request for verification. At that time, however, Dworman and her husband were vacationing in Europe, and they did not return until on or about October 1, 1996. Dworman sent the verification form back to DHCR on October 23, 1996 \u2014 71 days after the notice had been sent \u2014 again affirming that she had no taxable income for 1994 or 1995. Dworman alleges that she returned the form immediately after discovering it among three months of accumulated mail, which the doorman had collected for her while she was in Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On November 1, 1996, DHCR entered an order dismissing the landlord\u2019s 1995 petition. The order bore the docket number assigned to the 1995 petition (ZJF-410691-LD), but did not otherwise state that it related to the 1995 petition, rather than the 1996 petition, also pending at that time. One week later, on November 8, 1996, DHCR sent Dworman a letter requesting \u201cproof of timely filing\u201d of her answer to the 1996 petition. Like the November 1 order, however, the November 8 letter did not specify which petition it concerned, although it bore the docket number of the 1996 petition (KF-410275-LD). Confused about which petition the November 8 letter concerned, Dworman on November 11 responded that she did not understand the November 8 letter because the petition had just been dismissed. On January 6, 1997, DHCR sent Dworman a \u201cfinal request\u201d for additional information, explaining that the November 1, 1996 dismissal order applied to the 1995 petition. Dworman promptly responded that her financial condition had not changed since the previous year and that she and her husband had no income aside from Social Security. On Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ary 27, 1997, the Rent Administrator issued an order of deregulation, stating that Dworman \u201cdid not answer the owner\u2019s petition or has failed to provide certain information required to verify household income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Dworman filed a Petition for Administrative Review (PAR), which DHCR denied on October 23, 1997. The Division ruled that the Act required Dworman to respond to its notice within 60 days, that this limit was <em>\u201cstatutory </em>in nature\u201d (emphasis in original), and that it was \u201coutside the discretion and purview of DHCR to change this statutory time-limit.\u201d Thus, the Division concluded, because Dworman did not respond to its August 13, 1996 notice until October 23, 1996 \u2014 71 days later \u2014 her response was untimely, and the Division was required to issue an order of deregulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Dworman then filed the instant CPLR article 78 petition, which Supreme Court dismissed, noting that Dworman had responded to DHCR\u2019s petition \u201celeven days late.\u201d The Appellate Division reversed, holding that DHCR\u2019s ruling was arbitrary and capricious because Dworman had responded to the notice \u201ca mere 11 days late but months before DHCR\u2019s determination,\u201d Dworman\u2019s income had been \u201cverified as being below the statutory threshold,\u201d and \u201cthe landlord and DHCR suffered no prejudice from the brief delay.\u201d The Appellate Division remanded the case to DHCR for a \u201cdetermination on the merits\u201d (261 AD2d 139, 140). We granted DHCR leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>Sudarsky v DHCR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">On April 19, 1994, Peter Sudarsky\u2019s landlord sent him an ICF, advising him that he was required to return the completed form within 30 days of service. On June 9, 1994, the landlord filed a petition for deregulation with DHCR, stating that Sudarsky had failed to return the ICF. The Division sent Sudarsky a notice on August 4, 1994, informing him of the petition and stating that he was required to provide income verification information within 60 days. On January 31, 1995, the Rent Administrator issued an order of deregulation, on the grounds that Sudarsky \u201cdid not answer\u201d the petition and \u201cfailed to provide income verification information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Sudarsky filed a PAR on February 21, 1995, alleging that he had sent the income verification information to DHCR \u201cseveral weeks ago,\u201d and that he and his wife had a combined income of \u201cabout $20,000.\u201d The landlord opposed the PAR, arguing that Sudarsky had defaulted by not timely supplying the informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tion. In response, Sudarsky stated that he had returned the IGF to the landlord with a rent payment in May 1994 and that his initial answer to DHCR\u2019s notice had been mistakenly sent to the landlord \u2014 rather than DHCR \u2014 in late July 1994. In addition, Sudarsky enclosed tax returns demonstrating that the combined household income was below the statutory threshold and, in fact, that his real estate business had suffered a net loss of over $500,000. DHCR denied the PAR, ruling that Sudarsky had defaulted by failing to file a timely response. The Division rejected both of Sudarsky\u2019s explanations for his default, stating that a response filed \u201cseveral weeks\u201d before February 21, 1995 would still have been untimely, and that he could not have mistakenly mailed the response to the landlord in \u201clate July,\u201d because the notice was not mailed to him until August 4, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Sudarsky then filed the instant article 78 petition, alleging that DHCR\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious. In addition to the claims raised in his PAR, Sudarsky argued that he had not timely responded to DHCR\u2019s notice because he had been suffering from clinical depression in August 1994, and because his wife, a concert pianist, had been away on tour; he further asserted that DHCR\u2019s procedures violated the Due Process Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. Supreme Court granted the petition, holding that DHCR\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because the Division had \u201cfailed to address the issue[] of excusable default.\u201d Thus, Supreme Court remanded the case to DHCR to \u201cdetermine whether [Sudarsky\u2019s] default was justified or excusable, and if so, whether the decision terminating the rent protections should be affirmed or reversed.\u201d Finally, Supreme Court declined to determine that Sudarsky\u2019s due process rights had been violated, calling such a finding \u201cunnecessary and unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Appellate Division reversed, holding that the requirement that the tenant respond to DHCR\u2019s notice within 60 days is \u201cmandatory and explicit,\u201d and that it \u201crequire [s] deregulation of a stabilized apartment where the tenant fails to supply the requisite certification of household income within the 60-day period.\u201d Further, the Appellate Division held that Sudarsky had been provided with \u201cample notice,\u201d and agreed with DHCR\u2019s finding that Sudarsky had \u201cfailed to provide a valid excuse for the failure to timely submit the income certification form to DHCR.\u201d The Appellate Division refused to consider his \u201cbelated excuses proffered * * * before Supreme Court\u201d (258 AD2d 405, 407-408).</p>\n<p id=\"AMMT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Sudarsky appealed as of right to this Court pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1), arguing that his due process rights had been violated. We dismissed the appeal, because no substantial constitutional question was involved (see, <em>Matter of Sudarsky v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>93 NY2d 998). We granted leave to Sudarsky on the issue whether DHCR\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\n<em>Seymour v DHCR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In January 1995, Seymour\u2019s landlord sent her an IGF, which she failed to return. On April \u201927, 1995, the landlord filed a petition for deregulation, and on August 17, 1995, DHCR sent Seymour notice of the petition. Seymour did not submit income verification information to DHCR, and on December 21, 1995 the Rent Administrator issued a default order of deregulation. On January 24, 1996, Seymour filed a PAR, providing tax returns demonstrating that her household income fell below the statutory threshold. Seymour acknowledged that she had received the notice sent by the Division in August 1994 but had \u201cneglected to mail it.\u201d She asked that the default order be vacated because her default was not willful and because of the \u201cstrong policy of this state that matters be decided on their merits.\u201d On July 23, 1997, DHCR denied the PAR, holding that \u201c[ijnadvertent neglect does not excuse the tenant\u2019s failure to file an Answer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Seymour then filed the instant article 78 proceeding, alleging that DHCR\u2019s refusal to vacate its default order was arbitrary and capricious and denied her due process of law. Supreme Court held that DHCR had the discretion to review Seymour\u2019s late submission and vacate the default, and remitted the case to the Division to reconsider its order in light of Seymour\u2019s belated submissions. The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that DHCR\u2019s decision not to reconsider its default order was \u201carbitrary and capricious given the tenant\u2019s compelling proof of household income well below the * * * statutory threshold\u201d (261 AD2d 176). This Court granted leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Clearly the Act intends for tenants to provide income verification information to DHCR within 60 days after the Division serves notice of the landlord\u2019s petition to deregulate: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Act states that the notification \u201cshall require the tenant or tenants to provide the information to the division within sixty days of service\u201d (Rent Stabilization Law [Administrative Code] \u00a7 26-504.3 [c] [1]). And clearly the Act gives DHCR authority to issue an order of deregulation if at least 60 days have passed and the tenant has not responded: the Act states that DHCR \u201cshall issue\u201d an order of deregulation \u201c[i]n the event that the tenant or tenants fail to provide the information required pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision\u201d <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 26-504.3 [c] [3]). What remains at issue is whether the Division <em>must </em>issue an order of deregulation if the tenant responds after expiration of the 24th hour of the 60th day, or whether the agency has discretion to accept a late filing. For the reasons that follow, we reject the Division\u2019s contention that, under the statute, the hammer necessarily and invariably falls at 12:01 a.m. on the 61st day.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">At the outset, we owe little deference to DHCR\u2019s own interpretation of the 60-day provision in this matter of statutory construction. To be sure, where the interpretation of a statute involves specialized \u201cknowledge and understanding of underlying operational practices or entails an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be drawn therefrom,\u201d the courts should defer to the administrative agency\u2019s interpretation unless irrational or unreasonable <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459; <em>see also, Matter of Union Indem. Ins. Co., </em>92 NY2d 107, 114-115; <em>Matter of Rosen v Public Empl. Relations Bd., </em>72 NY2d 42, 47-48). By contrast, where, as here, the question is one of pure statutory interpretation \u201cdependent only on accurate apprehension of legislative intent, there is little basis to rely on any special competence or expertise of the administrative agency and its interpretive regulations are therefore to be accorded much less weight\u201d <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>49 NY2d, at 459).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In the instant cases, as well as others decided today <em>(see, Matter of Elkin v Roldan, </em>94 NY2d 853; <em>Matter of Shapiro v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>94 NY2d 853; <em>Pledge v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal, </em>94 NY2d 851), DHCR urges that Administrative Code \u00a7 26-504.3 (c) (1) and (c) (3), by their terms, permit no exceptions where a tenant fails to send income verification information to the Division within 60 days of service of the notice. This, however, is not a correct reading of the unambiguous statutory language. While subdivision (c) (1) indeed requires the tenant to return the information \u201cwithin sixty days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>service,\u201d it does not divest the Division of authority to forgive a late filing or excusable default in the sound exercise of its discretion. Notably, subdivision (c) (3) requires the Division to enter an order of deregulation only if \u201cthe tenant or tenants <em>fail to provide the information\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Significantly, the statute does not \u2014 as DHCR contends \u2014 state that such an order must be issued if the tenant does not respond within 60 days. Rather, the implication is that an order must be issued only if the tenant fails to respond at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The legislative history additionally supports the interpretation that DHCR has discretion to review a case on the merits despite justifiable tenant tardiness. The Introducer\u2019s Memorandum in Support of the Act states that if the tenant fails to return the ICF to the landlord, the Division of \u201cTaxation and Finance is required by this bill to verify whether the income threshold * * * is exceeded and to advise DHCR of its findings\u201d (Bill Jacket, L 1993, ch 253, Introducer\u2019s Mem in Support, at 3). This indicates that, within the framework set by the statute, the Legislature intended for deregulation proceedings to be decided on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Further, while DHCR reads the Act to require invariant application of the 60-day rule to tenants, the Division apparently shows little regard for the equally precise deadlines the statute imposes on it. Subdivision (c) (1), for instance, requires DHCR to notify tenants within 20 days after the landlord has filed a petition for deregulation. In the cases at hand, however, DHCR waited nearly four months before notifying Seymour, and two months before notifying either Dworman or Sudarsky. In addition, subdivision (c) (3) requires DHCR to enter a deregulation order by December 1 if the tenant has not responded to the notice. Here, however, the Rent Administrator did not enter the deregulation orders until February 27 in <em>Dworman, </em>January 31 in <em>Sudarsky </em>and December 21 in <em>Seymour. </em>Indeed, DHCR took so long \u2014 more than a year \u2014 to decide Dworman\u2019s 1995 case that she was confused as to whether the Division\u2019s November 8, 1996 letter applied to her landlord\u2019s 1995, or 1996, petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">To be sure, DHCR\u2019s delay in sending the notifications did not deprive it of jurisdiction over the proceedings, nor is there any allegation that the delay was so unreasonable as to constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting judicial intervention <em>(see, Matter of Cortlandt Nursing Home v Axelrod, </em>66 NY2d 169, 180 [judicial intervention for excessive delay in adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>trative proceeding is warranted only under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d], <em>cert denied </em>476 US 1115; <em>Matter of Geary v Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>59 NY2d 950, 952 [excessive delay would at most amount to legal error and would not divest agency of jurisdiction]; <em>see also, </em>State Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 301 [1] [\u201cIn an adjudicatory proceeding, all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing within reasonable time\u201d]). However, DHCR\u2019s view of its own deadlines as merely \u201cadvisory\u201d weakens its argument that, by mandate of the statute, a tenant\u2019s tardiness in complying with deadlines imposed under the same enactment can never, under any circumstances, be forgiven.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Nor do <em>Matter of Mennella v Lopez-Torres </em>(91 NY2d 474) and <em>Matter of Brusco v Braun </em>(84 NY2d 674) support DHCR\u2019s interpretation of the Act. In those cases, we held that RPAPL 732 (3), which requires the court to enter a default judgment in an eviction proceeding for nonpayment of rent if the tenant \u201cfails to answer within five days from the date of service,\u201d must be strictly enforced. Unlike the statute at issue, however, RPAPL 732 (3) explicitly states that a default must be entered if the tenant \u201cfails to answer within five days.\u201d Moreover, we noted in <em>Mennella </em>that despite the unequivocal language of the statute, the trial court may nonetheless retain \u201cthe power to stay execution of the warrant of eviction for particularized good cause\u201d <em>(Matter of Mennella v Lopez-Torres, supra, </em>at 480).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Significantly, the Rent Stabilization Code states that DHCR may, at \u201cany stage of a proceeding * * * for good cause shown, except where prohibited by the RSL, accept for filing any papers, even though not filed within the time required by this Code\u201d (9 NYCRR 2527.5 [d]; see <em>also, </em>9 NYCRR 2507.5 [d]; 9 NYCRR 2210.1 [unless it conflicts with the statute, the Rent Stabilization Code applies to all proceedings under the Rent Stabilization Law]). Since Administrative Code \u00a7 26-504.3 does not prohibit DHCR from accepting late filings, it may exercise its discretion under the Code to accept late filings when good cause is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Further, Code sections 2507.5 (d) and 2527.5 (d) permit DHCR to accept late filings for good cause shown at \u201cany stage of a proceeding\u201d \u2014 that is, at any point before the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>sioner has entered a final order dismissing the PAR <em>(see, Matter of Magnone v Halperin, </em>238 AD2d 207 [\u201ca final decision was not rendered until the resolution of the tenant\u2019s petition for administrative review\u201d]; <em>see also, </em>9 NYCRR 2529.8 <em>et seq. </em>[regulations governing \u201c(f)inal determination\u201d by the Commissioner]). Of course, a tenant who waits to supply the required information until an order of deregulation has been entered faces a far heavier burden in establishing good cause for the delay. Nevertheless, where good cause is shown, DHCR has the discretion to permit a late filing either before or after the Rent Administrator has issued a deregulation order, until the Commissioner has taken final action.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We underscore that DHCR may reasonably interpret \u201cgood cause\u201d to mean more than \u201cany cause.\u201d By fixing timetables for income verification and deregulation, the Legislature made plain its desire that these proceedings not languish but that they be conducted, and resolved, expeditiously. While ameliorating undue severity, DHCR\u2019s discretion to excuse a default should not be viewed as an invitation to ignore filing deadlines or as a prescription for laxity. DHCR is within its discretion to hold that a tenant who does not demonstrate good cause is simply not entitled to relief <em>(cf., Matter of Fruci [Commissioner of Labor], </em>260 AD2d 831, 832 [declining to vacate default where claimant failed to show that Board \u201cabused its discretion in denying claimant\u2019s application to reopen the default decision\u201d]). However, where a tenant does demonstrate good cause for failing to submit the required information within 60 days, DHCR may accept the late filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Turning to the cases at hand, we remit <em>Dworman </em>and <em>Sudarsky </em>to DHCR so that the agency may evaluate them under the good cause standard. Dworman alleges what might, or might not, amount to good cause: she claims that her response was 11 days late because she was in Europe for three months and did not see the notice until after the deadline had expired. In denying Dworman\u2019s PAR, DHCR held that the 60-day time limit was <em>\u201cstatutory\u201d </em>in nature and that it was \u201coutside the discretion and purview of DHCR\u201d to alter it. Although the Commissioner commented in passing that Dworman had not provided a \u201csufficient explanation for the late filing,\u201d the analysis is otherwise devoted \u2014 in its entirety \u2014 to asserting that the 60-day limit is inflexible and insurmountable. Significantly, in its several communications with Dworman, DHCR never asked her to provide an \u201cexplanation\u201d for her late filing; rather, it asked only for proof that her response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>had in fact been timely filed. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to remit the case to DHCR for reconsideration under the proper standard. Further, on remittal, DHCR may consider, in its discretion, whether the 11-day delay was so minimal as to be excusable under the maxim of <em>de minimis non curat lex (cf., Van Clief v Van Vechten, </em>130 NY 571, 579; <em>Flora Co. v Ingilis, </em>233 AD2d 418, 419).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Similarly, Sudarsky alleged what might possibly be good cause: he claimed that he mistakenly sent the information to the landlord rather than to DHCR. Contrary to DHCR\u2019s holding, the fact that he recalled having sent the information in late July 1994 (rather than early August when the notice was mailed) did not necessarily defeat his claim \u2014 his recollection of the dates might simply have been off by a few days. Thus, we remit <em>Sudarsky </em>as well to DHCR for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In <em>Seymour, </em>however, the Appellate Division erred in remitting the matter to DHCR; the order deregulating Seymour\u2019s apartment should not be disturbed. In denying Seymour\u2019s PAR, DHCR did not apply the wrong standard: it did not assert that it could never forgive violations of the 60-day deadline. Rather, the Division found that Seymour\u2019s \u201c[i]nadvertent neglect\u201d\u2014 concededly the cause of her delay \u2014 did not excuse her default. DHCR was within its discretion to conclude that, absent any allegation of good cause, the policy of deciding cases on their merits does not override the statutory mandate that information be provided expeditiously. Nor can Seymour\u2019s five-month delay fairly be characterized as de minimis. Thus, we cannot say that the Division abused its discretion in denying Seymour\u2019s PAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division\u2019s order in <em>Dworman </em>should be modified, without costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court with instructions to remand to DHCR for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, and, as so modified, affirmed; the Appellate Division\u2019s order in <em>Sudarsky </em>should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court with instructions to remand to DHCR for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; and the Appellate Division\u2019s order in <em>Seymour </em>should be reversed, with costs, and the petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">In <em>Matter of Dworman v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal: </em>Order modified, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>In <em>Matter of Seymour v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>Matter of Sudarsky v New York State Div. of Hous. &amp; Community Renewal: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\">.

DHCR acknowledges that a late response would be accepted if, for instance, a tenant was incapacitated and thus unable to respond within 60 days.
