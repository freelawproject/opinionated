We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">As presented at both trials, the case against defendant rested on testimony that defendant and an accomplice, armed with a gun, robbed a driver of his car and some personal property. The police were summoned, gave chase and found defendant hiding under a van, after he and the accomplice had fled the stolen car on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Prior to the first trial, Justice James Leff conducted a <em>Sandoval </em>hearing to determine the extent to which the prosecutor would be able to cross-examine defendant. His criminal record contained some 12 dispositions extending over an 11-year period. The oldest was defendant\u2019s youthful offender adjudication based on a third degree criminal possession of an automatic pistol. Defendant also had eight misdemeanor convictions: six for drug possession, one for criminal facilitation and one for unauthorized use of a vehicle. In addition, he had been convicted of three felonies: fifth degree sale of a controlled substance, third degree weapons possession and third degree attempted sale of a controlled substance. Justice Leff precluded the People from asking defendant about anything in his criminal past. Defendant testified at trial. After the jury could not agree on a verdict, Justice Leff ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">At the outset of defendant\u2019s retrial before Justice Nicholas Figueroa, defendant argued that Justice LefFs <em>Sandoval </em>ruling was binding on the court as the \u201claw of the case.\u201d Concluding that he was not bound by the prior <em>Sandoval </em>ruling, Justice Figueroa exercised his discretion by allowing the prosecution to ask defendant \u2014 were he to testify \u2014 whether he had been convicted of three felonies (including the underlying acts of one, involving a drug sale) and a misdemeanor. The court prohibited cross-examination as to the rest. Defendant did not testify at the second trial. The jury found him guilty of robbery in the first degree, robbery in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. The Appellate Division affirmed his conviction and a Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Defendant does not contend that Justice Figueroa\u2019s <em>Sandoval </em>ruling was erroneous on its merits. Put differently, he does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>not claim that Justice Figueroa abused his discretion by allowing the prosecutor to cross-examine defendant as to the four convictions. Rather, he asserts that the \u201claw of the case\u201d operated to bar Justice Figueroa from making a second <em>Sandoval </em>ruling at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The law of the case doctrine is part of a larger family of kindred concepts, which includes res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These doctrines, broadly speaking, are designed to limit relitigation of issues. Like claim preclusion and issue preclusion, preclusion under the law of the case contemplates that the parties had a \u201cfull and fair\u201d opportunity to litigate the initial determination <em>(see, Arizona v California, </em>460 US 605, 619; <em>People v Guerra, </em>65 NY2d 60, 63; <em>Sales v State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>902 F2d 933, 936 [11th Cir 1990]).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">As distinguished from issue preclusion and claim preclusion, however, law of the case addresses the potentially preclusive effect of judicial determinations made in the course of a single litigation <em>before </em>final judgment <em>(Matter of McGrath v Gold, </em>36 NY2d 406, 413; <em>Walker v Gerli, </em>257 App Div 249, 251; <em>see generally, </em>Steinman, <em>Law of the Case: A Judicial Puzzle in Consolidated and Transferred Cases and in Multidistrict Litigation, </em>135 U Pa L Rev 595 [1987]; 18 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4478). Res judicata and collateral estoppel generally deal with preclusion after judgment: res judicata precludes a party from asserting a <em>claim </em>that was litigated in a prior action <em>(see, Parker v Blauvelt Volunteer Fire Co., </em>93 NY2d 343, 347), while collateral estoppel precludes relitigating an <em>issue </em>decided in a prior action <em>(see, Continental Cas. Co. v Rapid-American Corp., </em>80 NY2d 640, 649). Accordingly, law of the case has been aptly characterized as \u201ca kind of intra-action res judicata\u201d (Siegel, New York Practice \u00a7 448, at 723 [3d ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Res judicata and collateral estoppel are rules of limitation recognized in the CPLR. Indeed, in a civil proceeding a party is entitled, by statute, to a dismissal based on issue preclusion or claim preclusion <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3211 [a] [5]), both of which are also designated as affirmative defenses <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3018 [b]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrastingly, the law of the case doctrine is found in no New York statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Beyond these procedural differences, law of the case rests on a foundation that further distinguishes it from issue and claim preclusion. Whereas the latter concepts are rigid rules of limitation, law of the case is a judicially crafted policy that \u201cexpresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, [and is] not a limit to their power\u201d <em>(Messenger v Anderson, </em>225 US 436, 444). As such, law of the case is necessarily \u201camorphous\u201d in that it \u201cdirects a court\u2019s discretion,\u201d but does not restrict its authority <em>(see, Arizona v California, </em>460 US, at 618, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Over the years, the phrase \u201claw of the case\u201d has appeared at various times in New York decisional law, but it has not always meant the same thing <em>(see, </em>Black, Judicial Precedents or Science of Case Law [1912]). While this Court has used the term to connote a preclusive type doctrine <em>(e.g., Booth v Bunce, </em>31 NY 246, 250; <em>People ex rel. Davis v Sturtevant, </em>9 NY 263, 267), it has also been used colloquially <em>(e.g., Sanford v Eighth Ave. R. R. Co., </em>23 NY 343, 346; <em>Belmont v Coleman, </em>21 NY 96, 100). For a time, the phrase described jury charges to which no objection was taken <em>(e.g., People v Lobel, </em>298 NY 243, 254; <em>Brown v Du Frey, </em>1 NY2d 190, 195). As this Court observed in <em>Martin v City of Cohoes </em>(37 NY2d 162, 165), that usage is no longer current, in part because the Appellate Division is free, in the interest of justice, to review unpreserved error <em>(see also, </em>12 Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac \u00b6 5501.11).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The term \u201claw of the case\u201d is also used, often in Federal court decisions, to describe the doctrine requiring a lower court, on remand, to follow the mandate of the higher court <em>(see, e.g., Prisco v A &amp; D Carting Corp., </em>168 F3d 593, 607, n 10; <em>Day v Moscow, </em>955 F2d 807, 812, <em>cert denied </em>506 US 821). In that setting, there is no discretion involved; the lower court must apply the rule laid down by the appellate court (18 Solum, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 134.23 [1] [a], at 134-58 [3d ed]).* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although we too have employed the term in that way <em>(e.g., Preston Corp. v Fabrication Enters., </em>68 NY2d 397, 405), we now refer to it primarily in the manner raised on this appeal \u2014 as a concept regulating pre-judgment rulings made by courts of coordinate jurisdiction in a single litigation <em>(Martin v City of Co-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>hoes, </em>37 NY2d 162, 165, <em>supra; Matter of McGrath v Gold, </em>36 NY2d 406, 413, <em>supra; see also, United States v Todd, 920 F2d 399 </em>[6th Cir]; <em>United States v Williams, </em>728 F2d 1402 [11th Cir]; <em>United States v Riley, </em>684 F2d 542 [8th Cir], <em>cert denied </em>459 US 1111).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We agree with defendant insofar as he asserts that the law of the case doctrine is designed to eliminate the inefficiency and disorder that would follow if courts of coordinate jurisdiction were free to overrule one another in an ongoing case. This Court recognized as much in <em>Matter of Dondi v Jones </em>(40 NY2d 8, 15), when it cautioned that \u201ca court should not ordinarily reconsider, disturb or overrule an order in the same action of another court of co-ordinate jurisdiction\u201d <em>(see also, Martin v City of Cohoes, </em>37 NY2d, at 165, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Although the vast majority of law of the case jurisprudence arises in civil cases, defendant also correctly argues that the concept is appropriate in criminal cases as well <em>(e.g., People v Nieves, </em>67 NY2d 125, 137; <em>People v Malizia, </em>62 NY2d 755, 758; <em>People v Leon, 264 </em>AD2d 784 [barring reconsideration of a request for a <em>Mapp </em>hearing]; <em>People v Rodriguez, </em>244 AD2d 364 [barring reconsideration of motion to dismiss indictment], <em>Iv denied </em>91 NY2d 896; <em>People v Johnson, </em>131 AD2d 696 [same]; <em>People v Guin, </em>243 AD2d 649, <em>Iv denied </em>91 NY2d 834 [barring reinspection of Grand Jury minutes]; <em>People v Broome, </em>151 AD2d 995 [barring <em>Wade </em>hearing redetermination]).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Law of the case, however, does not contemplate that every trial ruling is binding on retrial. By asserting that the successor Judge had no discretion but to adhere fully to the earlier <em>Sandoval </em>ruling, defendant, in effect, seeks inappropriately to impose the strict, legal application of claim and issue preclusion on the more flexible doctrine of law of the case. If that were so, a Judge conducting a retrial would be corseted by each of the previous Judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including those, for example, dealing with leading questions, or the manner in which an exhibit is marked or shown to a jury or some other discretionary call. Obviously, distinctions must be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Although this Court\u2019s precedents on the law of the case in the usage before us are sparse, there are two cases in which the issue is touched upon, and they point the way to our determination. Between them, they establish that an \u201cevidentiary\u201d type ruling will normally not be binding in a subsequent trial <em>(see, People v Malizia, </em>62 NY2d 755, 758, <em>supra), </em>whereas an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>order following a suppression motion made pursuant to CPL article 710 ordinarily will be <em>(see, People v Nieves, </em>67 NY2d 125, 137, n 5, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Because the nature of the prior ruling is a pivotal concern in determining whether the successor Judge is constrained by the law of the case, we next consider the function and purpose of a <em>Sandoval </em>motion. Defendant contends that <em>Sandoval </em>contemplates a pre-trial determination akin to a motion to suppress evidence. Citing <em>People v Nieves </em>(67 NY2d, at 137, n 5, <em>supra), </em>he asserts that the import of a <em>Sandoval </em>ruling \u2014 the admissibility or preclusion of impeachment material \u2014 is closely likened to the exclusion of evidence under CPL article 710. It follows, he argues, that the successor Judge was bound by the earlier <em>Sandoval </em>ruling and stripped of the discretion to revisit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Relying on <em>People v Malizia </em>(62 NY2d, at 758, <em>supra), </em>the prosecution counters that a <em>Sandoval </em>determination is essentially an evidentiary ruling that does not normally bind a successor Judge. We agree with the People. In its form, a <em>Sandoval </em>ruling may resemble an article 710 suppression procedure insofar as it contemplates a pre-trial admissibility \u201chearing.\u201d But the resemblance ends there. The nature and content of the two determinations are vastly different. Unlike a <em>Sandoval </em>determination, the CPL article 710 suppression procedure involves an adjudication based on mixed questions of law and fact <em>(see, People v Harrison, </em>57 NY2d 470; <em>People v McRay, </em>51 NY2d 594). The suppression court must make findings of fact, often requiring it to assess the credibility of witnesses. It must then render its conclusions of law and the reasons for its determination, all of which must be set forth on the record (CPL 710.60 [6]) as a basis for an order (CPL 710.70). By way of contrast, <em>Sandoval </em>deals with the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion in controlling cross-examination and impeachment \u2014 subjects of classical evidentiary character <em>(see generally, People v Chapleau, </em>121 NY 266, 276; former Penal Law \u00a7 2444; former Penal Code \u00a7 714). As such, a successor Judge examining an earlier discretionary ruling is in a position different from one who would revisit a prior determination of law or finding of fact. This distinction compels our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">That <em>Sandoval </em>determinations are typically made before trial does not change their character as evidentiary rulings based on discretion. The timing is not controlling; the determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>nation is still a \u201ctrial ruling,\u201d even though, for purposes of fairness and convenience, it is made before trial <em>(People v Nieves, </em>at 136, <em>supra). </em>Moreover, the character of a <em>Sandoval </em>ruling is revealed in the language of the case itself. Citing <em>People v Schwartzman </em>(24 NY2d 241) for the proposition that \u201cthe nature and extent of cross-examination have always been subject to the sound discretion of the Trial Judge,\u201d the <em>Sandoval </em>Court specifically refrained from laying down \u201cprecise guidelines,\u201d considering that the determination is one of <em>\u201cad hoc </em>discretion\u201d <em>(People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371, 374, 376).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Justice Leff, acting solely in the exercise of his discretion, precluded the prosecution from any cross-examination as to defendant\u2019s criminal past. Justice Figueroa could have adhered to Justice Leifs ruling. Concluding correctly that the doctrine of the law of the case did not bind him, he was free to exercise his discretion in deciding whether to revisit the issue, or to defer to the earlier, discretionary ruling of Justice Leif. In all, there is no basis to identify an abuse of discretion on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Wesley concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">.
