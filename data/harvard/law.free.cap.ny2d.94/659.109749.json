We conclude that, in these circumstances, indemnification is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Plaintiff, Nicholas Biondi, is the former president of the board of directors of defendant Beekman Hill House Apartment Corporation. In 1995, Simone Demou, a shareholder of Beekman, informed Biondi that she intended to sublease her apartment to Gregory and Shannon Broome, a financially eligible couple. Biondi assured Demou that he would meet with Gregory Broome and that, in keeping with the usual practice, a full board interview would not be required. Nevertheless, after Biondi\u2019s meeting with Gregory Broome, Beekman\u2019s manag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ing agent advised the Broomes that a full board meeting was necessary. Prior to that meeting, Biondi informed another board member that Gregory Broome was African-American, and told yet another board member that he felt \u201cuneasy\u201d about him. The board unanimously denied the Broomes\u2019 application and issued a notice of default against Demou for \u201cobjectionable conduct\u201d arising from her accusations of racism against Biondi and the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">On January 30, 1996, Biondi, represented by Beekman\u2019s counsel, commenced a defamation action against Demou in Supreme Court. On February 2, 1996, the Broomes filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that Beekman and its directors (the Beekman defendants), including Biondi, violated various State and Federal civil rights laws by denying their sublease application based on Gregory Broome\u2019s race. The Beekman defendants counterclaimed against the Broomes and brought a third-party action against Demou for injurious falsehoods. Demou removed Biondi\u2019s defamation action to Federal court, consolidated it with the Broomes\u2019 Federal action and asserted counterclaims against the Beekman defendants for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">After trial, the jury found that the Beekman defendants, including Biondi both personally and in his official capacity, violated the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982) and New York Human Rights Law (Executive Law \u00a7 296 [5]). The jury awarded the Broomes $230,000 in compensatory damages and $410,000 in punitive damages, $125,000 of which was assessed individually against Biondi. As to Demou, the jury found that Biondi and the Beekman defendants violated her rights under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the New York Human Rights Law, breached their fiduciary duties to her and tortiously interfered with her sublease agreement with the Broomes. The jury awarded Demou a total of $107,000 in compensatory damages and $57,000 in punitive damages, $29,000 of which was assessed individually against Biondi.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Following the verdict, the Beekman defendants moved, in part, for a new trial. In denying the motion, the Federal District Court concluded that: (1) the evidence supporting Demou\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim established that \u201cthe Beekman Board members acted in bad faith and with a purpose that was not in the best interests of the cooperative\u201d; and (2) the evidence established that the Beekman defendants acted \u201cwillfully or maliciously when they rejected the Broomes\u2019 sublet application * * * and retaliated against Demou for trying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>oppose the Board\u2019s actions\u201d <em>(Broome v Biondi, </em>17 F Supp 2d 211, 220, 228 [SD NY]). Biondi and the Beekman defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. At a settlement conference, Biondi and Beekman\u2019s directors agreed to limit their liability to their respective punitive damage awards. After Biondi failed to comply with the settlement, a second conference ensued, at which the parties agreed to reduce Biondi\u2019s punitive damage contribution to $124,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Biondi subsequently sued Beekman for indemnification under article VII of its by-laws, and Beekman moved to dismiss Biondi\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211. Supreme Court denied Beekman\u2019s motion. It held that Beekman\u2019s by-laws authorized indemnification for directors who act in good faith, and the \u201cmere fact\u201d that the Federal jury found Biondi liable for violating the Broomes\u2019 civil rights was not \u201cdispositive\u201d of that issue. It further held that the public policy prohibition against indemnification for punitive damages did not apply because the settlement agreement did not clearly identify Biondi\u2019s damages as punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The Appellate Division unanimously reversed and dismissed the complaint. The Court held that Biondi\u2019s settlement agreement limited his liability to punitive damages and that indemnification for punitive damages is prohibited by public policy. The Court also held that Business Corporation Law \u00a7 721 barred indemnification, where the jury in the underlying action found that Biondi had acted in bad faith toward the Broomes and Demou. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Under the facts of this case, Biondi cannot obtain indemnification for the punitive damages imposed for his acts of bad faith against Beekman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the context of insurance indemnification, \u201cthe rule to be applied with respect to a punitive damage award made in a Civil Rights Act action is that coverage is proscribed as a matter of public policy\u201d <em>(Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v Village of Hempstead, </em>48 NY2d 218, 228). Indemnification \u201cdefeats the purpose of punitive damages, which is to punish and deter others from acting similarly\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 226; <em>see, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Zurich Ins. v Shearson Lehman Hutton, </em>84 NY2d 309, 316; <em>Home Ins. Co. v American Home Prods. Corp., </em>75 NY2d 196, 200).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">So too, Beekman should not bear the burden of indemnifying its director for punitive damages imposed for acts of bad faith. Biondi\u2019s racial discrimination against the Broomes and retaliation against Demon is precisely the type of conduct for which public policy should preclude indemnification. The jury in the Federal action found that Biondi willfully violated the Broomes\u2019 and Demou\u2019s civil rights, and it imposed personal liability on Biondi. Indeed, the punitive damages assessed against Biondi were greater than those against any other director, confirming that Biondi was singled out for punishment. To allow Biondi now to shift that penalty to Beekman would eviscerate the deterrent effect of punitive damages, and \u201cviolate the \u2018fundamental principle that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong\u2019 \u201d <em>(Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co. v Goldfarb, </em>53 NY2d 392, 400, quoting <em>Messersmith v American Fid. Co., </em>232 NY 161, 165).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Although Biondi acknowledges that public policy prohibits insurer indemnification for punitive damages, he argues that the prohibition does not apply to this case because, unlike New York\u2019s Insurance Law, the Business Corporation Law evinces a clear legislative policy of indemnifying corporate directors who act in good faith. While we recognize that \u201cour determination of public policy * * * is limited by [existing] statutes\u201d <em>(Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v Village of Hempstead, supra, </em>48 NY2d, at 225), we conclude that neither the Business Corporation Law nor Beekman\u2019s by-laws entitle Biondi to indemnification, where the underlying judgment establishes that he acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Business Corporation Law \u00a7 722 (a) and (c) allow corporations to indemnify directors against third-party actions and derivative suits, respectively. Section 722 (a) permits indemnification against judgments, fines, settlement payments and reasonable litigation expenses, while section 722 (c) limits indemnification to settlement payments and litigation expenses. In both cases, the standard of conduct is the same: a corporation may indemnify a director who acts \u201cin good faith, <em>for a purpose which he reasonably believed to be in * * * the best interests of the </em>corporation\u201d (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 722 [a], [c] [emphasis added]). Termination of an action by a judgment or settlement does not, by itself, \u201ccreate a presumption\u201d that the standard of conduct has not been satisfied (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 722 [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Business Corporation Law former \u00a7 721 previously made these statutory indemnification provisions exclusive. However, in 1986, in an attempt to \u201cattract\u201d capable officers and directors, the Legislature amended section 721 to expand indemnification to include any additional rights conferred by a corporation in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws, provided that \u201cno indemnification may be made to or on behalf of any director or officer <em>if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the director or officer establishes that his acts were committed in bad faith </em>or were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated\u201d (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 721 [emphasis added]; Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1986, ch 513, \u00a7 1, at 9, reprinted in 1986 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 3171-3172).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">While section 721\u2019s nonexclusivity language <em>broadens </em>the scope of indemnification, its \u201cbad faith\u201d standard manifests a public policy limitation on indemnification <em>(see, </em>Business Corporation Law former \u00a7 721 [Joint Legis Comm to Study Revision of Corporation Laws, Explanatory Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1961, ch 855, at 266]; Note, Rosh, <em>New York's Response to Director and Officer Liability Crisis: A Need to Reexamine the Importance of D &amp; O Insurance, </em>54 Brook L Rev 1305, 1323, 1325 [1989]; <em>cf., Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v Village of Hemp-stead, supra, </em>48 NY2d, at 225 [\u201cgood faith\u201d language in General Municipal Law \u00a7 52, which authorizes a municipality to purchase liability insurance, suggests that the \u201cLegislature did not contemplate insurance against punitive damages\u201d]; <em>Waltuch v Conticommodity Servs., </em>88 F3d 87, 90-91 [2d Cir 1996] [recognizing public policy restrictions on indemnification under Delaware\u2019s analogous nonexclusivity provision]). That limitation is reflected in the statutory indemnification provisions, as well as Beekman\u2019s by-laws, both of which restrict indemnification to acts of \u201cgood faith\u201d that are \u201creasonably believed to be in * * * the best interests of the corporation\u201d (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 722 [a], [c]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>With this background, we consider whether the adverse Federal judgment establishing Biondi\u2019s bad faith toward the Broomes and Demou precludes indemnification under Business Corporation Law \u00a7 721. Relying on section 722, Biondi argues that the Federal jury\u2019s finding of bad faith is not dispositive of his actions toward Beekman, and that he is entitled to prove that he acted in Beekman\u2019s interest. Beekman counters that a finding of bad faith toward a third party is, by itself, sufficient to bar indemnification under Business Corporation Law \u00a7 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Reading sections 721 and 722 together and applying them harmoniously and consistently as we are required to do (McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 221), we hold that the key to indemnification is a director\u2019s good faith <em>toward the corporation </em>and that a judgment against the director, standing alone, may not be dispositive of whether the director acted in good faith <em>(see, </em>Business Corporation Law \u00a7\u00a7 721, 722 [a], [b]; <em>see also, Titley v Amerford Intl. Corp., </em>249 AD2d 380, 381; <em>cf., Waltuch v Conticommodity Seros., supra, </em>88 F3d, at 95 [no indemnification under Delaware law for directors who fail to act in \u201cgood faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in * * * the best interest of the corporation\u201d (internal quotations omitted)]). However, we conclude, as a matter of law, that in this case it <em>is </em>dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Based on the entire record before us, nothing in Biondi\u2019s conduct can be construed as being undertaken in good faith, for a purpose \u201creasonably believed\u201d to be in the best interests of Beekman. By intentionally denying the Broomes\u2019 sublease application on the basis of race, Biondi knowingly exposed Beekman to liability under the civil rights laws. Indeed, a Beekman board member warned Biondi that if he felt \u201cuneasy because Mr. Broome is black, we will be sued.\u201d Biondi\u2019s willful racial discrimination cannot be considered an act in the corporation\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Nor was it in Beekman\u2019s best interest for Biondi to breach his fiduciary duty to Demou, Beekman\u2019s shareholder. The Federal District Court in the underlying action instructed the jury that if it found that \u201cthe Board members made determinations in bad faith and with a purpose that was not in the best interest of all the people they represent, then you must find-that the Board breached its fiduciary duty\u201d to Demou. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>found that Biondi, acting in bad faith, breached his fiduciary-duty to Demou. That finding was later upheld by the District Court, which denied Biondi\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that \u201cthe jury could reasonably find that the Beekman Board members acted in <em>bad faith and with a purpose that was not in the best interests of the </em>cooperative\u201d <em>(Broome v Biondi, supra, </em>17 F Supp 2d, at 220 [emphasis added]). Because the underlying Federal judgment establishes that Biondi\u2019s acts were committed in bad faith, Biondi is not entitled to indemnification and cannot relitigate the good faith versus bad faith issue here (Business Corporation Law \u00a7 721).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Levine, Wesley and Rosenblatt concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\">. We agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s interpretation of the settlement agreement. The amount next to each director\u2019s name in the agreement corresponded to the amount of punitive damages awarded, and Biondi failed to submit proof disputing that amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. Article VII of Beekman\u2019s by-laws provides, in pertinent part: <em>\u201cTo the extent allowed hy law, </em>the Corporation shall also indemnify any person, made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding * * * whether civil or criminal, including an action by or in the right of any other corporation, domestic or foreign, which he served in any capacity at the request of the Corporation by reason of the fact that he * * * was a director or officer of the Corporation or served it in any capacity against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees * * * <em>if such director or officer acted in good faith, for a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>purpose which he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation </em>and, in criminal actions or proceedings, in addition, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
