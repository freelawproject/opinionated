The court below erroneously found the challenged rezoning to be constitutional when it unconstitutionally takes plaintiffs property without just compensation. <em>(Nollan v California Coastal Commn., </em>483 US 825; <em>Seawall Assocs. v City of New York, </em>74 NY2d 92, <em>cert denied sub nom.

III.

Heightened scrutiny is inapplicable in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ing whether Local Law No. 6 effects a taking of plaintiffs property and, in any event, Local Law No. 6 survives such scrutiny. <em>(Nollan v California Coastal Commn., </em>483 US 825; <em>Dolan v City of Tigard, </em>512 US 374; <em>Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 US 365; <em>Agins v City of Tiburon, </em>447 US 255; <em>Matter of Gernatt Asphalt Prods. v Town of Sardinia, </em>87 NY2d 668; <em>Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>84 NY2d 385; <em>Rent Stabilization Assn. v Higgins, </em>83 NY2d 156; <em>Seawall Assocs. v City of New York, </em>74 NY2d 92, <em>cert denied sub nom.

The lower courts correctly held that Local Law No. 6 is a proper exercise of the Town Board\u2019s zoning authority pursuant to Town Law \u00a7\u00a7 261 and 263. <em>(Kaufman v Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>65 NY2d 449; <em>Rivervale Realty Co. v Town of Orangetown, </em>816 F Supp 937.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-4\"><em>Community Rights Counsel (Douglas T.

The causal nexus scrutiny of <em>Nollan, Seawall </em>and <em>Manocherian </em>does not apply to this case. <em>(Nollan v California Coastal Commn., </em>483 US 825; <em>Commercial Bldrs. v City of Sacramento, </em>941 F2d 872, 504 US 931; <em>Yee v City of Escondido, </em>503 US 519; <em>Garneau v City of Seattle, </em>147 F3d 802; <em>Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>84 NY2d 385; <em>Texas Manufactured Hous.

II. The reasonableness of zoning should be evaluated under the Due Process Clause, not the Takings Clause. <em>(Eastern Enters. v Apfel, </em>524 US 498; <em>Agins v City of Tiburon, </em>447 US 255; <em>Unity Real Estate Co. v Hudson, </em>178 F3d 649; <em>Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>84 NY2d 385; <em>Town of Orangetown v Magee, </em>88 NY2d 41; <em>Nectow v City of Cambridge, </em>277 US 183; <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v County of Los Angeles, </em>482 US 304; <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon, </em>260 US 393; <em>Loretto v Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 US 419; <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commn. v Hamilton Bank, </em>473 US 172.)

Open space is of such fundamental importance, and unique character, that legislative bodies must be afforded significant latitude and deference in zoning to preserve open space within local communities. <em>(Turner Broadcasting Sys. v Federal Communications Commn., </em>520 US 180.) II. No taking has occurred in this case, under any test, and therefore this Court should reject any such claim. <em>(Goldblatt v Town of Hemp-stead, </em>369 US 590; <em>de St. Aubin v Flacke, </em>68 NY2d 66; <em>Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 US 365; <em>Thomas v Town of Bedford, </em>11 NY2d 428; <em>Town of Islip v Summers Coal &amp; Lbr.

III. This Court should clarify the standard of review applicable to the relationship between legislative ends and means, and should' unequivocally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>state that due process, rational basis review is the correct standard for zoning and other general land-use regulation. <em>(McCray v New York, </em>461 US 961; <em>McMinn v Town of Oyster Bay, </em>66 NY2d 544; <em>French Investing Co. v City of New York, </em>39 NY2d 587; <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon, </em>260 US 393; <em>Lucas v.

The Court should continue to exercise deference to State and local authorities when reviewing traditional land-use regulations that do not result in physical exactions or dedications of property. <em>(Dolan v City of Tigard, </em>512 US 374; <em>Nollan v California Coastal Commn., </em>483 US 825; <em>Agins v City of Tiburon, </em>447 US 255; <em>Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 US 365; <em>Nectow v City of Cambridge, </em>277 US 183; <em>Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>84 NY2d 385, 514 US 1109; <em>Seawall Assocs. v City of New York, </em>74 NY2d 92, <em>cert denied sub nom.

II. The Mamaroneck ordinance must be sustained because its requirements are rationally related to and substantially advance legitimate governmental interests. <em>(Village of Euclid v Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 US 365; <em>Agins v City of Tiburon, </em>447 US 255; <em>Penn Cent.

This appeal addresses whether the change in zoning of plaintiff\u2019s property in 1994, from residential to solely recreational use, constituted a regulatory taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tion. Resolution of this question requires us to ascertain the appropriate standard to be applied in reviewing the sufficiency of the relationship between the Town\u2019s interests and the rezoning determination on this purely regulatory taking claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Bonnie Briar Country Club has leased the land from plaintiff since 1921. The following year, the area in which the Club is located for the first time became subject to a zoning ordinance. The land was zoned for residential use, permitting single family detached homes on lots of at least 15,000 and, in some areas, 30,000 square feet. The area surrounding Bonnie Briar was similarly zoned, and over the years has been developed in accordance with those zoning restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In the 1960\u2019s, the Town of Mamaroneck began to focus on its diminishing open spaces and in 1966 developed a \u201cMaster Plan\u201d in order to address the issue in a comprehensive manner. This Master Plan recommended that Bonnie Briar remain a golf course. A Master Plan \u201cUpdate\u201d in 1976 recommended that another neighboring golf course \u2014 the Winged Foot \u2014 also affected by the rezoning in Local Laws, 1994, No. 6 of the Town of Mamaroneck, remain a golf course. In 1985, the two golf course properties were included in a land-use study, \u201cWestchester 2000.\u201d That study also recommended the retention of the golf course properties as recreational areas and open spaces, concluding that development of these properties would increase the risk of flooding from the Sheldrake River. A portion of plaintiff\u2019s property is within the flood plain of the Sheldrake River. In its current non-developed state, the land helps control flooding by acting as a natural detention basin for rising river waters due to storms.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In 1986, the Towns of Mamaroneck and Larchmont together adopted a \u201cLocal Waterfront Revitalization Program\u201d (LWRP) for a comprehensive examination of land-use policies. The LWRP was primarily concerned with, and sought effectively to protect against, the flooding potential in both the flood plain and coastal areas. The LWRP identified flood damage to the Town\u2019s wetlands, fish and other wildlife habitats and streams, cautioning the Town to prepare itself for further adverse effects that would result from future changes in land use.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The LWRP found that the Town golf clubs were \u201cappropriate uses which, in addition to their ecological, recreational, architectural and scenic value, provide open space and natural water retention. They should remain in their present use if possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>In 1988 the Town retained Shuster Associates, a private planning firm, to assist in formulating its comprehensive plan to address and best implement the goals stated in the LWRP. Shuster examined a number of varying development options and issued a report and addendum considering three alternative development schemes. These development schemes did contemplate some residential development, not unlike that subsequently proposed by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Because rezoning these golf course properties required a review pursuant to the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), on May 30,1990, defendant Town Board declared its intention to serve as lead agency for the purpose of conducting the SEQRA review and retained yet another planning firm to assist in the review process. After preparation of a Generic Environmental Impact Statement in 1991, the Board issued a Findings Statement in completion of its SEQRA review in 1994. The Findings Statement described in great detail how the various proposed development and rezoning schemes would impact this environmentally sensitive area.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Specifically, the Findings Statement noted that the area was facing \u201clong-term pressure toward continuing urbanization in an already over-developed landscape,\u201d noting that \u201cless than 5% of the Westchester County watershed of the Long Island Sound remains open space.\u201d In response to these concerns over dwindling existing open spaces and to ensure their retention, the Board determined that zoning the Winged Foot and Bonnie Briar club properties solely for recreational uses was the best alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In addition, the Findings Statement explained that further residential development would frustrate the Town\u2019s goal of preserving recreational opportunities for Town and area residents, noting that 70% of Bonnie Briar\u2019s membership resided within a five-mile radius of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Finally, in connection with concerns over flooding, the SE-QRA Findings Statement noted that, without even considering further development beyond the Town\u2019s control, residential development within the Town could increase the flooding already experienced by many area homeowners. Furthermore, the Board was not adequately persuaded that proposed measures to mitigate the increased flooding associated with residential development would be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Based upon all of the foregoing considerations, the Findings Statement concluded that the \u201cRecreation Zone best achieves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the objectives of the Town, State, regional and federal policies that have guided the Town\u2019s comprehensive planning process for almost three decades.\u201d The Town Board rezoned accordingly, enacting Local Law No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Just months prior to the passage of that law, plaintiff retained its own planning firm and submitted a Preliminary Subdivision Plan for the golf club property to the Town Board. This plan provided for the construction of 71 residential lots, leaving approximately 112 acres of standing open space on the existing 18-hole golf course site. Upon receipt of this plan submitted by plaintiff, the Town Board requested certain revisions with which the plaintiff complied. The final plan submitted by plaintiff comported with the various possible development schemes recommended to the Board by the Shuster planning firm. In the end, however, as previously discussed, the Board chose to implement a rezoning of the property for exclusively recreational use to achieve its stated goals and interests of (1) preserving open space, (2) providing recreational opportunities for Town and other area residents and (3) mitigating flooding of both coastal and flood plain areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Plaintiff subsequently commenced this action, the main thrust of which was that Local Law No. 6 effected an unconstitutional taking of its property without just compensation. Plaintiff averred that Local Law No. 6 was not sufficiently related to the three stated purposes and that the application of the zoning ordinance deprived them of all economically viable uses of their land. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on a number of its various causes of action; defendant opposed the motion and cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the same claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Supreme Court granted defendant partial summary judgment, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s cause of action in which it alleged that there was an insufficiently close relationship between the Town\u2019s goals and its zoning ordinance. That holding was affirmed by the Appellate Division (242 AD2d 356). Subsequently, defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining causes of action concerning the alleged economic taking of plaintiff\u2019s property brought about by the enactment of Local Law No. 6. This motion was denied by Supreme Court. The Appellate Division reversed, granting defendant\u2019s motion and remitting to Supreme Court for the entry of judgment declaring the law constitutional as applied in this case (256 AD2d 293). This appeal is before us as of right (CPLR 5601 [b] [1]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">In <em>Agins v City of Tiburon </em>(447 US 255), the United States Supreme Court articulated the general test for determining whether \u201c[t]he application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 260). <em>Agins </em>held that a zoning law effects a regulatory taking if either: (1) \u201cthe ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests\u201d <em>or </em>(2) the ordinance \u201cdenies an owner economically viable use of his land\u201d (id). Plaintiff has abandoned its claim that it has been denied all economically viable uses of its land. Thus, its only remaining claim is that the \u201csubstantially advance\u201d alternative regulatory taking-prong of <em>Agins </em>is not met here because there is an insufficiently \u201cclose causal nexus\u201d <em>(Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>84 NY2d 385, 392; <em>Rent Stabilization Assn. v Higgins, </em>83 NY2d 156, 174; <em>see, Nollan v California Coastal Commn., </em>483 US 825) between the rezoning measure and the legitimate public interests defendants sought to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Relying on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Seawall Assocs. v City of New York </em>(74 NY2d 92) and <em>Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp. (supra), </em>plaintiff claims that Local Law No. 6 fails to meet the <em>Agins </em>standard because there is not a \u201cclose causal nexus\u201d between the Town\u2019s objectives and Local Law No. 6. Plaintiff argues that this was demonstrated as a matter of law, because in the opinion of the Shuster planning firm the same three objectives could be accomplished by less restrictive land control, permitting some residential development. We disagree with plaintiff\u2019s analysis and reject its proposed standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The close causal nexus standard urged by plaintiffs was derived from two United States Supreme Court cases, <em>Nollan v California Coastal Commn. (supra) </em>and <em>Dolan v City of Tigard </em>(512 US 374). In <em>Nollan, </em>the Supreme Court applied the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d prong of the <em>Agins </em>standard for a regulatory taking in the context of an exaction. In that case, the State had conditioned the granting of a permit to build a larger residence upon the owners\u2019 conveyance of a public easement across the property. In that specific circumstance, the Supreme Court applied the <em>Agins </em>standard to require an \u201cessential nexus\u201d between the property interest exacted from the owner and the identified legitimate governmental objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Seven years later, the Supreme Court decided <em>Dolan v City of Tigard (supra), </em>another exaction case, in which the municipality conditioned a permit for an expansion of a commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>establishment upon a dedication of portions of the owner\u2019s property for recreational and flood-control uses. In <em>Dolan, </em>the Court elucidated its \u201cessential nexus\u201d requirement in such cases. The Court explained that the essential connection is more than merely some relationship, but, on the other hand, the municipality need not \u201cdemonstrate that its exaction is directly proportional to the specifically created need\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 38,8-390). The Court adopted an intermediate position, i.e., that the essential nexus is a \u201crough proportionality\u201d between the required exaction and the governmental interests involved <em>(id., </em>at 391).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan </em>decisions, there was considerable disagreement as to the reach of those holdings. There were takings scholars who read the cases as creating a new standard for all regulatory takings <em>(see, </em>Peterson, <em>Land Use Regulatory \u201cTakings\u201d Revisited: The New Supreme Court Approaches, </em>39 Hastings LJ 335, 351; Kmiec, <em>The Original Understanding of the Takings Clause is Neither Weak Nor Obtuse, </em>88 Colum L Rev 1630, 1648-1654). Indeed, even Justice Brennan, in his dissent in <em>Nollan, </em>expressed concern over the heightened level of scrutiny, predicting its general application in takings cases: \u201cthe Court demands a degree of exactitude that is inconsistent with our standard for reviewing the rationality of a State\u2019s exercise of its police power for the welfare of its citizens\u201d <em>(Nollan v California Coastal Commn., supra, </em>at 842-843).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Other takings scholars opined that the heightened level of judicial scrutiny was applicable only in the specific context of an exaction <em>(see, </em>Michelman, <em>Takings, 1987, </em>88 Colum L Rev 1600, 1608-1609; Manheim, <em>Tenant Eviction Protection and the Takings Clause, </em>1989 Wis L Rev 925, 949-950, nn 146, 149; Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 9-4, at 599, n 20 [2d edj). Judges on this Court likewise differed in interpreting this line of cases <em>(compare, Seawall Assocs. v City of New York, </em>74 NY2d 92, <em>with id., </em>at 117 [Bellacosa, J., dissenting], <em>supra; compare, Manocherian v Lenox Hill Hosp., </em>84 NY2d 385, <em>with id., </em>at 400 [Levine, J., dissenting], <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The issue was finally resolved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>City of Monterey v Del Monte Dunes </em>(526 US 687),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in which the Court reaffirmed the continued viability of the <em>Agins </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>standard in regulatory takings that do not involve an exaction. In <em>Del Monte, </em>the Court expressly held that where, as here, \u201cthe landowner\u2019s challenge is based not on excessive exactions but on denial of development * * * the rough-proportionality test of <em>Dolan </em>is inapposite\u201d <em>(id., </em>526 US, at 703).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Plaintiff concedes that <em>Del Monte </em>clearly removed <em>Dolan\u2019s </em>\u201crough proportionality\u201d inquiry from a general regulatory takings analysis. It asserts, instead, that because the Supreme Court failed expressly to declare as inapplicable <em>Nollan\u2019s </em>\u201cessential nexus\u201d test, a reviewing court is still bound to determine if a generally applicable zoning regulation has a close nexus with the interests sought to be furthered. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Two reasons persuade us to reject plaintiffs contention that <em>Del Monte </em>has left <em>Nollan\u2019s </em>\u201cessential nexus\u201d test applicable in all takings cases. First, as we have previously demonstrated, the \u201crough proportionality\u201d test articulated in <em>Dolan </em>was nothing more than the Court\u2019s explication of the required closeness of the connection between the condition of development and the governmental objective under the essential nexus standard <em>in an exaction case. </em>Thus, in explicitly rejecting the application of the \u201crough proportionality\u201d test when, as here, the zoning law merely \u201cdenfies] * * * development\u201d <em>(City of Monterey v Del Monte Dunes, supra, </em>526 US, at 703), limiting its application to those cases involving exactions, the Supreme Court necessarily rejected the applicability of the \u201cessential nexus\u201d inquiry to general zoning regulations as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Second, our disagreement with the plaintiffs reading of <em>Del Monte </em>is confirmed by the Court\u2019s treatment of the other major issue before it in that case: whether, in a 42 USC \u00a7 1983 damage action for an unconstitutional taking, the plaintiff was entitled to have a jury consider the validity of that alleged taking. Although the <em>Del Monte </em>Court was divided over the issue of the availability of a jury trial, all concurring and dissenting Justices agreed upon the applicable standard and that the charge given by the trial court accurately reflected the current standard for regulatory takings analysis when no exaction is involved. The trial court in <em>Del Monte </em>instructed the jury that</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u201cone of your jobs as jurors is to decide if the city\u2019s decision here <em>substantially advanced </em>any such legitimate public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u201c \u2018The regulatory actions of the city or any agency <em>substantially advanc[e] a legitimate public purpose if </em>the action bears a <em>reasonable relationship </em>to that objective\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Monterey v Del Monte Dunes, supra, </em>526 US, at 701 [emphasis supplied] [alterations in the original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Importantly, this charge makes no reference at all to a necessary <em>essential nexus </em>between the regulation at issue and the governmental interests at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Here, Local Law No. 6 easily qualifies as a valid regulatory denial of development pursuant to a generally applicable zoning law. Because zoning plaintiffs property for solely recreational use bears a reasonable relation to the legitimate objectives stated within that law (to further open space, recreational opportunities and flood control), the regulatory action here substantially advances those purposes <em>(see, City of Monterey v Del Monte Dunes, supra, </em>526 US, at 701).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">As we have already described in detail, this shift in the zoning districts was in response to years of-study and documentation regarding the recurrent flooding problems and concerns. The LWRP concluded that \u201cin addition to their ecological, recreational, architectural and scenic value, [the properties\u2019 exclusive use as golf courses] provide [s] open space and natural water retention.\u201d Consequently, the LWRP recommended that the golf courses \u201cshould remain in their present use if possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">That defendant Board had before it other less restrictive options to choose from in arriving at its ultimate conclusion with respect to zoning is irrelevant. So long as the method and solution the Board eventually chose substantially advances the public interest, it is not this Court\u2019s place to substitute its own judgment for that of the Zoning Board <em>(see, Rent Stabilization Assn. v Higgins, </em>83 NY2d 156, 174, <em>supra </em>[\u201cThe question before us, however, is not the general wisdom or desirability of * * * (the regulation) \u2014 that is a question for the legislature\u201d]). It is similarly not for this Court to determine if, in regulating land use, the rezoning determination was more stringent than one might reasonably conclude was necessary to further public objectives <em>(see, Keystone Bituminuous Coal Assn. v DeBenedictis, </em>480 US 470, 487, n 16 [\u201cThat a land use regulation may be somewhat overinclusive or underinclusive is, of course, no justification for rejecting it\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">We have considered plaintiffs remaining claims and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Bellacosa, Smith, Ciparick and Wesley concur; Judge Rosenblatt taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"><em> </em>As shown in both <em>Del Monte Dunes </em>and <em>Eastern Enters, v Apfel </em>(524 US 498), no majority has accepted the invitation to rework the <em>Agins </em>standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>(see, the response of the Court to the contentions of the <em>amici </em>in <em>Del Monte (supra, </em>526 US, at 704).
