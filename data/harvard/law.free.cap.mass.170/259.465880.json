The declaration alleged that the shares were a total loss to the plaintiff, and were worth nothing, and he sought to recover the total amount of the purchase price, namely, $1,000 with interest. The defendant contended, among other things, that at the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ no cause of action had accrued on the instrument.

See also <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Mosely, </em>11 Gray, 170; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Kilburn Co-operative Society, </em>L. R. 10 Q. B. 264. As this action was brought before the expiration of the five years named in the agreement declared on, it was prematurely brought if the words \u201c at or before \u201d relate to the word \u201c reimburse.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>proposition is not disputed by the plaintiff. He- however contends that the language used is to be construed as a promise to reimburse him for any loss of the shares of stock suffered at or before the expiration of five years. This construction does not seem to us, however, to be the natural and reasonable meaning of the agreement. It fixes no time when the reimbursement is to be made. If it be said that the law will imply a reasonable time after any loss has occurred, then the defendant might be liable to a hundred actions, for the plaintiff might sell the stock a share at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">If the defendant had promised to reimburse the plaintiff \u201c at or before th\u00e9 expiration of five years, for any loss,\u201d etc., there could be no question of the meaning. <em>Belcher </em>v. Loveland, 119 Mass. 539. We are of opinion that the agreement should be construed as if it were so written. There is merely an inversion of the clauses of a sentence, which does not in any way affect the sense. We have no doubt that the words \u201cat or before the expiration of five years \u201d relate to the promise to reimburse.</p>\n<p id=\"AJHF\"><em>Exceptions </em>sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
