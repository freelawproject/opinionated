To .support this view, the plaintiff relies on the vote of the county commissioners accepting its bid and awarding the contract. We have therefore to consider whether, in view of the circumstances, the vote bears that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The vote is to be construed with reference to the advertise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ments under which the proposals of the plaintiff were submitted. The contract mentioned in the vote is the same contract mentioned in the advertisements, namely, the contract which was to be executed within six days from the date of notification of the award, and of the preparation and readiness for signature of the contract. A formal written contract, according to the form submitted to the bidders, was expressly provided for. After the award, the parties were to meet and execute such a contract. Where proposals and an award made thereon look to the future execution of the contract, such award is not necessarily a contract of any kind, nor an agreement to enter into a contract based upon the proposals; it is at most a matter to be determined whether such an agreement exists, upon a consideration of the terms and purpose of the award, construed in the light of the existing circumstances. In <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>14 Allen, 242, where it was sought to establish a contract from letters, it was said: \u201c A valid contract may doubtless be made by correspondence, but care should always be taken not to construe as an agreement letters which the parties intended only as preliminary negotiation. The question in such cases always is, Did they mean to contract by their correspondence, or were they only 'settling the terms of an agreement into which they proposed to enter after all its particulars were adjusted, which was then to be formally drawn up, and by which alone they designed to be bound ? \u201d See also <em>Ridgway </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 238, and cases there cited; <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>7 Ch. D. 29; <em>Rossiter </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>3 App. Cas. 1124; <em>Starkey </em>v. <em>Minneapolis, </em>19 Minn. 203; <em>Eads </em>v. <em>Carondelet, </em>42 Mo. 113; Pollock, Con. 41. Especially where the supposed contract is found only in a vote passed by a board of public officers, which looks to the preparation and execution of a formal contract in the future, care must be taken not to hold that to be a contract which was intended only to signify an intention to enter into a contract. See <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>12 Allen, 375; <em>Water Commissioners </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Vroom, 504, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In the present case, the county commissioners had advertised for proposals for doing a public work, with careful provisions looking to the final execution of a formal contract between themselves and the bidder whose proposals should be accepted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The bidders were to be bound to stand by their proposals, under a certain penalty or forfeiture. But the county was not to be bound until subsequently it should agree to be bound. The plaintiff concedes that no contract was made under which the work was to be done, but insists that the county commissioners did agree that they would thereafter enter into such a contract. We are unable to put that construction upon the vote. While it is possible for a party to agree in express terms to enter into an executory contract in the future, <em>(Drummond </em>v. Crane, 159 Mass. 577, and <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Hudson River </em>Railroad, 21 N. Y. 305,) the present case is not one of that description. The vote was but a step in the negotiation. It showed an expectation and an intention, for the time being, to enter into a contract with the plaintiff upon the basis of its proposals. But the execution of the contract was an act to be done in the future, and till that should be done no intention to be legally bound is fairly to be inferred. The vote meant merely to say that the plaintiff\u2019s proposals were accepted, subject to the preparation and execution of a formal contract. There is nothing to indicate an intention to bind the county by a preliminary agreement that a formal contract should be executed in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">This is especially apparent when the state of the existing legislation concerning the powers and duties of county commissioners is considered. By St. 1897, c. 137, \u00a7 2, it was provided that all contracts made by county commissioners for the construction of public works, if exceeding eight hundred dollars in amount, shall be made in writing, after notice for proposals therefor has been published; that all proposals shall be publicly opened in the presence of a majority of the commissioners, and a record thereof made upon their record; that all such contracts shall be in writing, and recorded in a book to be kept for the purpose with the records of the county; and that no contract made in violation of the provisions of this section shall be valid against the county, and no payment thereon shall be made from the county treasury. By St. 1897, c. 153, a greatly increased strictness was established in respect to expenditures by counties, and the duties of county commissioners in respect thereto were defined, and their powers limited. In these statutes, the purpose of the Legislature to prevent wasteful or unnecessary county expenses is clearly mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>fested, and it is open to doubt whether it would now be in the power of county commissioners to bind a county by a preliminary agreement to enter into a future contract for the construction of a public work. This question, however, need not now be determined, because it is quite obvious that the county commissioners of Bristol County were seeking to conform carefully to the spirit of the provisions of the statutes, and that by their vote they did not intend to bind the county by a preliminary agreement, such as that upon which the plaintiff relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
