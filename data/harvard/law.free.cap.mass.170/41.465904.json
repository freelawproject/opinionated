Germain, feloniously, wilfully, and maliciously did set fire to and burn.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-11\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Wardwell, J., there was evidence tending to show that the defendant was a boy sixteen years of age, and of rather below average intelligence; that having been summoned to appear at the Fire Marshal\u2019s office, in Boston, he went there, accompanied by one Chaffee and one Scott, and without the knowledge of his father, and that the following interview took place between him and the Fire Marshal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Av6\">The last named testified: \u201c I asked him his name, age, and residence, which he gave me. I said to him, 2 You have been having quite a number of fires in Oxford.\u2019 He smiled, and said they had. 1 How,\u2019 I said, 11 want you to tell me about them, but before you do, I want to tell you about the different kinds of fires that we have to deal with. First, there is a class who set fives to get the insurance, and to defraud insurance companies. Second, there is a class who do it for spite. These people are a menace to society, and deserve no pity or sympathy. Third, there is a class, at a certain age, who have a mania for setting fires, without an evil motive, such as women in pregnancy, girls coming to puberty, and boys of your age and habits, for whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>I have sympathy, and I take it that this fire was one of this class.\u2019 The boy said, \u2018Do you think that I set the fire?\u2019 I said, \u2018 Yes \u2019; and he said, \u2018 Why ? \u2019 and I said, \u2018 No matter.\u2019 He said, \u2018 I had nothing to do with the Chaffee fire.\u2019 I said, \u2018 Go on and tell me about the Germain fire.\u2019 The boy said, \u2018 What will they do with me, will they send me away?\u2019 I made no reply. (The witness saying on cross-examination that the reason why he did not reply was that he thought that it would affect the boy so that he would break down if he told the boy what he asked.) I then asked him how many matches he used to set the fire with ; he said, 1 One.\u2019 I asked him where he got it, and he said, \u2018 At Germain\u2019s kitchen.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">\u201c I said, \u2018 Now I want to call in some witnesses, and this evidence may be used against you.\u2019 The boy then said he had no intention of setting fire when he started, but that, when he passed the barn, the hay stuck out of the window and he lighted it, and that he did it to see it burn, for the excitement. I then called in the stenographer, and dictated the paper called the \u2018confession,\u2019 the first part of which I dictated without saying anything to him up to the word \u2018 prosecution \u2019; and then I used my own language, and after dictating a few words asked him if it was all right, to which he replied that it was; then I dictated a little more, asking him again, and so on until it.was all dictated. Then it was all read over to him again before he signed it, and he said it was all right. After showing him that it might be used as evidence in court against him, he signed it, and I had him hold up bis hand and make oath to it before me, and the witnesses sign it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">The confession, which was then admitted, against the objection of the defendant, and which was witnessed by Scott and Chaffee, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">\u201c I, William M. Bond, of Oxford, Massachusetts, hereby make the following voluntary confession, of my own free will and accord, without hope of favor or reward by reason of my so doing, and having been fully warned that the same might be used against me in criminal prosecution:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">\u201c On the evening of October 11th, 1896, between six and seven o\u2019clock, I set fire to an old house of Frank A. Germain, which was used as a barn, by igniting some hay which was pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>jecting from a window on the side of the barn. I did this for the purpose of burning the building and having a little excitement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">\u201c I have carefully read the above statement and declare the same to be true.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">The case was argued at the bar in October, 1897, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-8\"><em>W.

The judge finds the fact in the first instance. If he is of opinion that the confession was not voluntary, or that when the declaration was made the speaker expected to recover, or, in general, that the preliminary facts were not such as to make the evidence admissible, he rejects it, and that is the end of the matter unless some question of law is reserved. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bishop, 165 Mass. 148, 152. If he finds the other way and is of opinion that the evidence is admissible, he admits it, but instructs the jury to disregard it if they do not agree with him. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Preece, 140 Mass. 276, 277. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brewer, 164 Mass. 577, 582. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>120 Mass. 185, 188. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>126 Mass. 464, 466. Of course the accused has the further safeguard of a right to except, and it may be that, in considering exceptions to the admission of confessions, courts have used a slightly greater latitude than in ordinary cases of a generally similar kind. For instance, it is said that, <em>prima fade, </em>confessions are voluntary; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sego, </em>125 Mass. 210, 213; and if so, there always is some evidence that they are admissible. Yet the appellate courts not infrequently hold them inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nott, </em>135 Mass. 269. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>160 Mass. 530, 532. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>1 Gray, 461, 463; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>10 Gray, 173, 191, 192; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flood, </em>152 Mass. 529; <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>12 Met. 235, 237, 238. But the question is whether there was any evidence to justify the admission, even if a greater freedom is to be used in considering the evidence as a whole, and in disregarding a merely technical possibility. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>115 Mass. 481, 504, 505. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>120 Mass. 185, 188. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>129 Mass. 474, <em>475. Costelo v. Crowell, </em>139 Mass. 588, 590. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preece, </em>140 Mass. 276, 277. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>146 Mass. 571, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In the case at bar, considering the boy\u2019s capacity, there were strong reasons in the way in which he was treated for hesitating to accept his confession. Not to speak of the earlier examination, the manner in which the written confession was prepared deserves criticism, as every word of it was put into the boy\u2019s mouth by one in whose power he probably seemed to himself to be. Nevertheless, it purports on its face to be made of his own free will, without hope of favor, and after he had been duly warned. The judge who tried the case and saw the parties was satisfied to let it in, and we must presume that the jury were of his opinion. We cannot say, as matter of law, that the admission of the evidence was wrong. See <em>Commonwealth v. Wesley, </em>166 Mass. 248; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffee, </em>108 Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
