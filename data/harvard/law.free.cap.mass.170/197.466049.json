The judge refused so to rule; the jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-4\">G. <em>A. </em>Perkins, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-5\"><em>M.

In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Beaman, 8 Gray, 497, the rule of law in cases of larceny is thus stated by Mr. Justice Metcalf: \u201cAn indictment for a larceny of live animals need not state them to be alive, because the law will presume them to be so, unless the contrary be stated ; but' if, when stolen, the animals were dead, that fact must be stated; for, as the law would otherwise presume them to be alive, the variance would be fatal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">There is of course a great difference between the larceny of a live animal and that of a dead one, and the penalty may be much greater in the one case than in the other; but we are of opinion that the rule above stated has no application to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The St. of 1887, c. 814, \u00a7 1, is intended for the protection of, lobsters, and makes the selling, offering for sale, or having in possession a lobster less than a certain length a punishable offence, the penalty being five dollars for each lobster. The statute is broad enough to include dead lobsters as well as live lobsters. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>128 Mass. 410; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>165 Mass. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The offence is created by statute, and it is the general rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that it is sufficient to charge the offence in the words of the statute. An offence like the one complained of in this case comes within the general rule. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Prescott, 151 Mass. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"AF2\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
