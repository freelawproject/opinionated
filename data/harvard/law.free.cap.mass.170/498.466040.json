At the trial in the Superior Court, before Blodgett, J., it appeared in evidence that, before any trial of the case was had, the deposition of Barbour, one of the plaintiffs, was taken, on June 24,1894, upon a commission issuing from the Municipal Court, and to the interrogatories put to him no cross-interrogatories were filed by the defendant.. This deposition was used at the trial of the case in the Municipal Court, and at the first trial of the case in the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-12\">After the case had been once tried in the Superior Court, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney again filed interrogatories to Barbour in that court, for the purpose of taking his deposition a second time. The only cross-interrogatories filed by the defendant were inquiries to the witness concerning whether or not he had given the deposition first mentioned. The defendant filed with these cross-interrogatories his objections to the plaintiffs giving this deposition, for the reason substantially that they had already given the first deposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-13\">A commission was issued, and Barbour gave, on January 17, 1896, his second deposition, which related to the same subject matter, with some additional testimony, and contradicted a portion of the testimony given by the defendant at the former trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-14\">At the present trial the plaintiffs offered in evidence the second deposition, and the defendant objected thereto, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>asked that at least so much of the deposition as related to matters upon which the said Barbour had given testimony in his first deposition be excluded. The judge overruled the objection of the defendant, denied his request, and allowed the whole of the second deposition to be read to the jury. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-5\"><em>E. O. Cooke, pro se, </em>submitted the case on a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-6\"><em>W. P. Hale, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-7\">Field, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHt\">The exceptions in this case do not raise the question whether any of the interrogatories contained in the second deposition called for incompetent evidence, or whether any of the answers thereto were incompetent. The single exception is to the admission of the second deposition in evidence, or at least of \u201c so much of the deposition as related to matters upon which the said Barbour had given testimony in his first deposition.\u201d We think that the ruling was right. <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Demond, </em>103 Mass. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"AyU\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
