It appeared that the-plaintiff kept constantly at work until the train struck him that the train did not slacken its speed or stop after the plaintiff was struck; and that the rules of the defendant required the-engineer to give warning to persons or animals on its tracks of the approach of the train by blowing consecutively short sharp\u00a1 blasts of the whistle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">Xavier Jean, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that he was at work at the time of the accident on the same track as the plaintiff, but on a different rail, and farther than he from the approaching train by the distance of one hundred and fifty feet; that they had worked at that place five or six days repairing the track; that the plaintiff was at work unscrewing nuts from old rails and taking off old bolts; that the old rail was on the outside of the track, eighteen or twenty inches from the rail upon which the train came; that the plaintiff was bent over, with a wrench a foot and a half long, and his head was over the rail; that it was not possible for him to do that work so as to prevent some part of his body from being exposed to a train upon the tracks ; that the train by which the plaintiff was injured was a regular train, always running at the same hour; that he heard it coming when it was at the station; that he heard it whistle for the crossing at the Summit Station and before it came in sight, there being four whistles,' two long and two short ones; that five persons were working there at that time; that the engine did not whistle, neither did the bell ring, after the train came into sight; that as the train came along the plaintiff was still unscrewing nuts, as when the witness first saw him before the train came into sight; that the kind of work which the plaintiff was doing made it more difficult to hear the approach of trains ; that there was snow on the ground, and snow deafens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the hearing of the approach of trains ; that the train came fast, and the front part of the engine struck the plaintiff on the right :side of the head; that the witness did not call to him because he was afraid that he would jump in front of the train and get killed; that the plaintiff did not look up at any time, but kept doing the same work ; that the plaintiff\u2019s hearing was good, and he had no difficulty in understanding the witness when he spoke English ; that he knew, aside from the signal, that it was time for the train to come, and knew no reason why the plaintiff should not have known that too; and that it was part of the witness\u2019s business to watch and listen for signals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-3\">Albert S. Davis testified that he was in the gang with the plaintiff, putting in steel rails below the crossing, and came along up to the place where the plaintiff was injured; that he was sixty feet nearer the station than the plaintiff when he was hurt; that he heard the train coming, and heard it blow for the crossing before it came around the curve; that he saw the engine all the time as it came along; that after hearing the whistle, he kept watch for it; that it was not possible for a man to do the work which he and the plaintiff were doing without having some part of the body exposed to a train on the tracks; that the whistle was not blown nor the bell rung after the train came in sight; that it was a down grade, and the train was going forty miles an hour ; that he saw the plaintiff all the time as the train came along; that he was still at work upon the old rail; that when the train came along the witness got up, and when it was about up to him he called to the plaintiff to look out, that the train was coming'; that the wind was blowing against him at the time; that the plaintiff never moved, but kept right on at work; that he heard the plaintiff\u2019s brother call to him in French when the train was about at the crossing; that the train was in plain sight for a quarter of a mile; that there was no obstruction between the crossing and their place of work; that it was the witness\u2019s business when he heard a signal to get out of the way of the coming train; that he did not know what the signal was to warn people on the track ; and that it did not blow that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\">Frank Landry testified that he was about three hundred and thirty-seven feet nearer to the crossing than the plaintiff, going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>towards the station ; that he heard the bell ring and whistle blow before the engine came around the curve, and before it was in sight; that he heard the bell and whistle for the crossing without difficulty; and that the bell did not ring nor whistle blow after the train came into sight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-3\">One Ladre testified that he was working on this track from two hundred and twenty-four to two hundred and forty feet farther from the station than the plaintiff; that he saw the train coming and heard the whistle before it reached the curve; that after it came in sight he heard neither whistle nor bell; that the plaintiff was at work outside the track on an old rail which had been taken off; that the witness did not think he was in any danger; that Bowles told the witness and others to look out for the trains when the work commenced; and that he did not remember whether the plaintiff was there or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">Albert S. Davis, recalled, testified that Bowles always told everybody in the gang to look out for trains; and that at the time of the accident, nobody was in charge of the men, Bowles having been up at the station for about half an hour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that her husband spoke good English.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">Upon all this evidence, the judge ruled, as matter of law, that the plaintiff could not recover; and directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>C. H.

The train was a regular one and came at the regular time and in the usual way. It was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to get out of its way, without compelling those in control of the train to give him warning of danger. He does not seem to have been upon the track itself, though working upon a rail which had been taken up, and which lay outside of the track and near it. But if it could be found from the evidence that he was upon the track, or so near the track, and so leaning toward or over it as to make it the duty of the engineer to give the signal required by the rules to persons on the track, and that the engineer was negligent in not giving that signal, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tiff bad no right to stay upon the track until such a signal should be given. It was his duty seasonably to put himself out of danger at the approach of the train. His bearing was good. The train had been in plain sight for a quarter of a mile, and its whistle at a greater distance was audible even farther away than the place where he was at work. Beside the warning given by the approach of the train itself, he was called to by fellow workmen. The inference must be drawn from the testimony that he was negligent in not noticing the approach of the train, and this negligence precludes his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"AYku\">\n<em>\u00a1Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
