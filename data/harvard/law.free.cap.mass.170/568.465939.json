Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 38. Before filing his petition he did file a list with them, as required by \u00a7 72. The court did not pass upon the question whether there was good cause why the list was not brought in within the time fixed by the assessors, \u00a7 72, other than that the petitioner was a nonresident, but found for the petitioner and reported the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">We are of opinion that, putting the case at the lowest, the judge was warranted in finding as, if necessary, we must assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>him to have done, that residence in another State was good cause why the list was not brought in earlier. But we need not stop there, as we are of opinion that such residence is sufficient cause as matter of law. The only persons to whom the notice of the assessors is to be given under \u00a738 are the inhabitants. It is true that \u00a7 72 requires a list from any person seeking an abatement whether resident or not. <em>Winnisimmet Co. </em>v. Chelsea, 6 Cush. 477. But as the only section fixing a time for doing so is \u00a7 38, which does not apply to non-residents, it follows that any time before filing a petition for abatement is seasonable for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>Judgment upon the finding.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
