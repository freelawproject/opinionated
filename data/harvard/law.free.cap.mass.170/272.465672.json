It was agreed that, prior to the date of the decree, the defendant was in occupation of and operating the railroad of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad Company under the lease of that company to the Boston, Hartford, and Erie Railroad Company, dated February 9,1869. It appeared that some of the persons in the employ of the New York and New England Railroad at the time of the decree aforesaid were continued in the employ of the receivers as their servants in operating the road. It also appeared that the receivers entered upon the possession of all the property of the defendant railroad at the time of their appointment, and continued exclusively to occupy and operate the same until midnight of August 31, 1895, when they turned all the property over to the New England Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>road Company, which corporation has operated the same ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-3\">The plaintiff contended that this defence was not open under the defendant\u2019s answer, and also contended that the decree appointing the receivers did not relieve the railroad from liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\">If the verdict ordered was right, judgment was to be entered thereon; otherwise, there was to be a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">The case was argued at the bar in October, 1897, and after-wards was submitted on briefs to all the justices.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-6\"><em>W. A. Gile &amp; C. T. </em>Tatman, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-7\"><em>F. P. Goulding &amp; W.

It happened that the next day after the accident the receivers turned over the property to a new corporation, so that the case suggests a possible hardship. But in the opinion of a majority of the court the defendant cannot be made liable on that account for an act done by persons who were not its agents or servants, but were put in control of its property by an adverse act. <em>Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>23 Ind. 553. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad, </em>74 Mo. 602. <em>Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railway </em>v. <em>Stringfellow, </em>44 Ark. 322, 324. <em>Kansas Pacific Railway </em>v. <em>Searle, </em>11 Col. 1. <em>Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad </em>v. <em>Hoechner, </em>14 C.

Beach, Receivers, (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 384, 726. Elliott, Railroads, \u00a7 581. The special grounds upon which it has been thought proper to charge a corporation to the extent of property in its hands paid for out of income by the receiver do not exist. <em>Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>62 Miss. 271. <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Railway </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>76 Texas, 421; <em>S. C. </em>151 U. S. 81, 99. As the defence shows that the defendant did not do the acts complained of, it is admissible under a general denial. <em>Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>23 Ind. 553, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
