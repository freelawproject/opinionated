He was allowed to amend his declaration by adding a count for a fraudulent assignment of certain accounts receivable. The defendant\u2019s only exception is to the allowance of the amendment. The allowance of the amendment was an adjudication under the Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 85, that the cause of action relied on by the plaintiff when the action was commenced was a fraudulent transfer of the property, which included the accounts, although perhaps the plaintiff did not then know what property was covered by the conveyance. If his purpose was to recover the value of everything included in the fraudulent transfer, and if he did not mention the accounts in the original declaration because he did not know until afterward that they were included, he was properly allowed to amend his declaration. The decision involved a finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The effect of these sections of the statute, in creating \u201c an essential change in the power and practice of the court in allowing amendments,\u201d is stated at length by Chief Justice Bigelow in <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>7 Allen, 202. See also <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>7 Gray, 540; <em>Freeman </em>v. Creech, 112 Mass. 180; <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>147 Mass. 342; <em>Townsend National Bank </em>v. Jones, 151 Mass. 454; <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Holt, post, </em>262.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The Pub. Sts. c. 167, \u00a7 85, which makes the adjudication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the court allowing an amendment conclusive evidence of the identity of the cause of action, leaves the defendant with no right of exception in a case like the present. <em>Mann </em>v. Brewer, 7 Allen, 202. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>124 Mass. 240. The question passed upon by the Superior Court was merely a question of fact, to the decision of which no exception lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
