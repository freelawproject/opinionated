We find the testimony of the defendant dentist<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> supplied evidence on this point sufficient to withstand a directed verdict as to one count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Edmund J. Jaskolski, D.D.S., is a specialist in oral surgery. Petrina Rice first sought his services on April 28, 1972. Dr. Jaskolski found pericoronitis of her left mandibular third molar and a similar condition on the right which was not yet in active infection. For preventive reasons, he recommended surgical removal of four mandibular and maxillary molars.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Dr. Jaskolski removed the teeth on May 2, 1972. Mrs. Rice subsequently complained that the effect of the novocaine remained, and portions of her face remained numb. Mrs. Rice consulted a neurologist. He diagnosed a neuropathy involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>mentalis position of the mandibular nerve, and he concluded the nerve injury was permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">Mrs. Rice filed a complaint in Wayne Circuit Court which alleged Dr. Jaskolski\u2019s malpractice in carrying out the surgical procedure and in failing to warn Mrs. Rice \"that such proffered surgery would or could possibly result in facial paralysis or paresthesia\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At trial, Mrs. Rice testified about the manner in which the local surgery was performed. She said also that Dr. Jaskolski gave her no warning of the possibility of numbness on April 28 when she consented to the oral surgery or on May 2 when the surgery occurred. Dr. Jaskolski explained the procedure he used on Mrs. Rice. As to the warning of possible numbness, he acknowledged that he did not explain that potential complication to her on April 28 when she gave her consent, but claimed that he did so advise on May 2 before he began the surgical procedure and his notes reflected that numbness had been explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Asked about whether the warning on May 2 was given before or after surgery, Dr. Jaskolski stated: \"The doctor is obligated to explain these conditions before not after.\u201d Despite protestations that he did not know what other oral surgeons did in like circumstances, the record discloses the following colloquy with Mrs. Rice\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>But under the conditions that obtain, to your patient then, Mrs. Rice, my client, wouldn\u2019t the general standard have been for the possible numbness result to be explained?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\"><em>\"A. </em>I can\u2019t speak for other offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You would have no knowledge?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\"A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Would your teachings have taught you such during your residency?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>\"A. </em>Teachings with regard to this is usually the practitioner\u2019s discretion. If he feels it\u2019s serious enough, he should explain it. My standard of care with these conditions, I always explain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>\"Q. </em>Your standard of care would be different than that of a general dentist practitioner?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">'A. Absolutely.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>If the general standard of care was any different, would you have known of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\"><em>'A. </em>Would you repeat that please?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\"><em>\"Q. </em>If the general standard of care for your specialty at that time was any different, would you have known of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\"><em>\u2019A. </em>I\u2019m sure it would be published in our literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>You do read current literature, do you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">\"A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>So if there were any new developments in the standard of care relative to the warning of patients about numbness after a mandibular extraction, you would have been made aware of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">'A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>If, in fact, your standard was any different than the general standard, you would have been aware of it?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">'A. Sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">In conclusion, counsel asked about Dr. Jaskolski\u2019s deposition testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b327-18\">\"Q. Doctor, on page 61, the question beginning at the bottom, I asked, 'Doctor, I ask you this question with reference to the warning you testified you gave the patient regarding the possibility of numbness, would, and I ask you this from a general standpoint not a personal one, I\u2019m asking relative to that standard any dentist would employ in a surgical removal procedure.\u2019 There was an objection. 'You mean any dentist\u2019 by [defendants\u2019 counsel]. [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], continuing: 'We\u2019ll limit it to any oral surgeon.\u2019 'You want to know my standard of practice\u2019, your response, 'Do you want to know my standard of practice? My standard of practice of conditions that are possibly caused or com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>plications or problems the then existing condition is explained, numbness is explained, statistics are given and whether or not the patients are hearing this and listening to this or not, I don\u2019t know. I do know that the existing condition is explained.\u2019 'Would that be a standard of practice as you as a professional with your experience would aptly apply to oral surgery?\u2019 Answer: 'Yes.\u2019 There is an objection. The question was repeated. 'Is the answer, yes?\u2019 The answer, again by you, 'Yes.\u2019 Question: 'Would that standard of care differ, or would it apply to a D.D.S. engaged in the practice of general dentistry in a surgical removal?\u2019 Answer: T would say this would be the standard of practice. There are many levels of training.\u2019 Were those then your responses to those questions?</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\"A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\"0. Were they then true?</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\"A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The trial judge treated the issues raised by Dr. Jaskolski\u2019s motion for directed verdict separately. He found that no evidence had been presented on the standard of care for the surgical procedure so that the jury could measure the alleged deviation from the standard. As to the informed consent issue, he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\"This record is silent as to anything other than the defendant\u2019s practice or his personal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\"In my view the jury would have to speculate as to what the standard of care was for oral surgeons following the dictates of the Michigan Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the reason that they could not apply the standard jury instruction dealing with what a reasonable person would have construed or understood given the question of informed consent, because that charge would be inappropriate and there is no criteria against which the jury could evaluate the plaintiff\u2019s statement vis-\u00e1-vis the defendant\u2019s statement since there is no evidence on this record establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>standard of care for either the medical treatment given, nor is there a standard of care in the profession for the kind of information that must be exchanged before the plaintiff or any patient is said to have received or given informed consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">He granted the directed verdict. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We granted leave to appeal and asked the parties to address whether the record contained sufficient evidence to warrant jury consideration and whether we should adopt the rule developed by the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Sard v Hardy, </em>281 Md 432; 379 A2d 1014 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we find the first issue dispositive, we do not address the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In <em>Roberts v Young, </em>369 Mich 133, 140; 119 NW2d 627 (1963), we said that there are some types of conduct of a medical practitioner which do not require expert testimony for a layperson to evaluate, but that is ordinarily not the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\"The question presented is in substance whether a physician and surgeon before operating should advise the patient of all <em>possible </em>results. Whether such should be done would seem to be a matter to be determined with reference to the general practice customarily followed by the medical profession in the locality. <em>Twombly v Leach, </em>65 Mass 397 [1853]; <em>Rosenberg v Feigin, </em>119 Cal App 2d 783; 260 P2d 143 [1953]. The case of <em>Bang v Charles T Miller Hospital, </em>251 Minn 427; 88 NW2d 186 [1958], is not in point for the reason that there a result, serious in nature, was certain to happen, whereas in the case at bar there was a mere possibility. As before indicated, whether such possibility should have been discussed with the patient is a matter to be determined in accordance with the general practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>customarily observed by practitioners in good standing of defendant Young\u2019s school of treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Court of Appeals has held, however, that the defendant himself may provide the necessary expert testimony. It first addressed the point in <em>Giacobazzi v Fetzer, </em>6 Mich App 308; 149 NW2d 222 (1967):</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\"The question presented is whether in a malpractice action expert testimony may be elicited from a defendant physician called for cross-examination under the Michigan adverse party statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The Court concluded that the plaintiff should have been allowed to \"establish her case in chief through defendants\u2019 expert testimony\u201d. 6 Mich App 313. Both in <em>Mitz v Stern, </em>27 Mich App 459; 183 NW2d 608 (1970), and in <em>McPhee v Bay City Samaritan Hospital, </em>10 Mich App 567; 159 NW2d 880 (1968), the Court accepted a defendant\u2019s testimony to establish the standard of care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">We agree that the defendant may supply the necessary expert testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question here therefore is whether Dr. Jaskolski\u2019s testimony provided the jury with evidence it would need to evaluate Mrs. Rice\u2019s claim. We conclude that it did. He testified that if the general standard of care for his specialty were different than his own, he would know it and he explained what his standard of care was. He affirmed deposition testimony on the standard of practice of oral surgeons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>as to warning of numbness. This testimony was sufficient to withstand in part the directed verdict he sought at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for trial on the first count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.
