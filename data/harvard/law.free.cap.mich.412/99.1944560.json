First, the Court of Appeals in its decision confused the elements in the traditional fraudulent misrepresentation rule and the elements in the Michigan innocent misrepresentation rule. Both the Court of Appeals and the trial court erred in trying to decide an innocent misrepresentation case on the basis of the failure to prove an element required in the traditional fraudulent misrepresentation rule but not required under the innocent misrepresentation rule. Second, the trial court, although purporting to recognize the legal rule that it was sufficient that the \"misrepresentation exerted a material influence\u201d, inconsistently and erroneously acted as though the influence had to be total and exclusive. Third, the trial court erroneously failed to permit the defendants to attempt to prove the affirmative defense of silent fraud, saying the plaintiff had no duty of disclosure. However, the record indicates that there was indeed evidence which could substantiate such a duty. And fourth, in determining whether a misrepresentation had actually been made the trial court made contradictory statements so that it is impossible to conclude for certain whether or not a misrepresentation was made that the victims, in this case the defendants, relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Because of the errors above mentioned, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Court of Appeals affirmance of the trial court is reversed. However, because it is unclear whether the trial court did or did not find that plaintiff in fact made a misrepresentation on which defendants relied and because the trial court erroneously dismissed the possibility of silent fraud, the matter is remanded to the trial court for further consideration. The nature of the equitable remedy is discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Appellants Chase Black, Phillip Haughey and AHB Associates, Inc. (AHB), are defendants in an action for reimbursement by plaintiff-appellee United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (USF &amp;G) pursuant to an indemnity agreement dated December 28, 1971, but actually signed by the defendants on June 20, 1972. AHB is the developer of the Glenwood Trace Housing Project in Battle Creek and the general partner of the Glenwood Trace Limited Dividend Housing Association which owned the project. Black and Haughey, as stockholders and officers of AHB, desired to obtain financing for a low- and medium-income housing project from the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA). To do so, however, required that the general contractor furnish labor and materials payment and performance bonds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After accepting bids from prospective contractors in late 1971, defendants hired the Kwaske Brothers Construction Company on the condition that it could satisfy the MSHDA\u2019s bond requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Kwaske Brothers went to Mourer-Foster, Inc., a Lansing insurance agent, for assistance in finding an underwriter willing to furnish the necessary bonds. After negotiations with Capitol Indemnity Company were abandoned due to exorbitant rates and stiff underwriting requirements,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a MourerFoster employee, Albert Neubacher, contacted his former employer, USF&amp;G. At first the underwriter refused to issue the bonds to Kwaske Brothers, but reconsidered provided certain conditions were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On December 18, 1971, another Mourer-Foster employee, Myron Montie, met with Gerald Kwaske and defendant Black at defendant\u2019s offices and presented the following four bonding requirements of USF&amp;G:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\"1. The four Kwaske brothers, as officers of the general contractor, and their wives were to sign an indemnity agreement in favor of USF&amp;G for amounts paid by USF&amp;G under the bonds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\"2. Kwaske Brothers\u2019 bank, Jackson City Bank of Jackson, Michigan, was to subordinate its rights to certain assets of Kwaske Brothers and the Kwaskes individually to USF&amp;G;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\"3. Three major subcontractors and one material supplier (heating, plumbing, electrical and lumber) were to become liable on the bond by signing a surety or indemnity agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\"4. AHB Associates, Phillip Haughey, Chase Black and their wives were to sign an indemnity agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Black objected to Montie about the extensive lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>bility defendants were asked to assume. He repeated these objections to Neubacher, the head of Mourer-Foster\u2019s Bond Department, but the requirements were reaffirmed. After evaluating the bond conditions against their potential liability, Black and Haughey agreed to sign the indemnity agreement provided their wives were omitted from the bond and USF&amp;G agreed to include a priority of collection so that if indemnification were required, defendants would be the last indemnitors pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The loan closing meeting was held at the MSHDA office in Lansing on December 28, 1971. Neubacher signed the labor and materials payment and performance bonds for USF&amp;G in accordance with a written power of attorney. Black testified that he specifically asked Neubacher whether all of the other conditions imposed by USF&amp;G had been satisfied and was told that USF &amp;G \"had obtained all of the conditions\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the following months Neubacher made several requests for defendants to execute the indemnity agreement. One such attempt occurred on March 28, 1972, when Neubacher personally delivered a copy of the indemnity agreement to Black. Attached to the agreement was a photocopy of a letter to Neubacher from USF&amp;G Bond Superintendent J. Edwin Pohl dated February 4th, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\"As you know, we are <em>still awaiting </em>certain papers to compl\u00e9te our file on this bond. We <em>are to receive </em>a Master Surety Agreement and resolution and certification signed by Kwaske Brothers Construction Company, Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Kwaske, Mr. and Mrs. Gerald Kwaske, Anthony Kwaske and Ernest Kwaske. We <em>are </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>also to receive </em>a specific indemnity agreement and resolution and certification signed by Chase Black, Phillip C. Haughey and AHB Associates, Inc. A letter from the City Bank of Jackson is <em>also to be received, </em>subordinating their interest to ours in connection with the blanket financing statement now in effect on Kwaske Brothers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Black admitted having read the letter at the time. When asked during cross-examination, \"is it not true, from reading this, you were aware that the conditions that you were relying on had not at this time been satisfied?\u201d, Black responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\"On the contrary, because I asked Mr. Neubacher what the situation was. That does not say that on March 28th that those were not available. It says on February 4th, they were not available. Mr. Neubacher responded that <em>those things had been taken care of </em>and this, our signature, our indemnity was the only thing yet remaining * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">After the March 28th meeting with Neubacher, defendant Black sent a photocopy of the February 4th USF&amp;G letter with the proposed indemnity agreement to his attorney with the following handwritten note at the bottom of the letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\"3/28/72</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\"Bob \u2014 A1 Neubacher came in this PM \u2014 wanting to talk about the attached 'Specific Indemnity Agreement.\u2019 I told him the wives <em>would not </em>be expected to sign, and that we wanted assurance that we were limiting ourselves after Kwaske Bros. Constr. Co., Inc., and after the three brothers personally[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] He said thats <em>[sic] </em>what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>all these papers mean. Do you agree. Please call me after reading them over.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\"Chase\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In the extreme bottom right hand corner of the exhibit, below the handwritten note, is a date stamp indicating that defendants\u2019 counsel received the letter on March 29, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Defendants Black and Haughey testified that they \"put total reliance\u201d on representations that there would be other indemnitors and that the Jackson Bank would subordinate its security interest in Kwaske Brothers\u2019 assets. They insisted that Neubacher told them that they were the last to comply with the bond requirements both before and after the delivery of the February 4th letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neubacher denied ever making such representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">USF&amp;G agreed to remove appellants\u2019 wives\u2019 names from the indemnity agreement but refused to set up any type of priority among the indemnitors. Defendants finally signed the agreement on June 20, 1972 and mailed it to Mourer-Foster. It was not until March, 1973, that defendants discovered that the Jackson City Bank had not subordinated its rights to various assets of the Kwaske Brothers, and not until 1975 that defendants learned that only two of the four Kwaske brothers and their wives and only one of the subcontractors had signed the master indemnity contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Kwaske Brothers defaulted under its labor and materials bond when it failed to pay all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>material suppliers and subcontractors. USF&amp;G intervened in accordance with the labor and materials bond and settled the claims. USF&amp;G subsequently brought suit against those sureties who had signed the indemnity agreement in order to recover its expenses of $78,971.27 plus interest. The plaintiff obtained a default judgment against defendants Kwaske Brothers Construction Company, Kathleen and Mary Helen Kwaske, and subcontractor Schmidt Electric Company; however, Gerald A. Kwaske and Ernest Kwaske received discharges in bankruptcy, leaving defendants Black, Haughey and AHB to face the remaining liability. Anthony Kwaske, Eugene Kwaske and his wife, the Jackson City Bank, and the major subcontractors and material suppliers who had worked on the project were not included in the suit since they had not signed the specific indemnity agreement, or, in the case of the bank, subordinated its security interest in the assets of Kwaske Brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">After a three-day bench trial in late July 1977 and submission of post-trial briefs by all the parties, the trial judge in a sometimes confusing and contradictory finding stated <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Mourer-Foster and its employees Montie and Neubacher were agents of USF&amp;G;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Defendants \"relied, in part, upon the fact that there were others who would be liable in the event that indemnification was required\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">However, \"defendants did not rely on the December, 1971 statement, for they did not sign the indemnity agreement until several months later and then only after the agreement was modified to eliminate the requirement that their wives sign it\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Nevertheless the \"preliminary statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>made to the defendants and these were certainly a factor in their decision to sign the indemnity agreement\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Neubacher answered yes when asked on December 28, 1971 if all the bond requirements of December 18th had been met;</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Defendants failed to establish that Neubacher repeated the assurances on March 28, 1972, that the other conditions of the bond requirements had been met;</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\"[T]here is a total absence of proof that the plaintiff or its agents <em>made any representations with the intention that these be acted upon </em>by the defendants\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The trial court, relying on <em>Candler v Heigho, </em>208 Mich 115; 175 NW 141 (1919), and its progeny, held that the affirmative defense of actionable fraud was not established due to the failure of proofs that USF&amp;G intended to induce defendants to act upon any misrepresentation which may have been made. Similarly the trial court dismissed the argument that the doctrine of silent fraud applied, holding the plaintiff had no duty to speak since it \"neither knew nor had any reason to believe that defendants\u2019 actions were governed at all by its own requirements\u201d. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a 1-1/2-page unpublished per curiam opinion. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on April 17, 1980. 408 Mich 898 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">II. Court of Appeals Confusion of the Traditional and the \"Innocent\u201d Misrepresentation Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The pertinent part of the Court of Appeals opinion reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\"On appeal, defendants argue that the general rule that a material misrepresentation be made with the intention that it be acted upon has been modified by Michigan\u2019s \"innocent misrepresentation\u201d rule of fraud. We disagree. <em>Hi-Way Motor Co v International Harvester Co, </em>398 Mich 330, 336; 247 NW2d 813 (1976), sets forth the elements of actionable fraud by quoting from <em>Candler v Heigho, </em>208 Mich 115, 121; 175 NW 141 (1919), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\" 'The general rule is that to constitute actionable fraud it must appear: (1) That defendant made a material representation; (2) that it was false; (3) that when he made it he knew that it was false, or made it recklessly, without any knowledge of its truth and as a positive assertion; (4) that he made it with the intention that it should be acted upon by plaintiff; (5) that plaintiff acted in reliance upon it; and (6) that he thereby suffered injury. Each of these facts must be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty, and all of them must be found to exist; the absence of any one of them is fatal to a recovery.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\"Michigan\u2019s 'innocent misrepresentation\u2019 rule of fraud modifies element (3) of the aforementioned general rule, but has no effect upon element (4). <em>Phillips v General Adjustment Bureau, </em>12 Mich App 16, 20; 162 NW2d 301 (1968), clearly states that it is the intent to deceive that is modified by the 'innocent misrepresentation\u2019 rule of fraud. Element (4) of the aforementioned general rule is required to be proven under Michigan\u2019s 'innocent misrepresentation\u2019 rule of fraud. <em>Phillips, supra.\"</em><footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The doctrine of \"innocent misrepresentation\u201d established by Justice Cooley 115 years ago in <em>Converse v Blumrich, </em>14 Mich 109, 123; 90 Am Dec 230 (1866), was restated in <em>Holcomb v Noble, </em>69 Mich 396, 399; 37 NW 497 (1888) (Morse, J., concurring), where Justice Morse, although being \"strongly impressed\u201d with the majority rule \"supported by abundant authority outside of our own State\u201d, found</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\"that the doctrine is settled here, by a long line of cases, that if there was in fact a misrepresentation, <em>though made innocently, </em>and its deceptive influence was effective, the consequences to the plaintiff being as serious as though it had proceeded from a vicious purpose, he would have a right of action for the damages caused thereby either at law or in equity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Accord, <em>Kroninger v Anast, </em>367 Mich 478, 482; 116 NW2d 863 (1962); <em>Boss v Tomaras, </em>241 Mich 540, 543; 217 NW 783 (1928); <em>Aldrich v Scribner, </em>154 Mich 23, 25; 117 NW 581 (1908); <em>Busch v Wilcox, </em>82 Mich 315, 336; 46 NW 940 (1890).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The innocent misrepresentation doctrine still obtains in Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>gan today. We have found no case overturning or disapproving of <em>Converse </em>and its progeny.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The rule of \"innocent misrepresentation\u201d is well expressed in a passage from <em>Phillips, supra, </em>p 20, quoting 23 Am Jur, Fraud and Deceit, \u00a7 120, p 908, reincorporated in 37 Am Jur 2d, Fraud and Deceit, \u00a7 195, p 257:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\"The minority rule is followed in at least one state in a slightly more specific formulation; it is held that where an action is brought to recover for false and fraudulent misrepresentations made by one party to another [1] in a transaction between them, [2] any representations which are false in fact [3] and actually deceive the other, and [4] are relied on by him to his damage, are actionable, irrespective of whether the person making them acted in good faith in making them, [5] where the loss of the party deceived inures to the benefit of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In comparing the traditional common-law rule as stated in the Court of Appeals opinion with the innocent misrepresentation rule set forth in American Jurisprudence, several significant differences appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">1. The innocent misrepresentation rule occurs [1] in a transaction between the contracting parties, whereas no such requirement appears in the traditional rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The instant case of course involves a contract of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">2. The requirement of <em>scienter, i.e., </em>knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentation, is present in the traditional rule (3) but not present in the innocent misrepresentation rule [3] and [4]. The Court of Appeals correctly recognized this.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">3. The traditional misrepresentation rule requires (4) that the misrepresentation be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the victim. The innocent misrepresentation rule has no . such requirement. The quotation from American Jurisprudence states [4] \"irrespective of whether the person making them acted in good faith in making them\u201d. As to this point, of course, the Court of Appeals applied the traditional instead of the \"innocent\u201d misrepresentation rule. We shall discuss this further almost immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>4. Under the traditional misrepresentation rule it is sufficient that the victim (6) suffer an injury. Under the innocent misrepresentation rule, the victim [5] must not only suffer an injury but also the injury must inure to the benefit of the other.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Briefly then, while the traditional and innocent misrepresentation actions are substantially similar, they are also significantly different. On the one hand, the innocent misrepresentation rule differs in eliminating <em>scienter </em>and proof of the intention that the misrepresentation be acted upon. However, on the other hand, the innocent misrepresentation rule adds the requirements that the misrepresentation be made in connection with making a contract and the injury suffered by the victim must inure to the benefit of the misrepresenter. Actually what this means is this: while it is unnecessary to show that the innocent misrepresenter knew his representation was false, it is necessary to show that not only does the victim suffer injury, but also the injury must inure to the misrepresenter\u2019s benefit. It also means, and this is the major legal issue in this case, that it is unnecessary to prove separately that the representer intended that the victim rely on the misrepresentation, because the representation must be made \"in a transaction between them\u201d, where the misre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>presenter should realize that the misrepresentation would be relied upon. This was implicitly recognized in <em>Boss v Tomaras, </em>241 Mich 540, 543; 217 NW 783 (1928), where this Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><em>\"It was unnecessary for plaintiffs to prove a fraudulent purpose or intent upon the part of defendants, or those representing them. </em>If defendants made representations to plaintiffs with reference to the value and condition of the farm and the personal property, and plaintiffs relied and acted upon them to their damage, and they were false, <em>the purpose or intention of defendants in making the representations would be immaterial. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Accord, <em>Essenburg v Russell, </em>346 Mich 319, 323-324; 78 NW2d 136 (1956). <em>Goodrich v Waller, </em>314 Mich 456, 467-468; 22 NW2d 862 (1946). See <em>Rosenberg v Cyrowski, </em>227 Mich 508, 511; 198 NW 905 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Since the rule of innocent misrepresentation only applies to parties in privity of contract, the traditional requirement that the misrepresentation be made with the intention to induce the other party to act is automatically satisfied. Whenever a party engages in contractual negotiations that party attempts to persuade the other to accept the proposed terms, and vice-versa. The parties reach the goal of forming a mutually agreeable contract based upon the representations made in the course of bargaining. Thus, in situations involving privity of contract, all representations may be presumed to be made for the purpose of inducing the other party to enter the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In the case at bar, USF&amp;G, through its agents, appears to have represented to Black and Haughey that various parties had signed the indemnity agreement and that the Jackson Bank had subor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>dinated its security interest in the assets of Kwaske Brothers. Defendants, as competent businessmen, were concerned in spreading their potential liability over as many parties as possible and subordinating their liability to as many indemnitors as possible. They indicated this concern on several occasions by inquiring whether all of the bond requirements had been met. This was obviously an important consideration for defendants. Plaintiff wanted the indemnity agreement signed. As the months passed following the loan closing, USF&amp;G wrote increasingly demanding memos to Neubacher inquiring when he would obtain the signed indemnification agreements set forth in the bond requirements. Neubacher in turn stepped up his discussions with defendants. The trial judge found that \"statements made by Mr. Neubacher subsequent to the closing would constitute a misrepresentation, although there was no evidence that it was an intentional one\u201d. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, Neubacher misrepresented a material fact in the course of trying to get defendants to sign the indemnity agreement. It is evident he did so with the hope that defendants would act upon it by signing the agreement. As the above facts indicate, in a contractual bargaining situation it may justifiably be presumed that all material representations are made with the intention to induce the other party to act, <em>i.e., </em>enter into the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Therefore we hold that independent proof of intent to induce reliance is unnecessary to maintain an action in deceit under the doctrine of innocent misrepresentation inasmuch as a material statement made in the course of contractual negotiations is presumptively made with the intention that it should be relied upon. To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that <em>Candler v Heigho, supra, </em>purports to require that every traditional common-law element of fraud must be specifically proven in a case of innocent misrepresentation, it is hereby overruled. See footnote 8 and accompanying text, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">III. The Trial Court Misapplied the Rule That the Misrepresentation Need Only \"Exert a Material Influence\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It is well settled in Michigan that the test for determining the existence of reliance is not whether the misrepresentation was the sole influence upon the complaining party in deciding to sign the agreement but rather is \"whether the * * * misrepresentation exerted a <em>material </em>influence upon the minds of [the complainants], although it might be only 1 of several motives, acting together, which produced the result\u201d. <em>Callihan v Talkowski, </em>372 Mich 1, 6; 124 NW2d 788 (1963) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Was there such reliance in the case at bar? Defendant Black certainly indicated there was and minced no words in saying so:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\"><em>\"[Defense Attorney McFee]: </em>Now, what reliance, Mr. Black, if any, did you put upon these \u2014 this conversation with Mr. Neubacher with regard to the indemnity agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>\"[Defendant Black]: </em>Put total reliance on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\"><em>\"Q. </em>In what way?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\"><em>\"A. </em>That all of the items that were told to us were conditions of the bond and that without any one of them, the bond would not be offered, would not be made available. That meant our signatures. That meant the bank\u2019s agreement; that meant Kwaske\u2019s signatures; that meant the subcontractors\u2019 agreements to sign the bond. All of them had to be there for the bond to be made. I, therefore, assumed that any one of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>missing, there would be no bond nor could any one be missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Well, now, I\u2019m talking specifically, though, with regard to your willingness to sign an indemnity agreement which you eventually signed. What reliance or what consideration did you place on any of this conversation or these conditions?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><em>\"A. </em>If any of these monetary conditions that had to do with Kwaske\u2019s money or his equipment or the contractor\u2019s money or the bank\u2019s subordination, if those were not present, we wouldn\u2019t have signed the bond. It would have placed us in total jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\"We relied on the equipment being there for the bonding company to have as security. We relied on the working capital being available. We relied on that being available to the contractor and then to the bonding company. We relied on the assets of Kwaskes, of all the brothers and their wives, and we relied on the subcontractors signing the bond in that should there be a default, that their claims would not be made because they were guarantors under the bond. We relied on each of these totally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">From such testimony the trial judge found: \"It is * * * apparent that the two men [Black and Haughey] <em>relied, in part, </em>upon the fact that there were others who would be liable in the event that indemnification was required\u201d (emphasis added). The court also noted that while plaintiff considered the bond requirements as underwriting conditions, \"[t]o the defendants, they were factors in determining the extent of their liability if they signed the agreement. * * * As a result, I find that preliminary statements were made to the defendants and <em>these were certainly a factor in their decision to sign the indemnity agreement\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Therefore, following the rule in <em>Callihan </em>the trial judge should have ineluctably come to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>conclusion that the defendants did rely on plaintiffs\u2019 misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">However, inconsistently with the <em>Callihan </em>rule, he concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\"It is clear to me that the defendants did not rely on the December, 1971 statement <em>for they did not sign the indemnity agreement until several months later </em>and then <em>only after the agreement was modi\u00f1ed to eliminate the requirement that their wives sign it. </em>The effect of the December, 1971, statement by Neubacher cannot be overlooked, however, but may only be considered along with other acts of plaintiff and its agents in determining whether defendants have established their affirmative defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">This conclusion contains both internal inconsistencies and a failure to follow the rule of <em>Callihan. </em>The fact that defendants did not sign the indemnity agreement until after plaintiff abandoned the requirement that the defendants\u2019 wives become coindemnitors in no way requires the conclusion that the defendants did not rely on the misrepresentation that the other bond requirements were satisfied. It is a complete <em>non sequitur. </em>On the contrary, it may even be considered evidence that defendants were sure the other requirements were satisfied, because there is no evidence that they had given up on those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Nor is the trial court\u2019s holding that defendants failed to rely on the December, 1971 misrepresentations consistent with its own understanding of <em>Callihan. </em>The trial judge, in specifically recognizing the applicability of <em>Callihan, </em>correctly paraphrased the rule: \"If plaintiff\u2019s misrepresentations <em>exerted a material influence </em>on the minds of defendants <em>although </em>it might be <em>only one of several motives acting together, </em>which produced the re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>suit, this is sufficient reliance.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Having found that defendants \"relied in part\u201d upon plaintiffs misrepresentations and that the assurances that all the bond requirements had been met \"were certainly a factor in their decision to sign the indemnity agreement\u201d the trial judge nevertheless, inexplicably, found there was no reliance on the December, 1971 misrepresentation. Since the defendants \"relied in part\u201d on plaintiffs misrepresentations, that should have been sufficient under the <em>Callihan </em>rule. That the defendants did not immediately act upon plaintiffs misrepresentation, <em>i.e., </em>sign the indemnity contract, but instead continued to bargain on other issues had nothing to do with whether defendants did or did not rely on plaintiffs misrepresentations. The trial court\u2019s argument here is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">IV. Silent Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Defendants also raise the affirmative defense of silent fraud. They point out that during the n\u00e9gotiations leading up to the closing USF&amp;G had flatly stated that all of the enumerated bond requirements had to be satisfied, or at least agreed to, prior to the issuance of the labor and material and the performance bonds. They claim that plaintiffs agents saw or should have seen that defendants would rely on plaintiffs insisting on these conditions, because defendants showed they were very concerned with their potential liability and were looking to the other indemnitors sharing any indemnification with defendants. The defendants therefore argue that plaintiff had a duty to inform them of the reduction in the bond requirements. In addition, since Montie and Neubacher repeatedly assured defendants that they were the only parties who had not signed the indemnity agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ment, the two agents had a duty to inform defendants of the misstatement when they discovered that many of the bond requirements had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">It is generally recognized that \"[f]raud may be consummated by suppression of facts and of the truth, as well as by open false assertions\u201d, <em>Fred Macey Co v Macey, </em>143 Mich 138, 153; 106 NW 722 (1906), since \"a suppression of the truth may amount to <em>a </em>suggestion of falsehood\u201d. <em>Stewart v Wyoming Cattle Ranche Co, </em>128 US 383, 388; 9 S Ct 101; 32 L Ed 439 (1888). In order for the suppression of information to constitute silent fraud there must be a legal or equitable duty of disclosure. See 37 Am Jur 2d, Fraud and Deceit, \u00a7146.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In its original findings of November 4, 1977 the trial judge summarily dismissed defendants\u2019 silent fraud claim, holding that there was \"no duty on the part of the plaintiff to make a disclosure of the waivers [of the remaining bond requirements], <em>they [sic] having no knowledge of the effect the original statements of Montie\u2019s had on the defendants\u2019 decision\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.) On motion for reconsideration the trial court explained its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\"It is true that <em>some of the conditions originally called for were not met. If any misrepresentation occurred, it was through a statement that they had been. </em>As I indicated in the finding, the proofs satisfy me:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\"1. The statement of what would be required in order to issue the bond was true when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\"2. It was not made in an attempt to induce the defendants to act, although in their minds it was in fact an inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\"3. The plaintiff neither knew nor had any reason to believe that defendants\u2019 actions were governed at all by its own requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\"4. <em>When the changes took place, there was no duty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>on the part of the plaintiff to speak. </em>At that time and throughout, the defendants had conveyed two objections to the plaintiff \u2014 one that their wives should not be required to sign the indemnity agreement, to which the plaintiff acceded; two, that there be a list of priorities among the indemnitors, which request was denied. <em>Not knowing and not having reason to believe, that the defendants looked to the other conditions as \u2019running\u2019 to them, the plaintiff\u2019s silence cannot, in my judgment, be construed to have been breach of a duty to speak.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Thus the trial court concluded that plaintiff had no duty to notify defendants of the modification of the bond requirements because it found that USF &amp;G did not know, nor reasonably should have known, that defendants were relying on the representations that all of the bond requirements had been satisfied. We find this premise to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In the instant case the trial court specifically found that Montie and Neubacher were agents of USF&amp;G. Therefore if the agents knew, or reasonably should have known, that defendants were relying on all the bond requirements being completed that knowledge is imputed to the principal, USF&amp;G. Seavey, Law of Agency (West, 1964), \u00a7 97, p 174. See 1 Restatement Agency, 2d, \u00a7 272, p 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">We hold that the trial court was clearly in error in finding that plaintiff did not know, nor reasonably should have known, of defendants\u2019 reliance. Defendants had discussed with both agents their concern over their potential liability under the indemnity agreement and were openly attempting to limit this liability by 1) making sure that all of the proposed indemnitors had signed the indemnity agreement and that the Jackson Bank had subordinated its security interest in Kwaske Brothers\u2019 assets; 2) attempting to establish a prior<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ity of collections clause; and 3) eliminating the requirement that their wives sign the indemnity agreement. Therefore we find that Montie and Neubacher, as professional insurance agents experienced in the drafting and execution of indemnity agreements, knew, or reasonably should have known, that defendants were relying on the representations that all the bond requirements had been satisfied. See Part III, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Once this determination has been made it logically follows that the agents had a duty to disclose that all the bond requirements had not been met. \"[O]ne who remains silent when fair dealing requires him to speak may be guilty of fraudulent concealment.\u201d <em>Nowicki v Podgorski, </em>359 Mich 18, 32; 101 NW2d 371 (1960). It is the general rule \"that a party to a business transaction is under an obligation to exercise reasonable care to disclose to the other party, before the transaction is consummated, any subsequently acquired information which he recognizes as rendering untrue, or misleading, previous representations which, when made, were true or believed to be true\u201d. <em>Strand v Librascope, </em>Inc, 197 F Supp 743, 754 (ED Mich, 1961). See <em>Wolfe v A E Kusterer &amp; Co, </em>269 Mich 424; 257 NW 729 (1934). Accord, 3 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 551(2)(c), p 119. When Montie and Neubacher discovered that their representations concerning the bond requirements were inaccurate, and because they knew that defendants were very concerned with whether all of the other parties had signed the indemnity agreement, the insurance agents had a duty to clearly inform defendants of the new situation. This duty may have been satisfied by the delivery of the USF&amp;G letter to defendants on March 28, 1972 insofar as the letter put defendants on notice that certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>parties listed in the bond requirements had not signed the indemnity agreement as of February 4, 1972, the date the letter was written. In other words, the USF&amp;G letter notified defendants that the December 1971 representations were not true when made. However, it is far from clear whether the letter was intended to, or actually did, alter defendants\u2019 reasonable understanding of plaintiffs previous and continual assurances that all of the bond requirements had been satisfied since the letter was delivered almost two months after it was written and called for the delivery of the remaining indemnity agreements \"at an early date\u201d. (See Part V, <em>infra.) </em>Since neither the trial nor appellate court reviewed the issue of whether the duty to notify was satisfied and since this issue was not briefed by the parties, we reverse only the finding that there was no duty to inform and remand to the trial court for further consideration not inconsistent with this opinion. We note, however, that whether or not there was a satisfaction of the duty is closely aligned with the question of whether or not there was an effective misrepresentation, which is discussed next.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">V. Was There an Effective Misrepresentation?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We now turn to the record to determine whether defendants successfully proved a misrepresentation. In reviewing the findings of the trial court we are unable to ascertain whether the trial court believed that plaintiff made a misrepresentation that defendants relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The trial court found that on December 28, 1971, at the closing, plaintiff answered affirmatively to defendants\u2019 question whether all the coindemnitors had signed and the bank had subordinated its security interest in the Kwaske Brothers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>assets, thereby making a misrepresentation. Defendants became aware that the December, 1971 misrepresentation was, or had been, false when on March 28, 1972, Neubacher gave Black a photocopy of a letter he had received from USF&amp;G Bond Superintendent Pohl. Since the letter indicated that certain bond requirements remained unfulfilled as of February 4, 1972, the date the letter was written, defendants became aware that any representations made prior to or at the December 28, 1971 closing that the bond conditions were fulfilled were false.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus after defendants received the USF&amp;G letter on March 28, 1972 the December 1971 misrepresentations, in and of themselves, were no longer effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Defendants Black and Haughey, however, both claimed that Neubacher assured them upon the delivery of the USF&amp;G letter, and subsequently, that all of the bond requirements had been satisfied since, the writing of the USF&amp;G letter. Black was very definite and unequivocal as to what took place during Neubacher\u2019s visit:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\"/Plaintiff\u2019s <em>Attorney Carter]: </em>So, is it not true, from reading this [letter], you were aware that the conditions that you were relying on had not at this time been satisfied?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>\u201d[.Defendant Black]: </em>On the contrary because <em>I asked Mr. Neubacher what the situation was. </em>That does not say that on March 28th that those were not available. It says on February 4th, they were not available. <em>Mr. Neubacher responded that those things had been taken care of and this, our signature, our indemnity was the only thing yet remaining, </em>and if you\u2019ll read it carefully, you\u2019ll find that it says that.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Black later testified that he mailed a copy of the proposed indemnity agreement and the USF&amp;G letter to his attorney with a handwritten note at the bottom describing the meeting with Neubacher. The note, dated March 28, 1972, and bearing a March 29, 1972 time stamp of the law office, in part stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\"I told [Neubacher] the wives <em>would not </em>be expected to sign, and that we wanted assurance that we were limiting ourselves after Kwaske Bros. Constr. Co., Inc., and after the three brothers personally. He said thats <em>[sic] </em>what all these papers mean.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Neubacher admitted visiting defendants\u2019 office to discuss the signing of the indemnity agreement but denied stating that the bond requirements had been subsequently met.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The trial court nevertheless found that defendants failed to show, by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that oral assurances were made on March 28, 1972, declaring: \"The equivocal nature of the defendants\u2019 testimony contrasted with the positive nature of Neubacher\u2019s does not convince me.\u201d However, at a later point in the decision, the trial judge declared: \"I further find that statements made by Mr. Neubacher <em>subsequent </em>to the closing [December 28, 1971] would constitute a misrepresentation, although there was no evidence that it was an intentional one.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The trial court\u2019s confusing and contradictory findings necessitate that we remand for clarification. The court found (1) there was a misrepresentation <em>on </em>December 28, 1971, (2) that defendants failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was a misrepresentation on March 28, 1972, but (3) there were \"statements made by Mr. Neubacher <em>subsequent </em>to the closing\u201d of December 28, 1971 which \"constitute a misrepresentation\u201d. Which statements made at what time remains unclear. If any of the misrepresentations \"subsequent to the closing\u201d were also made subsequent to the receipt of the USF&amp;G letter on March 28, 1972 or February 4, 1972 (for the significance of the February 4, 1972 date see Black\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>above), then defendants may have reasonably relied on them and thereby have satisfied the first element necessary to maintain their affirmative defense of innocent misrepresentation. If, on the other hand, the trial court finds that none of the \"statements made by Mr. Neubacher subsequent to the closing\u201d were made on or after March 28, 1972 or February 4, 1972 then there can be no effective misrepresentation upon which defendants could have reasonably relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Furthermore, the antepenultimate paragraph of the trial judge\u2019s ten-page findings reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\"As a result, I find that preliminary statements were made to the defendants and these were certainly' a factor in their decision to sign the indemnity agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Obviously if the statements exerted a material influence on the final decision to sign the indemnity agreement, and, if they were false, as was the case, then the only logical conclusion is that there was an actionable misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">However, the trial judge in the next paragraph discusses the fact that plaintiff\u2019s misrepresentations were neither intentionally false nor made with the intention that defendants should rely upon them. Both propositions, of course, are extraneous to a consideration of innocent misrepresentation and consequently legally erroneous if applied to the findings in the antepenultimate paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Nonetheless, in the ultimate paragraph, the trial judge finds \"that the defendants have failed to establish their affirmative defense\u201d. On the basis of the two preceding paragraphs this is a legally erroneous conclusion, and standing alone would be subject to reversal. But these three criti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>cal paragraphs do not necessarily jibe with the rest of the trial judge\u2019s findings and only add to the confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Therefore we remand to the trial court to find whether defendants reasonably relied upon misrepresentations made by plaintiff or his agents at the time of their signing the indemnity agreement. The trial court shall provide defendants an opportunity to present evidence concerning the discussions between the parties over establishing a priority of collection among the indemnitors.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Insofar as the defendants no longer allege that a priority arrangement was contracted, the testimony presented shall only be considered for its probative value concerning 1) whether there were subsequent misrepresentations that the bond requirements had been satisfied, 2) whether defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>were concerned with the scope of their potential liability and communicated this to plaintiff through its agents, and 3) whether the defendants acted in reliance on the fact that there would be other indemnitors to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">VI. Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Should the trial court find defendants have satisfied their burden of proof in raising the affirmative defense of innocent misrepresentation or that there was silent fraud, then the court will be given the task of awarding an appropriate remedy. Defendants seek to have the entire indemnity agreement set aside, arguing that \"it is only equitable to void the agreement when it is determined that the assurances were false\u201d. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the indemnity agreement should be enforced as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The defenses of innocent misrepresentation and silent fraud are not based in law but in equity. The equitable court awarding a remedy must look to the most just result. Therefore, should the court on remand find there was innocent misrepresentation or silent fraud it must decide which remedy would be the most equitable under the unique circumstances of the case. The court is not confined to the polar opposite remedies urged by the opposing parties: full enforcement or total abrogation of the indemnity agreement. Other remedies, such as reformation, restitution, or partial enforcement of the contract, may be examined. We leave the resolution of the proper remedy, if any, to the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The Court of Appeals erred in attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>decide a case of innocent misrepresentation on the basis of failure to prove an element required only in the traditional common-law rule of misrepresentation but not in the innocent misrepresentation rule. Its judgment is consequently reversed. The trial court erred in the same particular. It in addition erred in misapplying the <em>Callihan </em>rule as to what constitutes reliance on a misrepresentation. It also erred in misapplying the rule of silent fraud. Therefore, we remand for consideration whether plaintiff satisfied its duty to inform defendants that the earlier representations that all of the bond requirements had been satisfied were false in finding plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of defendants\u2019 reliance on the misrepresentation. Finally, we are unable to read the trial court\u2019s findings as to whether or not there was an effective misrepresentation. For these reasons we reverse and remand to the trial court to reconsider the case in the light of the rulings of law we have made and to clarify its findings on the fact of misrepresentation. In case it finds there was in fact an actionable misrepresentation we have provided the trial court some guidance on the nature of the remedy that would be appropriate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-4\">Levin, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> The surety of a labor and materials payment bond agrees to pay parties furnishing labor and materials to the project if the contractor is unable.

Although <em>Phillips </em>quoted 23 Am Jur, Fraud and Deceit, \u00a7 120, p 908, reincorporated in 37 Am Jur 2d, Fraud and Deceit, \u00a7 195, p 257, for a summary of the innocent misrepresentation doctrine, the Court limited its analysis to the last section, holding: \"Michigan requires a benefit to inure to the person making an innocent misrepresentation in order to render him liable to a party relying on it to his detriment\u201d. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>20. Therefore, <em>Phillips </em>is not authority for the rule of <em>Candler </em>\"(4) that he made it [the misrepresentation] with the intention that it should be acted upon by [the victim]\u201d. Quite the opposite, as <em>Phillips </em>cites American Jurisprudence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We note also that in Michigan the terms \"actionable fraud\u201d or \"actionable fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d are more encompassing than the traditional common-law definition of fraud in that they may apply to situations where the misrepresenter had no <em>scienter.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\"> Although there were a few isolated instances of other state and federal cases intimating that <em>scienter </em>is not required, see, <em>e.g., Smith v Richards, </em>38 US (13 Pet) 26 (1839); <em>Smith v Babcock, </em>2 Wood &amp; M 246 (CCD Mass, 1846); <em>Tuthill v Babcock, </em>2 Wood &amp; M 298 (CCD Mass, 1846); <em>Lockridge v Foster, </em>5 Ill 569 (1843); see, generally, Shapo, <em>A Representational Theory of Consumer Protection: Doctrine, Function and Legal Liability for Product Disappointment, </em>60 Va L Rev 1109, 1172-1174 (1974), the doctrine of innocent misrepresentation remained pretty much \"peculiar to our jurisprudence\u201d for many years. <em>Aldrich v Scribner, </em>154 Mich 23, 32; 117 NW 581 (1908). Over the past several decades, however, other states have abandoned the requirement of <em>scienter </em>in actions in fraud arising out of contractual misrepresentation. See, <em>e.g., Gulf Electric Co v Fried, </em>218 Ala 684; 119 So 685 (1928); <em>Westerman v Corder, </em>86 Kan 239; 119 P 868 (1912); <em>Maser </em>v <em>Lind, </em>181 Neb 365; 148 NW2d 831 (1967); <em>McDaniel v Hodges, </em>176 Va 519; 11 SE2d 623 (1940).

As Justice Souris, writing for a unanimous Court, later noted when reviewing the innocent misrepresentation doctrine in light of <em>Candler </em>and its progeny:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\"Unfortunately, without acknowledging the limited applicability in Michigan of the general rule stated in 20 Cyc ** * * our opinions * * * made reference generally to its requirement of proof of knowledge. * * * But none of these cases required the Court to consider proof of <em>scienter, </em>or lack thereof. The decisions turned upon absence of proof of misrepresentation. We have found no case in Michigan contrary to the rule of <em>Converse v Blumrich, </em>when determination of the issue of <em>scienter </em>was necessary to the decision.\u201d <em>Irwin v Carlton, </em>369 Mich 92, 97; 119 NW2d 617 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">This remains true today even in light of <em>Hi-Way Motor Co v International Harvester Co, </em>398 Mich 330, 336; 247 NW2d 813 (1976), where this Court once again cited 20 Cyc without acknowledging its limited applicability in Michigan. <em>Hi-Way Motor </em>turned on the absence of a misrepresentation and plaintiffs\u2019 failure to rely on the representations made. <em>Id., </em>336-337. So that there will not be any confusion as to this state\u2019s position concerning the doctrine of innocent misrepresentation we specifically overrule <em>Candler </em>insofar as it purports to hold that all six common-law requirements of fraud must be proven in an innocent misrepresentation case.

The plaintiff sues to recover damages because he has been fraudulently induced to make that contract. The defendant may be, and generally is, the other party to that contract. Sometimes, however, the defendant is a third person, either the agent of the other party, or perhaps some one having no legal relation whatever to either party. For the purpose of determining whether the principle of the <em>Holcomb </em>and <em>Busch </em>cases is applicable, I draw a distinction between the suits brought against a party to the contract and the suits brought against those who are not parties to the contract. If it is brought against a party to the contract, that principle is applicable. If it is not brought against a party to the contract, that principle is not applicable.\u201d <em>Aldrich, supra, </em>30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> We note that many states adopting the strict common-law definition of fraud distinguish between an action brought in tort for fraudulent misrepresentation and an affirmative defense of misrepresentation in a contract enforcement suit. While the tort action, typically seeking damages, must prove all of the requirements in the quotation cited in <em>Candler, </em>such as <em>scienter </em>and intent to induce reliance, the affirmative defense of misrepresentation has a lesser standard. See 12 Williston, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a7 1487, pp 322-328. In Michigan, however, we have done away with the distinction in requirements when the parties to the suit are in privity of contract. Whether the doctrine of innocent misrepresentation is used to recover damages or as an affirmative defense rescinding or reforming the contract the requirements are the same, since in both instances the object is to make the injured party whole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\"> Whether this letter satisfied plaintiffs duties to clearly notify defendants that they could no longer rely on the statements that all the other parties to the indemnity agreement had signed, or were required to sign, is unclear. The letter directed Neubacher to promptly send the signed indemnity agreements of various recalcitrant parties to USF&amp;G. Thus, even though the letter notified defendants that some of the bond requirements had not been met as of February 4, 1972 (two months prior to defendants\u2019 receipt of the letter) the letter also reaffirmed USF&amp;G\u2019s policy that all of the bond requirements had to be met. Therefore, when delivering the letter to defendants Neubacher may have calmed any suspicions concerning prior misstatements by telling defendants that the other parties had since signed the agreement. Indeed, this is precisely what defendants contend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\"> Neubacher testified on direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\"><em>\"Q.

In fact, however, the clause was in an earlier proposed draft of the agreement which plaintiff had refused to accept. The impasse was resolved when plaintiff agreed not to require defendants\u2019 wives to become indemnitors in exchange for defendants agreeing to sign the indemnity agreement without demanding a priority of collection clause. When defense counsel realized that he had mistakenly read the wrong agreement in answering the complaint he abandoned the priority defense. Thus plaintiff objected to the admission of testimony concerning past discussion between the parties concerning priority of collection among the indemnitors. Defense counsel unsuccessfully attempted to explain his position to the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>\"The Court: </em>What is the materiality of [the statements by agent Montie suggesting the possibility of arranging for a priority of collection]?</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em>\"Mr. McFee: </em>Well, from the standpoint that <em>there were to be other Kwaskes on the agreement and all of these people were on the master surety agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\"><em>\"The Court: </em>I think, if I understand your objection, Mr. Carter, to this specific question as to whether there was to be some priority to demand for liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\"><em>\"Mr. McFee: </em>We are not alleging that there was to be any specific priority, but I\u2019m saying this was part of the conversation that took place at that time and it <em>shows how important these representations were to my client\u2019s mind, </em>all of these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\"><em>\"The Court: </em>I\u2019m going to sustain the objection.
