Since <em>Deay </em>was-decided we have witnessed the appearance of one California Supreme Court <em>decision\u2014In re Harris </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 131 [260 Cal.Rptr. 288, 775 P.2d 1057]\u2014and several Court of Appeal decisions from other districts. In light of these decisions, we conclude that the \u201ctemporal separateness\u201d principle noted in <em>Deay </em>is simply a factor to consider in determining whether prior offenses were adjudicated in proceedings that were \u201cformally distinct\u201d as required by <em>In re Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that California Supreme Court precedent forecloses us from substantively considering defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 2.90, which defines reasonable doubt in terms of \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">A jury convicted defendant of attempted first degree burglary for which he received a one-year sentence. Pursuant to section 667, the trial court also imposed three consecutive five-year \u201cenhancements\u201d for the defendant\u2019s three prior first degree burglary convictions. The total sentence was 16 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">To prove defendant\u2019s three prior first degree burglary convictions, the prosecution offered certified copies of pertinent court documents. One conviction was from 1987, and two were from 1988. The two 1988 convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>are at issue here. The court documents regarding the two 1988 convictions showed that the convictions were for separate burglaries committed three weeks apart, on February 24 and March 16, 1988. These two burglaries were charged in separate felony complaints, numbered 88F01897 and 88F02058. In one proceeding in municipal court, defendant entered a negotiated plea of guilty to each complaint. At this proceeding defendant\u2019s attorney noted that defendant was \u201cprepared to enter pleas of guilty to both complaints with the understanding that he would be promised no more than the midterm of four years as to one complaint, and one-third of the middle term as to the second complaint, so his maximum exposure would be five years and four months.\u2019\u2019 Throughout this plea proceeding, the magistrate distinguished between the two cases and repeatedly referred to them as \u201cboth cases.\u201d The factual basis supporting each guilty plea was independently set out prior to the acceptance of the pleas. Defendant was given one constitutional admonishment. When the clerk of the court inquired which sentence went with which complaint, defense counsel remarked it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d but the clerk noted it was necessary to specify. After accepting the pleas, the magistrate certified each case to the superior court, and the cases were respectively numbered 83797 and 83798.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In the superior court, defendant was sentenced separately on each case under its respective number. The judge noted that the two burglaries \u201cwere separate objectives on separate occasions,\u201d and sentenced them consecutively in line with the plea agreement. Separate custody credits were awarded and separate restitution fines were imposed in the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On appeal, defendant contends his two 1988 burglary convictions were not \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d as required by section 667 since they arose from complaints adjudicated in a single plea agreement. Therefore, defendant argues, one of the five-year enhancements based on these convictions must be stricken. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">1. <em>The Section 667 Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> The pivotal issue on appeal is whether defendant\u2019s two 1988 burglary convictions\u2014which were distinctively adjudicated by plea at the same time based upon separate complaints\u2014were \u201cbrought and tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>separately\u201d for purposes of imposing two enhancements under section 667.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s appeal requires this court to revisit its decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Deay, supra, </em>194 Cal.App.3d 280, in light of the subsequent California Supreme Court decision, <em>In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 131, and more recent Court of Appeal opinions interpreting these two decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In <em>Deay </em>this court held that the defendant was improperly given two 5-year sentence enhancements under section 667 since the defendant\u2019s two prior convictions were not \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d as required by that section. In <em>Deay </em>the defendant\u2019s two prior convictions arose from \u201ctwo counts\u201d contained in one accusatory pleading to which the defendant had pled guilty in one proceeding. We held that the phrase \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d does not apply where the multiple convictions are based on several counts of a single accusatory pleading. (194 Cal.3d at pp. 286-289.) In a footnote which has received considerable attention, we noted that although \u201cseparate case numbers may be evidence that multiple priors were brought separately, we reject any suggestion that, despite the fact the defendant pled guilty to both priors at the same time they may be deemed to have been tried separately simply because of the fortuity of their bearing different case numbers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 290, fn. 6.) We then added: \u201cIn our view, and consistent with its purpose, section 667 contemplates temporal rather than administrative separateness.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Just weeks before <em>Deay </em>was decided, the Fifth District in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1197 [238 Cal.Rptr. 31], confronted a similar claim. In <em>Harris, </em>the defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s imposition of two 5-year enhancements under section 667, arguing that his two prior convictions were by plea at the same hearing and he was sentenced concurrently for those crimes. (192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1199.) The appellate court rejected Harris\u2019s claim, reasoning that his prior convictions were based on two separate incidents under two separate case numbers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1202.) Additionally, the appellate court noted the trial court\u2019s finding that Harris had been \u201ctried separately\u201d when he pled guilty to \u201ceach different robbery case,\u201d although these pleas were taken in one hearing. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Finally, the appellate court noted that there was no evidence the cases had been consolidated or tried together, and stated that the trial court\u2019s finding could not be overcome by the mere fact that the pleas were taken at the same time and the sentences were imposed on the same day. After new facts emerged, however, concerning the separateness of Harris\u2019s prior conviction proceedings, the California Supreme Court, in <em>In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 131, granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The <em>In re Harris </em>court held that Harris had been improperly given two 5-year sentence enhancements under section 667, because the new evidence showed that his two prior convictions had originated in a single complaint in municipal court followed by a single preliminary hearing.  The court held that to support sentence enhancements under section 667, \u201c. . . the underlying proceedings must have been formally distinct, from filing to adjudication of guilt. Here, as the record plainly reveals, the charges in question were not \u2018brought . . . separately,\u2019 but were made in a single complaint.\u201d (49 Cal.3d at p. 136.) The Supreme Court in <em>In re Harris </em>failed to mention <em>Deay, </em>but noted the issue facing and the conclusion reached by the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Appellate court decisions subsequent to <em>Deay </em>and <em>In re Harris </em>have interpreted the phrase \u201con charges brought and tried separately\u201d as requiring separate charging documents but not requiring that guilty pleas be entered on separate days or that there be separate sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 134 [267 Cal.Rptr. 908], the trial court imposed two 5-year sentence enhancements under section 667 based on the defendant\u2019s two prior convictions which arose from two separate felony complaints followed by two separate informations. The Fourth District affirmed even though the defendant had pled guilty to these charges on the same day pursuant to a plea bargain, and was sentenced on these guilty pleas on another day in the same sentencing proceedings. (219 Cal.App.3d at pp. 145-147.) The court noted that in one of the prior cases, a jury had already been selected and sworn before the case was continued to allow plea bargaining. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 146-147.) The mere fact that the defendant thereafter pled guilty, on the same day to separate offenses, did not mean that the cases were not separately \u201cbrought and tried.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Fourth District concluded that the same date for accepting the pleas in these nonconsolidated cases, \u201cis of no significance for purposes of section 667.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 147, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1288, 1301 [237 Cal.Rptr. 64] [\u201c \u2018separately brought and tried\u2019 limitation of section 667, subdivision (a), does not bar multiple enhancements where convictions are based on unrelated counts of different accusatory pleadings.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The <em>Thomas </em>court distinguished <em>Deay </em>on the grounds that in <em>Deay </em>the defendant\u2019s prior convictions were adjudicated in one accusatory pleading containing two counts; \u201cThis factor distinguishes <em>Deay </em>from Thomas\u2019s case where separate accusatory pleadings were adjudicated.\u201d (219 Cal.App.3d at p. 147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The <em>Thomas </em>court also found it \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that the California Supreme Court in <em>In re Harris </em>did not criticize the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>a holding the <em>Thomas </em>court characterized as follows: \u201c[W]here the record shows more than one proceeding was separately initiated and not consolidated . . . the fact the defendant pled guilty in the cases at the same time and was sentenced on the same day cannot overcome a finding the cases were tried separately.\u201d (219 Cal.App.3d at p. 147, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 134 [269 Cal.Rptr. 221] the defendant, in one hearing, pled guilty to separate complaints alleging separate offenses. The <em>Gonzales </em>court considered <em>In re Harris\u2019s </em>requirement of \u201cformally distinct criminal proceedings\u201d and our footnote in <em>Deay </em>suggesting \u201ctemporal separateness.\u201d (220 Cal.App.3d at p. 140.) After noting that both <em>In re Harris </em>and <em>Deay </em>involved prosecutions initiated by a single charging document, the <em>Gonzales </em>court concluded, based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d that Gonzales\u2019s charges were brought and tried separately. <em>(Ibid.) </em>These circumstances included: \u201c[Gonzales\u2019s] priors originated in separate charging documents. The charges were unrelated; the incidents occurred at different times and places. ... [j]] ... Up to the day of [the plea hearing], separate counsel represented [Gonzales] in the two cases. .. . The magistrate^ carefully specified] case numbers in each instance, took the pleas and certified the cases to the superior court. Still with separate case numbers, that court imposed separate sentences. . . . [^] . . . [T]he cases were never consolidated. They remained formally distinct from their inception through sentencing.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 140, 142, 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">As part of its analysis, the Sixth District in <em>Gonzales </em>noted that \u201c. . . although the guilty pleas and the imposition of sentence were contemporaneous, we do not believe that temporal togetherness alone is sufficient to defeat the demonstrated intention of the parties and the court. The fact that both cases were called for hearing in municipal court on the same day is not evidence of a motion or grant of consolidation. Rather, it is a product of the practical realities of an overburdened criminal court system.\u201d (220 Cal.App.3d at p. 140.) The <em>Gonzales </em>court specifically rejected the argument that hearing more than one case per day per defendant results in \u201cde facto consolidation.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201c[i]t would neither benefit the public nor a defendant to require hearings on separate days for each case involved so as not to effect a \u2018de facto\u2019 consolidation of cases. On the contrary, the public would be justly incensed by an increased number of criminal cases clogging court calendars while civil cases languish unheard; by the uncertain status of victims, waiting longer to be called or released as witnesses; [and] by the expense of additional court personnel, courtrooms, deputy district attorneys and defense counsel to handle repetitious, but \u2018temporally separate,\u2019 hearings . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 140-141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Finally, the court in <em>Gonzales </em>looked to expressions of public policy. The court noted that the Legislature and the voters of California have declared that \u201c. . . the purpose of imprisonment for crime is punishment.\u201d (220 Cal.App.3d at p. 141.) The court noted that \u201c[i]ncreased penalties for recidivists exist because \u2018an offender undeterred by his <em>prior brushes with the law </em>deserves more severe criminal treatment. . . .\u2019 <em>(Ibid., </em>italics in original, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Rojas </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 795, 798 [253 Cal.Rptr. 786]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1147 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163].) And the court noted that the Legislature enacted subdivision (b) of Penal Code section 1385 \u201c \u2018to abrogate the holding in People v. Fritz, [(1985)] 40 Cal.3d 227 [219 Cal.Rptr. 460, 707 P.2d 833], and to restrict the authority of the trial court to strike prior convictions of serious felonies when imposing an enhancement under Section 667 of the Penal Code.\u2019 \u201d (220 Cal.App.3d at p. 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The recent Fourth District case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1184 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 491], has continued these themes in dealing directly with the language in <em>Deay </em>that \u201c. . . section 667 contemplates temporal rather than administrative separateness.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1192.) Initially, the <em>Smith </em>court noted that since <em>Deay </em>involved \u201ctwo <em>counts </em>of a <em>single </em>felony complaint to which defendant entered a guilty plea in one proceeding on the same date, it is factually dissimilar to Smith\u2019s case where separate accusatory pleadings were adjudicated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1192, italics in original.) But the court also reasoned that in light of the \u201cformally distinct\u201d test set forth in <em>In re Harris, </em>contrary to the \u201ctemporal separateness\u201d statement in <em>Deay, </em>\u201c. . . we are of the view that separately filed cases involving separate crimes can be adjudicated on the same date under their separate case numbers and still be considered to have been both \u2018brought and tried separately\u2019 within the meaning of section 667. This construction of the statute and <em>In re Harris, </em>rather than <em>Deay\u2019s </em>construction, advances the purpose of the statute to deter recidivism.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1193.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Indeed there is some conflict between interpretations of our \u201ctemporal separateness\u201d statement in <em>Deay </em>and <em>In re Harris\u2019s </em>\u201cformally distinct\u201d requirement. The <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Gonzales </em>courts went to great lengths to overcome the interpretation that the \u201ctemporal separateness\u201d principle set forth in <em>Deay </em>requires that a defendant, in plea adjudication proceedings, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>tried in separate proceedings on separate days. The <em>Smith </em>court was not as charitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In <em>Deay, </em>we considered only whether two counts of a single accusatory pleading, to which a defendant had pled guilty in one proceeding, could be used for two enhancements under section 667; we held they could not. In a footnote we also noted that while separate case numbers may be evidence that multiple priors were brought separately, this factor alone, which may be one of simple administrative fortuity, would not be conclusive as to whether the offenses were tried separately under section 667. It was in this context that we noted that section 667 contemplates temporal rather than administrative separateness. This footnote language in <em>Deay, </em>in light of <em>In re Harris, </em>should not be read to <em>require </em>that multiple offenses resolved by plea be adjudicated in separate proceedings at separate times to qualify as separately tried under section 667. Different case numbers or separate proceedings are merely factors which may be considered in determining whether prior convictions satisfy section 667 under the \u201cformally distinct\u201d test of <em>In re Harris. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 140-144 [applying a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis to <em>In re Harris's </em>\u201cformally distinct\u201d requirement].)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">That brings us to the practical matter at hand. The defendant\u2019s two prior convictions at issue involved unrelated separate criminal incidents and originated in separate complaints. As part of defendant\u2019s plea agreement, the complaints retained their separate character and defendant entered a separate plea on each complaint. A distinction was made between the two cases throughout both the plea hearing and the sentencing hearing. Defendant was sentenced separately for each offense\u2014in fact, different custody credits were awarded and different restitution fines were imposed for each offense. There is no evidence that a formal consolidation was ever sought. These facts are quite similar to those in <em>Gonzales. </em>(220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 139-140, 142.) The mere fact that defendant, pursuant to a plea agreement, entered pleas to both offenses in one proceeding, and was later sentenced for both offenses in another proceeding, does not overcome the conclusion, based on the facts just noted, that these offenses were \u201cbrought and tried separately\u201d for section 667 purposes. The underlying proceedings resulting in these convictions were formally distinct, from filing to adjudication of guilt. <em>(In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 136.) Accordingly, defendant\u2019s three 5-year enhancements were properly imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>2. <em>The \u201cMoral Certainty\" </em>Instruction<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\">There is \u201c \u2018no distinction between an adjudication of guilt based on a plea of guilt and that predicated on a trial on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 135, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Ebner </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 297, 304 [49 Cal.Rptr. 690, 411 P.2d 578].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">(See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1165 [269 Cal.Rptr. 705] [defendant improperly given two 5-year sentence enhancements since two prior convictions were not brought separately, but were made in a single complaint]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bizieff </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 130 [276 Cal.Rptr. 235] [defendant\u2019s equal protection rights were not violated by imposition of two sentence enhancements under section 667, based on two prior felony convictions, even though charges in both prior proceedings could have been brought and tried together, which would have resulted in only one section 667 enhancement].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">While the dissent raises some legitimate questions, it fails to account adequately for the realities of the contemporary criminal justice system and a procedure central to that system and this case: the plea bargain encompassing multiple offenses. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 140-142.) The fundamental issue is what does the section 667 phrase \u201ctried separately\u201d mean in this plea bargain context, where there is no \u201ctrial\" as that term is commonly used. An adjudication of guilt based on a guilty plea and that based on a trial on the merits both count as a prior conviction for enhancement purposes. (See <em>In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 135.) So long as the proceedings comprising that bargain are individualized in the manner evident here, the requirements of section 667 and the \u201cformally distinct\u201d test of <em>In re Harris </em>are satisfied. The formal distinction maintained throughout the proceedings in this case from charging to adjudication of guilt to sentencing furthers the defendant\u2019s interest in being informed about and presented with the cases' against him and furthers the public\u2019s interest in punishing defendant and deterring recidivism, Nothing would be gained, and a lot of public confidence might be lost, by requiring that a court take a brief recess between considering each offense in the multiple offense-plea bargain context simply to create some \u201ctemporal\u201d separation in otherwise functionally separate proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-12\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 729.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b494-7\">BLEASE, Acting P.

The majority have thereby transmuted the two required elements of the enhancement into one.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Defendant was separately charged with two burglaries which occurred three weeks apart. The pleas to both offenses were taken, both singly and jointly, in a <em>single proceeding </em>pursuant to a single plea bargain. The plea bargain provides: \u201cMr. Wagner [defendant] is prepared to enter pleas of guilty to both Complaints with the understanding that he would be promised no more than the midterm of four years as to one complaint, and one-third of the middle term as to the second complaint, so his maximum exposure would be five years and four months.\u201d Additionally, it was made a condition of the bargain that \u201cany time he receives on the violation of probation would run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>concurrent with this sentence; and, additionally, that the People will recommend that Mr. Wagner be housed at the Youth Authority . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Next, although defendant was explained the charges as to each complaint and pled guilty to each complaint, the waiver of specific rights was jointly done as to both charged offenses. Thus, for example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cMagistrate: Sir, as to both counts in both Complaints are you pleading freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">\u201cMagistrate: And are you doing so on both cases with advice of your counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">\u201cMagistrate: And in both cases are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty of both offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">\u201cMagistrate: I find there is a factual basis for both pleas in this case. I further find that both pleas were made and all waivers were made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. I accept and approve the plea and conditions previously stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">In addition the defendant was jointly sentenced for both offenses in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">Penal Code section 667 requires that each prior serious felony arise \u201con charges brought and tried separately.\u201d That makes for two distinct elements. <em>In re Harris </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 131 [260 Cal.Rptr. 288, 775 P.2d 1057], upon which the majority rely, says that this phrase \u201cis similar to language contained in former section 644 [upon charges separately brought and tried], a habitual criminal statute . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 135.) It views the language of section 667 as \u201cvirtually identical to that which appeared in former section 644 . . . .\u201d (49 Cal.3d at p. 136.) For that reason, it says: \u201c 1 \u201c \u2018the presumption is almost irresistible\u2019 \u201d that the terms have been used \u201c \u2018in the precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It quotes with approval the test applied to Penal Code section 644 taken from <em>People </em>v. <em>Ebner </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 297, 304 [49 Cal.Rptr. 690, 411 P.2d 578], in which, as <em>Harris </em>notes, the \u201ccourt construed the phrase [in former section 644] to \u2018signif[y] that . . . <em>prior felony proceedings must be totally separate, </em>not only during proceedings before trial but also as to those leading to the ultimate adjudication of guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 135, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><em>Ebner </em>there referred to the meaning of \u201ctried separately.\u201d <em>Ebner </em>says: \u201cThe term \u2018tried,\u2019 as used in the context of the statutory phrase, \u2018charges separately brought and tried,\u2019 signifies that the two prior felony proceedings must be totally separate, not only during proceedings before trial but also as to those leading to the ultimate adjudication of guilt.\u201d (64 Cal.2d at p. 304.) <em>In re Harris </em>also points out, again relying upon <em>Ebner, </em>that \u201c. . . there is \u2018no distinction between an adjudication of guilt based on a plea of guilt and that predicated on a trial on the merits.\u2019 \u201d (49 Cal.3d at p. 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Putting these principles together, prior offenses are not <em>\u201ctried </em>separately\u201d unless inter alia the \u201cultimate adjudication of guilt\u201d\u2014in this case the pleas\u2014 are made in \u201cfelony proceedings [that are] <em>totally </em>separate\u201d including all those \u201cleading to the ultimate adjudication of guilt.\u201d (Italics added.) If that were not the case, the sole measure of separability would be the actions taken on the \u201cformal\u201d pleadings\u2014the charges\u2014eliminating thereby the distinct requirement that the offenses be \u201ctried separately.\u201d Put another way, the term \u201ctried separately\u201d would have no meaning if the sole measure were the \u201cformal\u201d distinctness of two parts of a single proceeding, viewed as emanating from separate charging documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Yet, that is what the opinion in this case comes down to. It says: \u201cThe underlying proceedings resulting in these convictions were formally distinct, from filing to adjudication of guilt.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 737.) It further says: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s two prior convictions . . . originated in separate complaints. As part of defendant\u2019s plea agreement, the complaints retained their separate character and defendant entered a separate plea on each complaint. A distinction was made between the two cases throughout both the plea hearing and the sentencing hearing. Defendant was sentenced separately for each offense . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">If this case had resulted in a consolidated joint trial on the merits, predicated upon separate pleadings, it could not be said that the defendant was \u201ctried separately.\u201d Since the pleas are equivalent to a trial their taking in a joint proceeding is the equivalent of a joint trial on the merits for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>of Penal Code section 667. The fact that ordinarily no formal mechanism is invoked for the consolidation of the proceedings for the taking of joint pleas, as distinguished from joint trials, is a distinction without a difference. If the majority opinion is allowed to stand, defense counsel would be well advised to seek the formal consolidation of cases separately pled preliminary to the taking of joint pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The majority opinion goes wrong in reading the \u201cformally distinct\u201d language in <em>In re Harris </em>(49 Cal.3d at p. 136) as bearing on the meaning of \u201cseparately tried.\u201d In <em>Harris </em>the two candidate convictions resulted from charges that had been initiated through the filing of a single complaint in the municipal court, which were thereafter prosecuted in the superior court under separate informations to which separate guilty pleas were entered. The court concluded that \u201c. . . as the record plainly reveals, the <em>charges </em>in question were not \u2018brought . . . separately,\u2019 but were made in a single complaint.\u201d <em>{Ibid.., </em>italics added.) Thus, when the court says that the \u201cconvictions must have been made in proceedings that were formally distinct\u201d (p. 133), it is referring to but one of two elements of Penal Code section 667. The \u201cformally distinct\u201d test is obviously appropriate to the question whether the \u201ccharges\u201d were separately brought but not to the wholly different question whether the charges, however brought, were \u201cseparately tried.\u201d On the latter point, the test is appropriately that advanced in <em>Ebner, </em>whether the entire \u201cfelony proceedings . . . leading to the ultimate adjudication of guilt\u201d are \u201ctotally separate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\"><em>In re Harris, </em>which arose on habeas corpus, notably did not adopt the analysis advanced by the court which considered the same case on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1197.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>on facts much like those here, held that the defendant was not tried separately for the reason that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence . . . that the cases were consolidated prior to the defendant\u2019s plea. Although the pleas were taken at the same time and the defendant was sentenced on the same day, these facts alone cannot overcome the sentencing judge\u2019s finding that the two cases were tried separately.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>rejected the idea, central to <em>In re Harris, </em>that Penal Code section 667 uses a phrase that is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to that in former section 644 and \u201c \u2018that [its] terms have been used \u201c \u2018in the precise and technical sense which had been placed upon them by the courts.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Harris, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 136.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>to the contrary, emphasized that \u201c. . . section 667 ... is worded differently from old section 644.\u201d (192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>For that reason no doubt <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>did not, as <em>In re Harris </em>does, rely upon the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ebner, supra, </em>a case interpreting Penal Code section 644, that to be \u201ctried separately\u201d the \u201c \\ . . prior felony proceedings must be <em>totally separate </em>... as to [all] those leading to the ultimate adjudication of guilt.\u2019 \u201d (49 Cal.3d at p. 135, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The proceedings in this case were manifestly not \u201ctotally separate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">I would reverse the determination that the defendant\u2019s sentence may be enhanced for two prior serious felony convictions under Penal Code section 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 13, 1994. Mosk, J., and Kennard, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
