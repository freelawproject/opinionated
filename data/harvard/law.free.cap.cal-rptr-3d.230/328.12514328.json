INTRODUCTION\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Banke, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Beatrice Aguirre was detained by store security personnel after attempting to pay for purchases with a suspected counterfeit $100 bill. She was placed under arrest by a responding police officer, who, on conducting a search of defendant's purse incident to her arrest, found $1,130 in counterfeit $100, $20 and $5 bills, as well as 40 \"washed out\" $1 bills the officer believed were on their way to becoming counterfeit $100 bills. Defendant was charged with several felonies, including one count of forgery in violation of Penal Code section 476. She subsequently pleaded no contest to the forgery charge. The following year, defendant sought to recall her sentence under Proposition 47 ( Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 10, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.18 ) for resentencing as a misdemeanor. The trial court denied her petition on the ground the value of the counterfeit currency exceeded $950.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant's principal argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in totaling the value of the counterfeit currency she\n   possessed and should have,\n   instead, followed cases holding the face amounts of forged checks cannot be aggregated for purposes of Proposition 47. We conclude the forged check cases are inapplicable and the total amount of counterfeit currency possessed by a defendant at a given time properly determines whether the crime of possessing counterfeit currency remains a \"wobbler\" or must be charged and sentenced as a misdemeanor. Indeed, as we explain, were that not the case, there could never be a felony conviction for possession of counterfeit currency, even for a suitcase of bogus bills, because the largest denomination the United States Federal Reserve prints in paper currency is $100. We discern no intent on the part of the proponents of Proposition 47 or the electorate to entirely eliminate felony convictions for possession of counterfeit currency. We therefore affirm the denial of defendant's petition for resentencing. We also affirm the trial court's refusal to split her sentence between mandatory supervision and county jail, but agree the court erred in imposing a parole revocation restitution fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the summer of 2015, police officers responded to a report of someone trying to make a purchase using counterfeit currency. When officers arrived on the scene, defendant told them she was unaware the $100 bill she had tried to use was counterfeit. However, the store clerk alerted the officers that defendant had several other $100 bills in her purse. Defendant, who was on probation at the time, refused to allow the officers to search her purse, and they subsequently arrested her. Defendant then admitted she possessed both drugs and additional counterfeit bills, and upon conducting a search of her purse, the officers found an additional $1,130 in counterfeit $5, $20 and $100 bills, as well as 40 \"washed out\" $1 bills the officers believed were in the \"stage of production\" of becoming counterfeit $100 bills, along with 4.19 grams of methamphetamine and a glass pipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was charged with felony forgery ( Pen. Code, \u00a7 476\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -count 1), one count of misdemeanor possession of methamphetamine ( Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a) -count 2) and one count of second degree commercial burglary (\u00a7 459-count 3). It was further alleged as to count 1 that defendant had served two prior prison terms. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant eventually pleaded no contest to felony forgery ( \u00a7 476 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district attorney agreed to dismiss the remaining counts and priors, and that\n   defendant would be allowed to withdraw her plea if she was found ineligible for probation. When defendant failed to appear for sentencing, the trial court issued a bench warrant, and she was subsequently apprehended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant's criminal history dated back to 1984, and she had never successfully completed a grant of probation. The probation department initially recommended a split sentence, i.e., defendant would serve one year of a three-year sentence in county jail and the rest on mandatory supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, probation thereafter reported defendant had sustained two new criminal arrests, both for forgery offenses. In light of defendant's failure to appear for sentencing and her subsequent criminal conduct the probation department dropped its split sentence recommendation, as it \"no longer appears appropriate.\" Instead, the department recommended denial of probation and \"imposition of the full incarceration period of three years.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court imposed a lesser sentence than that recommended by probation-the midterm of two years, as well as various fees, including a $300 section 1202.45 parole revocation restitution fee. The trial court stated \"It's apparent to me from [defendant's] behavior as well as while she was pending judgment and sentence that she is not a good candidate for probation. [\u00b6] For those same reasons I'm providing-a split sentence would not be appropriate in this case because of the time chasing her down and trying to offer her services, she has received a ton of services. [\u00b6] At this point in time, the ultimate service provider would be the jail which has more programs in it including the WRAP program and the Anka program. I hope [defendant] avails herself of the opportunity. ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant subsequently filed a petition for resentencing pursuant to Proposition 47, which the trial court denied \"based upon the number of counterfeit bills she was in possession [of] at the time\" of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Indeed, defendant has not directed our attention to a single possession of counterfeit currency case that suggests that whether the offense must be charged and sentenced as a misdemeanor under Proposition 47 turns on the individual denominations of the counterfeit bills, rather than the total value of the bogus currency on which the charge is based.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, if the $950 benchmark for possession of counterfeit currency is determined by the single highest denomination bill found in a defendant's possession, then Proposition 47 will have effectively eliminated the crime of felony possession of counterfeit currency, as the United States Treasury does\n   not produce paper currency in any denomination higher than $100.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the chances of anyone possessing a counterfeit bill with a greater face value are virtually nonexistent, and even if the defendant had a briefcase with $50,000 in counterfeit bills, the possessory crime would have to be charged and sentenced as a misdemeanor. We discern nothing in Proposition 47 or its legislative history (consisting of the materials sent to the voters) that suggests the proponents of the measure and the electorate intended to eliminate felony possession of counterfeit currency and to treat a mule in a big time counterfeiting operation the same as a petty criminal with a few counterfeit bills.

Such a result would also be at odds with Proposition 47's treatment of those forging checks. A defendant forging a $50,000 check, of course, can be charged with a felony and sentenced accordingly. It makes no sense that a defendant carrying $50,000 in counterfeit currency could be charged only with a misdemeanor because the highest denomination of the bills in his bag was $100.

In\n   <em>\n    Salmorin\n   </em>\n   , the defendant and a cohort came into possession of a number of stolen checks and, when arrested, had five of the checks in their possession-one was still blank, one was made out to an assumed name used by the defendant, two were payable to his cohort, and one was payable to another individual. The prosecutor's theory was that the two had committed the forgeries as a joint criminal enterprise and charged the defendant with one count of forgery under section 470, subdivision (d).
