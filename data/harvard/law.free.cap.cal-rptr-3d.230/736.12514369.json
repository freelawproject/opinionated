The Board of Parole Hearings (the Board) decides, subject to relevant statutory provisions and review by the Governor, whether such prisoners are suitable for release. This case concerns the interaction of those statutory provisions with a settlement agreement arising from litigation about the Board's procedures. While serving an indeterminate prison term, Roy Butler filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on December 12, 2012, alleging in part that the Board had a responsibility to avoid parole determinations leading to grossly disproportionate prison terms. In 2013, petitioner Roy Butler and respondent, the Board, agreed to a settlement requiring the Board to calculate the \"base terms\" of an inmate serving an indeterminate sentence for use at the inmate's initial parole hearing. At the time of the settlement agreement, \"base terms\" governed the earliest possible release date for inmates serving indeterminate sentences. Since then, changes to California's criminal justice system have altered the relevant statutory landscape, such that \"base terms\" no longer govern the release date of inmates subject to indeterminate sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The question before us is whether those statutory developments warrant modification of the settlement order to relieve the Board of any separate obligation to calculate \"base terms\" under the agreement. The Court of Appeal concluded the answer was no, so the settlement order could remain in force despite the statutory changes. We disagree. The settlement agreement was premised on the idea that \"base terms\" played some role-defined by statute-in determining release dates for those sentenced to indeterminate terms. Given this premise, the elimination of \"base term\" calculations from any such role is a sufficiently material change that it not only justifies-but in this case, requires-modification of the settlement by the Court of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court of Appeal also concluded that specific \"base term\" calculations were necessary to assure life prisoners would not suffer constitutionally excessive punishment. Here too, we differ with the appellate court. Base term calculations no longer play a role in the public safety assessments undertaken by the Board to determine the release dates for inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms, and are not designed or obviously well-suited as a tool for avoiding unconstitutionally long terms of incarceration. And, at least to some extent, these inmates are protected against disproportionate punishment through other means, such as provisions ending indeterminate sentences when individuals have served the statutory minimum term and have been found suitable for release. In light of the state's current sentencing regime and the existence of parole procedures focusing on public safety determinations, the Board is not constitutionally required to continue calculating base terms as required in the settlement order. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner Roy Butler was convicted of second degree murder in 1988. What Butler told detectives at the time of his arrest is that he and acquaintance Lanzester Hymes decided to attack Richard Davis because Davis had been abusing his girlfriend\n   Jane Woods, a friend of Butler's. On September 28, 1987, Butler and Hymes armed themselves with knives and went to the apartment that Davis, Hymes, and Woods shared. According to\n   Butler, he was hiding inside the bathroom when Hymes fatally stabbed Davis. After Butler pleaded guilty, he received a sentence of 15 years to life. Butler became eligible for parole in 1997, but the parole authority denied his application for parole at that hearing and at several subsequent hearings. After the Board denied his application at a hearing in February 2012, Butler filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which led to the case before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to 1977, California used an \"indeterminate\" sentencing regime for the vast majority of felonies.

Now, most felonies are subject to defined terms of confinement. But certain serious offenses, including noncapital murder, remain subject to indeterminate sentences. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20P.3d%20783\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sentence of 15 years to life Butler received in 1988 is an example of this type of punishment. For inmates serving indeterminate sentences, the parole authority (now called the Board of Parole Hearings) continues to determine the end of their period of incarceration via a determination that the inmate is suitable for parole. (See generally Pen. Code, \u00a7 3041.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The standard for parole suitability is whether the inmate \"will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison.\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2281, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When this action commenced, a previous version of section 3041 governed the Board's authority to set release dates for indeterminately-sentenced offenders. (Former \u00a7 3041 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Dannenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 34 Cal.4th at pp. 1078-1079,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20417\">\n    23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20P.3d%20783\">\n    104 P.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [describing this version of the statute].) Subdivision (a) of that statute directed the Board to set parolees' release dates \"in a manner that will provide uniform terms for offenses of similar gravity and magnitude in respect to their threat to the public.\" (Former \u00a7 3041, subd. (a).) The statute further directed the Board, when setting release dates, to \"consider the number of victims of the crime ... and other factors in mitigation or aggravation of the crime.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20P.3d%20783\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To implement this duty, the Board adopted regulations for each indeterminate sentence offense. These regulations expressly rely on and reference section 3041 as enabling authority. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 2280 [listing section 3041 as a statutory reference], 2400 [\"This article\n   implements Penal Code section 3041\"].) One such set of regulations applies to noncapital murder committed on or after November 8, 1978. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2400 et seq.;\n   <em>\n    Dannenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 34 Cal.4th at pp. 1078-1079,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20417\">\n    23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20P.3d%20783\">\n    104 P.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Under the regulations, the Board is required to \"set a base term for each life prisoner who is found suitable for parole.\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2403, subd. (a).) In accordance with the regulations, the Board must determine that an inmate is suitable for parole\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   setting that inmate's base term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2402, subd. (a) [\"The panel shall first determine whether the life prisoner is suitable for release on parole\"]; see also\n   <em>\n    Dannenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 34 Cal.4th at pp. 1079-1080,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20417\">\n    23 Cal.Rptr.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20P.3d%20783\">\n    104 P.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A base term is calculated using matrices that appear in said regulations. For murder, the matrix's horizontal axis presents general\n   descriptions of the cause of the victim's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The vertical axis lists possible descriptions of the relationship between the inmate and victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first step in calculating the base term is to determine which intersection of the horizontal and vertical axes is \"most closely related to the circumstances of the crime.\" ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2403, subd. (a).) Each intersection then lists three alternative sentences-a lower, middle, and upper base term. For example, a second degree murder committed after November 8, 1978, through a \"Direct\" mechanism and against a victim with whom the inmate had a \"Prior Relationship\" would yield base term alternatives of 17, 18, or 19 years. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20P.3d%20783\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2403, subd. (c).) The Board's regulations require it to select the middle term unless it finds circumstances in mitigation or aggravation (as defined elsewhere in the regulations). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2403, subd. (a).) A finding that mitigating circumstances exist leads to the selection of the lower base term, while a finding of aggravating circumstances leads to the selection of the upper base term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 2404, subd. (a), 2405, subd. (a).) The Board then modifies an inmate's base term for any enhancements related to the offense (such as use of a firearm), leading to the inmate's so-called \"adjusted base term.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2406.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under this version of the regulatory scheme, the Board begins its assessment of an inmate's earliest possible release date by calculating his or her adjusted base term. These regulations allow the Board to then postpone the release date if the inmate has other convictions ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 2407 - 2409 ) or to advance it for any postconviction credits the inmate has received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2410.) It is this final date that determines when an inmate found suitable for parole may be released. Under these regulations, a parolee cannot be released until the inmate has served at least this amount of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2411, subds.

Among other contentions, Butler argued that the Board violated the state and federal Constitutions through its policy of deferring the calculation of an inmate's base term until it found the inmate suitable for parole. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20375\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Court of Appeal appointed counsel who assisted Butler in filing a supplemental habeas petition.

The supplemental petition reiterated Butler's constitutional argument and added a separate claim arguing that insufficient evidence supported the Board's denial of parole in Butler's case. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 1228 &amp; fn. 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20375\">\n    187 Cal.Rptr.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Court of Appeal bifurcated the action into two separate cases; one concerned whether sufficient evidence supported denial of parole in Butler's case, while the other addressed the constitutionality of deferring base term calculations. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=187%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20375\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Court of Appeal eventually issued orders to show cause in both cases.

On remand, the Board vacated its earlier denial of parole and held a new\n   hearing at which it found Butler suitable for parole.

The parties eventually agreed to a settlement in December 2013 that required the Board to calculate an inmate's base and adjusted base terms at the inmate's initial parole hearing (or, for inmates who already had their initial hearing, at the inmate's next scheduled parole hearing). The stipulated order also required the Board to amend its regulations to codify this new approach. The Court of Appeal retained jurisdiction over the case until the amended regulations became effective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later, the Court of Appeal granted Butler's request for attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

The Board did not petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the years since the parties settled the case before us, legislators and the electorate made major changes to California's criminal justice system. Three of those changes are potentially relevant to the issues\n   before us. First, Senate Bill No. 260 became effective on January 1, 2014. (Stats. 2013, ch. 312.) Under this law, inmates who committed indeterminate sentence offenses before turning 18 years old would \"be paroled regardless of the manner in which the [B]oard set release dates pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 3041.\" (\u00a7 3046, subd. (c).) The result is that youth offenders are released once found suitable for parole, regardless of the minimum sentence that the offender's base term would otherwise provide. In 2018, the Legislature extended the benefits of Senate Bill No. 260 to inmates who committed offenses at 25 years of age or younger. (Stats. 2017, ch. 675.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the Board altered its treatment of certain elderly inmates to comply with a February 2014 federal court order. (See\n   <em>\n    Plata v. Brown\n   </em>\n   (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2014, No. 3:01-cv-01351-JST).) The order required the\n   Board to \"[f]inalize and implement\" new parole procedures for inmates who are at least 60 years old and who have served sentences of 25 years or more. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3 \u00b64(e).) In response, the Board announced expedited parole hearings for those elderly inmates who have served a minimum of 25 years and a new policy of considering an inmate's advanced age, long-term confinement, and diminished physical condition in determining their suitability for parole. (See Board of Parole Hearings, Cal. Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Elderly Parole Program (June 16, 2014) p. 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, as of June 2014, elderly inmates are also paroled upon a finding of suitability, regardless of what limit base terms would otherwise impose on the inmates' release dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Third-and most significantly-the Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 230 in 2015. (Stats. 2015, ch. 470.) This legislation excised the language from former section 3041, subdivision (a) requiring the Board to set parolees' release dates \"in a manner that will provide uniform terms for offenses of similar gravity and magnitude with respect to their threat to the public\"-the very language on which the Board relied in devising the base term system. Senate Bill No. 230 provided\n   instead that \"[u]pon a grant of parole, the inmate shall be released subject to all applicable review periods. However, an inmate shall not be released before reaching his or her minimum eligible parole date as set pursuant to Section 3046.\" ( \u00a7 3041, subd. (a)(4) ; Stats. 2015, ch. 470, \u00a7 1.) In turn, section 3046 provides that an inmate shall not be released until the inmate has served the greater of (1) seven years, or (2) a minimum term set by relevant statute, if one exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00a7 3046, subd. (a).) Because of this legislation, base terms no longer control the release date for nonyouthful, nonelderly inmates either. Instead, those inmates' indeterminate terms end when the inmate is both (1) found suitable for parole and (2) has served their statutory minimum term (subject, of course, to the Board's internal review procedures and the Governor's power to reverse a grant of parole or request further review (see \u00a7\u00a7 3041, subd. (b), 3041.1, 3041.2 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The most important aspect of these changes, for present purposes, is that base terms no longer play a defined role in determining the release date for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   inmate sentenced to an indeterminate term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After SB 230 went into effect in January 2016, the Board moved to modify the December 2013 settlement agreement. According to the Board, it should be relieved of its obligations to calculate base terms and promulgate new regulations for calculating base\n   terms at an inmate's initial parole hearing. In essence, the Board argued that changes to the statutory scheme eliminated the Board's authority or need to calculate base terms. The Court of Appeal denied the motion. It declined to modify the settlement order on the basis that the order \"does not conflict\" with any subsequent changes to the parole hearing process. The court also reasoned that the calculation of base terms was necessary to \"assure life prisoners will not suffer constitutionally excessive punishment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We granted the Board's petition for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We must now decide whether the changes discussed above are sufficiently material to require modification of the Board's obligations to calculate inmates' base terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties' settlement in this case was given effect in an injunctive order over which the Court of Appeal retained jurisdiction.

When a\n   court decides not to modify an order despite a material change in the law fundamentally undermining the presumptions underlying the parties' acceptance of a settlement agreement, its decision ordinarily constitutes an abuse of discretion.

Postsettlement changes to California's criminal justice system are at issue here, principally the fact that base terms no longer directly control the release date for indeterminately-sentenced inmates. The Board argues that these changes are sufficiently material because they have \"emptied base terms of any meaning and function.\" Butler, by contrast, argues that modification is appropriate only when an injunctive order \"conflicts with or violat[es]\" current law. And, Butler continues, far from conflicting with these subsequent developments, the settlement order in fact furthers their purpose of reducing the state's prison population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court of Appeal did not modify the injunction order. In continuing to embrace the stipulated agreement as it stood before the recent raft of legal changes, the court observed that the agreement did not directly conflict with the new legal regime and held that the changes in the law were not sufficiently material to warrant modification. Yet in so concluding, the appellate court did not fully consider the extent to which the intervening legal changes have undermined the settlement's foundational assumptions, even if the changes fell short of creating an actual conflict with the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its argument, the Board relies on cases involving injunctions that conflict with current law. These cases can be distinguished from what is before us. In\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   , for example, the trial court entered an injunctive order barring school districts for charging fees for transportation to and from school.

But\n   <em>\n    System Federation\n   </em>\n   also dealt with an injunctive order that conflicted with subsequent legal developments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This case is different. Although the relevant statutes and regulations have changed since the settlement, the Board faces no direct conflict between the injunctive order and existing statutes. Senate Bill No. 260 and Assembly Bill No. 1308 require that youth offenders be released once found suitable for parole-irrespective of any base term calculations. (Stats. 2013, ch. 312; Stats. 2017, ch. 675.) And\n   under the Elderly Parole Program, eligible elderly inmates who have served a minimum of 25 years may be released to parole if they are found suitable, regardless of what limit base terms would have otherwise imposed on the inmates' release dates. Finally, Senate Bill No. 230 requires that an\n   inmate's sentence ends once he is found suitable for parole and he has served his statutory minimum term. (Stats. 2015, ch. 470.) The order does not, as in\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    System Federation\n   </em>\n   , prevent the bound party from doing something that it unquestionably has a right to do under current law. Instead, it requires the Board to do something that no longer has any apparent significance under its own statutes or regulations. For this reason, we think the cases on which the Board relies are inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But neither does Butler persuade when he contends modification of a continuing injunction\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   a conflict between the injunction and current law. To support this argument, Butler cites\n   <em>\n    Firefighters v. City of Cleveland\n   </em>\n   (1986)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/\">\n    478 U.S. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/\">\n    92 L.Ed.2d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Firefighters\n   </em>\n   ). Yet\n   <em>\n    Firefighters\n   </em>\n   is a federal case with no direct relevance to the question before us. It concerned a consent decree, under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, designed to remedy past racial discrimination in the City of Cleveland's fire department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 505-508,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

The union representing the firefighters objected, arguing that the decree violated section 706(g) of title VII, which provides that \" '[n]o order of the court shall require the ... promotion of an individual ... if such individual was refused ... advancement ... for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion' \" etc. (\n   <em>\n    Firefighters\n   </em>\n   , at p. 514,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , italics omitted, quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (g).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the argument, holding that consent decrees\n   do not qualify as \" 'order[s] of the court' \" under section 706(g) because parties enter into them voluntarily.

The court then went on to cabin this conclusion by noting, in language that Butler cites, that courts cannot accept a consent decree that \"conflicts with or violates the statute upon which the complaint was based.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 526,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209292\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/501/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Even assuming this case sheds any light on the general issue before us, the morsel of it Butler quotes-read in context-does not announce a standard for modification of an injunctive order. In light of the case's procedural posture, it is quite clear the\n   <em>\n    Firefighters\n   </em>\n   court simply reiterated a more general principle underlying injunctive relief: that consent decrees should be consistent with governing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Contrary to what Butler's contention implies, flexibility is a touchstone of a court's power to modify an injunctive order. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 533 [allowing for modification based on \"a material\n   change in the facts\" or even simply because \"the ends of justice would be served by the modification\"]; see also\n   <em>\n    Sontag Chain Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.2d at p. 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20P.2d%20689\">\n    113 P.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [describing courts' power to modify injunctive orders as \"an inherent one,\" the exercise of which \"is determined by the facts and circumstances of each particular case, with a view to administering justice between the litigants\"].) Of course, statutory changes having only a tenuous bearing on a settlement agreement do not necessarily give rise to a requirement to modify the agreement. (See\n   <em>\n    Professional Engineers v. Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   (1997)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1005939\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/15/543/#p574\">\n    15 Cal.4th 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20467\">\n    63 Cal.Rptr.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=936%20P.2d%20473\">\n    936 P.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to modify the initially-imposed terms of an injunction despite subsequent legislative changes].) Where modification of a consent decree is neither foreclosed because of constitutional considerations nor required because of sufficiently important changed circumstances,\n   a court with jurisdiction over a consent decree has discretion to decide whether to modify the consent decree in light of the particular circumstances of the case. Given the nature and extent of statutory changes at issue, however, the relevant inquiry is therefore whether the statutory changes made since entry of the stipulated judgment are sufficiently material not only to permit, but in this case to require, modification of that judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Sontag Chain Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.2d at p. 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20P.2d%20689\">\n    113 P.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) In arguing that they are, the Board cites three changes: new rules for youth offenders (Senate Bill No. 260 and Assembly Bill No. 1308); the federal court\n   order relating to elderly inmates; and Senate Bill No. 230, which eliminated the statutory language on which the Board relied in devising base terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Changes of such magnitude are consequential enough to require the settlement agreement's modification. Although the new sources of law differ in certain details,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   all three are similar in establishing parole regimes that do not rely on an inmate's base term. Together, they create a new legal landscape wherein base terms no longer play a defined role in the Board's determination of parolee release dates. This is no trifling change. The terms to which the Board agreed in 2013 were significant, but they were also limited: the Board agreed to calculate, at an earlier time and regardless of suitability for parole, inmates' base terms-something that the Board's regulations anticipated at some point for most inmates subject to indeterminate sentences. Our conclusion might be different if the agreement reflected the parties' agreement regarding how the Board could comply, for example, with a responsibility to implement judicially-recognized constitutional principles in undertaking statutory parole determinations. But it is clear that the settlement agreement emanated from the then-existing statutory and regulatory structure and embodied, at best, an agnostic reading as to whether base terms had legal significance outside of that structure. The agreement expressly defines \"base term\" and \"adjusted base term\" by reference to the regulations that imbued those terms with legal significance. These regulations in turn reference section 3041, the statute that Senate Bill No. 230 amended. (See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2400 [\"This article implements Penal Code section 3041\"].) By citing these regulations, the settlement evinces an agreement that base\n   terms have legal significance because they were pivotal in determining release dates for indeterminately-sentenced inmates. And advising inmates of their base terms had the salutary rehabilitative effect of informing each inmate of his or her earliest possible release date, if found suitable for parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This review of the settlement agreement readily showcases how base terms were relevant in the settlement agreement for a specific reason. To wit: they were relevant in the existing regulatory structure. Indicia from the agreement, as well as the contemporary statutory and regulatory scheme, reveal that the settlement relied on base terms having legal significance within that framework. Specifically, an inmate's calculated release date commenced with his or her adjusted base term, as contemplated in the settlement agreement. When that agreement was drafted, the Board was required by statute to set a provisional \"parole release date\" founded on \"criteria\" that would \"provide\n   uniform terms\" for similar offenses. (Former \u00a7 3041, subd. (a).) The Board implemented that statutory mandate by promulgating regulations requiring the calculation of a base term, using a matrix that measured the seriousness of the offense and adjusted for aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

The Board's policy was to calculate the base term not before parole eligibility, but after he or she was found suitable for parole. The settlement agreement, however, changed the timing of an inmate's base term calculation to his or her initial parole hearing or at his or\n   her next scheduled hearing if the initial hearing had already occurred. What the settlement agreement did not alter is the Board's underlying statutory and regulatory duty to calculate base terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That base terms had some role to play in the sentencing regime strikes us as a \"controlling fact[ ]\" on which the injunction rested.

Postsettlement legal changes make that controlling fact no longer true. Base terms lack defined statutory significance-and informing inmates of their base terms no longer has an obvious rehabilitative purpose because those terms no longer control the release dates for inmates found suitable for parole. Put another way, the settlement agreement presupposes that base terms form part of the framework for parolee release date calculations. As a result of the changes described above emphasizing the centrality of public safety considerations, base terms are no longer part of that framework. We therefore conclude that the changes in the law constitute a material change in the stipulated order. And we think that this change is sufficiently material to raise substantial doubts as to whether the injunction continues to be \"necessary or desirable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Union Interchange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 52 Cal.2d at p. 604,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=342%20P.2d%20249\">\n    342 P.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In holding that the postsettlement changes were not material, the Court of Appeal focused on whether the stipulated settlement \"conflict[ed]\" with the new legal regime. What this approach ignores is that Code of Civil Procedure section 533 provides for modification of an injunctive order not only in instances of conflict but also upon a \"material change in the facts.\" The state's parole regime has changed significantly enough to warrant relieving the Board of its obligations, even in the absence of a direct conflict between the settlement and current law. (See\n   <em>\n    Sontag Chain Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 18 Cal.2d at p. 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20P.2d%20689\">\n    113 P.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [whether to modify an injunctive\n   order \"is determined by the facts and circumstances of each particular case\"].)

And indeed, the Court of Appeal also based its ruling on the motion to modify the injunction on the theory that base terms are necessary to \"assure life prisoners will not suffer constitutionally excessive punishment.\" What we nonetheless find is that, notwithstanding the importance of judicially-articulated constitutional considerations relevant to the Board's functions, there is no constitutional basis to require continued adherence to the injunctive provisions obligating the Board to calculate base terms. We thus hold that the Court of Appeal also abused its discretion in ordering the Board to continue calculating base terms as a constitutional requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   An inmate serving an indeterminate sentence has a constitutional right to a sentence not disproportionate to his or her offense.

The postsettlement changes to section 3041, subdivision (a) have not undermined the force of that aspect of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In effect, California's current and mostly determinate sentencing laws, along with statutory reforms to the parole process, have all but rendered specific base term calculations for individuals subject to parole determinations unnecessary as a means of ensuring against unconstitutionally excessive punishment. Plainly, defendants retain the ability to perform the base term calculation or something equivalent and submit it to the Board for consideration. Moreover, the Board retains responsibility to take account, in its parole determinations, of public safety concerns that a base term calculation could have illuminated. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2281, subd. (a) [explaining that the standard for parole suitability is whether \"the prisoner will pose an unreasonable risk of danger to society if released from prison\"].) For example, the Board was required, in calculating base terms for certain life offenses, to consider factors such as the crime's \"threat to the public,\" as well as mitigating or aggravating circumstances. ( Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2403, subd. (g).) But it can take account of such concerns without calculating base terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The settlement agreement approved by the parties in 2013 required the Board to calculate an inmate's base term at his or her initial parole hearing. At the time the parties ratified that agreement, a calculated base term directly impacted the release date for inmates serving indeterminate life sentences. Not so today. Instead, the release\n   date for indeterminately-sentenced adult inmates-like Butler-is now guided by the date when an inmate has served the statutory minimum term and is found suitable for parole based on statutory public safety-related criteria,\n   subject to limited exception. These changes to California's criminal justice system do not diminish the societal interest in avoiding arbitrary parole determinations. They do, however, dictate that base terms no longer directly control the release date for prisoners subject to indeterminate sentences. That these statutory changes are material to these parties' agreement requires, legally and practically, modification of the injunctive order by the Court of Appeal. Moreover, sentencing in California involves primarily determinate sentences and parole determinations involving public safety considerations-so specific base term calculations are not a constitutionally necessary measure for guarding inmates serving indeterminate sentences against disproportionate punishment.\n   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and order the settlement agreement modified so that the Board of Parole Hearings is relieved of its obligations to calculate base terms and adjusted base terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   CANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CHIN, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   CORRIGAN, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   LIU, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   KRUGER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   RUBIN, J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Indeterminate sentences of life imprisonment are also authorized for some felonies less serious than murder under, for example, the Three Strikes Law.
