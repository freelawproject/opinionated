This is a matter of considerable importance to these judges because, on January 1, 2013, JRS II became subject to the provisions of the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which amended virtually all state employee retirement systems to begin addressing the state's enormous unfunded pension liability and returning these systems to actuarially sound footing. Among other things, PEPRA increases employee contributions, provides for fluctuating contribution rates based on market performance and actuarial projections, and bases the amount of monthly pension payments on an employee's final three years of compensation, rather than on only the final year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude, as did the trial court, that the judges did not obtain a vested right in JRS II benefits as judges-elect, but rather obtained a vested right to retirement benefits only upon taking office, after PEPRA went into effect. We also conclude PEPRA's provisions pertaining to fluctuating pension contributions do not violate the non-diminution clause of the California Constitution ( Cal. Const., art. III, \u00a7 4 ), nor do they impermissibly delegate legislative authority over judicial compensation ( Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 19 ). We therefore affirm the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petitioning judges were elected to superior court judgeships in June and July of 2012. However, the terms of their offices did not commence, and they did not begin to draw a state salary, until January 7, 2013. ( Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 16, subd. (c) [\"Terms of judges of superior courts are six years beginning the Monday after January 1 following their election.\"].) Other judges were appointed to office during 2012. Unlike appellants, they assumed office on or before December 31, 2012, and the parties do not dispute that their retirement benefits are governed by pre-PEPRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   JRS II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is an additional, third group of judges-those who were elected during 2012, but who held public employment at the time and, thus, were already members of a public retirement system. Their retirement benefits are also governed by pre-PEPRA JRS II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Between the time appellants were elected and the time they assumed their judicial offices, the Legislature passed, and the Governor signed into law, PEPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants aver that prior to taking office, and in choosing to give up their private law practices and go into public service, they relied on representations by the state about JRS II. For example, after being elected but before assuming office, they were advised by state personnel about the provisions of pre-PEPRA JRS II-which include an 8 percent contribution rate and a monthly pension benefit based on the final year of salary-and were given a JRS II pamphlet. In fact, they allege state personnel expressly represented that \"[u]pon PEPRA's passage and following its effective date,\" the pre-PEPRA provisions of JRS II would nevertheless continue to govern their retirement. And, for more than a year after they assumed office, until March 2014, the state treated the judges as within pre-PEPRA JRS II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state then did an about-face and notified appellants they were subject to PEPRA's less favorable provisions. As a result, the judges' take home pay\n   in 2014 was reduced by 7.25 percent due to additional contributions to the retirement system (making their total contribution 15.25 percent of their salary) and was reduced by a further (unspecified) amount in 2015 due to an increased contribution rate. Appellants allege they \"are now subject to a fluctuating and increasing-as opposed to [a] guaranteed-rate of contribution towards their pension benefits.\" The judges will also receive lower monthly pension payments, as under post-PEPRA JRS II, the amount will be based on the average of their final three years of compensation, rather than their final year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The judges filed a verified petition for writ of mandate on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated to compel the State of California, the Judicial Council, the CalPERS Board of Administration, and the state's Comptroller (collectively respondents) to include them within pre-PEPRA JRS II. The judges additionally alleged respondents are subject to promissory and equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer, deeming it dispositive that appellants' terms of office and their actual employment began on January 7, 2013. Their \"statutory entitlement to pension benefits therefore began\" after PEPRA was operative and not in 2012, when they were elected to, but had not yet been sworn into, their offices. \"Accordingly,\" said the trial court, \"PEPRA does not unconstitutionally impair their pension rights. Similarly, PEPRA does not violate the constitutional prohibition on lowering judicial salary during a judge's term of\n   office....\" The court also rejected the judges' assertions that PEPRA unconstitutionally violates their right to equal protection and delegates to CalPERS the Legislature's authority to set judicial pay. The court concluded estoppel could not apply because the state respondents could not be compelled to act beyond their authority, which they would do if they treated appellants as within pre-PEPRA JRS II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Appellants are Subject to PEPRA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Judicial Retirement System and PEPRA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 1994, the Legislature made major changes to the then existing judicial retirement system, known as JRS I. (Cf. Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 75000 et seq., 75500 et seq. )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   These changes included significant contribution increases, lower monthly retirement benefits, the elimination of the option to retire before 20 years of service with a correlative reduction in pension benefits, and the\n   elimination of an economic incentive to defer retirement and work several additional years. ( \u00a7\u00a7 75521, 75522, 75601, 75602 ; see\n   <em>\n    Warner v. Public Employees' Retirement System\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363529\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/239/659/#p667\">\n    239 Cal.App.4th 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 667,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20870\">\n    190 Cal.Rptr.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Accordingly, under this more recently enacted retirement system, known as JRS II, judges receive significantly reduced retirement benefits than were provided under JRS I. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 667,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20870\">\n    190 Cal.Rptr.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   JRS II expressly described the judges to which it applied as follows: \" 'Judge' means a justice of the Supreme Court or of a court of appeal, or a judge of a superior court, municipal court, or justice court who is first elected or appointed to judicial office on or after November 9, 1994,\" which was the day following the 1994 general election. (\u00a7 75502, subd. (a).) Accordingly, judges \"elected or appointed\" before November 9, 1994, were grandfathered into, and continued to receive, the more favorable benefits of JRS I. (\u00a7\u00a7 75502, subd. (a), 75000, 75500.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under JRS II, the \"period of time a judge receive[s] a salary and ma[kes] contributions to the system by reason of holding office as a judge\" is known as the judge's \"service.\" (\u00a7 75502, subd. (c).) The state and counties, as applicable, deduct 8 percent from a judge's salary and deposit that amount in the JRS II retirement fund. ( \u00a7\u00a7 75601, 75602.) After attaining either 20 years of service and 65 years of age, or five years of service and 70 years of age, a \"judge is eligible to retire\" and receive a monthly pension payment based on the judge's salary during his or her final year in office and length of service. (\u00a7\u00a7 75502, subd. (d), 75522, subd. (a).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2012, nearly two decades after the enactment of JRS II, the California Legislature passed a comprehensive bill making significant changes to nearly all public retirement systems, including to JRS II. ( \u00a7\u00a7 7522 et seq., 75500 et seq. ) Effective January 1, 2013, PEPRA affects public employees who are \"new members\" of their retirement systems. (\u00a7\u00a7 7522.02, subd. (b), 7522.04, subd. (f)(1), 7522.30, 7522.32.) A new \"member\" includes \"[a]n individual who becomes a member of any public retirement system for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, and who was not a member of any other public retirement system prior to that date.\" (\u00a7 7522.04, subd. (f)(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Among other things, under PEPRA, a new \"member\" must pay half of the \"normal cost\" of pension benefits (\u00a7\u00a7 7522.30, subd. (a), 7522.04, subd. (g) [defining \"[n]ormal cost\"] ), and the amount of a\n   member's monthly pension benefit depends on his or her highest average pay over the final three years of employment (\u00a7 7522.32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Under the Statutory Language, Appellants are Subject to PEPRA\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellants point out that they come within the parameters of JRS II-that is, they were \"first elected or appointed to judicial office on or after\n   November 9, 1994.\" (\u00a7 75502, subd. (a).) They do, indeed. But that does not mean they are not affected by the amendments to JRS II made by PEPRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As set forth above, PEPRA took effect on January 1, 2013-six days before appellants assumed their judicial offices. By its own terms, the Act applies to any \"[n]ew member,\" meaning an \"individual who becomes a member of any public retirement system for the first time on or after January 1, 2013.\" (\u00a7 7522.04, subd. (f)(1).) Accordingly, PEPRA applies to any judge who becomes a \"member\" of JRS II for the first time on or after January 1, 2013. (See \u00a7 75505, subd. (a) [expressly amending JRS II to require adherence to PEPRA to \"the extent applicable\"]; see also \u00a7\u00a7 7522.02, subd. (a) &amp; (b), 7522.04, subd. (f)(1), 7522.30, 7522.32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   PEPRA, itself, does not address when a judge becomes a \"member\" of JRS II. However, JRS II and the Public Employees' Retirement Law (PERL), read together, provide the answer to this question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The statutes establishing and governing JRS II instruct that the judicial retirement system \"shall be administered and governed pursuant to [PERL] to the same extent and with the same effect as if those provisions are contained in this chapter [governing JRS II], except for those provisions that ... conflict with any provision of this chapter.\" (\u00a7 75505, subd. (a).) PERL, in turn, specifies that an \"employee becomes a member\" of his or her retirement system \"upon his or her\n   <em>\n    entry into employment\n   </em>\n   .\" (\u00a7 20281, italics added; see\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Water Dist. v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2004)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"801067\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/32/491/#p499\">\n    32 Cal.4th 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20857\">\n    9 Cal.Rptr.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20966\">\n    84 P.3d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) We discern no conflict in reading JRS II as including this provision of PERL. In fact, other provisions of JRS II are entirely consistent with PERL's directive that a public employee becomes a \"member\" of his or her retirement system upon \"entry into employment.\" It is only upon assuming judicial office that a judge goes on the public payroll, is authorized to perform judicial duties, commences making contributions to the JRS II retirement system, and begins to accrue \"monetary credits\" towards a pension. (See Cal. Const. art. XX, \u00a7 3 [must take oath of office before entering upon duties of office]; \u00a7 75502, subd. (f) [contributions made from salary]; \u00a7 75520 [monetary credits].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellants could not, of course, be said to have entered into judicial employment as of the time they were elected. On the contrary, at least some of the appellants remained employed by their law firms to conduct an orderly disengagement from their practices and, perhaps, to ensure they received the full annual compensation they were promised. As long as they remained employed by their law firms, they could not also be employed as a judge, as judges are prohibited from engaging in such outside legal employment. (See Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 4B, D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellants' reliance on section 75606 is misplaced. This statute prohibits judges\n   <em>\n    who are already bench officers\n   </em>\n   , and who are seeking a new term or a different judicial office, from withdrawing their pension contributions before the election or before transitioning to their new office, if elected. (\u00a7 75606, subd. (a).) In other words, this statute applies to individuals\n   who\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   judges and not merely judges-elect, and who have\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   paid into JRS II and have\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   accrued pension benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is, moreover, a striking difference between the statutory language that closed JRS I to future judges and established JRS II, on the one hand, and PEPRA's language modifying JRS II, on the other. As set forth above, the statutes closing JRS I and creating JRS II specifically defined judge to mean \"a justice of the Supreme Court or of a court of appeal, or a judge of a superior court, municipal court, or justice court\n   <em>\n    who is first elected or appointed\n   </em>\n   to judicial office on or after November 9, 1994.\" (\u00a7 75502, subd. (a), italics added.) While this language may be reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that judges who were merely\n   <em>\n    elected or appointed\n   </em>\n   before November 9, 1994, but who had not yet assumed their judicial offices, would become members of JRS I, rather than JRS II, no such language appears in PEPRA. Rather, PEPRA specifically applies to an individual who becomes \"a member of any public retirement system for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, and who was not a member of any other public retirement system prior to that date.\" (\u00a7 7522.04, subd. (f)(1).) An individual who is a judge-elect and not yet a judge, and who has never been a member of any public retirement system, plainly falls within this statutory provision of PEPRA modifying JRS II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In an effort to overcome this difference in the statutory language of JRS II as enacted, and as modified by PEPRA, appellants point out that, after the enactment of PEPRA, some members of the Legislature became concerned about its application to judges elected in 2012, but who could not, and did not, assume their offices until the commencement of new terms, on January 7, 2013. Accordingly, the 2013 cleanup legislation making numerous tweaks to PEPRA (Sen. Bill No. 13 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) ) initially included language that \"would have excluded from the definition of 'new member' as used in the provisions requiring new members to pay at least 50% of the normal cost rate, a judge who was elected to office prior to January 1, 2013, but may have become a member of the Judges' Retirement System II (JRS II) for the first time on or after that date.\" (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 13 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sep. 12, 2013, p. 2.) However, this language was ultimately stricken from the bill before passage. (Stats. 2013, ch. 528, \u00a7 3; see \u00a7 7522.04, subd. (f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The following year, in 2014, the Legislature succeeded in passing legislation (Assem. Bill No. 837 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) ) that would have \"specifically exclude[d] from the definition of 'new member' a judge, as defined in specified existing law, elected to office before January 1, 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) An assembly report stated the bill's author believed the legislation merely corrected a \" 'technical' \" oversight, that PEPRA \" 'was intended to apply to judges first elected or appointed after January 1, 2013,' \" and that \" '[i]t is clear under PEPRA that judges appointed before this date are included under the old pension contribution rules.' \" (Assem. Conc. Sen. Amends. to Assem. Bill No. 837 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 4, 2014, p. 2.) The Governor, however, vetoed the legislation, stating: \"This measure creates an exemption to the California Public Employees' Pension Reform Act of 2013. I am unwilling to begin chipping away at these reforms.\" (Governor's veto message to Assem. on Assem. Bill No. 837 (Sep. 28, 2014) Recess J. No. 25 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) p. 6805.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellants claim these recent legislative efforts show that the intent of the Legislature when it passed PEPRA in 2012 was akin to its intent when it enacted JRS II in 1994 and grandfathered in both individuals elected to and holding judicial office prior to November 9, 1994. However, in our view, this subsequent legislative history underscores that, as written and enacted, PEPRA does not grandfather into pre-PEPRA JRS II individuals who, as of January 1, 2013, had only been elected to, but who had not yet assumed, judicial office and who had never been a member of any public pension plan. While some individual legislators may have been of the view that the language proposed in 2013 and 2014 would make only a \"technical\" change to PEPRA to clarify the Legislature's intent when it passed the Act in 2012, it is too much of a stretch to say that the unsuccessful legislative efforts in 2013 and 2014 reflect the collective legislative intent in 2012, particularly since the proposed language was removed from the 2013 cleanup legislation\n   <em>\n    while it was still in the Legislature\n   </em>\n   and the Governor understood the language proposed in 2014 as creating a new exception to the Act.

Appellants suggest section 75505 provides the needed administrative latitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Section 75505 provides in pertinent part: \"To the extent applicable, the Board of Administration of the Public Employees' Retirement System [PERS] shall administer [JRS II] in conformance with [PEPRA] to the same extent and with the same effect as if the provisions of the act are contained in [JRS II]. If the Board of Administration of [PERS] determines that there is a conflict between the provisions of [PEPRA] and [JRS II], the provisions of [PEPRA] shall control.\" (\u00a7 75505, subd. (a).) This provision plainly compels compliance with PEPRA, and while it may give PERS some initial say-so as to the existence of a conflict between JRS II, as enacted, and PEPRA, it categorically resolves that conflict in favor of PEPRA. It in no way grants the state any authority to disregard PEPRA, and as we have discussed, the state would have to ignore PEPRA to grant appellants pre-PEPRA JRS II benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Appellants further contend that whatever PEPRA may say, that statutory scheme is ultimately of no consequence because the initial assurances they were given about retirement benefits under pre-PEPRA JRS II, were made before PEPRA went into effect. This does not change the fact that requiring respondents to treat appellants as coming within pre-PEPRA JRS II would require respondents to act beyond the legal authority they now have. In addition, JRS II, even as originally enacted, reserved to the Legislature the power to increase the base 8 percent rate of contribution as \"appropriate\" and to \"reduce\" pension benefits. (\u00a7 75603 [\"The Legislature reserves the right to increase the rates of contribution prescribed by Sections 75601 and 75602\n   in the amounts as it may find appropriate.\"]; \u00a7 75604 [\"The Legislature reserves the right to reduce any benefits applicable to any person who becomes a judge who is subject to this chapter.\"]; cf.\n   <em>\n    Walsh v.

First, these cases involved statutory provisions that impacted judges for the first time\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   their terms of office. Here, in contrast, PEPRA took effect prior to the time appellants assumed their judicial offices. Second, none of these cases involved contributions to a retirement system, like post-PEPRA JRS II, which (a) is mandatory and (b) fixes contributions by way of a formula that applies to virtually all public employee retirement systems and allows for adjustment based on market performance and actuarial data. In other words, there appears to be no case from any jurisdiction that has considered whether the kind of contribution formula that makes PEPRA retirement systems far more actuarially sound than earlier systems, results in a constitutionally impermissible reduction in judicial salaries when that formula calls for an increase in employee contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Nevertheless, in our view, the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   and the New York high court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Bransten\n   </em>\n   provide some guidance on the issue at hand. We are particularly persuaded by the Supreme Court's view, as explained in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , that a new deduction from take home pay does not\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   violate the non-diminution clause. We are also persuaded that any increased contributions required under PEPRA's contribution formula are, as described in both\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bransten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    indirect\n   </em>\n   reductions in a judge's salary. Indeed, as respondents point out, under JRS II, even as amended by PEPRA, a judge's pension contributions are essentially banked for his or her future withdrawal, either as a lump sum with interest or as part of a defined monthly benefit. So, while part of his or her salary is set aside for payment at a later time, no part of a judicial salary is eliminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We are further persuaded that the \"four factor\" template the Supreme Court set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , and which the New York court applied in\n   <em>\n    Bransten\n   </em>\n   , provides a sensible means of determining whether a financial obligation imposed on sitting judges runs afoul of the non-diminution clause. Applied here, this template yields the following points:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   First, given the breadth of PEPRA, the \"appropriate\" comparison group is virtually all other state employees eligible to participate in a public retirement system. While this is akin to the federal employee group covered by the Social Security tax disapproved, as to sitting federal judges in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , it is also equivalent to the New York state employee group impacted by the reduction in state contributions (and commensurate increase in employee contributions) considered and approved in\n   <em>\n    Bransten.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Second, unlike the unique and singular financial impact on federal judges of the Social Security tax at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , PEPRA's contribution formula has widespread effect and does not financially affect only judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Third, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , where nearly all federal judges were already covered by Social Security due to prior employment and there was no need for them to be brought into the system by the new legislation, a California judge becomes eligible for retirement benefits under JRS II only on assuming judicial office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Fourth, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , where the government's justification for the singular financial impact on federal judges (\"to make up for the fact that the judicial retirement system is basically a noncontributory system\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   directly impacted fundamental attributes of the federal judiciary, the state legislature enacted PEPRA in order to address the dire economic problems facing all public retirement systems and to make some headway towards returning these systems to actuarial sound footing. Furthermore, unlike the federal judicial retirement system, California's judicial retirement system has always been a contributory system. Accordingly, unlike the justification for the new Social Security tax at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , the justification for PEPRA's challenged contribution formula does not cut to a core attribute of the state's judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Thus, \"[t]aken together,\" the four factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , do not reveal a law that \"is special-in its manner of singling out judges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 532 U.S. at p. 576,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1304060\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/121/1782/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) On the contrary, state judges are bearing the same financial obligation imposed on virtually every other state employee eligible to participate in a state retirement system. As the Little Hoover Commission found in its study leading to the enactment of PEPRA, this burden is a matter of economic imperative. And the fiscal integrity of the state's retirement systems, including JRS II, cannot be restored without it. (E.g., Little Hoover Com., Public Pensions For Retirement Security (Report No. 204, Feb. 2011) pp. i-ix.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Our conclusion that PEPRA's contribution formula does not run afoul of the non-diminution clause is also consistent with a line of cases from other\n   jurisdictions, of which\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Mack, Judge v. Guckenberger, Aud.,\n   </em>\n   (1942)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1024657\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/139/273/\">\n    139 Ohio St. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20N.E.2d%20840\">\n    39 N.E.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is a leading example. In\n   <em>\n    Guckenberger\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court considered whether a state law that set the compensation for common pleas judges on the basis of local population (as determined by federal census) violated the state's compensation clause, and specifically, the provision barring increases in compensation during a judge's term. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p 842.) This law had the effect of increasing judicial salaries during a term of office, when a new census showed an increase in local population. Observing that \"[e]very reasonable presumption must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of a statute\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20N.E.2d%20840\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 843 ), the Ohio court concluded the specified method of determining judicial compensation did not violate the compensation clause. \"[T]here is no inhibition,\" said the court, \"against the Legislature fixing such compensation before the term begins on a basis which may vary it in amount as time advances, provided that\n   <em>\n    basis\n   </em>\n   , within the contemplation and understanding\n   of both the judge and the people who elect him, is fixed, certain and unchangeable during his term.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 845.) The court also pointed out that because the manner in which the judges' compensation was determined was fixed prior to the commencement of their terms, the \"salutary purposes [of the state's compensation clause] are fully and effectually preserved by the terms of the present statute, albeit the compensation of the judge is made variable, from and after the last federal census becoming effective during his term.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 843-844.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Stiftel v.

The Delaware court observed additional states had subsequently followed these precedents, and it applied the same reasoning in holding statutorily authorized cost of living adjustments were permissible and could not be eliminated during a judge's term of office. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Much the same can be said about PEPRA's methodology for determining contribution rates. It is a methodology spelled out by statute (\u00a7\u00a7 7522.04, 7522.30, 7522.32) and which was in effect prior to the commencement of the terms of the petitioning judges. Its application year in and year out, to virtually all employees that participate in a public retirement system, cannot be said to be at odds with the purposes of our state's non-diminution clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No Impermissible Delegation of Legislative Authority over Salaries\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Appellants lastly contend PEPRA's contribution formula runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that only the Legislature is to \"prescribe compensation\n   for judges.\" ( Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 19.) Specifically, they object to the provisions stating that \"the system's actuary may use a single rate of contribution or an age-based rate of contribution as is applicable to that retirement system\" (\u00a7 7522.04, subd. (g) ) and that the \" 'normal cost rate' shall mean the annual actuarially determined normal cost for the plan of retirement benefits provided to the new member and shall be established based on the actuarial assumptions used to determine the liabilities and costs as part of the annual actuarial valuation.\" (\u00a7 7522.30, subd.
