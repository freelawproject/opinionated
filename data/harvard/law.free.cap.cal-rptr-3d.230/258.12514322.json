Specifically, sections 51.7 and 52.1 prohibit the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate Ralph Act and Bane Act claims that are made as a condition of certain contracts or of providing or receiving goods or services. They also mandate that the party seeking to enforce an agreement to arbitrate such claims prove the other party knowingly and voluntarily agreed to arbitration. Defendants contend (1) the trial court erred in its interpretation of the parties' arbitration agreement and (2) the Ralph Act's and Bane Act's special requirements for arbitration agreements are preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). We agree and reverse the trial court's order denying Defendants' petition to compel arbitration of Saheli's Ralph Act and Bane Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Saheli filed her initial complaint against Defendants on February 21, 2017. In the operative First Amended Complaint, Saheli alleges she is a native of Iran and completed medical training at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. After immigrating to the United States, she enrolled in a medical residency program at White Memorial. In July 2016, Saheli discovered and reported to White Memorial violations of the Health Insurance Portability and\n   Accountability Act (HIPAA) by physicians who were sending confidential protected health information by unsecured and unauthorized means. Over the next few\n   months, she also reported unsafe patient care and conditions. In September 2016, Saheli reported the violations to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Saheli alleges that, in response to such reports, Barrio commenced a \"campaign of retaliation, harassment, and intimidation\" against her, which included yelling at her and threatening to terminate her. According to Saheli, a substantial motivating factor for the yelling was the fact that she is female. In addition, Saheli alleges Barrio made several slurs concerning her Iranian nationality as well as sexual remarks about her and another resident. On March 2, 2017, Saheli was placed on a paid leave of absence pending termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these allegations, Saheli asserts nine causes of action against Defendants: (1) retaliation in violation of Health and Safety Code section 1278.5 ; (2) violation of the Ralph Act ( \u00a7 51.7 ); (3) violation of the Bane Act ( \u00a7 52.1 ); (4) sexual harassment (\u00a7 51.9); (5) retaliatory wrongful termination ( Lab. Code, \u00a7 1102.5 ); (6) wrongful termination in violation of fundamental public policy; (7) gender discrimination and harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq. ); (8) national origin discrimination and harassment under the FEHA; and (9) retaliation under the FEHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Petition to Compel Arbitration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 3, 2017, Defendants filed a petition to compel Saheli to arbitrate all of her claims, relying on an arbitration agreement found in an employment/training agreement and employee handbook (Arbitration Agreement).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Arbitration Agreement provides that it \"shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Arbitration Act of the state in which the Organization is located.\" It further provides that \"[a]rbitration pursuant to this [Arbitration Agreement] shall be the exclusive means to address any arbitrable dispute, and the parties mutually waive their right to a trial before a judge or jury in federal or state court in favor of arbitration under this [Arbitration Agreement]. Except as stated herein, the rights of the parties under this [Arbitration Agreement] shall be the same as those available to\n   them in a court of competent jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Arbitrable claims\" under the Arbitration Agreement are defined as \"those claims ... that arise out of, or are related to, (i) a claim of employment discrimination ...; (ii) a claim of wrongful or unlawful termination of employment, including claims of constructive discharge; (iii) a claim for wages or other compensation; (iv) a tort claim or any other claim in which punitive damages or emotional distress damages could be awarded that arose out of, or is related to, the employment relationship; (v) a claim that is related in any\n   manner to the claims described in (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, whether based on a statu[t]e, public policy, or otherwise.\" However, per the Arbitration Agreement's \"carve-out\" provision, \"[c]laims for unemployment compensation, claims under the National Labor Relations Act, claims under PAGA [Private Attorney General Act], claims for workers' compensation benefits, and any claim that is non-arbitrable under applicable state or federal law are not arbitrable under this [Arbitration Agreement].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Saheli opposed Defendants' petition, arguing the Arbitration Agreement was unenforceable with respect to her Ralph Act and Bane Act claims because it failed to comply with certain requirements for arbitration agreements mandated by those acts. Defendants countered that such requirements are preempted by the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court granted the petition in part and compelled Saheli to arbitrate all her claims except those under the Ralph Act and Bane Act. The court found that, per the terms of the Arbitration Agreement, the parties agreed not to arbitrate claims that are not arbitrable under California law. It further determined that, pursuant to sections 51.7 and 52.1, the waiver of any forum or procedure under the Ralph Act and Bane Act is unenforceable unless expressly not made as a condition of entering into a contract for services. Because Defendants failed to show the parties expressly agreed the Arbitration Agreement was not a condition of entering into a contract for services, the court concluded the agreement is unenforceable with respect to the Ralph Act and Bane Act claims. The trial court declined to consider whether these requirements are preempted by the FAA. Although not asserted as a defense by Saheli, the court proceeded to find the Arbitration Agreement is not unconscionable. It then compelled arbitration of Saheli's non-Ralph Act and - Bane Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Where, as here, the issues presented by a petition to compel arbitration involve only the interpretation of an arbitration agreement, and there are no factual disputes concerning the language of the agreement or its formation, a reviewing court determines the scope and enforceability of the agreement de novo.

Moreover, under California's general contract principles, \"references to California law incorporate the California Legislature's power to change the law retroactively.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . ) The high court further criticized the Court of Appeal for its failure to provide any reasoning or principles to suggest it would reach the same interpretation in a non-arbitration context, its use of language focused solely on arbitration, and its view that state law retains independent force even after being invalidated. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 469-470.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We perceive no meaningful difference between the phrases \" 'law of your state' \" and \" 'applicable state ... law' \" that would lead us to interpret the latter differently than the United States Supreme Court interpreted the former.

Here, the trial court denied in part Defendants' petition to compel arbitration after determining the Arbitration Agreement failed to comply with certain requirements found in the Ralph Act and Bane Act. Accordingly, to determine if the trial court erred, we must decide\n   whether those requirements are preempted by the FAA.

The FAA does not displace the Ralph Act and Bane Act. Nor does it interfere with their enforcement schemes or California's ability to curb discriminatory violence. Instead, the FAA simply mandates that we treat agreements to arbitrate, including agreements to arbitrate Ralph Act and Bane Act claims, as we would other contracts.

Thus, to find that sections 51.7's and 52.1's prohibitions on the enforcement of certain arbitration agreements codify existing rules of unconscionability would require us to declare all agreements to arbitrate Ralph Act and Bane Act\n   claims, regardless of their actual terms, to be substantively unconscionable.

As such, it would be preempted by the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   A declaration that all agreements to arbitrate Ralph Act and Bane Act claims are per se substantively unconscionable would necessarily be premised on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate. Indeed, we could not reach such a conclusion without finding, for whatever reason, that it is inherently unfair to require a party to arbitrate Ralph Act and Bane Act claims. Stated otherwise, Saheli essentially urges us to declare that arbitration, in the abstract and without regard to the specific procedures to which the parties agreed, is fundamentally incapable of fairly adjudicating an entire class of claims. Such a rule would itself represent an improper hostility toward arbitration that would not be permitted under the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Even if the FAA permitted such a declaration, sections 51.7's and 52.1's special requirements would still be inconsistent with the existing doctrine of unconscionability. First, by declaring unconscionable arbitration agreements that fail to comply with certain procedural requirements, sections 51.7 and 52.1 preclude courts from performing the sliding scale analysis typically employed to determine whether a specific arbitration agreement is enforceable. In addition, sections 51.7 and 52.1 alter the burden of proving unconscionability. Generally, the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to show an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.

Sections 51.7 and 52.1, however, place the burden on the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement to show it was made knowingly and voluntarily and not as a condition of the contract or of providing or receiving goods or services. ( \u00a7 51.7, subd. (b)(5).) In effect, this shifts the burden to the party seeking enforcement to show that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable. In that way, sections 51.7 and 52.1 depart from the preexisting doctrine of unconscionability, and treat arbitration agreements differently from other types of contracts. Such discriminatory treatment is not permitted under the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    An Agreement to Arbitrate Ralph Act and Bane Act Claims Does Not Require the Waiver of Substantive Rights or Remedies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, we reject Saheli's various arguments that sections 51.7's and 52.1's special requirements avoid preemption because they are consistent with general California law restricting the waiver of certain substantive rights and remedies. The fundamental flaw with all of these arguments is that Saheli has failed to identify any substantive rights or remedies that are necessarily waived simply by submitting a\n   Ralph Act or Bane Act claim to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In passing, and without any explanation or citation to the record or authority, Saheli asserts the Arbitration Agreement precludes injunctive relief. Contrary to this assertion, the Arbitration Agreement provides that the rights of the parties \"shall be the same as those available to them in a court of competent jurisdiction.\" Further, it expressly empowers the arbitrator to award \"such remedies as could be awarded by a court under the applicable substantive law, which may include injunctive or other equitable relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We also find no merit to concerns expressed in the legislative history of AB 2617 that an arbitrator could not provide meaningful, immediate relief-such as a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction-to prevent the sort of abuse prohibited under the Ralph Act and Bane Act. (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2617 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) April 25, 2014, p. 7.) Such concerns are addressed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.8, which provides that a party to an arbitration agreement may seek from a court a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order if \"the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.\" ( Code Civ.

In limiting the enforceability of arbitration agreements related to PAGA claims, those courts relied on the fact that a PAGA action is not a \"dispute between an employer and an employee arising out of their contractual relationship. It is a dispute between an employer and the\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   , which alleges directly or through its agents-either the [Labor and Workforce Development] Agency or aggrieved employees-that the employer has violated the Labor Code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Iskanian, supra\n   </em>\n   , 59 Cal.4th at pp. 386-387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=173%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20289\">\n    173 Cal.Rptr.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=327%20P.3d%20129\">\n    327 P.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Consistent with the representative nature of such actions, prior to asserting a PAGA claim, an individual must give notice to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (Agency), and may only pursue the claim if the Agency declines to investigate the alleged violation or issue a citation. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 2699.3.) Accordingly, \"[b]ecause a PAGA plaintiff, whether suing solely on behalf of himself or herself or also on behalf of other employees, acts as a proxy for the state only with the state's acquiescence (see \u00a7 2699.3 ) and seeks civil penalties largely payable to the state via a judgment that will be binding on the state, a PAGA claim cannot be ordered to arbitration without the\n   <em>\n    state's\n   </em>\n   consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Tanguilig v.

In addition, unlike PAGA, the Ralph Act and Bane Act do not require that an individual provide the state notice of her claims and the opportunity to pursue them in the first instance.

The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics Report\n   on hate crimes, states that \"U.S. residents experienced an average of 250,000 hate crime victimizations each year from 2004 to 2015.\" (Hate Crime Victimization, 2004-2015 &lt; https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0415.pdf&gt; (as of March 13, 2018).)

They clearly do not, but that is beside the point. Both the Bane Act and the Ralph Act expressly represent part of the arsenal of legislative weapons against hate crimes, threats and intimidation, weapons that include enforcement of criminal laws, complaints to housing, employment and other agencies, and the prosecution of civil lawsuits. (See\n   <em>\n    Stamps v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (2006)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726910\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/136/1441/#p1447\">\n    136 Cal.App.4th 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1445-1448,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20706\">\n    39 Cal.Rptr.3d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Our state legislature went to great lengths in 2014 to craft amendments to the Ralph Act and Bane Act that would fit within traditional notions of unconscionability. Those amendments provide that a\n   <em>\n    predispute\n   </em>\n   agreement to waive\n   <em>\n    any rights or remedies\n   </em>\n   under the statutes imposed as a\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   condition of entering into a contract for goods or services is deemed unconscionable. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51.7, subd. (b)(4) &amp; 52.1, subd. (i).) In my view, this statutory provision encompasses elements of both procedural and substantive unconscionability. Procedurally, a contract which requires the predispute waiver of rights or remedies as a condition of entering into a contract for goods or services may very well be adhesive and contain other elements of procedural unconscionability identified by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Servs.\n   </em>\n   (2000)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1180100\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/24/83/#p114\">\n    24 Cal.4th 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20745\">\n    99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20P.3d%20669\">\n    6 P.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Substantively, the Legislature has determined that protections against hate crimes are sufficiently compelling, and implicate important public policies, such that their waiver is so unfair and one-sided as to be substantively unconscionable. This seems perfectly reasonable to me. The Ralph Act and Bane Act provide remedies-to be\n   pursued both by victimized individuals and by government agencies-to rid our state of hate crimes and related conduct. For the Legislature to determine that it is \"unconscionable, against public policy, and unenforceable\" for one party to force a waiver of those rights and remedies on another as a condition of entering into a contract for goods or services seems to be well within its power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The majority strikes down the Legislature's determination by relying on two lines of authority: the latter holds that a blanket assumption that arbitration provisions are substantively unconscionable is impermissibly hostile to arbitration; the former holds that a statute hostile to arbitration cannot be saved by being dressed up in language also hostile to other procedures. I have little abstract quarrel with either holding; I concur but with the concern that, in our desire to not be impermissibly hostile to arbitration, we are coming unnecessarily close to\n   <em>\n    elevating\n   </em>\n   arbitration above any other procedures and remedies to the derogation of our right to have disputes tried in civil courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Ralph Act and Bane Act preclude mandatory, predispute waivers of \"any legal right, penalty, remedy, forum, or procedure for violation\" of the statutes. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.7, subd. (b)(4).) A Ralph Act violation justifies an award of exemplary damages, civil penalties, and attorney's fees. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 52, subd. (b).) Any person claiming to be aggrieved by such a violation may pursue a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and\n   Housing. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 52, subd. (f).) The Bane Act additionally provides for injunctive relief, and a violation of such an injunction may be criminally punished. ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1, subds. (b), (i).) Under the 2014 amendments, none of these remedies and procedures can be waived by a clause inserted as a mandatory condition in a contract for goods or services. But only that part of the amendments which prevents such a waiver of the right to pursue a judicial remedy is here held unenforceable. In short, we are today holding that the California Legislature can rationally forbid an adhesive predispute waiver of exemplary damages, civil penalties, attorney fees, administrative complaints, and injunctive relief, but it cannot forbid an adhesive predispute waiver of the judicial remedy. The FAA prevents a state from treating arbitration more harshly than any other procedure; I do not believe it requires us to treat it more favorably than any other procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   I observe, however, that in opposition to respondents' petition to compel arbitration, appellant failed to develop an unconscionability defense. The bulk of her opposition to the petition was directed toward the argument that the arbitration provision in her employment contract excluded Ralph Act and Bane Act claims by its very terms, an argument unavailing under\n   <em>\n    Imburgia\n   </em>\n   . To the extent she argued unconscionability at all, she simply stated that the Ralph Act and Bane Act incorporated the common law doctrine of unconscionability, and suggested that the arbitration clause in this case was procedurally unconscionable because \"by all indications, Plaintiff did, in fact, have no choice but to accept the terms of the arbitration clause in order to enter into the employment agreement with Defendants.\" She submitted no declaration setting forth the circumstances in which she had signed the agreement, or stating that why she believed it to be mandatory. Nor did she argue in any way why the particular arbitration clause in this case was substantively unconscionable. As the procedural unconscionability argument was unsupported by evidence and the substantive unconscionability point was devoid of either evidence or argument, unconscionability was not properly pursued before\n   the trial court and is not before us here. This is therefore not the proper case to address the issue further.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    All further section references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    On June 7, 2016, Saheli signed a document entitled \"Post-Doctoral Training Agreement,\" which mandated that she challenge her termination and all other grievances using White Memorial's grievance and arbitration procedures as contained in its Employee Handbook. On June 16, 2016, Saheli signed an acknowledgement stating she received a copy of the Employee Handbook and was aware it contained the arbitration procedures.

They contend the fact that the Arbitration Agreement's \"carve-out\" excludes from arbitration claims for unemployment compensation, claims under the National Labor Relations Act, and claims for workers' compensation benefits, indicates that the phrase \"any claim that is non-arbitrable under applicable state ... law\" refers only to claims that are subject to adjudication by administrative bodies and are not the proper subject of arbitration. Defendants, however, wholly ignore the additional carve-out for PAGA claims. PAGA claims are not subject to adjudication by administrative bodies. (See Lab. Code, \u00a7 2699, subd. (a) [under PAGA, an aggrieved employee may recover civil penalties through a civil action].) Moreover, although PAGA claims may not be the subject of pre-dispute arbitration agreements, an individual may agree to arbitrate such claims after a dispute has arisen. (\n    <em>\n     Julian v.
