Judge Walter M. Jenifer, sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, sustained a demurrer to the amended bill of complaint without leave to further amend. Judge Jenifer held the complainants had no standing to bring the suit. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The amended bill alleged the defendants illegally reorganized the office of planning and zoning in violation of the Baltimore County Charter which vested the power of reorganization exclusively in the County Council. Attached to the bill of complaint, as an exhibit, was a letter directing the reorganization, a copy of which is set out in note one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pertinent provisions of Article 5 of the Baltimore County Charter giving the County Council and not the County Executive power to reorganize the planning office are set out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>in note two.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amended complaint alleged that the complainants\u2019 property rights would be affected in a \u201cpractical and pecuniary manner by causing said mechanism to operate in a less efficient manner and further served to damage the Plaintiffs in a pecuniary manner by potentially discouraging proper planning and zoning actions, thereby affecting the transfer and purchase of property in Baltimore County and reducing the future potential assessable property tax base of the County.\u201d Finally, the bill prayed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>a Declaratory Judgment that the reorganization of the office of planning and zoning of Baltimore County be deemed null and void, and for an injunction to restore the office to its status prior to July 1, 1972, and to enjoin the defendants from any future illegal reorganization of the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The rule concerning the standing of a taxpayer to bring suit in Maryland has been oft considered; it is most succinctly stated in <em>Stovall v. Secretary of State, </em>252 Md. 258, 263, 250 A. 2d 107 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cIn Maryland taxpayers have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute when the statute as applied increases their taxes, but if they cannot show a pecuniary loss or that the statute results in increased taxes to them, they have no standing to make such a challenge.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">To meet this test appellants argue now, as they alleged before in conclusory language, that the office of planning and zoning will be less efficient; therefore, inefficiency will impair the County\u2019s tax base and will increase concomitantly the real estate taxes of the appellants. They further say, that \u201c[g]overnmental efficiency is not necessarily consonant with reduction in size or abolishment of certain public jobs. The miniscule tax saving accomplished by eliminating four positions in the office of planning and zoning may very well be more than offset by the cost to the Appellants of the detrimental actions of the Appellees which . . . causes a potential increase in real property taxes\u201d by reducing the property tax base. It could just as well be said that neither is governmental efficiency necessarily consonant with an increase in public jobs. It is possible, of course, that the office will operate inefficiently under the reorganization but that conclusion is at best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>speculative. Fewer persons in the office may well do a better job than a gaggle of voices. We think the appellants\u2019 allegations are too tenuous to give them standing to bring the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Appellants rely primarily on <em>Horace Mann League v. Board, </em>242 Md. 645, 220 A. 2d 51 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 97, and <em>Castle Farms Dairy Stores, Inc. v. Lexington Market Authority, supra. </em>In the latter case, the question involved the constitutionality of an act of the Maryland legislature creating the Lexington Market Authority and empowering it to acquire markets from the City of Baltimore and to operate a public market. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cIf the Act is unconstitutional, the project is unlawful, and even though the City would not be obligated for the project, it presumably would incur some expense or loss in extricating itself and its property. As taxpayers, therefore, plaintiffs, are entitled to sue to enjoin such an unlawful project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At9L\"><em>Id. </em>at 482.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">It is apparent that the Court, faced with stall owner plaintiffs, was stretching the law of taxpayer standing to its utmost limits, as the Court subsequently pointed out in <em>Gordon v. City of Baltimore, </em>258 Md. 682, 688, 267 A. 2d 98 (1970). In <em>Castle Farms, supra, </em>it was apparent that the City and, ultimately, its taxpayers would be put to some measurable expense to rectify the unlawful project. In the instant case, the actions of the Administrative Office might well result in a savings not only in the four positions which were abolished but simply because it does not automatically follow that fewer people will necessarily do an inefficient job. Suffice it to say, the appellants allege no facts which necessarily lead to the conclusion that taxes will be increased; we cannot predicate standing upon their bald allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\"><em>Horace Mann League v. Board, supra, </em>involved a taxpayer suit to challenge whether the establishment clause of the first amendment of the United States Constitution and of Art. 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights were violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>by monetary state grants to four private colleges. The Court predicated standing upon the obvious pecuniary interest of taxpayers to preclude illegal expenditures of public funds. Having found standing to sue, the Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">\u201cAll of the parties agree that the issues here presented are of great public interest and concern. When this is the case, the necessary interest or injury to sustain standing to institute a taxpayer\u2019s suit is \u2018broadly comprehensive\u2019 and may be \u2018slight.\u2019 * * * We agree with the parties that the issues are of general and urgent public interest, and they are of sufficient importance and magnitude to invoke the above principle, if the factual situation rendered it necessary to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Upon this principle of \u201curgent public interest,\u201d appellants seek to predicate their claim of standing to sue. We note that to compare direct expenditures of state money for religious purposes with the subject issue of the reorganization of a zoning commission is to compare the sublime with the ridiculous. Such comparison, moreover, is not necessary. In <em>Horace Mann League, supra </em>at 653, the Court expressly refused to rely solely upon the \u201curgent public interest\u201d dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The trial judge relied on <em>Stovall v. Secretary of State, supra. </em>In that case, the Court affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision sustaining a demurrer to a bill of complaint, which sought a Declaratory Judgment on behalf of complainants as taxpayers, and others similarly situated, but which did not allege any pecuniary loss or increase in taxes. The trial judge also relied on <em>Kerpelman v. Board of Public Works, </em>261 Md. 436, 276 A. 2d 56 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U. S. 858. In that case, the complainant sought to preclude the Board of Public Works from conveying certain wetlands to private individuals under a statutory authority. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201cWhen the allegations of the bill of complaint are considered, it appears that the challenged transactions have \u2014 or will \u2014 result in the placing of additional land on the tax rolls which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>increase the tax base of the State so that the State taxes paid by Mrs. Kerpelman will actually be reduced as a result of those transactions. There are general allegations that the conveyances will have a damaging effect upon the marine ecology of the State, but there are no allegations of facts which would support these general allegations and, in any event, there are no allegations which indicate how this will result in the payment of higher State taxes by Mrs. Kerpelman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">\u201cThe allegations of the bill of complaint rather indicate that Mrs. Kerpelman is concerned with the policy of the State of Maryland in regard to the preservation of the marshlands and wetlands, and opposes the policy existing when the bill of complaint was filed. Her interest in this aspect of the matter, however, is not alleged to be different from that generally of citizens of the State; and this Court has held that there must be allegations (and ultimate proof) of a special interest, different from the general interest of a member of the public, in the plaintiff to enable a plaintiff to challenge a statute or the action of public officials acting under a statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">We think the trial judge\u2019s reliance on these two cases was well placed. When the appellants failed to allege facts showing a potential financial loss or increase in taxes from the alleged illegal actions of the County Executive, the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Finally, appellants argue that, under <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 410, 237 A. 2d 35 (1968) and <em>Shapiro v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>219 Md. 298, 302, 149 A. 2d 396 (1959), it is improper to sustain a demurrer in a Declaratory Judgment proceeding without a declaration one way or the other of the rights of the parties. The language of those cases, as well as others, indicates quite clearly that the rule has no application unless and until there is a justiciable controversy. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Board of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 9, 12, 304 A. 2d 228 (1973); <em>Patuxent Oil Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Commissioners, </em>212 Md. 543, 549, 129 A. 2d 847 (1957). If the plaintiff lacks standing to bring a suit, then the controversy is not justiciable. This seems to be the law throughout the country. 1 Anderson, <em>Actions for Declaratory Judgments </em>\u00a7 318, at 741 (2d ed. 1951); Borchard, <em>Declaratory Judgments, </em>33 <em>et seq.; </em>Eager, <em>The Declaratory Judgment Action </em>\u00a7 87 (1971); and 6A Moore, <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 57.15 (1973). We note that in <em>Stovall v. Secretary of State, supra, </em>and in <em>Kerpelman v. Board of Public Works, supra, </em>the appellants sought Declaratory Judgments but the Court affirmed orders sustaining demurrers thereto. Appellants, as members of the general public, without special interest in the subject matter or injury as taxpayers, must seek succor at the ballot box \u2014 not the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\n<em>Appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">. \u201cDear Mr. Gavrelis:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">\u201cIn the interest of a more efficient and effective operation within the Office of Planning and Zoning it has been determined that a reorganization is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">\u201cTo achieve improved operations, the Comprehensive Planning Program will function under a single head.

Appellants allege that Maryland cases seem to impose a stronger burden on taxpayer suits which challenge legislative acts as contrasted to challenges of <em>ultra vires </em>acts by the executive branch of the government. We have been unable to ascertain such a distinction. Appellants cite only <em>Castle Farms Dairy Stores, Inc. v. Lexington Market Authority, </em>193 Md. 472, 67 A. 2d 490 (1949), to sustain the argument. That case involved the constitutionality of a statute creating the Lexington Market Authority and we are unable to see any support for appellants\u2019 proposition in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
