It is further alleged that the respondent is ungovernable and so deports herself as to endanger herself and others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">\u201cIt appears that the respondent is in need of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>supervision, guidance, treatment, and/or rehabilitation beyond that being offered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The petition against Cindy Ann Spalding alleged similarly that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">-\u201con 1-31-73 in the County aforesaid an investigation by the Baltimore County Police Department revealed that the respondent had consumed controlled and prohibitive narcotics and engaged in acts of sexual intercourse and sexual perversion with an unknown number of male \u25a0 and female adults for a period of more than one year. The respondent is ungovernable and beyond the control of her parent, deports herself in such a manner as to be a danger to herself and others and is in need of care and treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On the same day, an adjudication was made by Juvenile Master Kahl that both girls were children in need of supervision and in need of care and treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They were committed to the custody of the State Department of Juvenile Services. On February 7 they were ordered taken to the Maryland Children\u2019s Center for evaluation, to be returned to court one month thereafter. On March 7 the report from th^ Maryland Children\u2019s Center was filed and a disposition hearing was held before Juvenile Master Peach. He recommended their retention in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services for placement and a Commitment Order, signed by him on March 7, was approved by Judge Jenifer. On March 12 counsel for both respondents filed general exceptions to the findings of the master and requested a hearing <em>de novo </em>on the entire matter pursuant to Maryland Rule 908 e 3. On May 3 separate adjudicatory and disposition hearings upon the exceptions were held before the Juvenile Court (Jenifer, J.). In a verbal opinion the court found both children to be in need of supervision, to be committed to the care and custody of the Department of Juvenile Services for placement. A formal Order was adopted by the court on May 7, 1973. At the time of argument on this appeal, both children were in foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>homes, the parents having been granted limited visitation rights. From these adjudications and dispositions both respondents have taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">At the hearing before Judge Jenifer, Officer Joseph Price of the Baltimore County Police Department, Dundalk Station, testified that in the early morning hours of January 31, 1973 he was summoned to City Hospital to investigate a possible rape and overdose of narcotics. He was met by Mr. Lenlie Carter, father of appellant, Victoria Elaine Carter, who advised him that his daughter had taken a white tablet that had dilated her eyes and affected her speech and equilibrium, and that he wanted her treated for the drug and examined for possible sexual intercourse. He explained that she had confessed to having intercourse with one Sheldon Coon on January 29. Questioned about the matter by the officer in her parents\u2019 presence, Elaine at first denied the intercourse (\u201cshe denied having any, denied to her mother and denied to her father . . .\u201d), but eventually she admitted that on January 29 she had climbed out her bedroom window in her parents\u2019 apartment at 2007 Bear Ridge Road and slipped down to the apartment immediately below where she was let in by Coon. Several persons were there, all nude. Coon gave her a pill that \u201cmade her float,\u201d after which she engaged in sexual acts with Coon and others including two women. According to the officer, Elaine\u2019s speech during this recitation was impaired, and her parents assisted him in eliciting details and the names of those involved in the \u201cparty.\u201d Following the initial questioning Elaine remained at the hospital (with her parents) for out-patient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">At approximately 6:30 a.m., in response to a phone call by Officer Price, Cindy Ann Spalding was brought to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Dundalk police station by her mother. The Carters also went to the station, taking with them Victoria Elaine and the Reverend Robert Gatney, the pastor of a church in Baltimore attended by both families. Mr. Price and another police officer talked with the girls in an atmosphere of some commotion: the parents \u201cinsisted on the girls giving the information. They were at sometimefs] . . . yelling at the girls and the girls being upset, crying, they were trying to calm them down. They were trying to help and assist getting all the information they could.\u201d Cindy Ann Spalding confessed to the police that on the evening of the 29th at about 9:00, Coon helped her out of her bedroom window and drove her to the Bear Ridge Road apartment where she had intercourse with several males and two adult women performed unnatural acts upon her. She stated that on previous occasions she had had sexual relations with other men including one who lived in the basement of her mother\u2019s house. With the consent of the parents the girls gave written statements to the police incorporating the substance of their oral statements. They were then taken to University Hospital for examination for possible intercourse (City Hospital apparently did not have the necessary facilities). The same day they were given over to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">On cross-examination, Price was asked if he had given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the police station prior to beginning questioning. He indicated he had announced \u201cto everyone in the room\u201d that anything they said could be used against them in a court of law if they were charged. On redirect he stated he never considered the girls or their parents to be in custody: \u201cThey volunteered all of this information to begin with, and it was so bizarre I started asking questions to try to pinpoint dates and times and individuals.\u201d The Carters \u201cwanted everybody named and wanted them arrested and punished.\u201d Mrs. Spalding wanted \u201cthis Mr. Coon arrested and charged, because he had beaten Cindy Spalding and she was afraid for her. . . .\u201d Rev. Gatney was in the forefront of the questioning and at one point, the officer testified, he \u201chad to threaten to arrest him just to keep him quiet.\u201d At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>another time, the parents began to walk out, themselves disenchanted with the investigation: \u201cThey said they did not like the way [we were] handling it. We were paid off just like everybody else.\u201d Price told them \u201cthey could go if they wanted to, but they were not going to get anywheres.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We talked it over and used cool heads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Over her counsel\u2019s objection to her being called by the State, Victoria Elaine Carter confirmed the essentials of her statement to the police. She testified she had met Sheldon Coon through the church and known him about a year. She had attended about fifteen \u201cparties\u201d with him in the apartment below her parents\u2019, in each case without their knowledge. Her escape from her parents\u2019 surveillance, \u201cbizarre\u201d but evidently effective, was managed by dropping sleeping pills given her by Coon in whatever they were drinking that evening, usually coffee. They had never become suspicious. Downstairs she would receive her pill from Coon and eventually everyone, as many as \u201ctwenty-five, thirty,\u201d \u201ctook off their clothes and made sex.\u201d On other occasions they would go instead to the Lacottis\u2019 and similar events would transpire. Asked why she went out with Coon, who was \u201cjust an old man\u201d to her, the eleven-year-old Victoria Elaine explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201cA. Time I was under the pill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">THE COURT: What, would he [Coon] give you a pill and then you\u2019d go out with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">THE COURT: How about when you went to the Lacottis\u2019, what would happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">A. I\u2019d get a pill before I went.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">She recalled telling Coon once that she was going to confess her activities to her parents, but \u201che said, if you do, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">On cross-examination Victoria Elaine stated that her brother, Steve, age 19, who had since left home, had first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>taken her to the parties. Indeed it was he and Coon who helped her make her way back through her bedroom window after a night\u2019s events.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Cindy Ann Spalding also testified over her counsel\u2019s objection and his instructions to her on the record not to testify. She identified her written statement made to the police and affirmed its truth. On cross-examination she responded to counsel\u2019s question as to whether she had been advised that she did not have to make the statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">\u201cA. Well, we more or less made it on our own. We figured we could save some more kids, but they gave us no rights or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">THE COURT: Give you what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">A. Any kind of rights, we thought we were doing the State a favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Called by counsel for her daughter, Mrs. Carter testified as to her \u201cintention in going to City Hospital and calling the police:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">\u201cA. Well, we thought that these men should be taken in custody to keep this from happening to other little children, we thought they should be apprehended and all- these rings broken up in the city; we thought they\u2019d be interested to know this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Reverend Gatney testified and stated that he had also \u201cwant[ed] to see justice\u201d since \u201c[tjhese men [were] guilty for assaulting these children,\u201d but the police had been incredulous for a while: \u201c. . . if you say anything like that [he paraphrased Price] people are going to put you in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">At the conclusion of the adjudicatory hearing the court found that the girls had been \u201cassociated in immoral sexual activities for a period of at least three months prior to January 31, 1973;\u201d had been \u201cgiven drugs of a narcotic nature and [had] indulged in the taking of the drug itself;\u201d had engaged in activities \u201ccertainly of a nature that would not have been permitted [by their parents] had they been known about;\u201d had \u201cdeported themselves so as to injure or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>endanger themselves or others;\u201d had \u201cendangered their own welfare\u201d in being \u201cthrown in\u201d with Coon, and had, in sum, \u201cgone through a very traumatic experience\u201d requiring guidance, treatment or rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In challenging the Order of Court declaring them to be children in need of supervision and committing them to the care and custody of the Department of Juvenile Services for placement, appellants make the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">1) their statement (oral and written) to the police should have been suppressed at the <em>de novo </em>hearing, and they should have been permitted to cross-examine Officer Price on the issues of voluntariness and <em>Miranda </em>warnings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">2) they were denied their constitutional right to refuse to testify at the <em>de novo </em>hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">3) the court erred in deciding the issue of need of supervision based on \u201call the statutory definitions rather than limiting the issue to the charge alleged in the petition\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">4) the court erred in denying the motion of Cindy Spalding challenging venue and the power of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to hear, the allegation that she was a child in need of supervision;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">5) the evidence was insufficient to justify a finding that they were children in need of supervision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">With respect to contentions 1) and 2) appellants strenuously urge that the decision of the Supreme Court in the celebrated case of <em>In Re Gault, </em>387 U. S. 1 (1966) is applicable to a proceeding to determine whether a child is in need of supervision. Appellants argue that there is no valid distinction between delinquent and CINS (child in need of supervision) proceedings and that a CINS case falls within the ambit of <em>Gault. </em>Consequently, it is asserted, Fifth Amendment guarantees are applicable to a CINS proceeding so that the child may choose to remain silent and is also entitled to a determination by the court of a Motion to Suppress on the ground of constitutional involuntariness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and under the rule of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436 (1966), which was made applicable to delinquency proceedings by <em>Gault.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">For the reason stated in Section I, <em>infra, </em>we find <em>Miranda </em>inapplicable upon the facts disclosed in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On the broad constitutional issues presented we also conclude in Section II that <em>Gault </em>is not applicable to a CINS proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The remaining substantive contentions we find to be without merit. Finally, at the conclusion of this opinion we deny appellants\u2019 motion set forth in brief to \u201cstrike portions of the record\u201d and we aiso formally deny appellee\u2019s \u201cmotion ne recipiatur\u201d addressed to the aforesaid motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Counsel for appellants contend that the questioning by the police at the hospital and at the police station was custodial interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>and assert that appellants were not adequately apprised of their rights under <em>Miranda </em>and \u201ccould not have knowingly waived\u201d them, and that in the totality of the circumstances their statements were not voluntary but a product of their youth, lack of sleep or \u201calleged\u201d weakened condition from a drug, and above all of the combined coercion of the police, their parents and their minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The short answer to this contention is that appellants were not in custody at the time of the statements in question. To hold otherwise would be to find custodial interrogation in any case where a police officer was present and participating or where the questioning took place at a police station. <em>Miranda </em>defined custodial interrogation as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d The Supreme Court noted this was what it had meant in <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478 (1964) when it spoke of an investigation that was \u201cno longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but [had] begun to focus on a particular suspect.. . .\u201d 378 U. S. at 490. Custody thus requires a significant deprivation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the freedom of one upon whom the eye of criminal suspicion has begun to focus. To see the matter thus is to perceive the considerable distance separating custodial interrogation from the questioning that took place here.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The evidence shows that Officer Price went to City Hospital in response to a call to police headquarters from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. There he was met by parents who were alarmed by their discoveries concerning their child and determined to seek exposure and punishment of the persons responsible. What triggered police involvement in the case was thus the anger of parents who believed their child to have been victimized and who were demanding police action. This position of the parties \u2014 and not that suggested by counsel for appellants who claims \u201cthey were <em>treated </em>by the police as victims and not defendants\u201d \u2014 continued when the Carters arrived at the station a few hours later accompanied by the Spaldings and Rev. Gatney. Mrs. Spalding, of course, had been called to the station with her daughter by the police, but her real motivation in being there was unquestionably her desire to see Coon prosecuted. Indeed the general picture conveyed of the scene is of a chorus, or a tumult, of competing voices \u2014 police, parental, and pastoral \u2014 all anxious to uncover the facts of the girls\u2019 abuse and \u201cto see justice.\u201d Thus while Officer Price saw fit to give an unparticularized <em>Miranda </em>warning \u201cto everyone in the room,\u201d we consider this of small account. His role in questioning the girls and receiving their written statements received the parents\u2019 unqualified support \u2014 indeed he was their \u201cadversary,\u201d it would appear, only in holding the questioning to an orderly course and insisting on separating fact from fiction. We find in all this no resemblance to the situation contemplated by <em>Miranda: </em>any restraint upon the girls\u2019 freedom at this point was at their parents\u2019 initiative and with their continued cooperation, and the overriding \u201cfocus\u201d of misconduct during the interrogation was not upon the girls but upon their exploiters. This was merely confirmed the next day when the juvenile master found inadequate evidence to support a juvenile delinquency petition against the girls, and on the day thereafter when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>warrants were sworn out for the arrest of at least four of the adults named by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Because the oral and written statements of the girls to the police did not stem from custodial interrogation, the- State was not required to demonstrate compliance with the procedural safeguards of <em>Miranda, </em>as a condition of their admissibility. For the same reason the court below did not err in refusing to permit defense counsel \u201cto question the officer about what warning he did give these children\u201d before the statements were introduced. (It may be noted that counsel did in fact, following admission of the statements, and some seven transcript pages later, cross-examine the officer in detail on precisely this matter.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Appellants argue that the statements should have been rejected in any event as the product of the girls\u2019 youth, their fatigue or possible weakness from drugs, and the combined coercion of their parents and minister. The Supreme Court in <em>Gault, supra, </em>wisely cautioned that where admissions of juveniles are involved, the greatest care must be taken to assure they are not the result of coercion, suggestion, adolescent fantasy, fright or despair. 387 U. S. at 55. We have no doubt that in confessing their activities the girls were in good measure yielding to the demands of their parents and pastor. On the other hand we reject as unwarranted the suggestion of counsel that \u201ca significant conflict of interest between the interests of the parent and of the child\u201d was thereby created, which itself contributed to a setting of custodial interrogation. The \u201c \u2018paternal\u2019 urgings\u201d or worse found suspect by Gault<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are not those involved here where parents \u2014 alarmed and perhaps painfully made aware of their own inadequacy \u2014 demand from their children an accounting of their conduct. Furthermore, Cindy Spalding gave the complete answer to the question of the voluntariness of the girls\u2019 statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cA. Well, we more or less made it on our own. We figured we could save some more kids, but they gave us no rights or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">THE COURT: Give you what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201cA. Any kind of rights, we thought we were doing the State a favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Supreme Court has established that State juvenile proceedings \u201cby which a determination is made as to whether a juvenile is a \u2018delinquent\u2019 as a result of alleged misconduct on his part, with the consequence that he may be committed to a State institution,\u201d must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment. <em>Gault </em>at 13, 30. Some of the constitutional requirements which apply equally to a state criminal trial and the adjudicative phase of a state juvenile court delinquency proceeding are the rights to appropriate notice, to counsel, to confrontation and to cross-examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U. S. 528 (1971). These constitutional rights are also expressly required in juvenile delinquency hearings at the adjudicative stage by Maryland law. <em>See Matter of Anderson, </em>20 Md. App. 31, 315 A. 2d 540 (1974), n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\"><em>Gault </em>made absolutely clear that its extension of the privilege against self-incrimination related only to a proceeding \u201cto determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile\u2019s freedom is curtailed. . . .\u201d At 41. Elsewhere it spoke of \u201cthe determination of delinquency, carrying with it the awesome prospect of incarceration in a state institution.. ..\u201d <em>Idem, </em>at 36-37. While the Court observed that \u201cthe availability of the privilege <em>does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its protection is invoked, </em>but upon the nature of the statement or admission, and the exposure which it invites,\u201d (emphasis added), this was said in reply to the argument that juvenile proceedings are \u201ccivil\u201d and not \u201ccriminal\u201d and therefore that the privilege should not apply to them. The Court went on to identify other \u201ctypes\u201d of proceedings: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>privilege may, for example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or may be inculpatory.\u201d The Court reasoned that it would be \u201centirely unrealistic to carve out of the Fifth Amendment all statements by juveniles on the ground that these cannot lead to \u2018criminal\u2019 involvement,\u201d since, at least as respects juvenile delinquency proceedings, these \u201cmay lead to commitment to a state institution,\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201c[i]ndeed, in over half of the States, there is not even assurance that the juvenile will be kept in separate institutions, apart from adult \u2018criminals.\u2019 In those States juveniles may be placed in or transferred to adult penal institutions after having been found \u2018delinquent\u2019 by a juvenile court. For this purpose, at least, commitment is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one\u2019s will, whether it is called \u2018criminal\u2019 or \u2018civil.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The Court added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201c* * * apart from the equivalence for this purpose of exposure to commitment as a juvenile delinquent and exposure to imprisonment as an adult offender, the fact of the matter is that there is little or no assurance in Arizona, as in most if not all of the States, that a juvenile apprehended and interrogated by the police or even by the Juvenile Court itself will remain outside of the reach of adult courts as a consequence of the offense for which he has been taken into custody. In Arizona, as in other States, provision is made for Juvenile Courts to relinquish or waive jurisdiction to the ordinary criminal courts. In the present case when Gerald Gault was interrogated concerning violation of a section of the Arizona Criminal Code, it could not be certain that the Juvenile Court Judge would decide to \u2018suspend\u2019 criminal prosecution in court for adults by proceeding to an adjudication in Juvenile Court.\u201d 387 U. S. at 49-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The quoted language from <em>Gault </em>is important, we think, as indicating the essential and grave concerns which caused the Court to penetrate the \u201cfeeble enticement of the \u2018civil\u2019 label-of-convenience which has been attached to juvenile proceedings\u201d and extend to them the safeguards of the Fifth Amendment: the juvenile delinquent may be committed to a state institution;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if so, he is without even the likelihood of assurance that he will be kept separate from adult criminals; and there is no certainty to begin with that he will remain outside of the reach of adult courts as a consequence of the offense for which he has been taken into custody, because of waiver provisions. It is in this context that we must examine the category entitled \u201cChild in Need of Supervision\u201d created by Chapter 432, Acts of 1969, of the General Assembly of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">This enactment substantially revised the law of Maryland governing juvenile causes. <em>In Re Hamill, </em>10 Md. App. 586, 271 A. 2d 762 (1970). The purposes of the new subtitle, as set forth in the present Courts Art. \u00a7 3-802,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u201c(1) To provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>(2) To remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">(3) To provide for a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">(4) To place a child in a wholesome family environment whenever possible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">(5) To separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interest of public safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">The implications of the above stated objectives were explained by Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Hamill, supra, </em>in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-13\">\u201cBy so providing, it is clear that the Legislature intended no departure in philosophy from that underlying previous juvenile court enactments in Maryland, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, <em>viz., </em>that juvenile proceedings are of a special nature designed to meet the problems peculiar to the adolescent <em>(In Re Fletcher, </em>251 Md. 520); that the proceedings of a juvenile court are not criminal in nature and its dispositions are not punishment for crime <em>(In the Matter of Cromwell, </em>232 Md. 409); that the juvenile law has as its underlying concept the protection of the juvenile, so that judges, in making dispositions in juvenile cases, think not in terms of guilt, but of the child\u2019s need for protection or rehabilitation <em>(In Re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517); that the juvenile act does not contemplate the punishment of children where they are found to be delinquent, but rather an attempt to correct and rehabilitate them in \u2018a wholesome family environment whenever possible,\u2019 although rehabilitation may have to be sought in some instances in an institution <em>(Moquin v. State, </em>216 Md. 524).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>More fully to effectuate the philosophy underlying juvenile law in Maryland, Chapter 432 created a \u201cwholly new\u201d category entitled Child in Need of Supervision, codified in Md. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-1 (i) (1973 repl. vol.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>In Re Arnold, </em>12 Md. App. 384, 278 A. 2d 658 (1971). Such a child was classified as one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">\u201c(1) Subject to compulsory school attendance who is habitually and without justification truant from school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">(2) Without substantial fault on the part of his parents, guardian, or other custodian, who is habitually disobedient, ungovernable, and beyond their control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">(3) Who so deports himself as to injure or endanger himself or others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">(4) Who has committed an offense applicable only to children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">(5) Requires guidance, treatment or rehabilitation.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">On the other hand, \u00a7 70-1 (h)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> defined a \u201cDelinquent child\u201d as a child \u201cwho commits a delinquent act and who requires supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d A \u201cDelinquent act\u201d was defined in \u00a7 70-1 (g) as \u201can act which is in violation of Article 66V2 of this Code, any other traffic violation, or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>act <em>which would be a crime if done by a verson who is not a </em>child.\u201d(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Former \u00a7 52 of Article 26 had defined a delinquent child as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201c* * * a child (1) who violates any law or ordinance, or who commits any act which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime not punishable by death or life imprisonment; (2) who is incorrigible or ungovernable or habitually disobedient or who is beyond the control of his parents, guardian, custodian or other lawful authority; (3) who is habitually a truant; (4) who without just cause and without the consent of his parents, guardian or other custodian, repeatedly deserts his home or place of abode; (5) who is engaged in any occupation which is in violation of law, or who associates with immoral or vicious persons; or (6) who so deports himself as to injure or endanger the morals of himself or others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It is apparent that the category of CINS, while it contains a number of the acts formerly defined as delinquent, is indeed \u201cwholly new.\u201d The Legislature, in revising the State law governing juvenile causes, was not satisfied to remove the \u201ctaint of criminality\u201d from the definition of a delinquent child (by changing the clause \u201cviolates any law or ordinance\u201d to include only traffic violations and eliminating the clause \u201cengaged in any occupation which is in violation of law\u201d formerly appearing in \u00a7 52 of Article 26). Nor did it stop with meeting one of the serious abuses identified in <em>Gault </em>by providing in Article 26, \u00a7 70-21<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that \u201cNo child shall be committed or transferred to a penal institution or other facility used primarily for the execution of sentences of persons convicted of \"a crime.\u201d It went further and differentiated between juvenile acts which \u201cwould be a crime if done by a person who is not a child\u201d (delinquent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>acts) and acts which <em>under no circumstances </em>would be criminal (limited, in this respect, to \u201coffenses applicable only to children\u201d). This latter class of acts, cast more in the language of sociology than of the penal code, the Legislature grouped in a separate category, CINS, thereby formally recognizing a species of juvenile misconduct of lesser gravity, made up of a pattern of behavior which bears uniquely juvenile features and reflects the particular susceptibilities of youth \u2014 conduct to which, therefore, any analogy to adult criminal conduct is altogether inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Article 26, \u00a7 70-16 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> gives initial effect to this distinction between delinquent and non-delinquent misconduct by permitting waiver of juvenile jurisdiction to the criminal court \u201c[a]fter a petition has been filed alleging delinquency,\u201d but, by negative implication, not after a petition alleging only need of supervision is filed. The Code thus insures that, as respects children in need of supervision, guidance, treatment or rehabilitation are to be the sole forms of State intervention. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-832 <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> makes plain, moreover, that within the juvenile system treatment of children other than delinquent children is to take a form specifically its own. Subsection (a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">\u201cA child, except a delinquent child, may not be confined in an institution or other facility designed or operated for the benefit of delinquent children. This prohibition does not apply to facilities approved by the Juvenile Services Administration of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Until January 1, 1974, this provision was followed by Article 26, \u00a7 70-19 (b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">\u201c(b) If an adequate facility required by this section has not been established, the court may approve a facility under the supervision and control of the State departments of juvenile services, social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>services, mental hygiene and other appropriate child-care agencies, for temporary use as such facility; but the use of a facility which does not meet the requirement of this section may not continue beyond January 1,1975.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Effective January 1, 1974, however, subsection (b) was replaced by the present Courts Art. \u00a7 3-832 (c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">\u201cIf a child is found to be neglected, in need of supervision, mentally handicapped or dependent, the court <em>may not confine the child in a juvenile training school or any similar institution.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Finally, it may be noted, pending adjudication a child alleged to be in need of supervision may not be placed in detention, defined by \u00a7 3-801 (m) in part as \u201cthe temporary care of children ... in physically restricting facilities,\u201d for \u00a7 3-823 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u201c(a). . . Detention is permitted only when a person is alleged or adjudicated to be a <em>delinquent </em>child.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">\u201c(d)... A child alleged to be neglected, dependent, or in need of supervision may not be placed in detention, but only in shelter care facilities maintained by the Department of Social Services or any home or facility maintained by the Department of Juvenile Services for the child in need of supervision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>It is evident, we think, that an important purpose of the legislative revision of the juvenile code was to insulate certain forms of juvenile misconduct from the consequences of an adjudication of delinquency as described in <em>Gault. </em>The creation of the category of CINS reflects a studied design of the legislature to insure that treatment of children guilty of misconduct peculiarly reflecting the propensities and susceptibilities of youth, will acquire none of the institutional, quasi-penal features of treatment that in <em>Gault's </em>view had been the main difference between the theory and the practice of the juvenile court system. Under Maryland law, we have seen, a child may not be confined in an institution used primarily for the execution of sentences of convicted criminals; a child alleged in need of supervision cannot, based on that allegation, come within \u201cthe reach of adult courts\u201d by means of waiver; he may not, upon adjudication, be confined in a facility designed or operated for the benefit of delinquent children, except as approved by the Juvenile Services Administration; and he may never be confined in a juvenile training school or any similar institution. In short, his correction and rehabilitation are designed to take place in an environment \u2014 of the group home, the foster home, or like unit \u2014 which duplicates as nearly as possible the intimacy, closeness and wholesomeness of the natural family environment. We would be poorly advised, admitting that the realities of juvenile rehabilitation may-fall short of its ideals, to extend the analogy between criminal and delinquency proceedings \u2014 for purposes of the ext/osure to State intervention each invites and hence the prpdise forms of due process each must obey \u2014 to embrace ^statutory scheme so clearly intended to substitute for ^institutional confinement modes of individualized juvenile rehabilitative treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">To do so, in our view, would be \u201cto disallow the States to experiment/further and to seek in new and different ways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the elusive answers to the problems of the young. . . .\u201d <em>McKeiver, supra </em>at 547. Nor would it \u201cremedy the defects of the [juvenile] system\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>\u2014 defects that this statutory scheme is explicitly designed to remedy. In Maryland adjudicatory juvenile proceedings are subject to the rules of evidence. Rule 912 c. In Maryland a child who is a party is entitled by statute to representation by legal counsel at every stage of any juvenile proceeding. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (d). We decline to go.further and hold that in a proceeding upon a CINS petition due process requires that the child be permitted, on Fifth Amendment grounds, to have relevant evidence excluded and to refuse to testify. Such a holding, in a proceeding in which the protection and welfare of the child are of primordial concern, would not only \u201cnot strengthen greatly\u201d but indeed would gravely impair \u201cthe fact-finding function, and would, contrarily, provide an attrition of the juvenile court\u2019s assumed ability to function in a unique manner.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It should be noted that, as provided in Courts Art., \u00a7 3-834: \u201cThe proceedings in the juvenile court regarding a child are not admissible as evidence against him in criminal proceedings, prior to conviction, unless the charge is perjury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Appellants next contend that the court denied them due process \u201cin not limiting its decision as to whether appellants were children in need of supervision to the single issue of \u2018ungovernable\u2019 alleged in the petition\u201d and to which they had prepared their defense. The issue was not raised below and has not been preserved for appeal. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In point of fact, however, each petition alleged at least that the respondent was in need of care and treatment and was 1) ungovernable and 2) had so deported herself as to be a danger to herself and others. It alleged particular facts that were the basis of these conclusions. The findings of the lower court, in turn, directly responded to these allegations. It found that the children had committed acts of the sort alleged; had habitually engaged in conduct, virtually before their parents\u2019 eyes, of which their parents could not have approved; had deported themselves so as to endanger themselves or others; and, as a result of the \u201ctraumatic experience,\u201d were in need of guidance, treatment and rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Rule 903 b 3 and 4 requires that the juvenile petition shall set forth \u201c[t]he statutory classification of the act or condition causing the respondent to come under the jurisdiction of the court;\u201d and: \u201c[a] statement in simple and nontechnical language of such facts on which the action is based as are sufficient to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d The petitions here fully conformed to these requirements and we find no deprivation of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Counsel for Cindy Ann Spalding contends here, as he did before the hearing judge, that \u201cwhen the delinquency petition was denied at the Master\u2019s hearing on March 7, 1973, all jurisdiction of the [Circuit Court for Baltimore County] was terminated\u201d and the appellant was entitled to a summary dismissal or a transfer of the proceedings to Baltimore City. This claim is based upon Art. 26, \u00a7 70-4 <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>which provides that proceedings under the subtitle, except if delinquency is alleged, \u201cshall be brought in the county where the child is living or domiciled.\u201d If delinquency is alleged, \u201cthe proceedings shall be brought in the county where the alleged delinquent acts occurred.\u201d The petition filed against Cindy alleged that she was <em>both </em>a delinquent child and a child in need of supervision and the implication of the statement of facts is that the delinquent acts occurred in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Section 70-4 (Courts Art. \u00a7 3-818) applies to venue, not jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals has consistently held that the question of venue should be raised by preliminary motion, Rule 323 a, or by dilatory plea. <em>Easthman v. Young, </em>250 Md. 516, 243 A. 2d 559 (1968). Judge Jenifer ruled, in his denial of the motion to dismiss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, the motion will be denied for two reasons: The first reason is that the petition as filed alleging certain delinquent acts which were committed in Baltimore County, and under Subsection 1 of Article 70-4 entitled \u2018Venue\u2019 said delinquent act did occur in Baltimore County. The second reason, is that I feel Section 70-4 of Article 26 is entitled \u2018Venue\u2019 and the question of venue should have been raised at the time of the original hearing before the Master in this case, so I\u2019ll deny the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Had the question been timely raised, as stated above, the court, pursuant to \u00a7 70-5, could have exercised its discretion to transfer the proceeding to the place of domicile. Where delinquency is alleged (and clearly, we think, where it is accompanied by the lesser allegation of need of supervision), \u00a7\u00a7 70-4 and 70-5 leave the determination of venue to the sound discretion of the court. Here, counsel failed to raise the venue question before the Master and also failed to request a transfer to Baltimore City. We find no error in the court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Appellants contend, finally, that the evidence does not sustain a finding that they are children in need of supervision in that it failed to show whether or not they \u201ccould be controlled and disciplined by their parents\u201d or were \u201chabitually\u201d disobedient or ungovernable, based on testimony of events constituting a \u201cone-time situation\u201d in which the girls were essentially \u201cabused and assaulted by various adults.. .</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Proof that a child is in need of supervision must be by a preponderance of the evidence. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-18.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The decision of the lower court will not be set aside by this Court unless clearly erroneous. Rule 1086; <em>Matter of Smith, </em>16 Md. App. 209, 295 A. 2d 238 (1972). The contention that upon this record the lower court erred in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that appellants were in need of guidance, treatment or rehabilitation, had shown themselves by repeated conduct to be beyond the control of their parents, and had deported themselves so as to endanger their own welfare, is patently without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Appellants\u2019 brief contains a \u201cMotion to Strike Portions of the Record\u201d which precipitated a \u201cMotion ne Recipiatur\u201d filed separately by the appellee wherein the State \u201cmoves to strike\u201d the brief of the appellants, or in the alternative, to expunge the motion \u201cto strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Appellants\u2019 motion pertains to documents in the record transmitted to this Court which, it is contended, were not admitted into evidence at the hearing before Judge Jenifer. They include a school report of Victoria Elaine Carter, Children\u2019s Center social investigation reports and psychiatric evaluation reports of each child, memoranda of Juvenile Masters Kahl and Peach and Baltimore County Police reports. In support of the motion to strike it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\u201cAppellants do not know to what degree Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Jenifer used these documents in the decision and disposition of this case. The appellants have a constitutional right to confrontation and cross-examination of their accusers. <em>The means by which these documents were included in the record without the knowledge of the appellants, denied the appellants their constitutional rights.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">It is clearly the obligation of all counsel to examine the record in the lower court prior to its transmittal to this Court. Rule 1026 e then provides a mechanism for the determination by the lower court of differences with respect to matters properly includible in the record on appeal. If counsel have not assumed this responsibility prior to transmittal of the record, they may not be heard to complain. In any event, the motion to strike must be denied because the question presented has not been preserved for appellate review. Rule 1085. If it were before us, we would deny the motion because plainly the designated documents were properly before the court on disposition, after adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The State\u2019s motion ne recipiatur is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed; motions denied; appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-14\">.

Those cases, however, involved allegations of conduct felonious under California law (including.unlawful homicide and assault with a deadly weapon) but couched in the juvenile petition in the language of the wardship statute, namely, that respondents were \u201cin danger of leading an idle, dissolute, lewd or immoral life\u201d by committing the named acts. In each case the California court concluded that the \u201cessential finding\u201d of the lower court was that a felony or felonies had been committed notwithstanding their characterization, and held that respondents had therefore properly invoked Fifth Amendment rights. In each case the court was also careful to state what it was not deciding. Thus, in In Re H. it said at 365: \u201cTo what degree a self-incriminating statement may be admissible wherein nothing more than minor law offenses or a course of misbehavior are involved, we need not determine.\u201d Maryland\u2019s classification of child in need of supervision, as we have seen, is directed at just such \u201ca course of misbehavior\u201d; it is designed by its terms to exclude an \u201cessential finding\u201d of criminal misconduct. Here the court found that while the children had engaged in a course of misconduct of a particularly aggravated sort, they were essentially the victims both of lack of parental control and of the criminal acts of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\"><em>. </em>Courts Art. <em>\u00a7 3-818.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\">.
