Specifically, we shall look again at the position taken with regard to the right of an accused to an immediate appeal from a pre-trial refusal of the trial court to dismiss the indictment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">The right of the State to appeal in a criminal case is severely limited by statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by constitutional guarantees to the accused.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The right of an accused to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>is much broader. The general rule is that he may appeal from a final judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The restrictions on the right of appeal bestowed upon an accused are, in the main, matters of procedure rather than of substance. Under Maryland Rule 1035, we are directed \u201cnot [to] entertain or consider an appeal taken from a <em>pro forma </em>order or judgment,\u201d and are required by the Rule to dismiss such appeals \u201cas prematurely taken.\u201d We said in <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 468, 470: \u201cThe cases have long recognized the principle that an appeal in a criminal case is premature until after final judgment, viz., that appeals from interlocutory orders of the trial court in criminal cases are not allowed.\u201d So in <em>Raimondi, </em>we held that an order denying a motion by the accused to dismiss an indictment on the ground that widespread publicity prevented a fair trial was an interlocutory order and not immediately appealable. We pointed out that we reached the same conclusion \u201c* * * that there is no right to file an immediate appeal from a denial of a pretrial motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment to the federal constitution, <em>Harris v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 7, and <em>Pearce v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 477 (1970); from an order overruling the defendant\u2019s constitutionally grounded exceptions to the State\u2019s answer to his motion for discovery and inspection, <em>Dodson v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 478 (1970); from the granting of the State\u2019s motion in a noncapital case for a change of venue, <em>Davis v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 480 (1970); from refusal to grant a motion to dismiss an indictment on the ground that the State\u2019s witnesses had made pretrial identifications of the accused in contravention of the principles enunciated in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U. S. 263, and <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, see <em>Powers v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 487 (1970); or from refusal to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>motion to dismiss indictment;- on the ground that they were technically defective, <em>Greathouse v. State, supra. </em>See also <em>Kardy v. Shook, </em>237 Md. 524, holding that an order of the trial court permitting the taking of a pretrial deposition is interlocutory in nature and not immediately appealable.\u201d 8 Md. App. at 474-475. In <em>Edwards v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 255, we held that an order denying a motion to quash charges was interlocutory and the appeal was premature where the only ground was failure of the State to comply with provisions of the Interstate Detainer Act. In <em>Kable v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 16, we concluded that notice of appeal from a denial of the accused\u2019s motion to dismiss the criminal information charging bribery on the ground he was entitled to indictment by a grand jury was an interlocutory nonappealable order. We observe that an accused may still obtain appellate review of all of these matters in the event he is convicted of the substantive offense upon trial on the merits. Rule 1087 provides: \u201cOn an appeal from a final judgment, every interlocutory order which has previously been entered in the action shall be open to review by this Court unless an appeal has theretofore been taken from such interlocutory order and been decided on the merits by this Court.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In the face of the rule that there can be no appeal except from a final judgment, the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Special Appeals following its lead, have entertained an immediate appeal from the refusal of the trial court prior to trial to dismiss an indictment because of the lack of a speedy trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Jones v. State, </em>241 Md. 599; <em>Harris v. State, </em>194 Md. 288; <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 1. And in <em>Brown v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 388, we held that an immediate appeal would lie, prior to trial on the merits, from the denial of a motion asserting a violation of the constitutional right not to be twice put in jeopardy. This was done as a corollary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>rule prohibiting appeals from interlocutory orders. It was explained in <em>Pearlman v. State, </em>226 Md. 67, 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u2018There has been applied through the years a corollary to the rule that there can be no appeal except from a final judgment. Action of a trial court which denies an absolute constitutional right, although seemingly interlocutory, will be reviewed by this Court without requiring the complainant to proceed to final judgment and then seek review of the challenged action on appeal from that judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">But in <em>Pearlman </em>the Court of Appeals recognized a qualification to the corollary, which it had indicated in <em>Lee v. State, </em>161 Md. 430. We discussed <em>Lee </em>in <em>Raimondi, </em>at 470-471:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u201cIn <em>Lee v. State, </em>161 Md. 430, decided in 1931, the Court of Appeals held that \u2018its jurisdiction is limited to the reviewing of final actions of the trial court; \u2019 accordingly, it declined to \u2018take up cases from the trial courts piecemeal.\u2019 Were it otherwise, the <em>Lee </em>court said, \u2018then proceedings in every criminal case, great or small, may be stopped and delayed while the accused prosecutes an appeal * * *\u2019 on matters preliminary to trial on the merits of the case. And this, continued the court in <em>Lee, </em>\u2018would add just so much to the resources of those who might find vexatious delays advantageous, and would multiply appeals in criminal cases, often when acquittals, in the end, would render them profitless.\u2019 The precise holding in <em>Lee </em>was that the selection of the forum to which a capital case had been removed was within the lower court\u2019s discretion and was not a final order immediately reviewable on appeal. Conversely, the court recognized that had there been a refusal to grant the accused his absolute Maryland constitutional right in a capital case to such removal, such a determination would have amounted to a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>judgment on the constitutional right and as such would have been immediately open to review on appeal. <em>Lee </em>concluded, on authority of <em>Tidewater Portland Cement Co. v. State, </em>122 Md. 96, that \u2018only decisions on claims of such absolute constitutional rights have been held reviewable at once,\u2019 and that \u2018orders within the discretion of the lower courts [such as whether to remove a non-capital case] are, on the contrary, not final orders within the meaning of the rules governing the jurisdiction of this court, and are therefore not immediately reviewable, if reviewable at all.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The Court explained the qualification in <em>Pearlman, </em>at 71:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">\u201cThe corollary is subject to the qualification that even though a constitutional right is involved, action of the lower court rightfully exercising discretion as to the functioning of the right will not be so reviewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The distinction between the corollary and the qualification stands out in <em>Pearlman. </em>The Court held that \u201c* * * a ruling by the lower court recognizing that the defendant was indigent but nevertheless denying him the right to pursue a motion for a new trial as an indigent constituted a final judgment on a constitutional right, from which an immediate appeal would lie, since it terminated the right of the indigent accused to further litigate his case.\u201d <em>Raimondi, </em>at 472. The Court made clear, however, that its ruling \u201c* * * does not mean that every exercise of discretion or judgment by the trial courts in determining whether an applicant for a new trial motion is or is not an indigent person, or as to how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>much he can pay towards the cost of a transcript or a lawyer, is immediately appealable.\u201d <em>Pearlman, </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We concluded in <em>Raimondi, </em>at 472:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u201cWe think it clear that <em>Lee </em>and <em>Pearlman </em>share this common thread: that in a criminal proceeding, where the lower court, prior to trial, recognizes the applicability of a particular constitutional right, but nevertheless refuses to apply it in the accused\u2019s case, then such action constitutes a final judgment since it involves the nondiscretionary refusal of the court to grant the accused an absolute constitutional right; but it is otherwise where the lower court makes a determination, based on the facts and circumstances of the case, that the constitutional right is not applicable to the accused\u2019s case, for in that event, as stated by the court in <em>Pearlman, </em>\u2018even though a constitutional right is involved, action of the lower court rightfully exercising discretion as to the functioning of the right will not be so reviewed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">And we expressed our belief, at 473:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">\u201cBut whether a person has been denied a speedy trial or is being placed in double jeopardy will usually turn on the facts and circumstances present in the particular case; and, at least with the exception of those cases where the trial judge concludes that the right exists and is applicable but nevertheless refuses to apply it, the determination of the question by the lower court would always seem to involve an application of judicial discretion \u2018as to the functioning of the right\u2019 squarely within the rules enunciated in <em>Pearlman </em>and <em>Lee </em>prohibiting immediate appeals from interlocutory orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">In <em>Raimondi </em>we did not attempt to resolve the rulings in <em>Lee </em>and <em>Pearlman </em>with the apparent exceptions thereto in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Harris, </em>because \u201cWhether a real distinction exists between the rationale underlying <em>Lee </em>and <em>Pearlman, </em>on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>one hand, and <em>Harris, Jones </em>and <em>Brown, </em>on the other, makes little difference in appellant\u2019s case, since under none of these cases would he have a right to an immediate appeal from the denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment.\u201d 8 Md. App. at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">We believe that the time has come for us to reconsider the position we have taken on the basis of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Harris. </em>On only one of the 25 occasions when the claim was before the Court of Appeals and resolved in a reported opinion did it hold the right to a speedy trial had been unconstitutionally denied, and that one case was <em>Jones. </em>At the time we decided <em>State v. Lawless, </em>13 Md. App. 220, on 21 October 1971, we had dealt with the question in 59 reported opinions, including <em>Lawless. </em>On only two occasions did we hold that the right to a speedy trial was unconstitutionally denied, <em>Wilson v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 299, and <em>Caesar v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 40. See note 4, 13 Md. App. at 226. Since <em>Lawless, </em>we have considered a claim of the denial of a speedy trial in 19 reported opinions, in none of which did we find that the constitutional right was violated. Since the inception of our Court we have had the question of double jeopardy before us in some 18 reported cases. In only two, <em>State v. Campbell, </em>7 Md. App. 538, and <em>Jones v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 504, did we find that another trial would put the accused twice in jeopardy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The piecemeal appellate review of immediate, and, with very few exceptions, patently frivolous appeals from a refusal to dismiss an indictment on an allegation of denial of a speedy trial or of double jeopardy does just what the Court in <em>Lee </em>anticipated. \u201c[Proceedings in every criminal case, great or small, may be stopped and delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>while the accused prosecutes an appeal * * * [adding] just so much to the resources of those who might find vexatious delays advantageous, and [multiplying] appeals in criminal cases * * *.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>at 434. We believe that it is now more beneficial to the proper administration of criminal justice and of little detriment in the circumstances to the vast majority of those accused of crime, that we follow the rulings of <em>Lee </em>and <em>Pearlman </em>rather than the apparent exceptions of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Harris. </em>We observe that we pointed out in <em>Harris v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 7, <em>cert. denied, 255 </em>Md. 741, that the trial court has discretion to defer a motion made before trial raising defenses or objections,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for determination on the general issue. We said, at 19: \u201cIf the court, exercising the discretion so granted, ordered that a pre-trial motion to dismiss based on a denial of a speedy trial or any other ground be deferred for determination at the trial of the general issue, there would be no judgment from which to take an immediate appeal.\u201d See Rule 725 d. Some trial courts have been taking this course, and we perceive no unfavorable results. And we emphasize that the denial of an immediate appeal does not foreclose appellate review of the claim in the event an accused is convicted upon trial on the merits. Rule 1087. The reasoning of the Court of Appeals in the <em>Harris </em>case before it, 194 Md. 288, was based, in part at least, on the thought that should the accused prevail on his motion he would thereby \u201cbecome entitled to be freed of further proceedings\u201d in the case. At 294. The result of a grant of a motion to suppress evidence is frequently the inability of the State to prove its case, but an immediate appeal does not lie from a refusal to grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We are of the opinion, as we indicated in <em>Raimondi, </em>that whether a speedy trial has been denied or whether an accused will be twice put in jeopardy, will usually turn on the facts and circumstances present in the particular case. This has been evident, certainly, in the cases which have come before us. Thus, the determination of the question by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the lower court would seem to involve an application of judicial discretion \u201cas to the functioning of the right\u201d squarely within the rule enunciated in <em>Pearlman </em>and <em>Lee </em>prohibiting immediate appeals from interlocutory orders. We shall follow the rule of <em>Pearlman </em>and <em>Lee </em>except in those cases where the trial judge concludes that the constitutional right exists and is applicable but nevertheless refuses to apply it. To the extent that this is a departure from our cases heretofore decided, we depart from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">DARLENE A. NEAL was charged under a warrant with shoplifting, proscribed by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 551 A. The case came on for trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on 6 December 1972. Upon conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the court <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial. On 3 July 1973. Neal moved that \u201cthe warrant and all charges arising thereunder be dismissed\u201d for reason that any subsequent trial would put her twice in jeopardy. The motion was denied prior to a retrial upon hearing on 25 July. Neal appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">It is clear from the reasons given by the hearing judge that he recognized the constitutional right but on the facts and circumstances found that it was not applicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the determination by the court below to deny the motion to dismiss was an exercise of judicial discretion as to the functioning of the right. As such, it was interlocutory, and appeal therefrom was premature. We dismiss the appeal. Rule 1035, \u00a7\u00a7 a and b.

At the aborted trial the State attempted to show through its first witness, a store employee, the value of the goods alleged to have been stolen. Objection was made on the ground that the witness could not identify the articles as those which had been stolen. Thereupon, the articles were introduced for identification only on a proffer by the State that it would offer them into evidence upon testimony of a store detective who had recovered them. The court said: \u201cIf the proffer is not made good, the Court proposes to entertain favorably by you a motion to strike that evidence. The Court will permit his testimony concerning the value, subject to making good on your proffer.\u201d Later in the trial when the State attempted to make good on its proffer, the defense for the first time, challenged the admissibility of the articles on the ground of an illegal search and seizure. The court, upon hearing out of the presence of the jury, granted the motion to suppress. Subsequently it granted a mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>because it believed that the striking of the testimony concerning the articles would not be sufficient to enable Neal to have a fair trial, even though it was of the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to convict with the challenged articles excluded.
