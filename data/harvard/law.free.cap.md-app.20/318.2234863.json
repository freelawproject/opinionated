Wilson, Jr., contends (1) that the trial court\u2019s expressions of incredulity during the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother constituted reversible error, (2) that the testimony of a defense witness that on the night of the shooting the decedent asked him for a gun was improperly excluded, (3) that the sworn affidavits given to the police by two prosecution witnesses, called as the court\u2019s witnesses, were improperly received and the court then erred in failing to instruct the jury on their limited use; and (4) that at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial the court erred in refusing to consider the results of polygraph examinations, made after the conclusion of the trial, of appellant and his mother, as well as the testimony of the polygraph examiner, and in refusing to permit appellant to lay a foundation for such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">We conclude that the third assignment of error must be sustained, and for this reason alone the conviction must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. We do, however, also consider appellant\u2019s other contentions for the guidance of the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Appellant, age 21, shot and killed a neighborhood acquaintance, age 20, after an argument which took place on the street in July, 1972, in the 2600 block of West Forest Park Avenue in Baltimore at about 10:30 in the evening. The weapon used was his father\u2019s single barrel hunting rifle which appellant obtained from his parents\u2019 bedroom after an exchange of angry words between him and the victim. The theory of the defense was that the deceased was in possession of a gun and that the appellant, warned by his mother as they were leaving the scene of the confrontation, wheeled and ducked and fired at his antagonist, killing in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">With respect to the third assignment of error, the record discloses that on the day of trial the State presented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>written motion requesting that the court call, as its own witnesses, three young men, eyewitnesses to the shooting, on the ground that both the witnesses and their parents had been intimidated, specifying instances of such intimidation, that the witnesses were \u201cterrified\u201d and the State could not vouch for their veracity. Over objection, the motion was granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The court thereafter called the three witnesses, Alfred Tuck, 24, Mark Craig, 20, and Winslow Holman, 18. After \u201cdirect\u201d examination by the court, the three were then cross-examined by the State and the defense, in that order. During the State\u2019s cross-examination of Tuck and Craig, the court received in evidence, over objection by appellant\u2019s trial counsel, affidavits given by them to the investigating police officers during the early morning hours of July 11, 1972, following the shooting on the evening of July 10. Holman\u2019s affidavit was not offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Tuck\u2019s affidavit contains the following statement in response to a police officer\u2019s question as to what he knew about the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cA. Yes, i was in the area of Forrest Park Burleith st., visiting some friends, and i saw Joe and Tommy argueing in the street. Tommy said wait a minute, and went into his house on forrest Park then came back several minutes later with a gun, i don\u2019t know if it was a rifle or shotgun, and he told Joe to \u2018go ahead\u2019, and Joe said \u2018if your going to shoot me, you better kill me\u2019, then Tommy fired and Joe fell to the street and i ran to tell Joe\u2019s Parants and thats it.\u201d (as in the original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">During his direct examination by the court, Tuck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>responded to a question as to \u201cwhat happened\u201d when appellant returned to the street;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201cIt was a shotgun. I mean, whatever it was it fired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u201cQ. Did you see it or hear it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">A. I heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">Q. Who had the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">A. I think it was Tommy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Upon objection, the court struck the last answer, cautioning the witness and asking the further question: \u201cWhat did you see? \u201d To this, the witness replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I see [sic], Your Honor. It could have been a shot fired. I took off with everybody else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">\u201cQ. Now, prior to hearing the shot, did you hear anybody say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">A. No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t pay that much attention, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">The State, at the outset of its cross-examination of Mr. Tuck, had him identify his affidavit, including his signature and verification. The testimony then continued in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">\u201cQ. But you did see this defendant with the gun did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">A. Yes, at the time he returned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">Q. Well, at that time, that was the only gun you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-19\">A. Right. That was, at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-20\">Q. Those were the only two arguing in the street at that time, were they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-21\">A. Right. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Q. Didn\u2019t you also tell the police officer that the deceased, Mr. Harris, told the defendant to go ahead and said, \u2018If you\u2019re going to shoot me, you had better kill me\u2019?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">After a somewhat evasive response, the State pressed the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cQ. Well, what exactly did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">A. He said something about, \u2018If you\u2019re going to shoot, shoot.\u2019 I didn\u2019t say that part about killing. I don\u2019t know. \u2018Shoot, if you\u2019re going to shoot.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">On cross-examination by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201cQ. If [the decedent had a gun in his possession], you didn\u2019t see it, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">A. Right, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">And on further cross-examination by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cQ. You saw the shots fired by the defendant that hit Joe Harris, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">A. What I was saying, what I\u2019m saying, is that I was in conference with Eugene Banks, and my back was turned. I heard the shot fired, and we turned around, and we seen the defendant [decedent] laying on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">\u201cQ. But at that time, that morning after what happened, you had a fresher recollection of what, in fact, did happen, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">A. I was still puzzled about certain things about what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">Q. It\u2019s also been some time, has it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">A Yes it has.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-18\">Q. Since this happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-19\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-20\">MR. MITCHELL: No further questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The State thereupon offered the witness\u2019 affidavit in evidence. In response to vigorous opposition by the defense, the court stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201c. .. it\u2019s even better than oral testimony It\u2019s signed and written and it\u2019s within this court\u2019s discretion, to allow that not as substantive evidence, but to impeach the witness, and the jury, of course, in determining whether or not to believe his testimony on the witness stand, has the right to consider the fact that he\u2019s made to a large degree an inconsistent statement on another occasion. So, I\u2019ll overrule your objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">When the witness Mark Craig testified, he was also interrogated by the court in the first instance and was thereafter cross-examined by the State and by defense counsel. He told the court that he had observed the two men arguing and appellant leave and return with a gun. He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201cA. . . . Well, next thing I know, the gun just went off somehow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">Q. Did you hear it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">Q. And were you looking in the direction of where it went off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">A. I wasn\u2019t looking in the direction, but I saw where it went off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">Q. I see. Then you looked in that direction. What did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">A. Then, like I said, I heard a shot, and I turned around, and Arthur was laying on the ground.... Then the defendant went back down the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">Questioned by the State, Craig verified his signature on the affidavit given to the police. He was asked if it accurately described what had happened that evening and he replied, \u201cAs far as I can remember, right.\u201d The testimony continued in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201cQ. They started arguing as if they were going to fight or something? Do you remember saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">A. Well, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">Q. ... Do you remember saying that Tommy walked away from Bunky, and said, Til be right back .. . [and] came back with either a rifle or shotgun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">Q. Do you remember also saying ... to the police officers at the time that Arthur Harris said, \u2018Tommy, if you shoot me, you had better kill me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">Q. Then you remember saying that then Tommy shot Bunky and ran down the street, and jumped into his car, and drove off in it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">A. Yes. There was a shot, and Tommy was the only one that I could see with a gun, was Tommy, and there was a shot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">On cross-examination by the defense Craig was pressed as to whether the words imputed to the decedent were not suggested by the detective, but answered, after initial hesitation: \u201cThose words were mine.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">\u201cMR. FREEDMAN: ... I would like you to explain to this jury how come those words, that quote of Bunky\u2019s, is in your statement exactly like the one in Tuck\u2019s statement? Can you or can\u2019t you explain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I can, because that\u2019s what he was saying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">At the conclusion of Craig\u2019s testimony, the State offered his affidavit and it too was received, over objection, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>overruling the objection for the \u201csame reason\u201d as earlier stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The pertinent passage in Craig\u2019s affidavit was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cI got up off the car and walked up to them to see what they were arguing about. Tommy walked away from Bunky and said \u2018I\u2019ll be right back.\u2019 He left. Tommy went into his house and came back with a rifle or shotgun. It had only one barrell. Tommy said something to Bunky and they started arguing again. Bunky did not move because Tommy had the gun. Bunky said \u2018Tommy if you shot me you better kill me.\u2019 . . . Tommy and Bunky kept arguing. Then Tommy shot Bunky, ran down the Street jumped into his car and drove off in it. He drove down Forrest Park Ave.\u201d (as in the original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">it is apparent from the trial court\u2019s explanation for overruling the objection that the court relied upon the rules of evidence relating to the use of prior inconsistent statements for purposes of impeachment in receiving the affidavits of Tuck and Craig. Appellant in his brief also places principal reliance upon the law limiting the use of such statements, citing <em>Green v. </em>State, 243 Md. 154, 220 A. 2d 544 (1966) and <em>Vandergrift v. </em>State, 13 Md. App. 277, 282 A. 2d 528 (1971), and argues that the lower court committed reversible error in failing to instruct the jury on their limited use.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The distillation of these and other Maryland cases which are concerned with the subject of surprise is that while evidence of extrajudicial statements made by a witness not a party and whose declarations are not binding as admissions is admissible to contradict him and therefore afford the party calling him an opportunity to show why he called him, such statements are not probative evidence on the merits and are not to be treated as having any substantive or independent testimonial value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The record before us discloses that indeed no instruction as to the limited use of the statements for the former purpose was given by the court. It also discloses that appellant requested no such instruction nor did he object to the failure of the court to so instruct. Were we in fact confronted with a situation involving the use of prior inconsistent statements to impeach a witness, our present inquiry would have to be whether this Court should take cognizance of a plain error in instructions, assumed to be material to the rights of the accused, such error being, however, one of omission and not one of commission. <em>Brown v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 415, 287 A. 2d 62 (1972); <em>Taylor v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 41, 299 A. 2d 841 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">That question does not present itself, however, on the facts before us because the law relating to the use of prior inconsistent statements is inapplicable here. Tuck\u2019s in-court testimony, as indicated earlier, was that he saw appellant and no one else with a gun, that appellant and the decedent were engaged in argument, that the decedent told appellant, \u201cShoot, if you are going to shoot,\u201d and that although he did not see the shot fired because his back was turned, he \u201cheard the shot fired\u201d and when he turned around saw the decedent lying on the ground. The version of the decedent\u2019s remark insisted upon by Tuck in court was slightly at variance with the version in his affidavit, \u201cIf your going to shoot me, you better kill me,\u201d and his insistence in court that he did not see the shot fired, but only heard it, was arguably at variance with his statement to the police, \u201cTommy fired and Joe fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>to the street\u201d; arguably, because the latter is also construable as a mere inference by Tuck from observations which he verified in his testimony in court. The test of what amounts to a self-contradiction is well stated in 3A Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1040 (Chadbourn rev. 1970) where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cAs a general principle, it is to be understood that this inconsistency is to be determined, not by individual words or phrases alone, but by the <em>whole impression or the effect </em>of what has been said or done.\u201d (Emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Wigmore quotes with approval <em>United States v. </em>Holmes, 1 Cliff. 98, 116 (1858), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cDirectness, in the technical sense, is not necessary to give the evidence that character, nor is it necessary that the contradiction should be complete and entire, in order to admit the opposing testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Despite the lower court\u2019s conclusion that self-contradiction had been shown with respect to Tuck\u2019s testimony, we are not persuaded that this was so as respects either the details of his testimony or its \u201cwhole impression or . . . effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Nor do we find inconsistency with respect to the testimony of Craig. In court, Craig confirmed that his affidavit accurately described the events of the shooting \u201cas far as [he] remember[ed].\u201d He testified that of the two disputants only appellant had a gun, that the decedent told appellant \u201cTommy, if you shoot me, you had better kill me,\u201d and that <em>based on his inference from his observations </em>he had indeed told the police that appellant shot the decedent before jumping in his car and driving off. In no material respect whatever, therefore, did Craig contradict the statements made in his affidavit but, on the contrary, verified or explained them in court to the full and evident satisfaction of the State. Indeed the only impeachment that took place in court was the effort of defense counsel to discredit the affidavit itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Putting the best face on the State\u2019s use of Craig\u2019s affidavit, as well as, we think, of Tuck\u2019s, it appears that we are confronted with a situation considerably more closely akin to that of a party using a prior statement to refresh a witness\u2019 present recollection. In Underhill, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 499 (5th ed. 1956), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cIt sometimes happens that state witnesses, who have given written statements, become unwilling, forgetful, or evasive when called upon to testify. In such case the prosecuting attorney, sometimes claiming surprise, may call the witness\u2019 attention to the prior statement, not so much for purposes of impsachment but to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Similarly, Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 849 (12th ed. 1955), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cThe court may, in its discretion, permit a party to put questions to his witness on direct examination to refresh his recollection, by directing his attention to a particular matter or asking questions relating to prior statements or prior testimony, or by reading to him his prior testimony or portions therefrom, especially when it appears that the witness is unfriendly toward the party calling him, or is trying to evade the questions put to him.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Although here the State was engaged not in direct examination but in cross-examination of Tuck and Craig, cross-examination to refresh a witness\u2019 recollection on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>basis of prior statements may be permitted. Its propriety lies largely withun tne sound discretion of the trial judge. 3 Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 <em>764; see United States v. Baratta, </em>397 F. 2d 215 (1968); <em>Young v. United States, </em>214 F. 2d 232 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Yet from the quite legitimate (and here successful) use of the prior statements of Tuck and Craig by the State.to refresh their memory or \u201cawaken their conscience,\u201d <em>People v. Malston, </em>258 N.E.2d 362, 365 (Ill. 1970), the State can take no comfort, for the affidavits should not have been received in evidence over appellant\u2019s objection. As stated in Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 416 (13th \u201eed. 1973): \u201cSince it is the witness\u2019 present recollection, not the memorandum, which is the evidence, the memorandum itself is not admissible, nor may the contents thereof be read to the jury. But such a memorandum is admissible in evidence when introduced by opposing, counsel.\u201d And as Wigmore has it: \u201cThat the <em>offering party </em>has not the right to treat it as evidence, by reading it or showing it or handling [sic] it to the jury, is well established.\u201d 3 Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 763. <em>See also </em>Underhill <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 499; 82 A.L.R.2d 473; <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 364, 234 A. 2d 775 (1967); <em>Bulluck v. State, </em>219 Md. 67, 148 A. 2d 433 (1959). By contrast, when the recollection of a witness is not refreshed by reference to a memorandum but he recalls the memorandum and recalls that it was accurate when made, he may testify from the memorandum or it may be received in evidence in connection with his direct examination, Underhill, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 500; <em>Askins v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 702, 284 A. 2d 626 (1971), the reason being one of necessity. 82 A.L.R.2d 522. But the testimony here establishes that Tuck and Craig possessed a recollection of the shooting that was not dependent on their prior statements and thus did not require proof of the latter. Their affidavits, therefore, were inadmissible in evidence and it was error for the court to receive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Nor, contrary to a suggestion by the State in brief, can we find that this error was harmless and not prejudicial to appellant. It is true that a third eyewitness, Winslow Holman, whose affidavit to the police was not made use of by the State on examination nor offered in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>testified to the essential facts of the shooting;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and as a rule the testimony of a singla_eyewitness,. if believed, is legally sufficient to convict. <em>Rodgers v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 407, 414, 243 A. 2d 28 (1968). But on balance we are unable to say that it was this testimony, and indeed the combined inculpatory in-court testimony of all three eyewitnesses that constituted the sole foundation of the jury\u2019s verdict and not the evidence of the two affidavits which it had before it in the jury room. A measure of the danger which these affidavits, improperly in the jury\u2019s hands, posed to its impartial deliberation upon the evidence <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the following language from the remainder of Craig\u2019s affidavit which, while <em>merely </em>cumulative of his in-court testimony insofar as hearing on the issue of alleged prior inconsistency, was <em>'prejudicially </em>cumulative in its potential effect on the outcome of the jury\u2019s deliberations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cQ. Are you sure the person who shot BUNKY, Arthur Joe Harris, thereby causing his death was Tommy Wilson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">A. Yes there is no doubt that it was Tommy Wilson who shot Bunky and killed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">Q. Is there anything you want to add to this statement that you have not previously stated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">A. No, other than I did not think Tommy would shoot Arthur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">What is at stake here, it must be remembered, is the constitutional right of appellant to a fair and impartial jury trial. In these circumstances, \u201can error in admitting plainly relevant evidence which <em>possibly influenced </em>the jury adversely to a. litigant cannot ... be conceived of as harmless.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18, 23 (1967) (emphasis added); <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85 (1963). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>We hold that it was reversible error for the court to receive the affidavits in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the trial judge also committed reversible error by \u201ctelegraphing to the jury his disbelief of a key defense witness.\u201d Specifically it is argued that \u201cby the manner and nature of his questioning of Mrs. Wilson\u201d (appellant\u2019s mother) and by his facial expressions during her questioning the trial judge made it clear to the jury that he did not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">That the trial court found appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony incredible is abundantly clear from the transcript. At a bench conference the court stated: \u201cI am thinking of holding her for perjury\u201d; and also that her testimony \u201chits me right in the pit of my stomach.\u201d The court\u2019s incredulity was based essentially upon the mother\u2019s testimony that she had told no one \u2014 neither the police nor her son\u2019s attorney nor neighborhood boys threatening reprisals against appellant for the shooting of the decedent \u2014 that she had seen the decedent pull out a gun just before he was shot by the appellant and, therefore, that her son had fired in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">At the bench, it was brought to the trial court\u2019s attention by counsel for appellant that the court had, by facial and oral expressions, manifested to the jury his disbelief in the mother\u2019s testimony. Defense counsel stated: \u201cYour Honor was shaking his head and smiling as if she was incredible.\u201d The court responded that he \u201cwasn\u2019t conscious of that\u201d but if it had occurred, \u201cit was natural.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The State contends that the court\u2019s conduct did not go beyond acts of intervention by a trial judge in the questioning of a witness to insure the development of essential facts. <em>See Madison v. State, </em>200 Md. 1, 87 A. 2d 593 (1952); <em>Jefferies v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 630, 248 A. 2d 807 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">It is the duty of trial counsel to take appropriate action on the record to preserve for appellate review a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>prejudicial error because of alleged absence of judicial restraint. Counsel should not hestitate to make formal objection and move for a mistrial. This was not done in the instant case and the question of whether the trial court committed reversible error in this regard is not before us. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Winslow Holman, the third eyewitness called by the court, was later recalled as a defense witness. The court sustained an objection to proffered testimony that the victim asked Holman for a gun on the evening of the shooting. It is appellant\u2019s position that this testimony would have tended to establish that the decedent had a gun when he was shot; and that the testimony of appellant, appellant\u2019s mother and uncle that each had seen a gun in the decedent\u2019s hand would have been corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The proffer made by defense counsel at a bench conference, at which the witness was present and was interrogated by the court, was that Holman was informed by the deceased earlier that evening that he had been robbed and that the deceased then asked the witness for a gun. Mr. Holman had not seen the alleged robbery. He did not give the decedent a gun; nor had he seen him in possession of a gun at any time that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Testimony by witness Holman that the deceased told him he had been robbed would have been hearsay and inadmissible; however, testimony by him that the deceased had asked him . . . for a gun was a non-hearsay utterance, a non-assertive implied expression of the deceased\u2019s state of mind not resting for its value upon his credibility, and was thus evidentiary on the defense of self-defense. Its weight, in our judgment, should be left to the jury. McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>(2d ed. 1972), \u00a7 246, p. 584; \u00a7 249, p. 590; <em>cf. Wilkins v. </em>State, 11 Md. App. 113, 131, 273 A. 2d 236, 245 (1971). The exclusion of the admissible testimony was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On January 12, 1973, the day after the verdict, appellant filed a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The subject of a lie detector test had not been mentioned at trial nor was there any proffer of evidence from such a test. <em>See Sylvester v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 638, 647, 299 A. 2d 124 (1973). The motion for a new trial was also silent on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">A hearing on the motion was not held until March 9, 1973 at which appellant was represented by both his trial counsel and by counsel on this appeal. In the interim, appellant\u2019s new counsel had persuaded both appellant and his mother to submit to polygraph examinations. The examiner, Harry Mahoney, Esq., was prepared to testify that appellant and Mrs. Wilson told the truth at the trial as to how the shooting occurred, including their testimony that decedent had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">It is contended that the trial court erred in refusing to receive this testimony at the new trial hearing and in refusing to permit the expert\u2019s testimony concerning the reliability of the polygraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In <em>Ragler v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 671, 308 A. 2d 401 (1973), appellant advanced as a reason for a new trial that he now wished to submit to a lie detector test. We held that the trial court \u201cquite properly ruled that this afforded no basis to award a new trial.\u201d That the appellant in this case, and appellant\u2019s mother, had actually taken the tests after the trial provides no basis for a departure from <em>Ragler </em>nor, indeed, for a reconsideration of the principle adopted by this Court in <em>Rawlings v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 611, 256 A. 2d 704 (1969) that evidence of polygraph tests is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded ftir a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">. The authority of a trial judge in the exercise of his sound discretion to call and examine witnesses of his own accord under appropriate circumstances is not at issue here and is well established, 67 A.L.R.2d 538, 540; 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 704 (12th ed. 1958); 42 Harv. L. Rev. 445 (1929), as is the rule that witnesses called by the court are subject to cross-examination by both the prosecution and the defense. 67 A.L.R.2d, <em>supra, </em>551; 3A Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 910, 918 (Chadbourn rev. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. This is the orthodox view, adopted in the great majority of jurisdictions including Maryland'. <em>See </em>133 A. L. R. 1454. In <em>West v. Belle Isle Cab Co. </em>203 Md. 244, 100 A. 2d 17 (1953), the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>acknowledged Wigmore\u2019s criticism of the view but said, \u201c[T]his Court has joined in the universality of its acceptance.\u201d At 253. The minority view, permitting the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements on the theory that the usual dangers of hearsay are largely nonexistent where the witness testifies at trial, has been urged by most legal commentators, finds expression in current proposals to codify the law of evidence and has been adopted in some jurisdictions, most notably in several federal eases arising in -the Second Circuit. <em>See U. S. v. DeSisto, </em>329 F. 2d 929 (2d Cir. 1964); <em>Taylor v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>344 F. 2d 281, 283 (2d Cir. 1965), <em>cert. den. </em>382 U. S. 831; <em>see also California v. Green, </em>399 U. S. 149 (1970) where, without having \u201cto decide which of these positions, purely as a matter of the law of evidence, is the sounder,\u201d the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation was not \u201cnecessarily inconsistent\u201d with California\u2019s decision to change its hearsay rules to reflect the minority view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. In <em>U. S. v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., </em>310 U. S. 150 (1940), the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Mr. justice Douglas, found no reversible error in the government\u2019s use of grand jury testimony in some 90 instances to refresh the recollection of witnesses who were characterized by \u201cobvious hostility and evasiveness,\u201d where the trial court was \u201calert to stop impeachment\u201d and \u201conly in about one-sixth of the instances was any inconsistency in testimony developed. In the balance, recollection was either not refreshed or the testimony which had been given was wholly or substantially consistent with the previous grand jury testimony.\u201d 310 U.
