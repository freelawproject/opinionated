William Anderson, Petition no. 158187, was called for an adjudicatory hearing before Master Theodore Hayes in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes. At the adjudicatory hearing testimony was presented by the State of Maryland and by William Anderson. At the conclusion of testimony, Master Hayes announced a finding that, based on the evidence before the Court, respondent William Anderson was not delinquent, and submitted a written recommendation to the Honorable Robert I. H. Hammerman, Judge, Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes, that an order be entered dismissing the juvenile petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u201cOn May 16,1973, the case of State of Maryland v. Michael A. Epps, Petition no. 004617, was called for an adjudicatory hearing before Master Paul A. Smith, Jr. in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes. At the adjudicatory hearing testimony was presented by the State of Maryland and by Michael A. Epps. At the conclusion of testimony, Master Smith announced a finding that, based on the evidence before the Court, respondent Michael A. Epps was not delinquent, and submitted a written recommendation to the Honorable Robert I. H. Hammerman, Judge, Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes, that an order be entered dismissing the juvenile petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u201cOn June 20, 1973, the case of State of Maryland v. Larry Smith, Petition no. 003285, was called for an adjudicatory hearing before Master Paul A. Smith, Jr., in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes. The hearing was recessed on that date prior to completion until June 27, 1973, and was recessed again prior to completion until July 18, 1973 at which time it was completed. At the adjudicatory hearing testimony was presented by the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>of Maryland and by Larry Smith. At the conclusion of testimony, Master Smith announced a finding that, based on the evidence before the Court, respondent Larry Smith was not delinquent, and submitted a written recommendation to the Honorable Robert I. H. Hammerman, Judge, Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes, that an order be entered dismissing the juvenile petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cOn January 25, 1973, the case of State of Maryland v. Donald Brady, Petition no. 000471, was called for an adjudicatory hearing before Master Bernard Peter, in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes. At the adjudicatory hearing testimony was presented by the State of Maryland. At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, counsel for Donald Brady moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that the State\u2019s evidence did not constitute a prima facie case. Master Peter granted the motion and submitted a written recommendation to the Honorable Robert I. H. Hammerman, Judge Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes that an order be entered dismissing the juvenile petition.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">On 16 May 1972 the State filed written exceptions to the master\u2019s finding that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the charge against Anderson and his recommendation that the case be dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On 26 September Anderson filed a motion to dismiss the exceptions. The crux of the motion was that an adjudicatory hearing before the judge of the juvenile court would put him twice in jeopardy on the matter of his delinquency. He urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>that the finding of the master be final. According to the docket entries in Matter of Anderson, Docket No. 158187, on 13 October there was an \u201cException Hearing on Motion to Dismiss\u201d before Hammerman, J., presiding in the Juvenile Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ruling on the motion was held <em>sub curia. </em>Memoranda were filed by the parties. There were further hearings on 27 March 1973 and 17 May. On 29 June stipulations of fact were filed and on 1 August the court granted the motion to dismiss the exceptions, and confirmed the recommendation of the master to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The State filed exceptions to the findings and recommendation of the master as to Brady on 26 January 1973, as to Epps on 16 May 1973, and as to Smith on 20 July 1973. In each case a motion to dismiss the exceptions was filed, and in each case, following its holding as to Anderson, the court entered an order on 3 August 1973 dismissing the exceptions and confirming the recommendation of the master to dismiss the petition filed against the child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On 7 August the State filed a \u201cConsolidated Appeal\u201d from the order of 1 August as to Anderson and from the orders of 3 August as to Brady, Epps and Smith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u201cThe right to take an appeal is entirely statutory, and no person or agency may prosecute an appeal unless the right is given by statute.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Pack, </em>250 Md. 306, 309; <em>State v. Lohss, </em>19 Md. App. 489.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to 1 January 1974 the right to appeal in juvenile proceedings was set out in Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-25, under the subtitle \u201cJuvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Causes\u201d: \u201cAn aggrieved party may appeal from any final order, judgment, or decree of the juvenile court to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner prescribed by the Maryland Rules.\u201d In <em>Matter of Waters, </em>13 Md. App. 95, footnote 6, at 99, and in <em>Aye v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 32, footnote 5, at 36, we suggested by way of <em>obiter dictum </em>that the State had no right of an appeal from a determination of a juvenile court not to waive its jurisdiction. The primary basis of this conclusion was that under Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-16 (c) as then in effect, only \u201can order of waiver\u201d was to be considered a final order, terminating the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. If jurisdiction was not waived, the juvenile court, of course, retained its jurisdiction, and the case proceeded under juvenile procedures. Thus, an order refusing to waive jurisdiction was interlocutory. But we also indicated, and this is what appellees seize upon, that because the definition of \u201cparty\u201d in the juvenile cause subtitle, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-1 (e), did not include the State, the right of \u201can aggrieved party\u201d to appeal, did not encompass the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Since our <em>dictum </em>in <em>Waters </em>and <em>Aye, </em>we have been afforded a new insight into the legislative intent concerning appeals in juvenile causes. Chapter 2, Acts 1973, First Extraordinary Session of the General Assembly of Maryland, repealed the provisions of the Annotated Code of Maryland dealing with courts and the judiciary and re-enacted them with revisions to be codified as the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This was a result of the Governor\u2019s establishment of a Commission to Revise the Annotated Code. The Governor charged the Commission with the responsibility of a formal revision of the public general laws, including an improved scheme of organization, elimination of obsolete or unconstitutional provisions, resolution of inconsistencies and conflicts in the laws, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the general improvement of language and expression. The laws as re-enacted made, in large measure, only stylistic revisions, and those in which substance appears were, in general, not changes of a major nature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Among the statutes repealed and re-enacted were those involving juvenile causes. Statutes concerning juvenile causes now appear in subtitle 8 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The right to appeal in juvenile proceedings no longer appears as a separate section in the Juvenile Causes subtitle; it is now \u00a7 12-301, \u201cAppeals from Final Judgments\u201d, subtitle 3, \u201cReview of Decisions of Trial Courts of General Jurisdiction\u201d, Title 12, \u201cAppeals, Certiorari, and Certification of Questions\u201d. The section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cExcept as provided in \u00a7 12-302, a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law. In a criminal case, the defendant may appeal even though imposition of execution of sentence has been suspended.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>We find it clear from the discussion of \u00a7 12-301 in the Commission\u2019s Report No. 3 F, pp. 77-78, and the revisor\u2019s note to the section, that the only substantive change intended from the law as it formerly existed was to allow an appeal from a trial court\u2019s exercise of special statutory original jurisdiction, as opposed to common-law original jurisdiction, which appeal, by case law, was previously denied in the absence of express statutory authority. This substantive change did not affect the appeal in juvenile causes because under Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-25, there existed before the enactment of Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301 the right of appeal from a final judgment of a circuit court in the exercise of its special statutory jurisdiction over juvenile causes. We believe that the Commission in proposing \u00a7 12-301, and the Legislature in enacting it, intended no departure from the law concerning appeals in juvenile causes as it previously existed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It follows, therefore, that \u00a7 12-301 reflects what Art. 26, \u00a7 70-25 provided, the change in language, style and scheme of organization serving merely to clarify as to juvenile causes, the right to appeal. The Court of Appeals said in <em>Welch v. Humphrey, </em>200 Md. 410, 417:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cIt is true that a codification of previously enacted legislation, eliminating repealed laws and systematically arranging the laws by subject matter, becomes an official Code when adopted by the Legislature, and, since it constitutes the latest expression of the legislative will, it controls over all previous expressions on the subject, if the Legislature so provides. However, the principal function of a Code is to reorganize the statutes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>state them in simpler form. Consequently any changes made in them by a Code are presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than change of meaning. Therefore, even a change in the phraseology of a statute by a codification thereof will not ordinarily modify the law, unless the change is so radical and material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakably from the language of the Code. <em>Welsh v. Kuntz, </em>196 Md. 86, 97, 75 A. 2d 343, 347.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Thus we can ascertain what former Art. 26, \u00a7 70-25 meant by what Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301 provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">By providing that \u201ca party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil * * * case <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by a circuit court\u201d, \u00a7 12-301 includes a court within the meaning of the Juvenile Causes subtitle. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-801, subsections (h) (1) and (h) (2) define court as a circuit court for a county sitting as a juvenile court (except the circuit court for Montgomery County), and the Circuit Court of Baltimore City sitting as a juvenile court. By providing that the right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of \u201coriginal, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction\u201d, \u00a7 12-301 is applicable to a circuit court, with the Montgomery County exception, exercising jurisdiction over juvenile causes. There being no limitation on the meaning of \u201cparty\u201d, and the State as a party in juvenile causes not being within the exceptions designated in \u00a7 12-302, the State may appeal from a final judgment entered in a juvenile case by a circuit court. As this was the clear legislative intent in enacting \u00a7 12-301, it was the intent of Art. 26, \u00a7 70-25. In the light of \u00a7 12-301, we recant our dictum in <em>Waters </em>and <em>Aye </em>that the right of an aggrieved party to appeal in juvenile causes does not encompass the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">We hold that the State had the right to appeal from the orders dismissing the charges against the appellees. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The threshold question presented on the merits of this consolidated appeal is whether juvenile delinquency proceedings as conducted in Maryland are within the ambit of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If they are, we must then determine whether the court below erred in applying the double jeopardy clause to dismiss the petitions filed against the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Supreme Court has established that a juvenile hearing must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment, insisting, in decisions to that end, that they do not \u201cspell the doom of the juvenile court system or even deprive it of its \u2018informality, flexibility, or speed.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKeiver v. </em>Pennsylvania, 403 U. S. 528, 534.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court refused to equate a juvenile proceeding, even the adjudicative phase of it, with a criminal trial. It observed: \u201cIf the formalities of the criminal adjudicative process are to be superimposed upon the juvenile court system, there is little need for its separate existence.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 551. Thus, it has not said that <em>all </em>rights constitutionally assured to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>adult accused of crime also are to be enforced or made available to the juvenile in his delinquency proceeding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But it has held that some of the constitutional requirements attendant upon the state criminal trial have equal application to that part of the state juvenile proceeding that is adjudicative in nature. <em>McKeiver </em>points to six cases that make this apparent \u2014 <em>Haley v. Ohio, </em>332 U. S. 596; <em>Gallegos v. Colorado, </em>370 U. S. 49; <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 U. S. 541; <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U. S. 1; <em>DeBacker v. Brainard, </em>396 U. S. 28; <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358. It spells out some of the constitutional requirements which apply equally to a state criminal trial and a state adjudicative proceeding \u2014 the right to appropriate notice, to counsel, to confrontation and to cross-examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination. Included also is the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On the other hand, the holding in <em>McKeiver </em>was that \u201cTrial by jury in the juvenile court\u2019s adjudicative stage is not a constitutional requirement.\u201d 403 U. S. at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Thus, it is clear that the juvenile court proceeding has not yet been held by the Supreme Court to be a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d and also has not yet been regarded as devoid of criminal aspects merely because it has been given the civil label. <em>McKeiver, </em>403 U. S., at 541; <em>Kent, </em>383 U. S., at 554; <em>Gault, </em>387 U. S., at 17; <em>Winship, </em>397 U. S., at 365-366. \u201cLittle, indeed, is to be gained by any attempt simplistically to call the juvenile court proceeding either \u2018civil\u2019 or \u2018criminal\u2019. The Court carefully has avoided this wooden approach.\u201d <em>McKeiver, </em>403 U. S., at 541. The Supreme Court has not said whether the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment applies to state juvenile proceedings, and if we had need of determining now whether the double jeopardy clause attaches to a juvenile adjudicative hearing our task would be \u201cto ascertain the precise impact of the due process requirement\u201d, as was the task of the Supreme Court with respect to trial by jury in <em>McKeiver </em>and in <em>Gault </em>with respect to other claimed rights. <em>Idem. </em>See <em>Gault, </em>387 U. S., at 13-14.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For the purpose of decision in this case only, however, and explicitly without determining the point, we assume that juvenile delinquency proceedings as conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>in Maryland are within the ambit of the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution, and, on that assumption, address ourselves to the propriety of the action of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The general law provides: \u201cAfter a petition has been filed and unless jurisdiction has been waived, the court shall hold an adjudicatory hearing.\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 3-829 (a). The Maryland Rules make provision for the scheduling of the adjudicatory hearing, Rule 912 a, call for the State\u2019s Attorney to prepare and present the testimony in behalf of the petitioner in a delinquency case, unless excused by the court, Rule 912 b, require the court upon conclusion of the hearing to make and file a brief statement of the grounds upon which it bases its determination, Rule 912 d 1, and, limit continued detention of the child if a dispositional hearing is not held immediately after adjudication, Rule 912 d 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Courts Art. \u00a7 2-501 (a) authorizes the judges of the circuit court for a county, or the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City to employ masters.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Subsection (b) of the section provides that each employee of the court shall perform the duties directed by the judge. There is no specific authority in the general law for a master to conduct a hearing, nor does Rule 912, which concerns \u201cThe Adjudicatory Hearing\u201d, refer to a master. Rule 913, however, entitled \u201cDisposition Hearing\u201d, prescribes in \u00a7 a 1 that \u201cThe judge or master who presided at the adjudicatory hearing shall, wherever possible, preside at the disposition hearing.\u201d The authority for a master to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>conduct an adjudicatory hearing is in Rule 908, dealing with \u201cHearings \u2014 Generally\u201d, under \u00a7 e, entitled \u201cMasters\u201d. Subsection 1 of \u00a7 e, bearing the heading \u201cHearing Before Master\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cThe master shall hear such cases as may be assigned to him by the court and upon the conclusion of the hearing shall announce his findings and recommendations. All papers relating to the case together with the master\u2019s findings and recommendations shall then be transmitted to the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The Rule continues, subsection 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201cThe petitioner or any party may file written exceptions to the master\u2019s findings or recommendations or any part thereof within five (5) days after the hearing. Exceptions by a petitioner after a delinquency hearing may only be taken by the State\u2019s attorney. The clerk designated by the court, upon the filing of such exceptions, shall notify the petitioner and all parties of the time and place of the hearing before the judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Subsection 3 concerns the order of the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201cIn the absence of exceptions, the master\u2019s findings and recommendations shall promptly be confirmed, modified or remanded by the judge. If, within the specified time, exceptions are filed, the judge shall hear the entire matter or such specific matters as set forth in the exceptions <em>de novo.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">It is the requirement that the judge hear the matter <em>de novo </em>upon filing of exceptions which focusses the double jeopardy issue in the cases before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">As we have indicated, the petition alleging that Anderson was a delin quent child was assigned by the juvenile judge for hearing before a master. The master reported under date of 12 May 1972 that the Anderson case was \u201cassigned for hearing before me and hearing was held this date. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>evidence was not sufficient to sustain the charge. It is recommended that the cases be dismissed.\u201d The report was endorsed \u201cApproved: and so ordered\u201d by the juvenile judge the same date. On 16 May the State filed exceptions dated 15 May to the finding of the master and requested the matter be set for hearing before the juvenile judge pursuant to Rule 908 e 2. On 26 September Anderson moved to dismiss the exceptions giving as his primary reason that Rules 908 e 2 and 908 e 3 were unconstitutional as offensive to the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution. After the series of hearings we have above described, the juvenile judge concluded that \u201cjeopardy attaches at the outset of a Master\u2019s adjudicatory hearing and that such a hearing which concludes with a finding of the charge not sustained and recommendation for dismissal, has come so close to the point of actual finality that for the purposes of the constitutional guarantee [against double jeopardy] it must be considered as a final adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not see it that way. We believe the juvenile judge was entirely wrong in his concept and application of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The obvious and inescapable effect of the holding of the juvenile judge is to raise the position of a master to the status of a judge of the circuit court and to emasculate the juvenile judge, whose employee the master is, leaving the judge with no control over the master\u2019s findings and with no part to play but to give <em>pro forma </em>endorsement to the master\u2019s recommendations. Such delegation of the judge\u2019s duties and authority is of a certainty invalid and patently beyond the contemplation of Art. IV of the Maryland Constitution, of the Legislature in authorizing the employment of masters and \u201cother employees necessary to conduct the business of the court\u201d, Courts Art. \u00a7 2-501 (a), and of the Court of Appeals in adopting the Rules of Practice and Procedure concerning masters, Rule 908 e. It is clear that the authority of the master in conducting such hearings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>as the court assigns to him extends only to findings and recommendations. It was not intended that the master assume the duties of a judge by being cloaked with judicial power and authority, but that he assist the judge, as an employee of the court. At the conclusion of the hearing the master must transmit all papers relating to the case to the judge. Rule 908 e 1. Even in the absence of exceptions the judge need not confirm the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, but may modify them or remand them. Rule 908 e 3. And there is no doubt whatsoever that when exceptions are properly made to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, Rule 908 e 2, the judge must hear the matter <em>de novo. </em>Rule 908 e 3. Even if jeopardy attaches at the beginning of the adjudicatory hearing before a master on a charge of delinquency, as we are assuming for the purpose of decision, there is no adjudication by reason of the master\u2019s findings and recommendations.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The proceedings before the master and his findings and recommendations are simply the first phase of the hearing which continues with the consideration by the juvenile judge. Whether the juvenile judge, in the absence of exceptions, accepts the master\u2019s findings or recommendations, modifies them or remands them, or whether, when exceptions are filed, he hears the matter himself <em>de novo, </em>there is merely a continuance of the hearing and the initial jeopardy. In other words, <em>the hearing, </em>and the jeopardy thereto attaching, terminate only upon a valid adjudication by the juvenile judge, not upon the findings and recommendations of the master. Therefore, the action of the juvenile judge, which is an essential requirement of the original hearing, does not put the child twice in jeopardy because there has been no culmination of the first jeopardy.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We conclude that Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>908 e, permitting the State to except to a master\u2019s finding that a child is not delinquent, and requiring a hearing before the juvenile judge, does not violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The \u201cNotice of Exceptions\u201d filed in the Anderson case were signed by an \u201cAssistant State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d Rule 908 e 2 includes the provision: \u201cExceptions by a petitioner after a delinquency hearing may only be taken by the State\u2019s attorney.\u201d Anderson contends that because the Notice of Exceptions here was executed by an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, the Rule was not followed, requiring dismissal of the exceptions. The juvenile judge, although noting it was unnecessary to meet this point in view of his ruling on the primary issue, found the arguments in support thereof \u201cto be unpersuasive and without merit.\u201d With this we are in full accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Rule 908 e 2 provides that the petitioner or any party may file written exceptions, and then limits the taking of exceptions by the petitioner after a delinquency hearing to the State\u2019s attorney. We think the use of the word \u201conly\u201d with reference to the limitation was to avoid any possible misinterpretation and assure that a petitioner in such case shall not take the exceptions. We believe it patent that \u201conly\u201d was not intended to mean, as Anderson would like it to mean, that the State\u2019s Attorney personally, as distinguished from his deputies or assistants, must take the exceptions. We note that there is reference to the State\u2019s attorney throughout the Rules. For example, if the intake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>officer refuses to authorize the filing of a petition, the complainant may submit such complaint for review to the State\u2019s attorney. Rule 901 f 2. See Courts Art. \u00a7 3-812 (a). \u201cA petition alleging delinquency shall be prepared by the State\u2019s attorney.\u201d Rule 903 d. If a respondent over 18 years of age charged with a wilful act or omission causing a child to be adjudicated neglected, delinquent, or in need of supervision, waives trial in the criminal court, trial in the juvenile court shall be prosecuted by the State\u2019s attorney. Rule 910. Waiver of juvenile jurisdiction over a child shall be initiated by the State\u2019s attorney. Rule 911 a. In a delinquency case, the State\u2019s attorney shall prepare and present the testimony in behalf of the petitioner unless excused by the court. Rule 912 b. To construe these Rules to mean that the State\u2019s Attorney alone may take the action prescribed is absurd. We think it evident, as we have stated in <em>State v. </em>Aquilla, 18 Md. App. 487, 493-494, that a State\u2019s Attorney generally may assign to his deputies and assistants the performance, subject to his discretion and control, of the duties required of him by law. See Constitution of Maryland, Art. V, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9; Code, Art. 10, \u00a7 34. <em>Qui facit per alium facit perse.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We hold that the exceptions to the findings and recommendations of the master were properly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In case no. 158187 below, we hold that the juvenile court erred in granting the motion of Anderson to dismiss the exceptions filed by the State on 16 May 1972 to the master\u2019s finding and recommendation of 12 May 1972.

In each case the juvenile court issued an order dated 3 August 1973 dismissing the notice of exception and confirming the recommendation of the master.

Technically, the dismissal of the exceptions would take the matter out of that part of Rule 908 e 3 requiring a hearing <em>de novo </em>when exceptions are filed, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>and put it within the ambit of that part of the Rule prescribing what is to be done in the absence of exceptions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\">.

Nevertheless, at some points in its work, the Commission has found it necessary to make recommendations which do involve the substance of the laws.

Section 12-302 designates exceptions to the right to appeal bestowed by \u00a7 12-301. Subsection (a) denies appeal from a final judgment of a court made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of the District Court, an administrative agency, or a local legislative body, unless expressly granted by law. Subsection (b) declares that \u00a7 12-301 does not apply to appeals in contempt cases, which are governed by \u00a7\u00a7 12-304 and 12-403. Subsection (c) prescribes that in a criminal case, the State may appeal only from a final judgment granting a motion to dismiss or quashing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>or dismissing an indictment, information, presentment, or inquisition in a criminal case.

The constitutional rights so designated are expressly required in juvenile delinquency hearings at the adjudicative stage by Maryland law. The summons to a respondent in a juvenile petition shall give notice of the time and place of hearing and its purpose. Rule 906 c 2. A party is entitled to representation by legal counsel at any stage of any juvenile proceeding. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (d); Rule 918. The Clerk shall issue a summons for each witness requested by each party, Rule 906 d. There are prohibitions against the use of certain information and statements. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-820. See \u00a7 3-834. \u201cA child may remain silent as of right during an adjudicatory hearing on an allegation of delinquency and shall be so advised.\u201d Rule 917. \u201cBefore a child is adjudicated delinquent, the allegation in the petition must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. An uncorroborated confession made by a child out of court is not sufficient proof of delinquency.\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 3-830 (a). We follow the Supreme Court with respect to right to trial by jury. \u201cHearings shall be conducted by the court without a jury.\u201d Rule 908 a. Maryland goes further than the Supreme Court in protecting a juvenile as to the nature of evidence in delinquency hearings. \u201cThe rules of evidence applicable to criminal cases shall apply to delinquency hearings.\u201d Rule 912 c. And although the Supreme Court has refrained from deciding whether a State must provide appellate review in juvenile cases or a transcript or recording of the hearings, Maryland provides for appellate review, Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301 (see <em>supra), </em>and \u201c[ujnless waived by counsel or the parties and approved by the court, proceedings before a judge shall be recorded by stenographic notes or by electronic, mechanical or other appropriate means,\u201d Rule 908 a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b63-5\">. Prior to <em>Benton v. Maryland, supra, </em>in this State protection against double jeopardy was available by way of the common law, there being no clause in the Maryland Constitution prohibiting it. <em>Greathouse v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 675, 688-689. For the meaning of common law double jeopardy see <em>Hoffman v. State, </em>20 Md. 425, 434 and <em>Boone v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 11. In <em>Moquin v. State, </em>216 Md. 524, the issue was whether a juvenile court proceeding placed a child in jeopardy in the common law sense of the phrase. The court found that \u201c* * * the rule of double jeopardy is applicable only when the first prosecution involves a trial before a criminal court or at least a court empowered to impose punishment by way of fine, imprisonment or otherwise as a deterrent to the commission of crime.\u201d At 528. The court concluded that the proceedings in juvenile court did not place a child in jeopardy on the rationale that the juvenile act does not contemplate punishment of children found to be delinquent but contemplates an attempt to correct and rehabilitate. <em>Idem,. </em>We followed this lead in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 105, 109-113. Of course, \"to remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior,\u201d and \u201cto provide for a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the protection of the public interest,\u201d Courts Art. \u00a7 3-802 (a) (2) and (3), are declared purposes of the juvenile law. And see the other purposes as spelled out in subsections (a) (1), (4 ), and <em>(5) </em>of \u00a7 3-802. But under <em>Benton </em>double jeopardy must be applied in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s constitutional constructions and interpretations from time to time of the Fifth Amendment clause. <em>Baker v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 73,77. Whether the <em>Moquin </em>rationale is still viable is questionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. The former law, Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 69, read, in relevant part: \u201cAny judge or judges of any of the eight judicial circuits who otherwise have no power to appoint a master or masters in chancery may appoint a master or masters in chancery for the purposes of this subtitle (Juvenile Causes). * * * Any master in chancery shall perform his duties under the supervision of the judge or judges who appointed him and in accordance with the rules and procedures of that court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">By resolution of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, adopted 31 October 1969, Supreme Bench Rules 901-919, inclusive, relating to Juvenile Causes were rescinded as superseded by Chapter 900 of the Maryland Rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b66-6\">. It was the stated \u201cclear view\u201d of the judge that \u201cthe new and unique situations must make for a newer definition and newer dimensions of double jeopardy.\u201d The Supreme Court, however, has not as yet gone beyond its views as expressed in <em>Benton v. Maryland, supra, </em>which do not compel or support the \u201cclear view\u201d of the juvenile judge here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b67-5\">. We observe that proceedings before a master are not required to be recorded as they are before a judge. See Rule 908 a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b67-6\">. The termination of a criminal trial by the declaration of a mistrial is nowise comparable because the court in a criminal trial, unlike the master in a juvenile cause, has power to adjudicate the case, the general rule being that an accused has the right to have his fate decided by the same trier of fact before whom his trial commenced. A master does not have the power to decide the fate of a juvenile. The law relating to double jeopardy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>mistrials is simply not apposite. See <em>Baker v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 73; <em>Jones v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">We are constrained to observe that if the conclusions of the judge below were indeed correct, the result would not be that a master\u2019s findings and recommendations were conclusive, the judge being merely a rubber stamp to indicate approval, but that juvenile delinquency hearings before a master were improper, requiring that all such hearings in the first instance be before the juvenile judge. The stipulation of facts in the record submitted to us shows that this would place an intolerable burden on judges now assigned to hear juvenile causes, especially in Baltimore City.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. We note that Rule 908 e <em>2 </em>designates the \u201cState\u2019s attorney\u201d, not the State\u2019s Attorney\u201d. The attorney for the State may be construed to include Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys and Deputy State\u2019s Attorneys as well as the State\u2019s Attorney.
