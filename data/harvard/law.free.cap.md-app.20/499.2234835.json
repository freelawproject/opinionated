PICARELLA, JR., a minor, by his mother and next friend, Claire Piearella, filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against SANDRA RHEY PICARELLA, formerly Sandra Rhey Graham, praying that the marriage entered into by them \u201cbe annulled and declared void and of no legal force and effect,\u201d that Sandra be restored to her maiden name, and that the costs be assessed against Ralph.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sandra answered the bill, admitting the allegations therein, and praying the same relief. The case came on for hearing before the Domestic Relations Master as uncontested on all issues. The Master heard testimony and argument and filed his report, all pursuant to Rule S 74 of the Sixth Judicial Circuit of Maryland. He recommended, on his findings of fact and the provisions of Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (b), that relief be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>as prayed by the parties. The court below did not accept the Master\u2019s recommendation. On 7 September 1973 it entered an order denying the \u201cBill of Complaint for Annulment of Marriage.\u201d Ralph noted a timely appeal.

Sixth Judicial Circuit Rule, S74 c 3. The evidence adduced through the testimony of Ralph and his mother and Sandra and her mother, and through three documents \u2014 the marriage license, Ralph\u2019s baptismal certificate and the certificate of Ralph\u2019s birth \u2014 was correctly reflected in the factual findings of the Master, which were not disputed. The Master found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Z\">\u201cBoth parties are residents of the State of Maryland, they were married July 16, 1973, in Frederick, Maryland, and no children have been born, conceived nor adopted during their marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">At the time of the marriage of the parties, [Ralph] was 16-1/2 years of age and [Sandra] was 18 years of age. [Ralph] testified that he orally misrepresented his age as 18 years and altered the date of his birth on his birth certificate at the time application was made for the marriage license of the parties because he had not received the consent of either of his parents to marry. After the parties married, they cohabited on one occasion in the home of [Sandra\u2019s] parents and thereafter [Ralph] returned to the home of his parents where he has continued to live apart from [Sandra] under separate roof continuously without interruption or cohabitation, while [Sandra] still resides in the home of her parents. The Bill of Complaint in this suit was filed July 18, 1973, two days after the marriage of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">[Sandra] testified she is certain she is not now pregnant, she has menstruated since the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>cohabited, and she desires to resume her maiden name, Sandra Rhey Graham.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">The testimony of the parties was duly corroborated by both of their mothers, and there is no hope or expectation of a reconciliation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Ralph contends that the marriage was \u201cabsolutely void <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>He relies on Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a), which, as amended by Acts 1973, ch. 651, \u00a7 29, effective 1 July 1973, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cA male over the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, or a female over the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, may marry, with the consent of the parent or guardian, if the parent or guardian swears or affirms that the child or ward is over the age of 16 years. A male over the age of 16 years or a female over the age of 16 years may marry without parental or guardian\u2019s consent, where required, upon presenting a certificate from a licensed physician stating that he has examined the female and positively ascertained that she is pregnant or has given birth to a child.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Sandra, being over the age of 18 years, was without the provisions of the statute. Ralph, being over the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, was squarely within its ambit. For him to marry in compliance with the statute, his parent had both to consent to the marriage and swear that he was over the age of 16 years, unless he presented a certificate from a licensed physician stating that the physician had examined Sandra and positively ascertained that she was pregnant or had given birth to a child. It is clear, as the Master found, that neither of Ralph\u2019s parents consented to the marriage, that no such certificate was presented and that the marriage license was procured upon Ralph\u2019s false statement as to his age, and alteration of his birth certificate, all of which was known to Sandra. This made Ralph, certainly, and Sandra, probably, subject to prosecution for committing a misdemeanor, Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 11 (a), and for perjury, \u00a7 11 (b). And see <em>State v. Floto, </em>81 Md. 600. But, the matter of criminal penalties to which they might be subject, is not before us. The question is what effect did the violation of the provisions of Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a) have on the validity of the marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u201cIt is well known that marriage, while from its very nature a sacred obligation, is nevertheless a civil contract and is regulated by law.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>193 Md. 489, 496. \u201cWhile marriage is a civil contract, it is, as said by <em>Story, Conflict of Laws, </em>paragraph 108n., \u2018something more than a mere contract. It is rather to be deemed an institution of society, founded upon the consent and contract of the parties, and in this view it has some peculiarities in its nature, character, operation and extent of obligation, different from what belong to ordinary contracts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oswald </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>v. Oswald, </em>146 Md. 313, 315. \u201cUndoubtedly in the eye of the law marriage is a civil contract differing from other contracts in the circumstances that it cannot be rescinded by the mere consent of the parties.\u201d <em>Ridgely v. Ridgely, </em>79 Md. 298, 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The general rule is that \u201c* * * marriages shall stand and not be nullified except with caution, and only upon clear, satisfactory proof of recognized grounds of nullification. The courts are not authorized to annul them merely because it may seem well for the particular parties before them.\u201d <em>Samuelson v. Samuelson, </em>155 Md. 639, 643.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Le Brun v. Le Brun, </em>55 Md. 496, 503. \u201cIn contracts of marriage there is an interest involved above and beyond that of the immediate parties. Public policy requires that marriage should not be lightly set aside.\u201d <em>Oswald v. Oswald, swpra, </em>at 315. It was neatly summed up in <em>Behr v. Behr, </em>181 Md. 422, 426:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201cWhile marriage is a civil contract and not a sacrament, the law regards it with a sanctity which is not attributed to any other kind of contract; on the theory that the public has a direct interest in it as an institution of transcendent importance to social welfare. <em>Fornshill v. Murray, </em>1 Bland 479, 18 Am. Dec. 344; <em>Denison v. Denison, </em>35 Md. 361; <em>Le Brun v. Le Brun, </em>55 Md. 496; <em>Ridgely v. Ridgely, </em>79 Md. 298, 29 A. 597, 25 L.R.A. 800; <em>Twigg v. Twigg, </em>107 Md. 676, 69 A. 517; <em>Wimbrough v. Wimbrough, </em>125 Md. 619, 94 A. 168. Moreover, in Maryland the marriage contract is required to be solemnized by a religious ceremony <em>(Denison v. Denison, supra), </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and will not be dissolved or annulled by the courts except for the soundest of reasons and upon the strictest of proof. <em>Le Brun v. Le Brun, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201c[T]he power of a court of equity to declare a marriage null and void, when a proper case is made out, cannot be questioned.\u201d <em>Le Brun v. Le Brun, supra, </em>at 502. The authority of the court in such cases derives from the inherent powers of the court, exclusive of any statutory provision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This authority is with respect to marriages procured by fraud or duress. \u201cThe inherent power of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>courts of equity to declare a marriage void when procured by fraud or duress has long been recognized in Maryland.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Morgan, </em>192 Md. 168, 174. The Court in <em>Le Brun v. Le Brun, supra, </em>put it thus, at 503: \u201cIf the marriage be procured by abduction, terror, fraud, or duress, the court, in declaring it a nullity, acts in virtue of its general jurisdiction in matters of fraud affecting contracts * * *.\u201d <em>Ridgely v. Ridgely, supra, </em>added a proviso. Observing, at 307, the status in the eye of the law of marriage as a civil contract, it said: \u201cBeing then a contract, it seems to follow that where it has been procured by fraud or duress, it may be set aside by a court whose inherent jurisdiction gives it authority to annul any ordinary contract procured in the same way; provided the application be promptly made and before a consummation of the marriage by voluntary cohabitation.\u201d <em>Oswald v. Oswald, supra, </em>at 316, apparently expanded the nature of the fraud: \u201cA marriage may be annulled by a court of equity in this State when it is procured by abduction, terror, fraud or duress, or when the fraud complained of relates to essential matters affecting the health or well being of the parties themselves.\u201d <em>Oswald </em>pointed out that the difficulty is in determining when the representations made or the acts charged amount to fraud which may authorize the courts to decree the annulment, and illustrated that view by discussing a number of cases. We find it clear, however, from <em>Oswald </em>and from the cases decided before and after it, that for the court - to decree annulment because of fraud, the representations made or the acts charged must not only amount to fraud but must be such as induced the other party to enter into the contract or be such as relate to essential matters affecting the health or well being of the parties themselves.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The acts of Ralph in making a false statement to the licensing authorities as to his age and in altering his birth certificate was patently not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>such fraudulent conduct under the decisions as to authorize the equity court to decree an annulment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The conduct of Ralph not being sufficient under prior judicial decisions to constitute such fraud as would authorize an annulment of the marriage, the question is whether Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a), mandates an annulment. That is, whether the statute goes to the validity of the marriages in violation of it, and is so, does it make them totally void or only voidable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">At the common law, from whence stemmed the Maryland rule of the marriage status, marriage was considered in no other light than a civil contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Commenting on the ability to marry, Blackstone said, id. at \u00a7 436, that a legal disability was want of age. \u201cThis is sufficient to avoid all other contracts, on account of the imbecility of judgment in the parties contracting; <em>a fortiori </em>therefore it ought to avoid this, the most important contract of any.\u201d By the common law rule, if one of the parties was under the age of 7, the marriage was totally void; if the male was over the age of 14 and the female over the age of 12, the marriage was completely valid; if the male was between 7 and 14 or the female between 7 and 12, the marriage was voidable by either, and subject to ratification when the under-age spouse reached 12 or 14 as the case might be.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There being no decision of the appellate courts of this State directly on the impediment of non-age,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and there being no Maryland statute definitely changing the common law, unless the statute here considered be deemed to be mandatory, the common law rule prevails. If the statute is not mandatory, as both Ralph and Sandra were over the common law age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>consent, age presented no impediment to their marriage, and it could not be avoided for non-age.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">As we have indicated, at the common law, if the parties themselves were of the age of consent, \u201cthere wanted no other concurrence to make the marriage valid: and this was agreeable to the canon law.\u201d Blackstone, \u00a7 437. There were, however, English statutes requiring parental consent in certain circumstances,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and it may well be that our statutory enactment on the subject was inspired by the English laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The legislative history of Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a) is germane to the consideration of its effect on marriages made in violation of it. Acts 1886, ch. 497, \u00a7 7 provided that no marriage license shall issue \u201cunless the male be above the age of twenty-one years, and the female above the age of sixteen years; provided, however, that if the parents or guardian assent thereto in person, or by writing, attested by two witnesses, such license may issue, and the fact of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>assent shall be made part of the record aforesaid.\u201d Acts 1920, ch. 549, raised the age of the female to above 18 years. Acts 1939, ch. 728, repealed the former law and re-enacted it with amendments. The language used was more stringent. Rather than merely prohibiting the issuance of a license, a crime was created:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful within this State for any female below the age of sixteen years or any male below the age of eighteen years to\" marry, or for a parent to permit any such female or male to marry, except on the certificate of a licensed physician, which shall be presented with the application for the marriage license, to the effect that the girl is pregnant, or for any female between the ages of 16 and 18 years, or for any male under the age of twenty-one years, to marry unless the parent or guardian of such male or female, in person or by signed affidavit, assent thereto, and, in the case of a female, swear or affirm that she is over the age of sixteen years, and in the case of a male, swear or affirm that he is over the age of eighteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">When either of the contracting parties was known to be within the provisions of the statute, it was the duty of the Clerk before issuing a license and of any minister before performing the ceremony to demand the assent and statement required, and make it a part of the record. Any person violating the statute was guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of not more than $250. Any person knowingly making any false statement to procure a marriage license or marriage ceremony was guilty of perjury. Acts 1947, ch. 105, amended the statute in regard to the necessary consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful within the State for any female below the age of sixteen years or any male below the age of eighteen years to marry, or for a parent or guardian to permit any such female or male to marry, or for any female between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years, or for any male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>under the age of twenty-one years to marry, unless the parent or guardian of such male or female, in person or by signed affidavit, assent thereto, and, in the case of a female, swear or affirm that she is over the age of sixteen years, and, in the case of a male, swear or affirm that he is over the age of eighteen years. Provided, however, that on the certificate of a licensed physician, presented with the application for a marriage license, to the effect that the girl is pregnant or has given birth to a child, a marriage license may be issued without the consent of her parent or guardian, and if the putative father of the child or prospective child of a girl under eighteen years of age is over sixteen years of age, a marriage license may be issued without the consent of his parents or guardian.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Acts 1951, ch. 6, made changes only regarding the sealing of the records. Acts 1967, ch. 573, repealed the former statute, by then codified as Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a), and re-enacted it with significant changes. The statute was divided into subsection (a) and subsection (b). Subsection (a) concerned males over 18 years and females over 16. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cA male over the age of 18 years and under the age of 21 years, or a female over the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years, may marry, with the consent of the parent or guardian, if the parent or guardian swears or affirms that the child or ward is over the age of 18 years or 16 years, as the case may be. A male over the age of 18 years or a female over the age of 16 years may marry without parental or guardian\u2019s consent, where required, upon presenting a certificate from a licensed physician stating that he has examined the female and positively ascertained that she is pregnant or has given birth to a child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Its prescriptions were couched in the affirmative. It authorized a marriage of those within the designated ages with parental consent or upon the physician\u2019s certificate. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the other hand, subsection (b), dealing with males under 18 and females under 16, proscribed a marriage of those under the designated ages, declared \u201cSuch a marriage shall be made only\u201d with parental consent or upon the physician\u2019s certificate. It was still a misdemeanor to violate the provisions of the sections and perjury to make a material false statement to procure a marriage license or ceremony. Acts 1973, ch. 651, as we have indicated <em>supra, </em>changed the ages in subsection (a) of both the male and the female to \u201cover the age of 16 years and under the age of 18 years\u201d and in subsection (b) to \u201cunder the age of 16 years.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We find it established in this State that the statutory licensing provisions are directory and not mandatory, so that a marriage performed without a license is nevertheless valid. In <em>Feehley v. Feehley, </em>129 Md. 565, the Court overruled a contention that failure to secure a license rendered the marriage void. It gave its reasons at length, at 568-571:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201c[T]here is no purpose expressed in the statute that a marriage otherwise validly contracted and celebrated shall be void if the prescribed license shall not have been procured. * * * On the contrary, there is an implied recognition of the efficacy of marriages solemnized without a license in the provision that a minister who shall \u2018marry\u2019 persons in the absence of such official authorization shall be subjected to the stated penalty. The requirement of a license preliminary to marriage is wholly of statutory origin. At common law, according to the decisions of this Court, a religious ceremony, in celebration of the civil contract, was sufficient to make the marriage lawful. * * * In view of the important considerations of morality and legitimacy involved, it is manifestly a sound and just rule of construction that statutes providing for marriage licenses are not held to have the effect of nullifying, for non-compliance with their terms, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>marriage valid at common law, unless such an intention is plainly disclosed. This salutary principle has been applied in numerous decisions. There are differences of judicial opinion in various jurisdictions as to what are the essential features of a marriage under the rules of the common law, but the courts are generally in accord upon the proposition that a statutory provision for license to marry should not be regarded as mandatory, and vital to the validity of a marriage, in the absence of a clear indication of a legislative purpose that it should be so construed. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A58g\">The regulative purposes of the license statute are useful and important, but they are sought to be enforced by pecuniary penalties pronounced against those officiating at unlicensed marriages, and not by the radical process of rendering void and immoral a matrimonial union otherwise validly contracted and solemnized. In order to obviate such a result it has been decided by this Court that even the statutory provision expressly declaring void any marriage contracted within the prohibited degrees of relationship, did not have the effect of making absolutely void a marriage of uncle and niece, contrary to its terms, but rendered the marriage voidable only by judicial decree passed during the lifetime of the parties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> * * * The principle that such provisions are directory only, has been adopted in jurisdictions where a religious ceremony is not regarded as an essential element of a marriage according to the common law, and it would seem that in a State like our own, where this additional sanction and safeguard is required, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>is even stronger reason for the rule that the validity of such a marriage should be sustained.\u201d (citations omitted)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The result is that, while the licensing authorities, the parties, and the celebrant may be criminally liable and punished for marrying without a license, the marriage itself is as valid as if one had been procured. We find this to be the present law of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">A marriage without a license being valid, it follows, we believe, that a marriage under a license improperly procured is valid. The statutory provisions with regard to licensing being directory and not mandatory, the statutory provisions regarding age and parental consent are directory and not mandatory. We hold that the provisions of Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a) are directory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As the provisions of Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a) are directory only and do not go to the essential validity of a marriage, a marriage in violation of any provision of the statute, whether as to the age of the parties (if the male is over 14 years and the female over 12 years) or as to parental consent, is valid and neither void nor voidable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The amendments of the statute from time to time, although changing the detail, and, perhaps, the emphasis, did not alter the basic import of the law. Whether the statute spoke in terms of no license being issued, or of it being unlawful to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>marry except as designated, or, as now, of authorizing a marriage under stated conditions precedent, the effect of the proscriptions was only <em>in terrorem. </em>The statute never, from its original enactment, through its divers amendments, explicitly or implicitly declared a marriage in violation of its provisions void or voidable or other than valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Our view finds tacit support in <em>Corder v. Corder, </em>141 Md. 114, where, although the parties were under the age then required by the statute and parental consent was lacking, an annulment was granted for fraudulent representation, not for non-age.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And also in <em>Montgomery v. U'Nertle, supra, </em>where both parties were under the age for parental consent, but no mention of the impediment was made, the annulment being granted for fraud and deceit on the basis of intoxication. \u201cObviously, if non-age alone were a sufficient ground for annulment, it would not have been necessary to have gone to such pains to spell out intoxication and fraud * * * on the conflicting facts of those cases.\u201d <em>Strahorn, </em>Comment, <em>A Query about the New Marriage Law, </em>2 Md. L. Rev. 341, 342, note 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We find expressed support for our view in two cases in foreign jurisdictions construing the Maryland law. <em>Hitchens v. Hitchens, </em>47 F. Supp. 73 (D.C.D.C., 1942), concerned the statute as amended in 1939. The court observed that the statute left \u201cit uncertain as to whether marriages contracted in violation of such provision [age and parental consent] are void or voidable, on the one hand, or are valid with certain penalties attaching, on the other hand.\u201d At 75. The court thought that the marriage was valid and proper. \u201cThis is in accord with the general rule that unless the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>expressly declares a marriage contracted without the necessary consent of the parents to be a nullity such statutes will be construed to be directory only so that the marriage contract itself will be valid although penalties may be imposed upon the parties.\u201d At 75-76. See cases cited in note 15 thereof, at 76. Pointing out that \u201cat no place does the Maryland Code specifically declare that marriages contracted in violation of such provision are null and void or even voidable, it said, at 76:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cIt would appear reasonable to assume that had the legislature intended such a consequence the statute, since it was changed, would have so provided. Similarly, in reading the entire statute it is to be noted that the \u2018it shall be unlawful\u2019 provision is used in the same sentence both as applying to the parties to the marriage ceremony and to the parent or guardian conniving in the marriage of a party that is under the minimum age of consent. This lends weight to the suggestion that the statute may be construed properly as \u2018in terrorem\u2019 only, and that while the Maryland legislature has sought to discourage marriages in this age group without parental consent, a lack of such consent does not necessarily make the contracted marriage invalid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">A motion to dismiss the complaint seeking an annulment was sustained. In <em>Needam v. Needam, </em>183 Va. 681, 33 S.E.2d, 288 (1945), the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia denied an annulment to a Virginia couple who went to Maryland and obtained a license without required parental consent. The parties were over the common law age of consent. The court referred to the general rule and concluded, 33 S.E.2d, at 291:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201cMarriages of minors over the age of consent for marriage are not \u2018supposed to be void\u2019 merely because of the lack of parental consent.

Such power is exclusive of the <em>a vinculo </em>divorce statute, Code, Art. 16, \u00a7 24, and Maryland Rule S76. The statute, however, has two grounds which actually involve granting, in the name of divorce, what are substantially annulments, namely impotence of either party at the time of the marriage, and for any cause, which by the laws of this State, render a marriage null and void <em>ab initio. </em>There was a third prevenient ground, the pre-marital unchastity of the wife, but this was deleted by Acts 1939, ch. 558. See <em>Behr v. Behr, supra, </em>at 426. The unfortunate situation of bastardizing, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>the offspring, which would be the result of avoiding a voidable marriage, was ameliorated by legislative enactment. Acts 1949, ch. 29, as amended by Acts 1950, ch. 33, and codified as Art. 16, \u00a7 27, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cThis section shall apply whenever any criminal or equity court of this State has for any reason annulled a marriage, and declared it to be null and void, or whenever any equity court of this State has decreed a divorce a vinculo matrimonii for any cause which by the laws of this State render a marriage null and void ab initio.

Ridgely, supra, </em>at 307-308. The Court expounded on this in <em>Townsend v. Morgan, supra, </em>at 175-176:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">\u201cIt is generally accepted that the equitable maxim that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands cannot be applied in any case where the result of the application sustains a relation which is denounced by statute or is contrary to public policy * * * In proceedings to annul a bigamous marriage, the interest of the State is paramount to the grievances of the parties directly interested. The State sponsors the sanctity of the marriage relation and the welfare of society. In some cases the interest of unborn children may be affected. There is a difference between the ordinary case where the court refuses to aid the complainant in securing benefits from his own wrongdoing and the case where the complainant desires to have a judicial declaration that a marriage is null and void. When a party files a suit for annulment of his marriage, he is deemed as coming into court repenting of his wrongdoing and asking the court to correct his wrongful act as far as possible, in order to prevent any injurious consequences which might be cast thereby in the future upon innocent persons and upon the State. For these reasons the unclean hands doctrine is not applicable in a suit to annul a bigamous marriage. The marriage status being on a different footing from contracts generally, a party may be relieved from a void marriage, although fully aware of its invalidity when contracted. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">It is an unquestioned principle that a court of equity will refuse aid to a complainant who has acted fraudulently or gained an advantage by deceit or unfair means. But the general iniquitous conduct, unconnected with the transaction alleged as the cause of action, does not deprive him of his right to relief in a court of equity. Equity does not demand that suitors shall have led blameless lives. The maxim requiring clean hands does not disqualify one who has not dealt unjustly in the particular matter in which judicial protection or redress is sought. The courts apply the maxim only where some unjust act of the complainant affects the equitable relations of the parties with respect to the matter presented for adjudication. Thus the maxim is applied, not by way of punishment for past violations of the law, but upon considerations that make for justice.\u201d (Citations omitted)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b527-11\">. \u201cTotally void\u201d means that the marriage possesses some defect rendering it subject to both direct and collateral attack.
