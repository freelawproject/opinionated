CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Danfi Gonzalez Iguaran pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to distribute cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of. the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a)(1), 70506(b). On appeal, he contends for the first time that, the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the record does not establish that the vessel in which he was apprehended was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States;</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\"> As an initial matter, the government contends that we should review only for plain error because Iguaran did not raise his jurisdictional objection-in the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u00a1 government is wrong. <em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1249 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[JJurisdictional errors are not subject to plain- or harmless-error analysis\u201d). The district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review <em>de novo </em>even when it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Giraldo-Prado, </em>150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>562 U.S. 428, 434, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1202, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011) (noting that \u201c[ojbjec-tions to subject-matter jurisdiction ... may be raised at any time\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 630, 1221 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (\u201c[Djefects in subject-matter jurisdiction require correction regardless of whether the error was raised in district court.\u201d). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factfindings relevant to jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1114 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">The MDLEA makes it a crime to conspire to distribute a controlled substance while on board \u201ca vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a)(1), 70506(b). The Act also states that \u201c[\u00bfjurisdiction of the United\u2019 States with respect to a vessel subject to this chapter is not an element of an offense\u201d \u2018 and that \u201c[\u00bfjurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\u201d 46 U.S.C, \u00a7 70504(a). Based on that language, this Court has \u201cinterpreted the \u2018on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u2019 portion of the MDLEA as a congressionally imposed limit on courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction, akin to the amount-in-controversy requirement contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Betancourth, </em>554 F.3d 1329, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, \u201cfor a district court to have \u2019 adjudicatory authority over a charge that a defendant conspired to violate the substantive crime defined in [the MDLEA], the Government must preliminarily show that the conspiracy\u2019s vessel was, when apprehended, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d <em>De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d at 1272 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>The MDLEA identifies various circumstances that would render a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. For example, \u201ca vessel without nationality\u201d counts as a \u201cvessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d for purposes of the MDLEA. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70502(c)(1)(A). In turn, the term \u201cvessel without nationality\u201d includes \u201ca vessel aboard which the master or individual in charge fails, on request of an officer of the United States authorized to enforce applicable provisions of United States law, to make a claim of nationality or registry for that vessel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 70502(d)(1)(B). Under those definitions, if Iguaran and his coconspirators failed, on request of the United States officials who apprehended them, \u25a0\u25a0\u2022to \u25a0 \u201cmake a claim of nationality,\u201d their vessel was \u201cwithout nationality\u201d and \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">In this case, the district court did not expressly make any factual findings with respect to its jurisdiction. The government contends, however, that Iguararis plea agreement, which was consistent with his factual proffer and presentence investigation report,- establishes the district court\u2019s jurisdiction. In the plea agreement, Iguaran''agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine \u201cwith individuals who were on board a vessel that was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'.\u201d That statement, the government appears to-argue, constitutes an admission of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">The government\u2019s argument fails because, as we have' repeatedly held, \u201ctpjarties may not stipulate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>W. Peninsular Title Co. v. Palm Beach Cty., </em>41 F.3d 1490, 1492 n. 4 (11th Cir.1995); <em>see also Travaglio v. Am. Express Co., </em>735 F.3d 1266, 1269-70 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c[I]t is fundamental that parties may not stipulate to federal jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>Bush v. United States, </em>703 F.2d 491, 494 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cThe mere\u2019 fact that the parties stipulated to jurisdiction does not automatically vest authority in the district court to adjudicate all the issutes' presented, for subject'matter jurisdiction cannot be assumed by the court nor can it be waived by the parties.\u201d).'- Parties may, howev\u00e9r, \u201cstipulate to <em>facts </em>thkt bear oh our jurisdictional inquiry.\u201d \u2019 <em>Eng\u2019g Contractors Ass\u2019n of S. Fla. v. Metro. Dade Cty., </em>122 F.3d 895, 905 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also Ry. Co. v. Ramsey, </em>89 U.S. (22 Wall.) 322, 327, 22 L.Ed. 823 (1874). A court\u2019s task-is to determine whether\" \u201cthe stipulated facts give rise to jurisdiction.\u201d <em>W. Peninsular Title Co., </em>41 F.3d at 1492 n. 4 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">In the plea agreement,-Iguaran does not admit to, facts that give, ripe to jurisdiction. The agreement does not state, for example, that Iguaran and his coconspirators failed to \u201cmake a claim of nationality\u201d upon request when United States officials apprehended thqm. Instead, it asserts that Iguaran was on a vessel. subject to the United States\u2019 jurisdiction. . That is a question of law and one which, as we have already explained, parties may not stipulate or admit to. <em>See Travaglio, </em>735 F.3d at 1269-70; <em>W. Peninsular Title Co., </em>41 F.3d at 1492 n. 4; <em>Bush, </em>703 F.2d at 494. Iguararis factual proffer, his presentence investigation report,, and. the transcript from his change of plea hearing also fail to supply facts which establish that Iguararis vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the' United States; And the record, is, devoid of any other facts that would\u2019 provide a basis for. federal subject matter jurisdiction, As a result, we are unable to determine whether the district court had jurisdiction over Iguararis case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">The government points out that one of Iguararis coconspirators, in. a separate proceeding against him, admitted to facts that would establish jurisdiction in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>case. For example, that coconspirator admitted in his plea agreement that when they were apprehended \u201cnone of the defendants claimed to be the master of the vessel,\u201d \u201cnone made a claim of nationality,\u201d and the vessel \u201cwas, therefore, a stateless vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d His admission is irrelevant here because the question is whether the record in Iguaran\u2019s case, not some other case, establishes jurisdiction. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">When a party\u2019s failure to challenge the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is at least partially responsible for the lack of a developed record, we have said that \u201cthe proper course of action ... is to remand the case to the district court for factual findings\u201d as to jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Best Buy Co., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1320 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Belleri v. United States, </em>712 F.3d 543, 548 (11th Cir.2013) (stating that when we discover \u201ca serious question regarding the factual predicate for subject-matter jurisdiction, we should remand for a finding to resolve the jurisdictional question\u201d) (quotation marks and alteration omitted); <em>Rolling Greens MHP, LP v. Comcast SCH Holdings LLC, </em>374 F.3d 1020, 1020-21 (11th Cir.2004) (remanding to the district court \u201cfor limited purpose of determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists\u201d). Although neither side requests it, a limited remand is the proper course of action in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">We therefore remand the case to the district court for the limited purpose of determining whether subject matter jurisdiction exists. On limited remand, the government \u201cshould be afforded an opportunity to submit evidence in support of its assertion\u201d that Iguaran\u2019s vessel was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and Iguaran should be afforded an opportunity to present evidence that it was not. <em>Williams, </em>269 F.3d at 1321. The district court should then determine whether the government has carried its burden of establishing that the vessel in which Iguaran was apprehended was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. If the court determines that the government has proven that, it should reinstate Iguaran\u2019s conviction; if the court determines that the government has not proven that, it should enter a judgment dismissing for lack of jurisdiction the charge against Iguaran.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">The judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">. In support of its argument that plain error review applies, the government relies on our unpublished decisions in <em>United States v. Estrada-Obregon, </em>270 Fed.Appx. 978 (11th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Madera-Lopez, </em>190 Fed.Appx. 832 (11th Cir.2006). Neither decision constitutes binding precedent. <em>See </em>llth Cir. R. 36-2 (\"Unpublished opinions are not considered binding precedent.\"); <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1215 n. 34 (11th Cir.2010) (\"Unpublished opinions are not precedential \u2014 \u201d),</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
