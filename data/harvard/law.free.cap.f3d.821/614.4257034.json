SMITH,'Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b641-21\">William Dickson appeals a summary judgment that he is liable for nearly $26 million under certain guaranty contracts; We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">In 2010, Edwards Family Partnership, L.P. (the \u201cPartnership\u201d), arid Beher Holdings Trust, Ltd. (\u201cBeher\u201d) (sometimes referred to jointly as the \u201cLenders\u201d), loaned Community Home Financial Services (\u201cCommunity\u201d) $16 million \u2014 the Partnership $4 million and- Beher $12 million. Dickson \u2014 Community\u2019s' founder, president, and CEO \u2014 signed the -identical loan agreements on behalf, of Community and as a personal guarantor. Community also executed notes to secure its obligations to the Partnership and Beher, respectively, set to mature on August 1, 2013, and Dickson signed them on behalf of Community and as a personal guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-24\">Dickson executed contemporaneous, independent, respective guaranties in favor of the Lenders; by each guaranty, Dickson \u201cunconditiorially and' absolutely guarantee[d] [] the due and punctual payment and performance when due of the principal of the Note and the interest thereon----\u201d He accepted liability that would be \u201cprimary and direct and not, conditional or contingent upon the enforceability of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>obligation, the solvency of [Community] ..., [or] any obligation or circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guaranty____\u201d He also assured the Lenders that they would not need to \u201cmake any demand\u201d upon or \u201cexhaust [their] remedies against\u201d Community, any collateral, or other guarantor before recovering from him. The guaranty contracts included other language worthy of reproduction here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am58\">The obligations of [Dickson] hereunder shall not in any way be affected by any action taken or not taken by [the Lenders], which action or inaction is hereby consented and agreed to by [Dickson], <em>or by the partial or complete unenforce-ability or invalidity of ... </em>the value, genuineness, validity or enforceability of the Collateral or any of the Guaranteed Obligations.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">[Dickson] hereby waives ... <em>all defenses </em>with respect to ... any other action taken by Lender in reliance hereon .,. it being the intention hereof that [Dickson] shall remain liable as a principal until the full amount of all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and performed and satisfied ... in full ... and the Loan Agreement terminated, notwithstanding any act, omission or anything else which might otherwise operate as a legal or equitable discharge of [Dickson],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">[Dickson] acknowledges and agrees that his obligations as Guarantor shall not be impaired, modified, changed, <em>released or limited in any manner whatsoever </em>by any impairment, modification, change, release or limitation of the liability of [Community] or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person or his or their respective estates in bankruptcy resulting from the operation of any present or future provision of the bankruptcy laws or other similar statute, <em>or from the decision of any court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-11\">[Dickson] hereby <em>waives and agrees not to assert against </em>[the Lenders] any rights which a guarantor or surety could exercise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-12\">[Dickson] agrees that his obligations hereunder are irrevocable, joint and several, and <em>independent of the obligation of </em>[Community] or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVho\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">Dickson testified that Community had made payments until October 2011 but defaulted by fading to pay thereafter. The Lenders demanded that Community cure the defaults; neither Community nor Dickson cured but instead sued the Lenders under theories ranging from breach of contract to conversion; the Lenders counterclaimed against Community for judgment on the loan transactions and notes and against Dickson personally for judgment on the guaranty contracts. Shortly after the Lenders counterclaimed, Community filed for bankruptcy, which automatically stayed all other proceedings against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">The Lenders moved to sever their claims against Dickson under the guaranties. Shortly thereafter, Community and Dickson filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy proceeding, contesting the \u201cextent and validity\u201d of Community\u2019s obligations to the Lenders. The court grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>ed the Lenders\u2019 motion to sever, allowing their claims.. against. Dickson. to proceed because Dickson personally was not. in bankruptcy and thus was not protected by the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The notes matured and remained unpaid, so on October 11, 2013, the Lenders moved for partial summary judgment as to Dickson\u2019s liability as guarantor. The court granted summary judgment and ordered the parties to file affidavits establishing the extent of Dickson\u2019s liability, after which the court concluded that Dickson owed $25,777,169 ($6,427,978 to the Partnership and $19,349,191 to Beher), with interest continuing to accrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">Dickson avers, primarily that summary judgment on his guarantor liability was premature because, in the bankruptcy proceedings, he and Community were challenging the extent and validity of the underlying obligations. Under Mississippi law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> guaranty contracts are subject to the same rules of construction that apply to other contracts. <em>Bank of McLain v. Pascagoula Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>150 Miss. 738, 117 So. 124, 126 (1928). Dickson\u2019s theory carries some intuitive force because Mississippi defines a \u201cguaranty\u201d as \u201ca <em>collateral </em>undertaking by one person to answer for the payment of a debt or the performance of some contract or duty in case of the default of another person who is liable for such payment or performance in' the first instance.\u201d <em>Powell v. Sowell, </em>245 Miss. 53, 145 So.2d 168, 171 (1962). Also, \u201c[i]f the principal underlying obligation is extin-, guished, generally the guarantor\u2019s obligation is also extinguished.\u201d <em>Woods-Tucker Leasing Corp. of Ga. v. Kellum, </em>641 F.2d 210, 213 (5th Cir. Unit A Mar. 1981). From this, Dickson reasons persuasively .that his guarantor liability is entirely derivative of Community\u2019s obligation, which could be discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding. Dickson posits that if Community\u2019s obligation falls away, so must his.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Though colorable, Dickson\u2019s argument ignores the :unambiguous language of the guaranty contracts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under which Dickson\u2019s liability is \u201cindependent of the obligations of [Community]\u201d and \u201cprimary and direct and not conditional or contingent upon the enforceability of any obligation.\u201d Dickson agreed that th\u00e9 Lenders need not exhaust their remedies against Community or any other entity. He expressly waived any and all defenses to enforcement. Finally, his personal guarantees are not affected by the \u201cunenforc'eability or invalidity\u201d of the notes or' loans, any bankruptcy proceedings, any limitation on Community\u2019s obligations, or \u201cthe decision of any court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">In sum, Dickson personally guaranteed the Lenders that he would satisfy the obligations represented by the promissory notes no matter what.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He does not allege that the guaranty contracts are ambiguous, unenforceable, or invalid but only that he cannot - be liable as a guarantor until the Lenders show that Community is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>liable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That might be a sensible provision to include in a guaranty, but it was not included here, and under Mississippi law, \u201c[t]he most basic principle of contract law is that contracts must be interpreted by objective, not subjective standards. A court must effect a determination of the language used, not the ascertainment of some possible but unexpressed intent of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We enforce the unambiguous language of the guaranty contracts, <em>Ronald Adams Contractor, </em>753 So.2d at 1087, which requires that Dickson fulfill the obligations under the notes regardless of any outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings or challenges to the underlying obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">That conclusion does not end the matter, because the Lenders have the burden to show Dickson is liable under the guaranty contracts. <em>See EAC Credit Corp. v. King, </em>507 F.2d 1232, 1236 (5th Cir.1975). They must show that (1) Dickson signed the guaranty contracts; (2) those contracts encompass .Community\u2019s obligations under the promissory notes and loan agreements; (3) they, are the current holders and owners. of the notes; (4) the notes are .in default; and. (5) the. conditions (if any), of Dickson\u2019s liability \u2014 as laid out in the guaranty contracts \u2014 have been met. <em>See id.; NCNB Tex. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Johnson, </em>11 F.3d 1260, 1264 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">'The Lenders presented evidence sufficient to establish Dickson\u2019s liability as guarantor. They attached copies of the loan agreements, the notes, and the guaranty contracts, each of which Dickson signed-, on behalf of Community and as guarantor. The guaranties specifically make reference to the notes and loan agreements. The record revealed that the Lenders are the current holders and owners of the notes. Dickson testified that Community1 defaulted on the notes by failing to pay after October 2011, and the evidence showed that the notes remained unpaid when they matured on August 1, 2013. Finally, the guaranty contracts reveal no conditions on Dickson\u2019s liability save Community\u2019s default on the notes, which the Lenders proved. Dickson offers no evidence whatsoever in response, claiming only that the bankruptcy proceeding may result in the invalidity of the underlying obligation. Thus, the Lenders met their burden to recover on the guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Dickson challenges the summary judgment on the extent of his guarantor liability. After finding Dickson liable under the guaranties, the court ordered the parties to file competing affidavits on the extent of his liability. The court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>that the Lenders\u2019 affidavit fairly and accurately reflected Dickson\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The Lenders presented an affidavit from Martha Borg, the companies\u2019 bookkeeper. Borg averred that she was responsible for reviewing all of Community\u2019s'financial reports and for calculating the principal-and-interest balances on its respective promissory notes, so she was familiar with Dickson\u2019s obligations under 'the guaranty contracts. She calculated his liability based on a \u201cBorrowing Base Certificate Form\u201d provided by Community and Dickson in October 2011 and on an August 2010 agreement regarding the amount due as of July 31, 2010, and she outlined her calculations and steps in a spreadsheet attached to her affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Dickson filed a competing affidavit that contended that Borg \u201cvastly overstates the amounts that could possibly be deemed due.\u201d Dickson also claimed he lacked sufficient information to contest Borg\u2019s affidavit because, \u201cthrough no fault of [his] own,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he could not conduct discovery. He posited that Borg misrepresented certain slims borrowed by Community, that she lacked the qualifications and ability to conduct an accurate, accounting, and that she failed to account for at least two repayments made by Community.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The combined errors, Dickson maintains,, led,to a $1.2 million , overestimation of his liability. He offers no documentary evidence or records to support those assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Dickson did, however, support his affidavit with an equally conclusional affidavit from Robert Cunningham, a certified public accountant hired by Community\u2019s bankruptcy estate to render professional accounting, services. Cunningham concurred in Dickson\u2019s, conclusion that Borg\u2019s affidavit overstated Dickson\u2019s liability by $1.2 million but provided no records or documents in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Dickson has failed to present sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on the amount of his obligation under the guaranty contracts. He admits that he lacked sufficient information to' dispute Borg\u2019s claims, but he did not move for additional time, under, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to allow more discovery. Instead, he alleged (without any s\u00fcpporting documentation), only that Community did not default on the obligations, that Borg made errors, and 'that Borg w\u00e1s unqu\u00e1lif\u00ed\u00e9d to\u2019 calculate his guarantor liability. Cunningham\u2019s'affidavit, which contained only another s\u00e9t of allegations that Borg had failed accurately to calculate Community\u2019s and Dickson\u2019s obligations, is insufficient to preclude summary judgment. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1203, 1207 (5th Cir.1993). Even supported by Cunningham\u2019s identical averments, Dickson\u2019s affidavit amounts only to \u201c[c]onclusional allegations and ... unsubstantiated assertions,\u201d which \u201cdo not adequately substitute for specific facts. showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>TIG Ins.
