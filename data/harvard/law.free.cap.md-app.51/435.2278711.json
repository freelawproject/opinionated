The order appealed from denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial of an administrative appeal to that court, which had affirmed the decision of a claims examiner of the Fire and Police Employees Retirement System. Although the original appeal from the Claims Examiner\u2019s decision to the Baltimore City Court questioned findings of fact, as well as construction of law by the Examiner, appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was limited solely to the court\u2019s construction of the retirement laws regarding disability benefits. By appealing from the order denying his motion, not only does appellant limit himself to that which was addressed upon that motion, <em>Carter v. State, </em>286 Md. 649, 651 (1979), but he places the burden upon himself of convincing this Court that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the motion for new trial. His gamble was successful. The judge did abuse his discretion by misconstruing the law applicable to the case and sustaining the construction by the Claims Examiner as a proper interpretation of the law. We will remand this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to the Baltimore City Court, directing it to remand to the Claims Examiner for a determination of appellant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under proper construction of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Appellant, Dennis R. Taylor, had been employed as a Baltimore City fire fighter since July 20, 1970. On January 5, 1978, he suffered an injury to his left elbow. According to a Statement of Undisputed Facts, appellant applied for a \"special\u201d disability retirement on October 3,1979. His application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">When appellant\u2019s condition worsened, he apparently filed a subsequent application (but it is not in the record before us). The Claims Examiner decided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\"the claimant is physically incapacitated for further performance of the duties of his job classification in the employ of Baltimore City\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">and that the incapacity \"is considered to be permanent\u201d. While permanent incapacity is required for either an \"ordinary\u201d or \"special\u201d disability retirement, the Examiner denied the more remunerative \"special\u201d disability claim,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the incapacity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\"is still not considered to be totally incapacitating based on the medical evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Presumably for the reason that the incapacity was \"not... totally incapacitating\u201d, the Examiner decided that appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">\"is ineligible for Special Disability Retirement but is eligible for Ordinary Disability Retirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">The Claims Examiner\u2019s opinion was affirmed upon appeal by an opinion of the Baltimore City Court on April 23, 1981 which was modified by an opinion dated May 28, 1981, denying the motion for a new trial. Erroneously assuming in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>both opinions that appellant\u2019s incapacity had been found by the Examiner to have been \"sustained in the performance of his duties ..the judge addressed a single issue of statutory interpretation. He pointed out that the two relevant sections in Article 22 of the Baltimore City Code relating to disability retirement benefits are \u00a7 34 (c) and \u00a7 34 (e); the former dealing with \"Ordinary disability retirement benefits\u201d read (prior to 1979) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\"Section 34 (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">Ordinary disability retirement benefit. Any member who has acquired five (5) or more years of service and who has been determined by a claims examiner to be <em>mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of the duties of the member\u2019s job classif\u00edcation </em>in the employ of Baltimore City, <em>and </em>that such incapacity <em>is likely to be permanent, </em>shall be retired by the Board of Trustees on an ordinary disability retirement, not less than thirty (30) and not more than ninety (90) days next following the date of filing his application for ordinary disability retirement benefits.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In 1979, the following language was added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\"For all claimants who became members of this system on or after July 1, 1979, and have been determined to be qualified for an ordinary disability benefit, the following shall be applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">If the claims examiner determines that the member has suffered any permanent disability which prevents the member from the further performance of the duties of the member\u2019s job classification in the employ of the City of Baltimore, the City shall within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the appeal period as provided in Section 33(1), or, if an appeal is taken, within thirty (30) days of the final determination of all appeals, refer the member to the Civil Service Commission for vocational coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>seling and job evaluation to determine whether the member is suitable for re-employment with the City in another position at the same rate of compensation as he was receiving in his last position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">During the period such member is being counseled, he shall temporarily receive the ordinary disability benefits under this section until such time as the Civil Service Commission has determined that either the member is suitable for re-employment in another position or that the City cannot offer any alternative employment. If the determination by the Civil Service Commission is that the member is re-employable, the member shall either be re-employed within one year and the award of ordinary disability benefits terminated, or else the member shall be retired on ordinary disability retirement subject to the other provisions of this subtitle. If the determination by the Civil Service Commission is that the member is not re-employable, the member shall be retired on ordinary disability retirement subject to the other provisions of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The briefer section dealing with \"Special disability benefits\u201d was, and remains, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\"Section 34 (e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">(e) Special disability benefits. Any member who has been determined by the claims examiner to be <em>totally and permanently incapacitated for the further performance of the duties of his job classification </em>in the employ of Baltimore City, as the result of an injury arising out of and in the course of the actual performance of duty, without willful negligence on his part, shall be retired by the Board of Trustees on a special disability retirement.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">In his May 28 opinion, the judge simply explicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>conclusion implied in the decision of the Claims Examiner that the only substantial distinguishing feature of the two sections was that \u00a7 34 (e) expressly requires that a claimant be \"totally\u201d incapacitated for the further performance of the duties of his job classification, while \u00a7 34 (c) does not use that adjective \"totally\u201d. The judge recognized, however, that prior to 1979, when the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Baltimore City was hearing such cases, it had interpreted the term \"incapacitated\u201d to mean \"totally incapacitated\u201d,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">\"when it was the Board\u2019s responsibility to make the determinations, it passed over the 'total\u2019 incapacity language and focused on the 'in the course of the actual performance of duty, without wilful negligence ...\u2019 language. This is a reasonable interpretation because the dictionary definition of 'incapacity\u2019 includes the concept of 'totally\u2019 within its scope, so that it could be argued that there is no substantive difference between 'incapacity\u2019 and 'total incapacity\u2019. It would then follow under this view that the only difference between Subsections (c) and (e) is the 'in the course ... of duty\u2019 <em>or </em>not 'in the course ... of duty\u2019 distinction in fact adopted by the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">He raised for recognition the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\"well established rule of law in Maryland that the consistent and long-standing interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement is 'strongly persuasive\u2019 and should not be disregarded except for 'weighty reasons,\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">then lowered it as inappropriate because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\"the administrative interpretation will not be considered unless the statute in question is ambiguous on its face. <em>Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Company v. State Department of Assessments and Taxation, </em>252 Md. 173, 249 A.2d 180 (1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Referring in part to the 1979 amendment to the \"ordinary\u201d disability provision, \u00a7 34 (c), noted above, the judge explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\"as of July 30, 1979, the City Council changed the system somewhat. The responsibility for hearing claims and making determinations thereon was vested in a group of Claims Examiners appointed for that purpose. Subsection (c) was amended by the addition of a provision requiring claimants found eligible for 'ordinary\u2019 benefits under that subsection to be referred to the Civil Service Commission for vocational counseling and job evaluation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">He pointed out that since their assumption of responsibility for hearing claims,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\"[t]he evidence indicates that the Claims Examiners have interpreted the difference between Subsections (c) and (e) to rest not on the 'in the course ... of duty\u2019 <em>or </em>not 'in the course ... of duty\u2019 distinction but, rather, on a 'total\u2019 incapacity <em>or </em>less-than- 'total\u2019 incapacity distinction. The Claims Examiners appear to interpret the 'in the course of the actual performance of duty, without wilful negligence ...\u2019 language to be a minimum requirement for 'special\u2019 disability benefits rather than a litmus test between Subsections (c) and (e). The shift of emphasis would be consistent with the addition of the vocational counseling and job evaluation provision because a claimant who is less than 'totally\u2019 incapacited could reasonably be referred for such counseling and evaluation, whereas it would make no sense to refer a 'totally\u2019 incapacitated claimant for vocational counseling and job evaluation. It is also reasonable to conclude that the City Council meant to require all less-than- 'totally\u2019 incapacitated claimants to be referred for vocational counseling and job evaluation regardless of whether their incapacity resulted from the performance of duty or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">\"Therefore, this Court finds that while it was formerly the practice to automatically award 'Special\u2019 disability benefits under Subsection (e) to claimants injured in the line of duty, this is no longer the case. Since Appellant has not disputed the Claims Examiner\u2019s finding of fact that he is not 'totally\u2019 disabled, this Court must affirm the Claims Examiner\u2019s determination that Appellant is not entitled to 'special\u2019 disability benefits under Article 22, Section 34 (e), of the Baltimore City Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In his initial opinion of April 23, the judge commenced his deliberative conclusion by acknowledging that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\"In construing this statute, this Court must first look to its plain language. Only when the language is ambiguous does a Court need to look to the intent of the legislature and consider the overall legislative scheme. <em>Koyce v. State Central Collection Unit, </em>289 Md. 134 (1980).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">He then conceded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\"in ordinary usage 'incapacitated\u2019 means 'totally incapacitated\u2019 unless otherwise modified,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">which, from his prior recognition of the law, seemingly obviated both the need and the right to seek legislative intent. He added, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">\"this meaning does not appear to have been intended by the legislature in drafting the statutes in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">He provided two reasons for discerning a legislative meaning contrary to what seemingly appeared unambiguous to him. That which compelled him to ignore the \"plain language\u201d earlier acknowledged was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">\"the legislature took the trouble to draft two separate subsections, one dealing with claimants found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>to be 'mentally or physically\u2019 incapacitated, and one dealing with claimants found to be 'totally\u2019 incapacitated. The two subsections provide for different levels of retirement benefits. In the present case, Appellant would, under Subsection (c), receive, tax free, twenty-six (26) percent of his former salary or, under Subsection (e), tax free, sixty-six and two-thirds (66%) percent of his former salary. In addition, Subsection (c) requires that a claimant found to be permanently disabled must be referred to the Civil Service Commission for vocational counseling and job evaluation to determine whether he is suitable for re-employment with the City. Subsection (e) [special disability] makes no such provision, assumingly because there is no point in referring a 'totally\u2019 incapacitated person for vocational counseling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Our review of the statute compels our disagreement with the interpretation of the Baltimore City Court in this instance. We are persuaded more by its opinion in <em>Hackley v. Mayor and City Council of </em>Baltimore, <em>et al., </em>Baltimore City Court, File No. 1-105843, Docket 25P/9 (April 1, 1981), wherein (we are told by the judge in this case)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\"the Court found that there is no real difference between Subsections (c) and (e) with respect to the level of disability required. The Court [in Hackley] reached this conclusion by finding that the dictionary definition of 'incapacity\u2019, unless the word is modified in its scope, includes the concept 'totally\u2019. Therefore, a finding that a claimant is 'incapacitated\u2019 is the same as a finding that a claimant is 'totally\u2019 incapacitated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">In particular regard to appellant\u2019s claim, initially we must note that because it preceded the 1979 amendment, it should have been judged upon the construction of the statute as it was intended at that time. The judge held that the Board\u2019s interpretation prior to 1979 was reasonable at that time, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>he further acknowledged that such long-standing administrative interpretation should not be disregarded except for weighty reasons. Apparently, however, the \"weighty reason\u201d that caused him to reject the Board\u2019s interpretation for the more recent views of the newly appointed claims examiners was the 1979 amendment relating to vocational rehabilitation counselling and job evaluation, which coincided with the creation of the examiners. Thus, even if that analysis of post-1979 legislative intent had been accurate, the judge would still have been wrong in not applying the pre-1979 interpretation that he found reasonable prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Even if the former version applied, the 1979 amendment accords with the entire statutory scheme and altered its purpose not one whit. To the contrary, it enlarged upon it by setting forth a procedure for vocational counselling, providing a better opportunity for reemployment of its tenured incapacitated employees in other city job classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The judge\u2019s analysis of legislative intent of the post-amendment statute was inaccurate. Both he and the Claims Examiner read far too much into the fact that \u00a7 34 (e) used the redundant adjective \"totally\u201d, while \u00a7 34 (c) did not. Such reasoning, like the maxim \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not a rule of law but is merely an auxiliary application of logical analysis to assist in determining legislative intent. Such auxiliary aids should be used with caution and should never be applied to override a more obvious purpose or visible scheme. <em>Cf. Kirkwood v. Provident Savings Bank, </em>205 Md. 48, 55 (1954). In this instance, to apply such logic would implicitly inject into \u00a7 34 (c) the adjective \"partial\u201d or some synonymous modifier for the negative-transitive verb \"incapacitated\u201d, which the judge conceded means \"totally incapacitated ... in ordinary usage ... unless otherwise modified.\u201d Not only have we been repeatedly admonished by the Court of Appeals that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>construing statutes, words must be interpreted according to their common acceptance <em>(e.g., Balto. Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades v. Barnes, </em>290 Md. 9, 15 (1981); <em>Parkinson v. State, </em>14 Md. 184,196-197 (1859)), we are told with equal consistency that we may not insert or omit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form. <em>Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 535 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The facts found by the Claims Examiner upon which the judge predicated his statutory interpretation were that the claimant was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\"incapacitated for further performance of the duties of his job classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">That finding carried the claimant over the first hurdle of entitlement in either section since the identical language is in both. She then held that the \"incapacity is considered to be permanent\u201d. That finding is also a requisite for entitlement to either special or ordinary benefits, carrying the claimant over the second hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The Examiner\u2019s (and ultimately the judge\u2019s) reason for denying the special benefits was that the incapacity \"is still not considered to be totally incapacitating ....\u201d This would contradict the prior finding unless it was intended to imply that the claimant was being denied special benefits because, although he was incapacitated from \"the performance of the duties of his job classification,\u201d he was still employable in some other type of employment, or under some other job description.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Assuming that is what the Examiner meant, and is the predicate for the court\u2019s analysis, we fail to see where either section of the statute <em>requires </em>that the claimant be incapacitated from performing <em>any </em>work, other than that which is within his job classification. In fact, by placing a limit on how much he may earn in addition to his benefits, \u00a7 34 (g) (2) contemplates that upon disability retirement (in either category) the retiree may work elsewhere.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The judge\u2019s interpretation of this statute was similar to the scheme of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Statute, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 101, which provides both for those who are totally disabled as well as those partially so as a result of their employment. But there the Legislature clearly explicated both scheme and purpose, without courts having to inject words or omit them as surplusage. Here, the judge not only injected a modifier by implication (the concept of \"partial\u201d incapacity), but omitted the limiting object of the key transitive verb \"incapacitated\u201d in one section, giving the same phrase emphasis in the other section. In order to reach the result that \u00a7 34 (e) (Special Disability) required total incapacity to perform <em>any </em>job (which his interpretation provided), the judge necessarily ignored or discounted the prepositional phrase following \"incapacitated,\u201d which provided its object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\"for the further performance of the duties of his job classification ....\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Before words in a statute may be rejected as surplusage, however, it must be certain that the Legislature could not possibly have intended the words to be in the statute, and that the correction of them serves merely as a correction of careless language and actually gives the true intention of the Legislature. <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 90 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In interpreting \u00a7 34 (c) (Ordinary Disability), however, the identical phrase was not ignored. To the contrary, it was emphasized. Only by omitting the prepositional phrase in \u00a7 34 (e) and inserting the modifying adjective in \u00a7 34 (c) could the court have arrived at the Workmen\u2019s Compensation-type-scheme it applied. But, as already noted, we may not surmise a legislative intention contrary to the words and letters of a statute, or insert or delete words with a view of making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning. <em>Fowel v. State, </em>206 Md. 101, 105-106 (1955); <em>Welsh v. Kuntz, </em>196 Md. 86, 93 (1950). Nowhere does it appear, by express reference or by implication, that the legislative body intended to provide <em>any </em>benefit for a partially disabled person. The criteria in both sections speak in absolutes. The test is whether he can or cannot perform \"the duties of his job classification\u201d. If he is \" 'incapacitated\u2019 for the performance\u201d of these duties, he may qualify for <em>either </em>ordinary or special benefits, but unless he is so incapacitated, he qualifies for neither. The statute does not refer to an incapacity to perform less than all of the duties of his job classification in either section. There are no \"degrees\u201d of incapacity referred to anywhere in the statute. The prefix \"in\u201d clearly connotes a negation of the root meaning of the term \"capacitated\u201d, which we must assume was purposefully used by the lawmakers. One who is incapacitated is without capacity. That which he is without capacity to do is the performance of the duties of his job classification. The legislative body expressed no concern for providing benefits to those whose disability may partially limit the degree of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>formance of their dangerous jobs. It sought to retire those who <em>no longer </em>could perform the rigorous duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Although the relative insignificance of an elbow injury hardly comports with the Examiner\u2019s, the judge\u2019s \u2014 or with our \u2014 philosophical concept of full retirement benefits when one is obviously able to work productively at another job, this does not justify either court in reaching a result not clearly intended by the enactors of the statute. In fact, similar concerns appear to have been addressed by the legislators in \u00a7 34 (g) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Whether we approve of the right to seek other employment subject to that limitation is not a matter of judicial concern. It is the Legislature\u2019s responsibility to establish policy. It would be dangerous and unwarrantable for a court to grope for an intent, or to make one from its own ideas of policy and morals, and on that ground say that a particular case is withdrawn from the operation of the plain and unambiguous language of a statute. <em>Hawbecker v. Hawbecker, </em>43 Md. 516, 519 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">But thus far we have primarily addressed an issue which the statute did not; <em>i.e., </em>the comparison between partial and total incapacitation. While the distinction in the legislative scheme was not in the <em>degree </em>of capacity, there are two dissimilar criteria for entitlement which were coupled with common requisites of incapacity, evidencing the purpose behind the enactments. The two distinguishing and unrelated elements from which the legislative scheme is gleaned are that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">in \u00a7 34 (c), referred to as \"ordinary\u201d disability benefits, entitlement depends upon tenure <em>(i.e., </em>at least five years of service); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">in \u00a7 34 (e), referred to as \"special\u201d disability benefits, entitlement depends upon an injury in the performance of one\u2019s duties, without regard to length of service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Conforming to its underlying tenure-related purpose, the \"ordinary\u201d benefits are computed by a formula which provides compensation in direct proportion to an employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>years of service. If the incapacitated employee of five or more years is fifty years old, he will receive a service retirement allowance; otherwise his first twenty years of service entitles him to one-fortieth of his average final compensation and one-fiftieth for every year thereafter \u00a7 34 (d) (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \"special\u201d benefits for the employee injured on the job, on the other hand, are a fixed two-thirds of his salary without regard to length of service either for entitlement purposes or amount, \u00a7 34 (f) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clearly, the two sections have diverse criteria; one section allows tenured employees to retire when they are no longer able to perform their duties, while the other affords retirement benefits to those who suffer injuries in the performance of their hazardous jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Because the statute is clear and unambiguous, we hold that the judge abused his discretion by interpreting the statute contrary to the clear legislative scheme. <em>Bouse v. Hutzler, </em>180 Md. 682, 687 (1942). We will, however, remand this case because, despite the judge\u2019s expression to the contrary, the <em>Examiner </em>did not make a finding whether the appellant\u2019s incapacity was \"the result of an injury arising out of and in the course of the actual performance of duty, without wilful negligence on his part.\u201d Both parties assumed the truth of this fact in their briefs, and in the Statement of Undisputed Facts submitted to us in the joint record extract. We are not factfinders, however, and leave this crucial issue for the Claims Examiner\u2019s determination by an expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>holding. That, of course, is essential to entitlement to special disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We reverse the judgment of the court and remand the case to it in accord with the agreement of both parties at oral argument. We direct that the court remand to the Claims Examiner who will provide a rehearing of the case in light of the proper construction of the statute. Obviously crucial to that hearing will be the requirements of the appellant\u2019s job classification (which were not in this record) as a guide to determine appellant\u2019s capacity or incapacity to perform the duties within that classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\n<em>Case remanded to the Baltimore City Court for its compliance with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-13\">.
