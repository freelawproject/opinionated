Said indictment, omitting the formal parts thereof, charged \u201cthat Earl Turnbaugh, late of said county, on the 4th day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hum dred and seven, at the county \u00f3f Guernsey aforesaid, in the night season of the same day, to-wit: about the hour of eleven o\u2019clock at night, in the county of Guernsey aforesaid, into a certain storehouse of one George Butts, there situate, did unlawfully, maliciously and forcibly break and enter with intent then and there and thereby the personal property of the said George Butts in the said store-house then and there being, unlawfully to steal, take and carry away, and money of the value of twelve dollars ($12.00) of the personal property of the said George Butts in said storehouse then and there being found, then and there unlawfully did steal, take and carry away.\u201d It being admitted in this case that the statement made by the prosecuting attorney in his brief touching the location, character, etc., of the building alleged to have been broken and entered, is a correct statement of the facts as proved by the state on the trial, we may for the purposes of the present inquiry adopt that statement, which is as follows: \u201cThe evidence showed the building to be situated on the corner of Harris avenue and Second street, Cambridge, Ohio. That there is no entrance to the building on. Harris avenue. That from Second street there are three entrances, \u2014 one into the north room which adjoins Harris avenue, in which room George Butts and his family reside; one into the grocery room south of and adjoining the living room; one into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>other grocery room on the south, being the south part of. the building, each of said grocery rooms extending back the full extent of the building. The house as originally constructed, did not include the grocery room on the south, this south room being built about two years ago as an addition, and for the express purpose of being used as a meat and grocery room, in connection with the adjoining grocery room on the north, which said south room was connected with the other grocery room by means of an open archway about seven feet wide and reaching to the ceiling, and said two rooms were used as the grocery store of George Butts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-6\">\u201cThere is a permanent partition between the grocery rooms and the living-room, extending from the floor to the ceiling, except there is a communicating door about ten feet from the rear of the storeroom, leading to the living-room, which communicating door was kept locked at night, and was locked on the night of the burglary herein. The building as it stood at the time of the burglary was as long on Harris avenue as it was wide on Second street, and besides the entrance or doorway to each of the storerooms from Second street, there was a door into the rear of the north storeroom from the out-, side. There was also a window on the south side of the south storeroom opposite the archway above mentioned, and it was through this last named opening or window that the burglar broke and entered, this south room into which he first entered, being the room built expressly for use as a store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201cThe burglar passed from the south room through the open archway into the other grocery room, and it was in the north grocery room, near the archway, where the money was found. There was no way of entering the living-room or dwelling-house proper from the storerooms, except through the communicating door, and that door was securely locked. The burglar did not enter, or attempt to break or enter, the living-room or dwelling-house proper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\">On the trial, at the conclusion of the state\u2019s evidence, counsel for the defendant, Turnbaugh, .moved the court to direct the jury to return a verdict of not .guilty and to discharge the accused, because of a claimed variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof offered by the state, in this, to-wit: that the defendant was charged in said indictment with breaking and entering a storehouse, whereas the evidence, it was claimed, showed that the building broken and entered was not a storehouse, but a <em>dwelling-house. </em>Said motion was sustained by the court and the jury was directed- to, and did, return a verdict of not guilty, whereupon the court discharged the accused from custody. To all of which the state by the prosecuting attorney duly excepted. * The present proceeding is prosecuted to obtain the decision of this court as'to the law to govern in similar cases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-5\"><em>Mr. Charles S. </em>Sheppard, prosecuting attorney, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">A room in a building may be a storehouse. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>State, </em>25 Ohio St., <em>70) Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>v. <em>Whalen, </em>131 Mass., 419; Section 16, N.

In modern practice much of the strictness that formerly obtained in criminal proceedings under the rule of the common law, as to proof of matters of mere description, has been done away with, as tending to embarrass and defeat, rather than promote, the administration of public justice. In harmony with this modern rule, which, while it preserves and protects the substantial rights of the accused, disregards such matters of variance as are not material to the merits of the case or prejudicial to the defendant, the general assembly of the State of Ohio, by Section 7216 of our Code of Criminal Procedure has enacted that: \u201cWhen on the trial of an indictment there appears to be any variance between the statement in such indictment and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>evidence offered in proof thereof, * * * in the name or description of any matter or thing therein named or described, such variance shall not be deemed ground for an acquittal of the defendant, unless the court before which the trial is had find that such variance is material to the merits of the case, or may be prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d The manifest purpose, as well as the positive effect of this statute, was to modify or change the strict rule of the common law which made fatal any variance between the allegations of the indictment, as to matters of description, and the proof offered in support thereof. In <em>Lytle </em>v. <em>The State, </em>31 Ohio St., 196, Gilmore, J., in discussing the effect of the above provision of our Criminal Code, says: \u201cThis abrogates, in our state, the rule of evidence on the subject of variance, in matters of description, between the allegation and proof. Instead of looking to the rules of evidence to ascertain whether there .is a variance between the allegations of the indictment and the evidence offered, the court now looks at the case as it stands before it; and if there are variances between the allegations and the proof offered, the defendant, for that reason alone, must not be acquitted, unless, in the opinion of the court, the variance is material or may be prejudicial to the defendant. The opinion of the court, in this respect, is now substituted for the former rule of evidence on the subject.\u201d And in <em>The State </em>v. Buechler, <em>57 </em>Ohio St., 95, it was held that the decision of the trial judge on the question of the materiality of the variance, is not conclusive, but that such decision may be reviewed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>this court on error, or upon exceptions presented by the prosecuting attorney. When we consider, in the present case, that the character and proper designation of the place or structure alleged to have been burglariously entered, must be ascertained and determined from the nature of the use to which it was appropriated at the time of the commission of the alleged <em>offense, </em>\u2014 Thalls v. <em>The State, </em>21 Ohio St., 233, \u2014 it would seem reasonably certain that such structure was not improperly or inappropriately designated in the indictment as a \u201cstorehouse.\u201d But if it be conceded in this case that there is a variance between the allegations of the indictment and the proof offered by the state in support thereof, in the name or description of the building entered, such variance, under the facts and circumstances appearing of record, was neither material nor prejudicial, and could not therefore, because of the provisions of Section 7216, Revised Statutes, furnish ground for the acquittal of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-7\">Price, C.
