Barr, during her natural life, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>except certain payments to be made to certain of his children in order to make them equal with two sons who had already received a part of his estate. And he further provided that, <em>\u201cafter the death of my wife I desire that the whole of my property both real and personal be sold by my executor and after expenses are paid to distrib%ite equally to my legal heirs.\u201d </em>About eleven years after the death of the .testator, his daughter Margaret Maud Barr, married the defendant, Henry H. Denney, and about two months after her marriage, and before the death of the widow of the testator, she died leaving no issue. The defendant, Denney, claims an eighth interest in the distribution of the fund arising from the sale of the said real and personal property. The administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of James Barr, deceased, began this proceeding to determine the true construction of the will and especially of the clause already quoted. The court of common pleas found that the true meaning of the will was that the legal heirs mentioned were those who constituted the legal heirs of James Barr at the period of distribution, to-wit, the death of the widow, and held, therefore, that the defendant, Henry H. Denney, was not entitled to share in the distribution of the estate. The circuit court reversed this finding and found that the true meaning of the will was that the legal heirs mentioned were those who constituted the legal heirs of James Barr at the time of his death and not at the time of the death of his widow and therefore held that Henry H. Denney, as the administrator of Margaret Denney, was entitled to an eighth of the fund to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>be distributed. This petition in error is prosecuted to reverse the finding and judgment of the circuit court and to affirm the finding and judgment of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-6\"><em>Messrs.

The chief source of debate between the parties is as to which of them, and how, they may be applied to best effectuate the intention of \u2022 the testator. All agree that the testator\u2019s intention when once ascertained must control, if the intended provision is lawful; and that such intention must be sought in the terms of the whole will. Yet it must be conceded that if the language of the will, when all of its parts have been considered, remains ambiguous, the construction must finally be determined by calling to our aid such rules of interpretation as the reasoning and experience of the courts have wrought out and established b)^ common consent as tending to the uniform administration of justice. To express these thoughts in another way, technical rules may be used as aids to interpretation but can not control if they be in conflict with the apparent intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The controversy in this case arises from the following clause of the will. \u201cAfter the death of my wife I desire that the whole of my property both real and personal be sold by my executor and after expenses are paid to distribute equally to my legal heirs.\u201d The contention on the part of the defendant in error, Denney, is that the -bequest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>to the legal heirs of the testator vested at the death of the testator. On the part of the plaintiff m error it is insisted that the bequest is future and contingent and that it did not vest until the time for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The testator had in contemplation all of his property and all of his family when he made this will; for his declaration is, \u201c will and bequeath to my wife, Mary A. Barr, the whole of my estate, both real and personal, for her use and benefit during her natural life, except as follows;\u201d then he provides for payments to equalize the amounts received by his children. He makes no gift over, either by remainder or executory devise; but looking to the future, he says, \u201cAfter the death of my wife I desire that the whole of my property, both real and personal, be sold by my executor and after expenses are paid to distribute equally to my legal heirs.\u201d There is nothing further in the will to explain or qualify this clause. Although he was careful to equalize advancements among his children and named several -of them, lie makes no devise or bequest specifically to any of them nor to all as a class, but requires that his executor, after the termination of the life estate, shall convert the whole estate into personalty, and after expenses are paid, shall distribute equally to his legal heirs. The fund cannot be created, nor the extent of the interest in it be determined until the life estate has terminated, the property converted and the expenses paid. This will was made when death was imminent. The testator died in less than three weeks afterward. Although he had his children in mind the moment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>before he dictated this provision, yet, looking into the indefinite future and perhaps remembering that some of them might predecease their mother \u2014the event which actually did happen \u2014 he refrained from bequeathing the property to his children, by name or as a class, or expressly to his next of kin or heirs at law who might be such at the time of his decease, but broadly, and it would seem with a distinct and rational purpose, directed his executor \u201cto distribute equally to my legal heirs,\u201d an expression exactly equivalent to a direction to make distribution at the time stated according to the statute of descents and distribution. Hence the most natural interpretation of this will is that the testator bequeathed nothing after the expiration of the life estate and contented himself with the expression of his desire that the property should all be converted into personalty and then distributed equally among those who might then be his legal heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">This interpretation of the will is made entirely clear, we think, by further considerations from the technical point of view. We have already adverted to the fact that 'there is no gift <em>in praesenti </em>tc the testator\u2019s heirs. If it were so the interests would be vested and would be contingent only in respect to the time of possession and enjoyment. Of such a nature is -the case of <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Laycock, </em>33 Ohio St., 128, which is so much relied upon by the defendant in error, and <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Grimesey, </em>36 Ohio St., 17. But if there is a gift over <em>in futuro </em>after the expiration of an intermediate estate, not to specified individuals or to a definite class, but to persons not ascertained or not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>being at the time of the bequest, the legacy is con-ting'ent and does not vest until the time of distribution. 4 Kent, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>Richey, Exr., </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>30 Ohio St., 288, this court had under consideration a will in which the testator devised to his wife for her natural life the use of a farm and directed that after her death his executors should sell the farm and divide the proceeds equally between the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters \u201cand their heirs.\u201d It was held that \u201cthe gift implied in the direction to divide the proceeds between the designated parties is a gift of personalty; but as the fund could not be raised until the death of the widow, and was to be divided between persons then living, the interest of the legatees therein remained contingent till that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In Tennessee it was held that a devise to a widow for life and at her death to the heirs at law of the testator, creates a contingent remainder and the estate goes in fee to such persons only as at the widow\u2019s death answer to the description of heirs at law of the testator; and the court cited with approval <em>Bigley </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>98 Tenn., 358, 359. The court said: \u201cThe chancellor treated the remainder as vested, but the Court of Chancery Appeals was of the opinion that it' was contingent. We concur in the latter view. The remainder was contingent, because the testator obviously intended the land to be divided at the death of his widow among such persons as should then sustain to him the relation of heirs at law. The remaindermen are to be ascertained not at his death, but at the death of his widow, the life ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ant; and they are to be such persons as would at that time be his \u2018heirs at law.\u2019 At his death, when the will took effect, those persons were \u2018dubious and uncertain;\u2019 therefore the remainder must be contingent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">.In New York, the court of appeals held, in a case in which the testator left a large estate,- both real and personal, giving to his widow a life estate and half the income of all his property of every kind, and to his \u2018legal heirs\u201d the remainder of the income accruing during the life of his wife after the payment of all taxes, assessments and' other charges against his estate, that the words \u201clegal heirs,\u201d as used in the will, meant those who would take in case of intestacy and in the portions prescribed as under the statute of distributions. <em>Woodward, </em>v. <em>James, </em>115 N. Y., 346. In another case the same court, <em>Matter of Crane, </em>164 N. Y., 71, per Parker, C. J., held that where, \u201caside from the direction to the executors or trustees to divide and distribute the estate upon the death of the widow, there are no words importing a gift, and where the only gift is found in a direction to divide, or pay, at a future time, the gift is future not immediate; contingent and not vested.\u201d There are many other cases of the same import, both in this country and m England. These well settled principles of law, with the considerations heretofore expressed with regard to the intention of the testator as shown in this will, would seem to conclusively establish the interpretation which we have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">But the counsel for the defendant in error, Denney, insists that although there may be no gift in this will except as implied from the direction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>pay after the death of the widow and the conver-' sion of the property into personalty and the.payment of the expenses, yet that the vesting of the interest to the legatees is immediate, because the interest is postponed only as to its enjoyment in order to let in a prior life estate. And he seems to rely upon the case of <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Laycock, </em>33 Ohio St., 128, as supporting his contention. As we have already said, that case was distinctly different from the present one in that, in that case the direction to divide and distribute was a direction to divide and distribute \u201camongst all my children then living or their heirs <em>when </em>the youngest child is twenty-one years of age,\u201d etc. And from that language the court held, as expressed in the fourth proposition of the syllabus, that: \u201cA devise to one <em>when </em>he arrives at a given age \u2014 sthe intermediate estate being devised to another \u2014 vests on the death of the testator, and is not defeated by the death of the devisee before the specified age. The words of futurity importing contingency, are not necessarily inconsistent with the immediate vesting of the estate, but may be regarded as merely postponing the possession.\u201d The court regarded the direction in the will to divide the estate among specified devisees as disclosing a gift in <em>praesenti, </em>which was to ripen into possession <em>\u201c'when </em>the youngest child is twenty-one years of age;\u201d and as an <em>aid </em>to that construction the court resorted to the rule that, \u201cwords of seeming condition will, if they can bear that construction, be held to have the effect of postponing the right of possession only, and not the present right to the estate.\u201d- In the present case the words of condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tion will not, in our. judgment, bear such a construction nor permit the application of that rule. The doctrine of <em>Richey, Exr., </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>30 Ohio St., 288; <em>Sinton </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>19 Ohio St., 30; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>38 Ohio St., 242; and not that of <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Laycock, supra, </em>is applicable to and decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The judgment of the circuit court is reversed and that of the court of common pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-8\">Crew, C.
