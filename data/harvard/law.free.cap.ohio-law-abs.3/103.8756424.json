The accused was found guilty and fined $25 and imprisoned for 30 days. Schonsberger was arrested in front of a hotel, as he was about to leave Youngstown. Error was prosecuted to common pleas. In affirming the judgment, the court of appeals held:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-25\">1. As the evidence disclosed that Schons-berger came to Youngstown on a mission to make money \u201cby criminal means and practices\u201d contrary to the ordinance in question, it cannot be said that the conviction was manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-27\">2. As the offense was not a second offense, as required by the ordinance, the municipal judge was not authorized to sentence the accused to 30 days or to any definite period of time; therefore that part of the ordinance is void for uncertainty and a sentence under it is contrary to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
