The affidavit charged that he permitted her to associate with men for an immoral purpose in his room and in other places with full knowledge that she was a minor. Lambeff was found guilty in juvenile court and sentenced to a fine and imprisonment. The evidence disclosed that Lambeff permitted three couples of young people to occupy a room in a building which he was holding under a joint lease and that he carried drinks to them. The defendant piV&gt;secuted\u00a1 error. In sustaining the judgment, the court of appeals held:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALYY\">Attorneys\u2014Moore, Barnum &amp; Hammond, for Schonsberger; William E. Lewis, for Youngstown; all of Youngstown.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">1. As the evidence disclosed that Schons-berger came to Youngstown on a mission to make money \u201cby criminal means and practices\u201d contrary t\u00f3 the ordinance in question, it cannot be, said that the conviction was manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">2. As the offense was not a second offense, as required by the ordinance, the municipal judge was not authorized to sentence the accused to 30 days or to any definite period of time; therefore that part of the ordinance is void for uncertainty and a sentence under it is contrary to law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
