January Term, 1873.</p><p id=\"Ak8\">*When the above case was called, counsel for defendants in error moved to dismiss the writ of error, upon the ground that the bill of exceptions had not been served as required by law. The only evidence of service was the following entry:</p><p id=\"b95-15\">\u201cI have this day served a copy of this' bill of exceptions on Messrs, Doyal &amp; Nunnally, attorneys for defendants in error, by forwarding the same to them by due course of mail, addressed to them at Griffin, Georgia. This November 29th, 1872.</p><p id=\"b95-17\">\u201cAttorney for plaintiff in error.\u201d</p><p id=\"b95-18\">Counsel for plaintiff in error stated that Mr. Doyal, of the firm of Doyal &amp; Nunnally, had admitted that he received the copy of the bill of exceptions forwarded. Upon this basis he moved to amend the entry by stating absolutely that counsel for defendants in error had been served. The Court refused to allow the amendment, and dismissed the writ of error.</p><p id=\"b95-21\">Service of Bill of Exceptions \u2014 Mailing.\u2014See Ency. Dig. Ga.
