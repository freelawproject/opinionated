Quarles, of two counts of first degree murder, one count of second degree murder, and other related charges. On this appeal, he claims</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">1. that he was denied his Sixth Amendment constitutional right to a speedy trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">2. that Judge Quarles erroneously admitted his confession, the taking of which did not comply with the requirements of <em>Miranda v. Arizona;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">3. that his efforts at the suppression hearing to cross-examine the interviewing detective about precise questions asked in the course of the interview were erroneously curtailed and that, at trial, his request for a <em>de novo </em>suppression hearing outside the presence of the judge was erroneously denied; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">4. that the State was erroneously allowed to give an improper rebuttal argument to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Speedy Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">This is not a <em>Hicks </em>claim. It is exclusively a constitutional speedy trial argument pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. We shall review it under the four-factored analysis of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">The crimes in this case were committed on September 27, 1997. The appellant, while in jail on an unrelated matter, was arrested for the crimes in this case on October 25, 1997, and that, for constitutional speedy trial purposes, is the date on which the clock begins to run. His first trial began on May 5, 1999, eighteen months and two weeks later. It was on that day that the speedy trial motion now under review was argued before Judge John C. Themelis and was denied. Our concern, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>therefore, is with the period from October 25, 1997 to May 5, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">A. The Trigger of \u201cConstitutional Dimensions\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The \u201clength of delay\u201d between arrest and trial is a term of art that serves two separate and distinct functions in a speedy trial analysis. In its first function, it identifies the threshold that must be crossed before any further analysis is called for. Along the delay continuum, the trigger of \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d is not itself part of the ultimate merits of a speedy trial claim. It simply marks the minimal point, short of which a court will dismiss a claim summarily and will not waste its time even inquiring into such things as reason for delay, demand-waiver, or prejudice. Beyond that minimal or triggering point, however, the claim may riot necessarily have merit, but it is worthy at least of thoughtful consideration. The trigger of \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d is exclusively a procedural phenomenon that justifies a further analysis and then drops out of the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The defense bar, however, has a chronic tendency to conflate the two functions of \u201clength of delay\u201d and to transform the mere procedural catalyst into a judicial pronouncement on the merits that takes on an apparent gravity that was never intended. The phrase \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d does, indeed, pack a potent rhetorical punch. Defense attorneys, therefore, frequently treat the preliminary finding that a delay is of \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d as persuasive argument that there was a violation of the right to a speedy trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">It is, of course, no such thing. Even a long delay caused exclusively by the defendant, for instance, would easily satisfy the procedural requirement of being of \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d but as a factor on the ultimate merits would be entitled to no weight whatsoever. The \u201clength of delay,\u201d as one of four interrelated factors in a <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>analysis, may be a factor of great weight, may be of intermediate weight, or may be of slight weight. In an apparent paradox, even a delay of very slight weight would necessarily have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d or the very weighing process, as part of the ultimate analysis, would never have taken place. Once the Sixth Amendment merits are in play, the only response that need be made to the no longer necessary use of the phrase \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d is, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s of \u2018constitutional dimensions\u2019 or we wouldn\u2019t even be having this hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Our point is that the notion of a delay being of \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d concerns only the threshold issue of whether a <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>analysis shall even be undertaken. Once the decision has been made to engage in that analysis, the threshold procedural finding no longer has any pertinence. The phrase \u201cconstitutional dimensions\u201d needs no further mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The length of delay of eighteen months in this case was of constitutional dimensions and the speedy trial claim, therefore, was and is deserving of further analysis. The concept of \u201cconstitutional dimensions,\u201d having fully served its purpose, will have nothing to do with that further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">B. The Length of Delay:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Once we are engaged in <em>Barker v. </em>Wingo\u2019s four-factored analysis, we view the \u201clength of delay\u201d in a different light. As far as the length of delay itself is concerned, what was sufficient to enable it to serve its first and triggering function may be of only minimal significance when it comes to its second function. Depending on which of its two functions is being served, we treat the \u201clength of delay\u201d very differently. As one of the four factors on the ultimate merits, it is heavily influenced by the other three factors, particularly that of \u201creasons for the delay.\u201d It may gain weight or it may lose weight because of circumstances that have nothing to do with the mere ticking of the clock. When serving its procedural or triggering function, however, the \u201clength of delay\u201dis impervious to such influences and circumstances. It is a mathematical constant that only requires us to read the calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>\u201cLength of delay\u201d in one of its manifestations, moreover, is by no means the equivalent of \u201clength of delay\u201d in its other manifestation. For its procedural function, \u201clength of delay\u201d is the gross period of time between the arrest and the trial or the hearing on the motion. For its function as a factor on the merits, by contrast, the \u201clength of delay\u201d is the net period of time that may be chargeable to the State or to the court system as true \u201cdelay,\u201d some of which, depending on other circumstances, may be given great weight and some of which may be given only slight weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The length of delay of eighteen months in this case, although it was more than enough to spark further analysis, is not on the ultimate merits particularly remarkable. In <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>itself, for instance, a length of delay of five years was held not to have violated the Sixth Amendment. An eighteen month delay is not, on the one hand, so brief as to call for summary dismissal and to obviate the need for further scrutiny. Neither, on the other hand, is it so overwhelming, as for example a ten year delay might be, as potentially to override the consideration of all other factors. In and of itself, it is not a weighty factor, one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">C. Demand-Waiver:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">For organizational convenience, we choose to consider the remaining factors out of their usual order. As with the length of delay, the demand-waiver factor is of little help to either party in this case. The appellant never waived his right to a speedy trial. Nor did he, except for an early on and <em>pro forma </em>objection to a postponement on a single occasion, ever consistently and vigorously cry out for the speedy disposition of the charges against him. This potential factor is a non-factor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">D. Prejudice:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Prejudice is not a weighty factor in this case. Presumed prejudice simply enjoys a weight proportionate to the length of delay itself, a factor that we have observed as being in this case very marginal.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In terms of actual prejudice, the appellant was subjected to pretrial incarceration. By the same token, the appellant was facing three separate charges of murder in the first degree and he ultimately was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without parole, compounded by another consecutive term of thirty years imprisonment. We also note that when the appellant was arrested on October 25, 1997, he was in jail on another unrelated matter. In his brief, the appellant has not bothered to tell us whether all or part of his pretrial incarceration overlapped detention for some other reason. In terms of this variety of actual prejudice, the appellant does not make much of a case. In terms of showing actual prejudice, moreover, the burden is on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The most significant variety of actual prejudice is prejudice to the defense of the case. The appellant does not suggest any such prejudice. The appellant did not take the stand in his own defense nor did he call any defense witnesses. There is no suggestion of any lost witnesses or of how their presence might have helped the defense case. There is no suggestion of any failed memory or of how a fresher recollection would have helped the defense case. There was no prejudice to the defense of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">E. Reason for Delay:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Eighteen months, to be sure, was a long time in scheduling this case for the trial table for the first time. Much of that delay, however, was attributable, in whole or in part, to the defense itself. Following the arrest of the appellant on October 25, 1997, the case was first scheduled for trial on May 5, 1998. That period of time was necessary for the orderly administration of justice and is not considered an unreasonable delay that calls for further accounting. <em>Howell v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 57, 82, 589 A.2d 90 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">That conclusion is well supported by the fact that appellant\u2019s first defense attorney did not enter his initial appearance until January 14,1998. This was, moreover, an extremely complex case, involving three separate murders charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>against multiple co-defendants. It involved numerous witnesses and considerable forensic evidence, including two forms of DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On May 5, the trial was postponed until May 27 because the prosecutor was tied up in another protracted case. That three-week delay was attributable to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The second postponement, from May 27 to July 14, is something of which the appellant may not complain because he requested it. The fact that the State also wished the postponement is coincidental. Defense counsel represented to the court that he wanted a postponement \u201cuntil July for further trial preparation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The third postponement, from July 14 until September 8, became inevitable when the appellant\u2019s first defense attorney withdrew from the case because of a conflict of interest and his second defense attorney only entered his appearance in June. July 14 had been scheduled for a hearing on motions and the new defense attorney indicated that he did not intend to pursue those motions. By mutual agreement, the case was sent to the administrative judge for a postponement \u201cinto September or November.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">It was scheduled for September 8. On that day the case was postponed a fourth time, until October 14, because counsel for both the appellant and his codefendant \u201cwanted time to investigate new witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The fifth postponement, from October 14 until January 19, 1999, was not the appellant\u2019s fault. Neither, however, was it the State\u2019s fault. The judge to whom the case was then assigned had a very truncated trial schedule and all indications were that the case against the two codefendants would take between two and one-half and three weeks with \u201csome fifty witnesses at least noted on the State\u2019s side.\u201d The scheduled court was unavailable for a trial of that length.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The sixth postponement, from January 19 to March 9, became inevitable when the appellant\u2019s second defense attorney withdrew from the case and his third lawyer entered her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>appearance on December 28, 1998. The new attorney was, moreover, in trial in another court in another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The seventh and final postponement, from March 9 to May 5, was one where new defense counsel indicated that she needed more time to prepare the case. The fact that the prosecutor was in trial in another case was again coincidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Basically, probably because of having had three different lawyers, we have a defendant who was not ready to go to trial on those serious charges. It is not a case in which a defendant, ready and eager to resolve the charges against him, was unconstitutionally denied his right to a speedy trial. We affirm Judge Themelis\u2019s denial of the speedy trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">A Reluctant Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The appellant\u2019s second and third contentions both challenge, in different ways, the admission into evidence of a statement he gave to Detective Darryl Massey on September 30, 1997, three days after the crimes were committed. Our chagrin at having to get embroiled in the contentions is because the impact of the statement on the appellant\u2019s case was so marginal as to be virtually nugatory. We are being asked to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">When Detective Massey interviewed the appellant on September 30 (he was not arrested for these crimes until a month later), the detective noticed that the appellant had scratches just above his left eye and on his neck. These could have had significance because there was evidence that there had been a struggle at the scene of the murders. The appellant\u2019s explanation for the scratches was that he had been involved in a fight with someone named Rodney. That \u201cfight\u201d did, to be sure, place him within two blocks of the murder scene. On the other hand, it was a crowded neighborhood that the appellant regularly frequented. The total impact of the statement was in the following exchange.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">Q And did you specifically ask him about the injuries to his neck and his left forehead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Q What if anything did he say about the injuries and his left forehead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">A He told me that he sustained those injuries in a fight with a gentleman by the name of Rodney on Friday the 26th of September, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">Q And where did he say the fight with Rodney on Friday, September 26th, 1997 occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">A In the alley, Park Heights and Cold Spring, West Cold Spring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">Q And how far is the alley located at Park Heights and West Cold Spring Lane from our crime scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">A Cold Spring separates, the intersection of 4400 block of Park Heights Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">Q So he put himself two blocks away on the night of the murder in a fight from our crime scene; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">A Yes. Yes, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Later in his testimony, Detective Massey summed up the appellant\u2019s statement as far as any acknowledgment of his involvement in the crimes was concerned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">Q And you advised him again that he was a suspect in a triple homicide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">Q And what did he say this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">A <em>He said that he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. He said, I didn\u2019t do anything; I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about; I didn\u2019t do anything.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">Fundamentally, that is exculpatory. The inculpatory significance of the statement is so slight, if anything at all, that it is hard to get excited about it. Because the State offered it, however, and it was received, it behooves us to treat the two contentions as if they had significance. What is nonetheless clear from this discussion is that, if our decision on either the second or third contention were to be different, we would not hesitate to find harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>The Voluntariness of the <em>Miranda </em>Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The appellant\u2019s second contention is that he did not voluntarily waive his Miranda-based right to silence and right to counsel. The appellant is swimming upstream against a strong current on this issue, in that he never took the stand at the May 22, 2000 suppression hearing before Judge Quarles immediately before the commencement of the trial. The only witness at the hearing was Detective Massey, a witness whom Judge Quarles found to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Detective Massey testified that he slowly and carefully delivered to the appellant the full <em>Miranda </em>catechism. The appellant replied that he understood each and every sentence of the <em>Miranda </em>litany. The appellant freely waived both of the so-called <em>Miranda </em>rights. Following Detective Massey\u2019s testimony and argument by counsel, Judge Quarles expressly found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">In this case I do find, having heard the detective and heard the uncontradicted testimony that has been proffered, that the Defendant was given his Miranda rights, that he was interviewed under conditions of relative comfort, in that bathroom breaks and other personal needs were attended to and that he was given Miranda warnings and had indicated to the detective an understanding of those warnings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Based on those findings, Judge Quarles ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">Accordingly, I do find that the statement was voluntarily made and that there was no offense to Miranda or any other requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The appellant argues that the waiver of rights was, as a matter of law, invalid because Detective Massey did not advise the appellant, prior to obtaining the <em>Miranda </em>waiver, that the subject of the interrogation was to be a triple murder. The law, however, does not compel such an advisement. In <em>Colorado v. Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 107 S.Ct. 851, 98 L.Ed.2d 954 (1987), the petitioner made the same argument that the appellant advances here. In rejecting it, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>[W]e have never read the Constitution to require that the police supply a suspect with a flow of information to help him calibrate his self-interest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights. Here, the additional information could affect only the wisdom of a Miranda waiver, not its essentially voluntary and knowing nature. Accordingly, <em>the failure of the law enforcement officials to inform Spring of the subject matter of the interrogation could not affect Spring\u2019s decision to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege in a constitutionally significant manner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">479 U.S. at 576-77,107 S.Ct. 851, 859 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In <em>Alston v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 178, 184-85, 597 A.2d 1023 (1991), this Court applied <em>Colorado v. Spring, </em>in rejecting a similar contention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding, the question <em>whether the appellant knew of all of the subjects about which he was to be questioned is irrelevant to the question of whether his Miranda waiver was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. </em>Since the appellant does not suggest that his <em>Miranda </em>waivers were involuntary for any other reason, we find that the lower court properly denied his Motion to Suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Restriction on Cross-Examination At Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The police interview of the appellant on September 30, 1997, including the advisement as to <em>Miranda </em>rights, took less than thirty minutes. Detective Massey took notes, later memorialized the appellant\u2019s statement in a brief typed summary of it, and then destroyed his notes. The pretrial suppression hearing of May 22, 2000, took place twenty months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">When defense counsel probed Detective Massey as to what precise questions he had asked in the course of the interview, Judge Quarles sustained the State\u2019s objection. In the colloquy that followed, two themes were intertwined. The dominant theme concerned the substantive content of the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>statement and Judge Quarles\u2019s ruling seems clearly to have focused on that theme. The appellant\u2019s more fully articulated argument on that issue was that the questions were necessary to establish a context for the answers and that the answers might lack relevance without them. The State\u2019s objection, also looking at substantive content, was based on the fact that the exclusive focus of a suppression hearing should be on the threshold question of admissibility in terms of voluntariness and that any question about the substantive content of the statement, including its ultimate relevance or irrelevance, might be appropriate subject matter for the later trial but not for a suppression hearing. Judge Quarles\u2019s ruling also clearly focused on that issue, as he admonished defense counsel, \u201cIt\u2019s not discovery. We\u2019re past discovery.\u201d The implicit thrust of his ruling was that the hearing had exhausted its examination of the voluntariness issue and was not going to get embroiled in anything that had to do with the substance of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Momentarily complicating our analysis, however, is the fact that defense counsel repeatedly, albeit <em>sotto voce, </em>interwove a secondary theme into his brief argument. He also suggested that the forms of the questions themselves might somehow impact on the voluntariness of the answers, although he did not articulate quite how that might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In retrospect, it might have been tactically wiser to have allowed the detective to have answered the questions. Detective Massey would probably have replied that he could not remember and that would have been the end of it. There could have been no claim that the Bill of Rights was in jeopardy. That, however, was the road not taken. For the moment, the contention is still before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The contention\u2019s suggestion is that some particular question, now lost to history, might have been so diabolically ingenious in form or content, that it, <em>ipso facto, </em>shattered the appellant\u2019s resolve to remain silent. The appellant\u2019s problem is that there no longer remained any such resolve capable of being shattered. The appellant had already waived his rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to silence and to counsel. He had already decided to talk and was, indeed, in the very act of talking. The appellant does not suggest how any question, no matter how cleverly contrived, could date back so as to corrode retroactively a waiver decision that had already been made before the question was ever asked. The appellant\u2019s claim seems to be: \u201cIf I had not already waived my right to silence, the questioning I had agreed to would have been enough to cause me to waive it involuntarily.\u201d The answer to the claim is that the State, already engaged in questioning pursuant to a valid waiver, does not need a double waiver to continue the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Absolutely foreclosing on this issue was the failure of the appellant to proffer just what such a will-destroying question might have been. If some question had been so artfully configured that it either broke the appellant\u2019s initial will to resist or suppressed the possible reemergence of a will to resist, the appellant, as its victim, would have been far better positioned than anyone else to tell us what it was. Future handbooks on interrogation techniques would doubtlessly salivate for such an illustration. The appellant, however, never took the stand to enlighten us. He never, through counsel, even vicariously proffered what such a mind-altering question had been. He simply invites us, beyond the reach of our imagination, to speculate about abstract possibilities. Indeed, the essentially self-serving nature of the brief statement he actually did give belies any thought that his resolve to keep weaving and dodging was ever compromised in the slightest. We see no merit in the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Turning to the related sub-contention, for all of the aforesaid reasons there was no reason why the appellant should have been permitted, on May 30, to relitigate, outside the presence of the jury, the admissibility question that had already been litigated on May 22. In terms of what defense counsel was permitted to ask on his cross-examination of Detective Massey in the presence of the jury, no limitation of any sort was ever imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The Open Door Policy For Responsive Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In his final contention, the appellant takes umbrage at comments made by the assistant state\u2019s attorney in her final rebuttal argument to the jury. The remarks complained of, with attendant objections, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Thank you, Your Honor. Ms. Cohen thinks that I want you to convict an innocent person. Ladies and gentlemen on the jury, the last thing I want you to do is to convict an innocent person. My job is not to ask you to convict innocent people. I don\u2019t sleep well at night doing this job for sixteen, almost seventeen years because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 I want to convict the innocent. I don\u2019t work for the City of Baltimore to convict innocent people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Detective Massey is not the outstanding homicide detective he is because he wants to convict innocent people. We are here to do our jobs. And the day I sentence [an innocent] person to a conviction is the day I quit. So I\u2019m sorry, but I have to start (unclear) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Objection, move to strike, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">THE COURT: Okay, Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: My job is to represent the people of Baltimore City in this murder case who ask you to do one thing \u2014 be fair and do justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">In a vacuum, the appellant\u2019s umbrage would be well taken. The assistant state\u2019s attorney unquestionably injected herself \u2014 her integrity, her honor \u2014 into the case. With the Chur-chillian repetition of the critical phrase, moreover, she did so very effectively. Ordinarily, she should have remained a neutral and unengaged commentator, an interpreter of the trial proceedings without subjective involvement in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In larger context, however, it is clear that the assistant state\u2019s attorney did not inject her character and her motivation into the argument. It was the defense attorney who did that. It was she who, in closing argument, cast dire aspersions on the prosecutor\u2019s professional integrity as she used an <em>ad hominem </em>attack on the assistant state\u2019s attorney to drag a red herring across the trail the jury should have been following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\"><em>So what do you if you\u2019re a prosecutor, you\u2019re the State, and you, and you have no evidence but you\u2019ve got a terrible crime. What do you do? Well, I\u2019ll tell you what you do. </em>You do things like this. You make charts of all the wounds, charts of all the wounds that describe in great detail, all of the wounds inflicted on these victims, like you need to figure out what happened here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">You can look at one photograph and you can figure out what happened here. This was a slaughter. This was crazy. But you know, if you don\u2019t have evidence, you\u2019re going to do something. <em>What you do, or at least what\u2019s been done in this case is they blow smoke, blow smoke in your eyes so that you can\u2019t see clearly in the hopes that you\u2019ll be so incensed by some of this stuff, that you will convict an innocent person.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Shorn of excess verbiage, the defense attorney\u2019s characterization of the actions and the ultimate intention of the assistant state\u2019s attorney was not subtle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">[W]hat do you if you\u2019re a prosecutor and you have no evidence but you\u2019ve got a terrible crime? I\u2019ll tell you what you do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">[Wjhat\u2019s been done in this case is they blow smoke in your eyes so that you can\u2019t see clearly IN THE HOPE THAT you\u2019ll be so incensed by some of this stuff that YOU WILL CONVICT AN INNOCENT PERSON.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">That was a harsh indictment of the professional integrity of the assistant state\u2019s attorney. She was well within her rights to strike back as she did. The appellant\u2019s suggestion that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>parry may have cut deeper than his initial thrust, even if true, falls on deaf ears. It is with ill grace that one complains of an effective counterpunch.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
