The circuit court, on July 10,1996, sentenced appellant to the following: twenty years imprisonment, with all but ten years suspended, and five years probation for robbery with a deadly weapon; ten years concurrent for the use of a handgun, with five years mandatory; one year concurrent for the assault and battery charges; and one year concurrent for false imprisonment. Appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief on October 10, 1996. We affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction on May 14,1997 and, on January 14,1998, appellant withdrew his petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">At a hearing on January 14, 1998, the circuit court (Nichols, J.) reconsidered appellant\u2019s sentence and imposed five years imprisonment on the robbery with a deadly weapon charge, five years for the use of a handgun in a crime of violence, to be served concurrently and, according to the court, \u201c[t]hat five years without parole.\u201d The revised sentence was to commence retroactively to appellant\u2019s original sentence commencement date of November 14, 1995. Appellant served less than four years of his five-year sentence and was released on March 30,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Subsequent to his release from prison, appellant, on May 2, 1999, was charged with the murder of his <em>former </em>girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend. On or about May 4, 1999, the Division of Parole and Probation filed an application for warrant on the basis that appellant violated probation. Agent Christina Stockton, Senior Agent, and Mary Grace Waldron, Field Supervisor I, both employed by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, Division of Parole and Probation, reported to the court appellant\u2019s \u201cill adjustment to supervision.\u201d In that report they stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">[Appellant] was released on Mandatory Release from Southern Maryland Pre Release Unit on March 30, 1999. Since his release from incarceration, [appellant] has given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>this Agent several different addresses where he is residing. On two occasions this Agent attempted to verify the addresses given by this offender. In both instances on April 22, 1999 and April 29, 1999 the home verification was unsuccessful. On the first instance, the resident of the home had no knowledge of the [appellant]. In the second instance, this Agent discovered that this was the residence of the [appellant\u2019s] aunt. She informed this Agent that [appellant] did not reside at that address. Therefore, [appellant\u2019s misrepresentation regarding his residence prohibited this Agent from conducting a home verification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">In addition, it has come to this Agent\u2019s attention that on May 2, 1999 [appellant] allegedly Committed First Degree Murder. This Agent was informed by Detective Jernigan of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, that [appellant] gunned down the new boyfriend (Wayne Sellers) of his ex-girlfriend (Terri Lewis). A warrant has been issues [sic] for [appellant] by the Police Department charging him with First Degree Murder (Case # CR000E00125041). At this time [appellant] is being sought by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>In light of the aforementioned facts it is respectfully requested that a Warrant be issued charging appellant with violation of Probation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On May 24,1999, the State filed a petition against appellant for violation of probation and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was served with a copy of a bench warrant on June 5, 1999 and was assigned a public defender on June 11, 1999. Appellant\u2019s public defender, on July 15, 1999, filed a motion to dismiss the petition for violation of probation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>1. That the [appellant] in the herein cause is charged with violation of probation of a Court Order of July 10, 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">2. That on January 14, 1998, the [appellant] was resen-tenced in this matter to a period of five years incarceration without parole. This sentence dated irom November 14,1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">3. That the [appellant] is not on probation in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The circuit court (Sothoron, J.), on September 15, 1999, denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, stating in its Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa-\">Furthermore, this [c]ourt notes that the Reconsideration of the [appellant\u2019s Sentence by Judge C. Philip Nichols, Jr. was illegal, in that such violated the provisions of Maryland Rule 4-345. Accordingly, the [appellant] was and is still on probation pursuant to this Court\u2019s original sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">On March 3, 2000, appellant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Krauser, Sherry, J.) of second degree murder and use of a handgun. On April 25, 2000, he was found guilty of violation of probation in the circuit court (Sothoron, J.). The court imposed a sentence of twenty years imprisonment with all but ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">The following is the sequence of the proceedings before the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">11/14/95-Beginning date of revised sentence/date appellant incarcerated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-15\">5/31/96-Appellant convicted of armed robbery and related offenses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-16\">7/10/96-Appellant sentenced for robbery with deadly weapon to twenty years, all but ten years suspended, five years probation; ten years concurrent with five years mandatory for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; one year for false imprisonment and one year for assault and battery, to be served concurrently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-17\">10/10/96-Petition for Post Conviction relief filed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>1/14/98-Appellant\u2019s 7/10/96 sentence reconsidered pursuant to agreement between State and appellant that, in consideration for withdrawal of Post Conviction Petition, appellant is sentenced to five years for robbery with a deadly weapon and five years concurrent without parole for use of handgun in commission of crime of violence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">3/30/99-Appellant\u2019s mandatory release after serving four years of 1/14/98 five year sentence; appellant received \u201cMandatory Supervision Release Certificate\u201d that reads \u201cthe date on which the inmate\u2019s maximum term will expire is November 14, 2000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">5/2/99-Appellant charged with murder of ex-girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend (Basis of Violation)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">5/4/99-State filed petition for violation of probation and appellant arrested on bench warrant on 6/5/99</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">7/15/99-Appellant filed motion to dismiss Petition for Violation of Probation based on contention that, pursuant to 1/14/98 reconsideration of his original sentence, he was no longer on probation (No probationary period was imposed at 1/14/98 hearing)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">9/15/99-Appellant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Violation of Probation Petition denied; circuit court concluded that reconsideration of sentence was illegal in that it violated Maryland Rule 4-345 because reconsideration hearing was not heard by sentencing judge, notwithstanding agreement between appellant and State and, because the reconsideration proceeding was illegal, appellant was on original probation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">3/3/00-Appellant convicted by jury in Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court of second degree murder of ex-girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">4/25/00-Appellant found guilty of violation of probation and sentenced to twenty years, with all but 10 years suspended; appeal subsequently filed to Court of Special Appeals</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">As noted in the time line, above, appellant filed this timely appeal presenting one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Did the trial court err in finding appellant in violation of probation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellant contends that he was not on probation and, <em>a fortiori, </em>could not be found to be in violation of probation. According to appellant \u2014 and conceded by the State \u2014 the parties reached a binding agreement at appellant\u2019s hearing for post-conviction relief. That agreement was summarized by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Your Honor, in consideration for the [appellant] withdrawing his post-conviction motion the State is agreeing to have the sentence in this case reconsidered to five years mandatory for the handgun violation and a concurrent five years on the RDW [robbery with a deadly weapon] count. No back-up time at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The court reiterated their agreement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">As I understand it[,] part of the agreement is I resentence you today as to count one robbery with a deadly weapon the sentence would be five years. As to count two the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence or a felony the sentence is five years. That five years without parole. And it accounts from, was it November 14th, 1995? [PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Appellant contends and the State concurs, that the agreement entered into by appellant and the State at the January 14, 1998 hearing was binding upon all parties. Appellant argues that the circuit court improperly contravened the agreement by re-sentencing appellant to the original sentence. The State \u201cagrees that it requested that that bargain be adopted by Judge Nichols____\u201d and will \u201cnot take a contrary position on appeal.\u201d Judge Sothoron <em>sua sponte </em>determined that Judge Nichols\u2019s modification of appellant\u2019s sentence at his post-conviction hearing was improper.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel] on behalf of appellant filed on July 15, 1999 a motion to dismiss. The basis in part was that the [appellant] was no longer on probation. This [c]ourt denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>that motion on September the 15th, 1999 by way of written word and in doing so this [c]ourt pointed out that Judge Nichols had illegally reconsidered appellant\u2019s case. That in the [cjourt\u2019s mind, and I am talking about myself, Judge Nichols\u2019s reconsideration was a violation of Maryland Rule 4-345 which speaks to reconsideration of sentence. So therefore I determined that appellant was still on probation and therefore denied the motion to dismiss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Maryland Rule 4-345 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">(a) Illegal sentence. The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">(b) Modification or reduction \u2014 Time for. The court has revisory power and control over a sentence upon a motion filed within 90 days after its imposition____Thereaf-ter, the court has revisory power and control over the sentence in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity,.... The court may not increase a sentence after the sentence has been imposed, except that it may correct an evidence mistake in the announcement of a sentence if the correction is made on the record before the defendant leaves the courtroom following the sentencing proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">(c) Open court hearing. The court may modify, reduce, correct, or vacate a sentence only on the record after notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">During the following colloquy, the State objected to a review of appellant\u2019s sentence during the post-conviction proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al1\">Your Honor, first I would say <em>post-Brooks v[.] State[Warden, Md. Penitentiary], </em>1 Md.App. 1 [, 226 A.2d 354 (1967) ], clearly says that post-conviction is not a place for review of sentence or reconsideration of sentence. Many times sentences are changed at post-conviction. But the proper way to do them is the post-conviction goes before another judge but the reconsideration or review has to go back to the sentencing judge. Just as [Maryland] Rule 4-345 says that a motion for reconsideration or reduction of sentence should be brought back before the sentencing court. And that, I believe it is <em>Duffin v[.] Warden, of Maryland Penitentiary, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>235 Md. 685[, 202 A.2d 597 (1964)], hold that. Also in <em>Wimbush v[.] Warden, </em>229 Md. 616[, 182 A.2d 357 (1962)], the reconsideration must go back to the trial court. Therefore I, my position is that when Judge Nichols did this it may be done all the time but it was wrong. And since it was wrong it could be considered an illegal sentence. And in order for an illegal sentence to be corrected it goes back to the sentencing court once again, which would be yourself. So I would argue that this sentence was not done properly to reduce it to five years and it should go back to you. And you at any time can correct what we believe to be an illegal sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On this appeal, as we have noted, the State concedes that the agreement by appellant to withdraw his post-conviction petition in exchange for a reconsideration of his sentence was a binding agreement. Although the typical agreement between the State and an accused contemplates a reduced charge or lesser sentence in consideration of a defendant\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of his right to a trial and the guarantees attendant thereto, the law is well settled that, in the absence of any jurisdictional defect, such agreements are based on contract principles and must be enforced. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">Nevertheless, <em>we conclude that the interests of justice and appropriate recognition of the duties of the prosecution in relation to promises made in the negotiation of pleas </em>of guilty will be best served by remanding the case to the state courts for further consideration. The ultimate relief to which petitioner is entitled we leave to the discretion of the state court, which is in a better position to decide whether the circumstances of this case require only that there be specific performance of the agreement on the plea, in which case petitioner should be resentenced by a different judge, or whether, in the view of the state court, the circumstances require granting the relief sought by petitioner, <em>ie., </em>the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty. We emphasize that this is in no sense to question the fairness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>sentencing judge; the fault here rests on the prosecutor, not on the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Thus, although the case at hand does not involve a plea agreement presented to the court prior to pre-sentencing proceedings and investigation report submitted by the Division of Parole and Probation <em>(see Smith v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 371, 375, 563 A.2d 1129 (1989)), Maryland Rule 4-243(a)(6) provides that a plea agreement may propose \u201ca particular sentence, disposition, or other judicial action to a judge for consideration pursuant to subsection (c) of this rule.\u201d Although we cannot discern from the record before us why the State was motivated to enter into the instant agreement, the State, after evaluating the merits of appellant\u2019s post-conviction petition, may well have decided that there was merit to the petition and that it would be required to re-try appellant. Speaking to just such considerations, the Court of Appeals said, in <em>Beverly v. State, </em>349 Md. 106, 123, 707 A.2d 91 (1998), that \u201cplea agreements also advance law enforcement efforts by eliminating \u2018many of the risks, uncertainties, and practical burdens of trial, permitting] the judiciary and prosecution to concentrate their resources on those cases in which they are most needed.\u2019 \u201d (Citing <em>State v. Brockman, </em>277 Md. 687, 693, 357 A.2d 376 (1976).) The sentence imposed by Judge Nichols pursuant to the agreement between appellant and the State was therefore valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Having determined that the five-year sentence for robbery with a deadly weapon and the five-year mandatory sentence without parole for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence were valid, Judge Sothoron erred in his re-imposition of the original sentence because, in violation of Rule 4-345, it was an attempt to modify a previously imposed valid sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Turning to the primary basis of appellant\u2019s appeal, Judge Sothoron, upon invalidating the reconsideration proceedings conducted by Judge Nichols, reinstated the original sentence which, unlike the sentence imposed by Judge Nich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ols, imposed a five-year period of probation. No part of the sentence imposed by Judge Nichols had been suspended and, thus, there was no probationary period imposed. Appellant could only have been found guilty of violation of probation under the sentence originally imposed. Because we hold that re-imposition of that original sentence was error, parole and probation agents were without authority to apply to a court for violation of that probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On March 30, 1999, appellant was released pursuant to Md.Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), Corr. Serv. \u00a7 7-501 (C.S.), entitled \u201cRelease on Mandatory Supervision,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The Division of Correction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall grant a conditional release from confinement to an inmate who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">(1) is serving a term of confinement of more than 12 months;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(2) was sentenced on or after July 2, 1970, to the jurisdiction of the Division of Correction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(3) has served the term or terms, less diminution credit awarded under Title 3, Subtitle 7 and Title 11, Subtitle 5 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">An individual on mandatory supervision remains in legal custody until the expiration of the individual\u2019s full term and is subject to \u201call laws, rules, regulations and conditions that apply to parolees and any special conditions established by a commissioner.\u201d C.S. \u00a7 7-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Parole and probation Senior Agent Stockton and Field Supervisor I Waldron, on behalf of the Division of Parole and Probation, applied for a warrant charging appellant with violation of probation. Judge Sothoron, after concluding that the reconsideration proceedings were invalid, found appellant guilty of violation of probation pursuant to the original sentence. Because, in our view, appellant was not on probation, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to enforce appellant\u2019s violation of his mandatory supervision release. Mandatory release under C.S. \u00a7 7-501, like parole, is uniquely an executive function and the enforcement and regulation thereof is vested solely within the Division of Parole and Probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Patently, during appellant\u2019s prison term, he was awarded \u201cdiminution credits.\u201d \u201c[A]n inmate committed to the custody of the Commissioner is entitled to a diminution of the inmate\u2019s term of confinement as provided under this subtitle.\u201d C.S. \u00a7 3-702. Pursuant to C.S. \u00a7 3-704, diminution credits are earned by an inmate to reduce the term of his or her confinement. <em>See also Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 128, 647 A.2d 106, <em>reconsid. denied, </em>(1994). Thus, \u201c[assuming an inmate does not forfeit diminution credits as the result of a disciplinary hearing,\u201d he or she can \u201cearn the right to be released on a date much sooner than that designated by ... [the] original term of confinement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Correctional Services \u00a7 7-504, entitled \u201cRevocation of Mandatory Supervision,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(a) Diminution credits previously awarded. \u2014 The commissioner presiding at an individual\u2019s mandatory supervision revocation hearing may revoke any or all of the diminution credits previously earned by the individual on the individual\u2019s term of confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">(b) New diminution credits.-An inmate may not be awarded any new diminution credits after the inmate\u2019s mandatory supervision has been revoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The diminution credits to which C.S. \u00a7 7-504 refers are set out in Md. Ann.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 700(d), (e), and (f), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>provide for a deduction of ten days in advance for each calendar month from an inmate\u2019s sentence for good conduct, five additional days deducted from an inmate\u2019s sentence where he or she has \u201cmanifested satisfactory performance of work tasks assigned,\u201d and five additional days from the inmate\u2019s term of confinement for \u201csatisfactory progress and vocational or other educational and training courses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Appellant\u2019s maximum five-year term, pursuant to his mandatory release date would have ended on November 14, 2000. He was, in fact, released, however, on May 30,1999. Thus, he received a reduction in his term of confinement, i.e., he received diminution credits that reduced his confinement by one year and approximately five months. For that period, appellant was under the authority and supervision of the Division of Parole and Probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">As further evidence that appellant was under the supervision of the Division of Parole and Probation, is the colloquy between counsel and the court that occurred at the end of appellant\u2019s hearing before Judge Sothoron on April 25, 2000.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: I would also argue even though he was out on mandatory release time he still ... he still signed the paper that said he accepted the conditions of mandatory supervision release that he was supposed to go to Probation. So at this point he was still on probation. At that point when he then, when he violated it on May 2nd, 1999 it would be a violation of probation whether it is with them or with you. But in this case I believe that it should go back to the original sentence because of the way the sentencing was done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">THE COURT: What is the State\u2019s position [PROSECUTOR] about purs[u]ing this matter today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: About pursuing it today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">THE COURT: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: My position is that it should go back to you and you could reconsider that sentence back to your original sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>THE COURT: Well my order that [appellant\u2019s counsel] and myself eluded [sic] to dated September the 15th speaks for itself in the sense that I indicated that Judge Nichols\u2019s sentence in my mind was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">THE COURT: \u2014 improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">THE COURT: I used the word illegal because I think it is illegal. And I said according [sic] the [appellant] was and still is on probation pursuant to the [c]ourt\u2019s original sentence. Now my question to you is, is the State still intending on prosecuting [appellant] for violation of probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">THE COURT: Okay. All right [sic]. [Appellant\u2019s counsel], what I am going to do is ... treat your comments as a motion to dismiss the petition for violation of probation based upon the fact that the [appellant] was not placed on notice that he was on probation as of the date of his release, which I understand it now to be pursuant to Judge Nichols\u2019s sentence, March the 80th, 1999. And I am going to allow [the prosecutor] to have, pursuant to that motion filed in open court State\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 ... [J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">THE COURT: Which would be the document that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">THE COURT: \u2014 you just referenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: It says Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u2014 and I am quoting Your Honor.

We do not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>reverse side of it. But we would object to that being entered, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">THE COURT: All right.

It appears to this [c]ourt that based upon this exhibit that [appellant] was still under the supervision of the Department of Parole and Probation as of March 31st, 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Although we disagree with the court\u2019s assessment that appellant was on probation, we agree with its determination that appellant was under the supervision of the Division of Parole and Probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Consequently, the State erroneously petitioned the circuit court for a violation of probation hearing when the court had no basis to hear the petition. Because we hold that appellant was on mandatory supervision release rather than on probation, the proper procedure for a violation of mandatory supervision release is left to the authority of the Division of Parole and Probation.
