Washington Street, on behalf of Charles Stokes (\u201cStokes\u201d), a minor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who formerly lived at that address. The current owner of that property, 835 Washington Street, LLC, appellee, refused appellants\u2019 request for access to the property in order to conduct a test for the presence of lead-based paint. Appellants filed an action against appellee, seeking an order for entry upon the property to conduct a \u201cnoninvasive and nondestructive test.\u201d The circuit court denied that motion and this appeal followed, in which appellants present a single question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4x\">Does the Circuit Court have power under the Maryland Rules of Civil Procedure or by common law to order a property owner to allow a nondestructive lead test of the owner\u2019s vacant property when the presence of lead in that property is relevant and material to another pending action involving the poisoning of a child?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cyes\u201d to that question, vacate the judgment of the circuit court, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">In the underlying action against the former owner of 835 N. Washington Street, appellants must prove that Stokes suffered lead poisoning while residing at that property. Appellee is not involved in the underlying action. When appellee refused their request to test the property, appellants filed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>action at issue, a Motion to Perpetuate Evidence, requesting that the circuit court exercise its subpoena power to order appellee to cease withholding evidence relevant to a matter pending before the court. Asserting that the presence or absence of lead-based paint in the dwelling \u201cwill be most relevant in the child\u2019s action against the former owners of 835 N. Washington Street,\u201d appellants argue that they are entitled to an order of court granting them the right to enter the property in order to conduct \u201ca noninvasive and nondestructive test\u201d that would determine lead-based paint therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Appellee responded to appellants\u2019 motion, arguing that (1) such relief is not provided for in the Maryland Rules, (2) the relief sought has been expressly rejected in a case that confirmed the clear meaning of the Rules, and (3) appellee was entitled to counsel fees incurred in this case because appellants\u2019 counsel had specific knowledge that appellants were not entitled to the relief sought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">Plaintiff was a minor who, according to the allegations, suffered lead poisoning while residing at 835 N. Washington Street before it was owned by the defendant here. It is argued that the presence of lead paint in the dwelling will be relevant to an action against the former owners of 835 N. Washington Street in the matter captioned as <em>Carl Stokes, et al. v. Avid Enterprises 1, Inc., </em>Case No. 24-C-99-004264. Clearly the LLC is not a party in connection with that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">The Court has reviewed plaintiffs motion as well as defendant\u2019s response, which provides that, in fact, the Court has no authority in connection with the first rule of discovery, that is 2-422, which [appellants\u2019 counsel] has conceded because that only provides documents and entiy onto a property by a party to another party clearly not satisfied here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The plaintiffs relies [sic] on Maryland Rule 2-404 here, captioned Perpetuation of Evidence which the Court has reviewed. I have also reviewed the case relied upon by the defendant, that is <em>Allen v. Allen </em>at 105 Md.App. 359 [659 A.2d 411 (1995) ], which provides that the rule was not intended to serve as a discovery device to provide prospective plaintiffs with an opportunity to secure information in order to frame a complaint. Indication of Rule 2-404 is therefore reserved for that category of situations in which it is necessary to prevent testimony from being lost or destroyed before a party is able to pursue discovery in the ordinary course of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">While, I am compelled that plaintiffs have presented that the property is vacant and compelling equitable circumstances that could require a court to issue an order perpetuating evidence, I don\u2019t believe that Maryland Rule 2^404 permits the type of relief that the plaintiff is suggesting here based on the limited authority, which really is <em>Allen </em>as well as the other two cases cited in the annotations, I don\u2019t believe it would be proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">And accordingly, I do believe that this is a matter more appropriately reserved for the legislature to take up if, in fact, the members of that branch believe that this Court should perpetuate such evidence in certain situations. So I don\u2019t believe that the motion that has been raised is without merit. And so accordingly I am going to deny defendant\u2019s request for fees. I do believe that it is a novel issue, again, that I don\u2019t believe is appropriate for this court of general jurisdiction to resolve without any authority, which has not been provided to this Court to date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">So accordingly, I will pass an order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to perpetuate evidence for the reasons stated on the record, and respectfully deny the defendant\u2019s claim for fees pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-341.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP 34) <em>expressly </em>authorizes a party in a lawsuit to enter upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>land of a non-party for the limited purpose of inspecting and testing the land for evidence that would be of consequence to a pending court action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only Maryland and Connecticut have no state provision allowing for non-party production/inspection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hence, this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Appellants argue that the purpose of Md. Rule 2-404 is to preserve evidence that might become unavailable,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that Md. Rule 2-402 makes clear that the scope of allowable discovery is broad.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellee counters that, under the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>cable Maryland Rules and judicial interpretation of those terms, discovery of documents and property may only be obtained from a \u201cparty\u201d to a suit. Because the Maryland Rules do not preclude circuit courts from exercising their inherent equitable powers, we are persuaded that the circuit court has jurisdiction to permit appellants entry into appellee\u2019s property through an equitable bill of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In <em>Webb v. Joyce Real Estate, Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 512, 672 A.2d 660 (1996), this Court concluded that, because \u201cnonparties may not be compelled to submit to an inspection of their property\u201d under Rule 2-422,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that rule did not authorize entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>onto property owned by a nonparty. <em>Webb </em>did not hold that the Maryland Rules precluded a party from seeking entry onto a non-party\u2019s land. That case simply held that Md. Rule 2-422 does not authorize the circuit court to grant such relief. Subsequent to our decision in <em>Webb, </em>the Court of Appeals rejected a proposal that would have permitted the relief that appellant is seeking in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are persuaded, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>er, that the absence of a rule expressly authorizing an inspection does not preclude the circuit court from granting that relief when it is in the interest of justice to do so. We therefore hold that the circuit courts have the power to order inspection of a non-party\u2019s property on a case-by-case basis through the equitable bill of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Prior to the enactment of FRCP 34, courts were presented with the issue of whether a party had a right to file a separate action against a non-party to enter the non-party\u2019s property in order to obtain needed discovery.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The cases are collected in Rupert F. Barron, <em>Existence and Nature of Cause of Action for Equitable Bill of Discovery, </em>37 ALR 5th 645 (1996). A review of those cases makes it clear that the circuit court has the authority to issue an equitable bill of discovery in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In <em>Shorey v. Lincoln Pulp &amp; Paper Company, Inc., </em>511 A.2d 1076 (Maine 1986), the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine was presented with a situation similar to the instant case. The plaintiff-appellant was completely disabled while operating a machine at the factory where he was employed. He asked his employer for permission to inspect the machine to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>see if it had any manufacturing flaws.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> His employer denied that request. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit seeking access to the factory in order to inspect the machine. <em>Id. </em>at 1077. The Supreme Judicial Court noted that, as the applicable Maine Rule<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> neither provided for nor prohibited the relief being sought, the trial court had the authority to grant the plaintiff a right to enter the factory and inspect the machine. The case was therefore remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought. The <em>Shorey </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">Although modern discovery rules and liberal pleading requirements virtually eliminate the need to resort to an independent action in the form of an equitable bill of discovery, they do not totally displace the traditional equitable jurisdiction of the Superior Court to issue appropriate orders for independent discovery when effective discovery cannot otherwise be obtained and the ends of justice are served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Several other state courts have held that, in the absence of a statute or rule prohibiting entry upon the property of a nonparty, the equitable bill of discovery is available to the party who needs the court\u2019s permission to gain entry to a nonparty\u2019s land. <em>See Temple v. Chevron, </em>254 Mont. 455, 459-63, 840 P.2d 561 (1992); <em>Arcell v. Ashland Chemical Co. et al, </em>152 N.J.Super. 471, 378 A.2d 53, 70-71 (1977); <em>Wofford v. Ethyl Corp., </em>316 S.C. 75, 447 S.E.2d 187 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In <em>Wimes v. Eaton Corporation, </em>573 F.Supp. 331 (E.D. Wis.1983), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin was faced with a situation similar to the situation in <em>Shorey. </em>The plaintiff was at work in a foundry when he was struck in the face by a hook attached to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>machine. He suffered severe injuries, and wanted to determine whether the machine had malfunctioned. When he asked for permission to inspect the machine, his employer denied that request. The <em>Wimes </em>Court stated that, because the then applicable Federal Rules did not expressly provide for or prohibit inspection of a non-party\u2019s premises, the equitable bill of discovery was available to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 336-37. The court remanded the case to the state court from which it had been removed for that court to determine whether a bill of discovery was warranted under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The Maryland Rules of Procedure have greatly reduced, but have not eliminated entirely, the need for an equitable bill of discovery. No Maryland Rule prohibits entry upon land of non-parties for the purposes of inspection. Indeed, a rule denying a party\u2019s right to seek an equitable bill <em>of </em>discovery may well violate the party\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>As noted above, the Court of Appeals rejected an amendment to Maryland Rule 24122. If the Court of Appeals has the power to enact a rule that would expressly provide for the kind of relief that appellant is seeking, the circuit courts obviously have the power to grant that relief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Maryland Rules do not prohibit Maryland circuit courts from exercising their inherent equitable powers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The information that appellants seek, namely to test the vacant premises for lead paint contamination, is vital to their lawsuit against the defendant in the underlying lead paint action. Appellants do not have an adequate alternative remedy for obtaining the evidence they will need. An equitable bill of discovery is the only way for appellants to obtain the information they need.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">While appellants cannot gain entry to appellee\u2019s property through Md. Rule 2-422, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for the circuit court\u2019s determination of whether an equitable bill of discovery should be issued in this case. The parties are entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which appellants must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) what they seek to discover is material and necessary for proof of the other action already brought; (2) appellants have no other adequate means of obtaining discovery of the essential information; (3) appellants\u2019 right of access to the premises outweighs the privacy rights of both the owner and the occupants of the property;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (4) issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>an equitable bill of discovery will not impose an unreasonable hardship upon the owner or upon any occupant of the property.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Berger v. Cuomo, </em>230 Conn. 1, 644 A.2d 333, 337 (1994); <em>Chevron, </em>254 Mont. at 463, 840 P.2d 561; <em>Hegwood, </em>569 So.2d at 1296-98; <em>Investors Mortgage Insurance v. Dykema, </em>598 F.Supp. 666, 668-69. A remedy is \u201cadequate\u201d only if it \u201cis one which is specific and adapted to securing the relief sought conveniently, effectively and completely.\u201d <em>Cuomo, </em>644 A.2d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that (1) the circuit court has <em>authority </em>to grant the relief sought in this case, and (2) it is for the circuit court to decide in the first instance whether \u2014 under the unique circumstances of this particular case \u2014 appellants <em>should </em>receive an equitable bill of discovery that would allow them to enter appellee\u2019s property in order to test for the presence of lead paint at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-11\">. Appellant Eve Jones, grandmother and next friend of Charles Stokes, filed the lawsuit on his behalf. For purposes of this opinion, we refer to them as \"appellants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">. Appellee has filed a cross-appeal, arguing that the circuit court erred in refusing to award counsel fees incurred in opposing appellants\u2019 efforts to gain access to appellee\u2019s property. In light of our holding, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s refusal to award counsel fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-4\">. That Rule now provides that \"[a] person not a party to the action may be compelled to produce documents and things or to submit to an inspection as provided in Rule 45.\u201d The following states have rules that are consistent with this rule: Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio (Rule adds notice safeguards), Oklahoma, Oregon (maintains old Rule 34 language), Rhode Island (reporter\u2019s note suggests non-party production/inspection allowed by deposition and subpoena), South Carolina (maintains old Rule 34 language), Vermont (reporter's note suggests non-party production inspection allowed by subpoena), West Virginia, and Wyoming (maintains old Rule 34 language).

Several courts have held that a criminal defendant has the right to inspect a crime scene that is under the control of a third party. In <em>Henshaw v. Virginia, </em>19 Va.App. 338, 451 S.E.2d 415 (1994), the criminal defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter by the trial court. <em>Henshaw </em>at 416. The defendant, prior to trial, filed motions for discovery seeking to inspect, photograph, and take measurements of the crime scene that was not under the State's control. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motions. <em>Id. </em>The appellate court found that criminal defendants do have a right to view, photograph, and take measurements at the crime scene under the control of a third party. <em>Id. </em>at 419. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">If an accused establishes that inspecting, photographing, or measuring the crime scene is relevant and material, he is entitled to access, subject to such reasonable limitations and restrictions as the trial judge may impose, unless due to special circumstances the private citizen\u2019s constitutional right to privacy outweighs the accused's right to view or inspect the premises. Upon a prima facie showing of relevance, the trial judge shall order access for observation and inspection, subject to such reasonable restrictions and limitations as the court determines necessary in its sound judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 420. The appellate court deemed the trial court\u2019s error to be harmless because the defendant was satisfactorily able to present his evidence through the State's diagram and photographs of the room, and the testimony of witnesses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Other courts have reached similar conclusions. <em>See Bullen v. Superior Court, et al., </em>204 Cal.App.3d 22, 251 Cal.Rptr. 32, (1988)(holding that when a criminal defendant wants to inspect a private party\u2019s property, \u201cpetitioner's fundamental right to privacy free from judicially mandated intrusion into her home invokes a 'legitimate government interest,\u2019 rendering it incumbent on defendant to demonstrate sufficient \u2018plausible justification\u2019 and 'good cause\u2019 for the intrusion\u201d); <em>State v.

It is not ground for objection that the information sought is already known to or otherwise obtainable by the party seeking discovery or that the information will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

In 1971, the advisory committee note to FRCP 34, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Rule 34 is revised to accomplish the following major changes in the existing rule: (1) to eliminate the requirement of good cause; (2) to have the rule operate extrajudicially; (3) to include testing and sampling as well as inspecting or photographing tangible things; and (4) to make clear that the rule does not preclude an independent action for analogous discovery against persons not parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\"><em>See </em>FRCP 34, advisory committee note, 1970 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">When Federal Rule 34 was amended in 1970, subsection (c) was added. That subsection stated: \"Persons Not Parties. This rule does not preclude an independent action against a person not a party for production of documents and things and permission to enter upon land.\" The Rule was subsequently amended to expressly provide for entry on non-party land. That amendment took effect in 1991. See F.R. Civ. P. 34 advisory committee\u2019s note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">.

Maine Rule 34(c), was identical to Federal Rule 34, as amended in 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b247-5\">. Other federal courts agreed with the <em>Mimes </em>Court that, in the absence of an amendment to the rules, the best method to gain entry to a non-party's land was through a bill of discovery. <em>See Lubrin v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., </em>109 F.R.D. 403, 404-05 (D.Virgin Islands 1986); <em>Home Insurance Co. v. First National Bank of Rome, </em>89 F.R.D. 485, 486-87 (N.D.Ga.1980); <em>Huynh v. Werke, </em>90 F.R.D. 447, 450 (S.D.Ohio 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\">. Several courts have noted that statutes modifying common law rights are to be strictly construed and will not displace such rights unless that intent is expressly declared. <em>See Adventist Health System/Sunbelt, Inc. v. Hegwood, </em>569 So.2d 1295 (Fla.App. 5 Dist.1990). In allowing a bill of discovery the court stated that neither the statute at issue nor its predecessor \"expressly prohibits discovery by alternative means.\u201d <em>Hegwood </em>at 1296. It went on to state that \"[statutes designed to supercede or modify rights provided by common law must be strictly construed and will not displace common law remedies unless such an intent is expressly declared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296-97. Furthermore \"[a]ccess to courts guarantees the continuation of common law causes of action [and] may be altered only if there is a reasonable substitution which protects the person protected by the common law remedy.\u201d <em>Id. See also Wolfe v. Massachusetts Port Authority, </em>366 Mass. 417, 319 N.E.2d 423 (1974). The <em>Wolfe </em>Court stated, \u201c[w]hen the bill seeks discovery alone, discovery is available 'in circumstances (a) where the statutory procedure was inadequate to obtain the necessary information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and (b) where the information sought could have been obtained under a pre-1851 bill for discovery\u2019.....Thus, rather than supplanting the bill of discovery, statutory remedies are supplemented by it.\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>at 425.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">. No court has ever enacted a rule that expressly prohibits the entry of an order granting a party the right to enter, etc. the property of a non-party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">. The Maryland Rules do not supercede common law or statute and they shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of any court unless they are in direct conflict with the rules or the rules expressly provide that the rule supercedes the common law or statute.
