Derrick McDonald, appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of possession of a handgun while under the age of twenty-one, in violation of Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 445(e)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends, however, that the age limitation of eighteen, set forth in \u00a7 441(o), should have governed his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">On appeal, McDonald poses two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">I. Was appellant, who was 19 years old at the time of his arrest, improperly charged with and convicted of being a minor in possession of a regulated firearm under Article 27, \u00a7 445(e), when \u00a7 441(o) defines \u201cminor\u201d as any person under the age of 18 years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">II. Was the evidence insufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction of minor in possession of a regulated firearm?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">On July 28, 2000, at approximately 8:00 p.m., Baltimore City Police Officer Earl Thompson was driving an unmarked vehicle in the 1600 block of Hilton Parkway. Thompson noticed a black Acura that had swerved out of its lane on northbound Hilton Parkway. Thompson followed the car for five blocks, until he reached a safe location to stop the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Three people were in the car when it was stopped. Appellant was the only person in the rear seat; he was sitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>behind the front seat passenger. As Thompson spoke with the driver, he noticed that appellant \u201chad his hands between bis legs, as though he was placing something down on the floorboard.\u201d Thompson moved to the other side of the car, where appellant was seated, and looked in. He saw an orange tee shirt and part of the butt of a handgun sticking out between appellant\u2019s feet. The occupants were then removed from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Thompson subsequently recovered a .38 caliber handgun from the floorboard, which contained four live rounds of ammunition. None of the occupants of the car claimed ownership of the weapon. Although Thompson thought that the gun belonged to appellant, he said that \u201cnobody wanted to fess up\u201d to possessing the gun, so each person was charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, appellant told Thompson that he was nineteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The gun was submitted for testing. It was found operable, but no fingerprints were found either on the weapon or on the bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Appellant testified in his own defense. He denied any knowledge of the gun and told the jury that he did not own the orange tee shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Sections 441 and 449 of Article 27 concern the subtitle known as \u201cRegulated Firearms.\u201d Section 441 is titled \u201cDefinitions.\u201d Section 445 is titled \u201cRestrictions on sale, transfer and possession of regulated firearms.\u201d A \u201cregulated firearm\u201d is defined in \u00a7 441(r)(l) as \u201c[a]ny handgun as defined in this section....\u201d As we noted, appellant was convicted of violating \u00a7 445(e)(1). Section 445(e)(1) states that it applies to \u201ca person who is under 21 years of age.\u201d But, for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the subtitle generally, \u00a7 441 (o) defines \u201cminor\u201d as \u201cany person under the age of 18 years.\u201d That statutory discrepancy is at the heart of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Appellant argues that two statutory provisions in Art. 27\u2014 \u00a7 441(o) and \u00a7 445(e)(1) \u2014 contain contradictory definitions of the term \u201cminor.\u201d He contends that he was improperly convicted because he was over the age of eighteen at the time of the incident, and thus was not a minor within the meaning of Article 27, \u00a7 441(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"> Initially, we note that appellant\u2019s statutory attack is not preserved for our review, because it was never advanced below. An argument that is not raised at trial is not preserved for appellate review. Rule 8-131(a); <em>Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 668, 759 A.2d 764 (2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1115, 121 S.Ct. 864, 148 L.Ed.2d 776 (2001); <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 640, 598 A.2d 187 (1991); <em>State v. Funkhouser, </em>140 Md.App. 696, 782 A.2d 387 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Similarly, appellant did not object to the jury instruction that led to his conviction, in which the trial judge said: \u201cThe defendant is charged with possessing a handgun while being under the age of twenty-one. That is the third charge. In order to convict the defendant the State must prove that the defendant possessed the handgun, and I already read the definition, <em>and the defendant was under the age of twenty-</em>one.\u201d (Emphasis added). The failure to object to the applicable jury instruction constitutes a waiver as to any claim of error as to the instruction. <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 167, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 910, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Even if appellant had preserved that contention, we would find no error. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">As we noted, appellant was convicted of violating Article 27, \u00a7 445, concerning \u201cregulated firearms.\u201d In particular, appellant was convicted under \u00a7 445(e)(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">(e) <em>Same </em>\u2014 Minors.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a person who is under 21 years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>age may not possess a regulated firearm or ammunition solely designed for a regulated firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Notwithstanding the applicable age of twenty-one in \u00a7 445(e)(1), appellant relies on \u00a7 441(o), which defines \u201cminor\u201d as \u201cany person under the age of 18 years.\u201d Relying on principles of statutory construction, he argues that the conflicting statutory provisions create an ambiguity that should have been resolved in his favor. We reject appellant\u2019s argument, because we see no ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">To be sure, the two statutory provisions contain different age limitations. But, we need not look beyond the particular provision under which appellant was convicted to ascertain the governing age limitation; the provision in issue contains its own definition of the relevant age. <em>See Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478 (2000); <em>Cianos v. State, </em>338 Md. 406, 411, 659 A.2d 291 (1995) (2000) (applying the statute as it reads); <em>McNeil v. State, </em>356 Md. 396, 404, 739 A.2d 80 (1999) (if statutory language is clear and unambiguous, inquiry ends).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">An important principle of statutory construction is to determine and effectuate the legislative intent. <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 507-08, 784 A.2d 1086 (2001); <em>Board of License Comm\u2019rs v. Toye, </em>354 Md. 116, 122, 729 A.2d 407 (1999); <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423 (1995). Ordinarily, we are guided in this endeavor by the statutory text. <em>Torboli v. Torboli </em>365 Md. 52, 63, 775 A.2d 1207 (2001); <em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088 (1999); <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Generally, we begin with the words of the statute, and give those words their ordinary meaning. <em>Langston, </em>at 507-08, 784 A.2d 1086; <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128 (1998); <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 647-48, 689 A.2d 610 (1997). If a term or provision is ambiguous, we consider the language \u201cin light of the ... objectives and purpose of the enactment,\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986), in order to ascertain the legislative intent. In this regard, \u201c[w]e may ... consider the particular problem or problems the legislature was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>dressing, and the objectives it sought to attain.\u201d <em>Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc. v. Department of Employment &amp; Training, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On the other hand, when the Legislature\u2019s intent is evident from the statutory text, and the statute is not ambiguous, \u201cwe end our inquiry and allow the plain meaning of the statute to govern our interpretation.\u201d <em>Langston, </em>at 508, 784 A.2d 1086; <em>see Martin v. Beverage Capital Corp., </em>353 Md. 388, 399, 726 A.2d 728 (1999). That is the circumstance of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The language of \u00a7 445(e) does not contain a definition of \u201cminor.\u201d Laws of Maryland, 1996, Chapter 561. When the statutory enactment was codified,' additional headings and subheadings were added in publication. In italics, the Code includes the caption of \u201cSame \u2014 Minors,\u201d which precedes the actual text enacted by the Legislature. The addition of this heading does not mean it is part of the legislative enactment. Nor does it change the plain meaning of the text. In this regard, Md.Code (1998 RepLVol.), Article 1, Section 18, is relevant. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">The captions or headlines of the several sections of this Code which are printed in bold type, and the captions or headlines of the several subsections of this Code which are printed in italics or otherwise, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and subsections. They are not to be deemed or taken as titles of the sections and subsections, or as any part thereof; and, unless expressly so provided, they shall not be so deemed or taken when any of such sections and subsections, including the captions or headlines, are amended or reenacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">As we see it, the text of \u00a7 445(e) could not be clearer with regard to the applicable age. Contrary to appellant\u2019s position, the General Assembly did not bar possession of firearms by persons under the age of eighteen. Rather, it expressly prohibited possession of firearms by persons \u201cunder 21 years of age.\u201d The language of that specific section prevails over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the definition of a minor in the general definitions section of the subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Appellant was under twenty-one years of age at the relevant time. It follows that his conviction comported with \u00a7 445(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Appellant contends that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain his conviction for minor in possession of a regulated firearm. First, he argues that the State failed to prove that he was under the age of eighteen when he was arrested. As discussed above, the State was not required to prove that he was under eighteen in order to establish a violation of \u00a7 445(e). Instead, the State was required to prove that appellant was under twenty-one, and it met that burden. Second, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient because the State did not establish that appellant was in possession of the handgun. Because the gun was not found on appellant\u2019s person, he asserts that an inference could have been drawn that the gun belonged to one of the other persons in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Bloodsworth v. State, </em>307 Md. 164, 167, 512 A.2d 1056 (1986). Weighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder. <em>Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 580-581, 583 A.2d 1037 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant was in constructive possession of the weapon. In <em>Price v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 487, 498, 681 A.2d 1206 (1996), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">In a possessory crime or one in which control or dominion over contraband ... constitutes, or is an element of, the <em>actus reus, </em>the law engages in the legal fiction of construe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>tive possession to impute inferentially criminal responsibility....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Court also observed in <em>Price </em>that several factors are relevant \u201cto establish the nexus....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 681 A.2d 1206. These include \u201cthe proximity between the defendant and the contraband and the fact that the contraband was within the view ... of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Officer Thompson testified that he saw appellant put his hands between his legs, as if he was reaching down to place something on the floorboard. Moreover, appellant was the only person in the back seat of the car. The officer saw the butt of a handgun sticking out between appellant\u2019s feet, and appellant was the person closest to the weapon. The jury was surely entitled to credit the officer\u2019s testimony that the gun was found on the floor of the car, between appellant\u2019s feet. From those facts, the jury reasonably could have concluded that appellant possessed the gun and put it on the floor in an attempt to hide it from the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Appellant argues that the inference that the gun belonged to one of the other persons was at least as strong, if not stronger, than the inference that he possessed it. Although the jury could have drawn an inference more favorable to appellant, it was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\">. Appellant was acquitted of the charges of wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun in a vehicle and on his person. When the jury could not reach a verdict on the charge of possession of ammunition for a handgun by a person under 21 years of age, the State dismissed that charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">. The charges were later dismissed against the driver and the other passenger.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
