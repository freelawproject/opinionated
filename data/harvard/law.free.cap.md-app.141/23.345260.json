Courts in two states have entered orders exercising jurisdiction over a custody dispute regarding a single child. Each court rejected a jurisdictional challenge by the non-resident parent. A court in Tennessee, where the child lived with her parents until her mother left the marital home in March 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>concluded that Tennessee is the child\u2019s home state and the most convenient forum to resolve custody issues. Then the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, where the child has lived since her mother left Tennessee, concluded that Maryland is the child\u2019s home state, as well as the place where the first custody complaint was filed and the most convenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">In this interlocutory appeal, we must decide whether the circuit court erred in concluding that Maryland is the home state, and in deciding to exercise jurisdiction even though the Tennessee court already had determined that it would do so. In resolving the latter question, we address the father\u2019s complaint that the mother deliberately misled him in order to prevent him from seeking custody in Tennessee during the six-month period that the child\u2019s home state was undisputedly Tennessee, not Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">David Gruber, appellant, and Kathie M. Gruber, appellee, lived together in Tennessee for approximately one year before they married in Memphis, on November 23, 1998. On May 5, 1999, their daughter Katarina was born, also in Memphis. The family lived together until March 18, 2000. On that day, Ms. Gruber left the marital home with ten-month-old Katari-na. At that time, Ms. Gruber was not ready to talk to Mr. Gruber about certain issues. She testified that when Mr. Gruber asked when she would be ready, they agreed that it would be around the time of her birthday, which was approximately six months away.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Ms. Gruber returned to Maryland, where she had previously lived. She and Katarina arrived on March 21, 2000. She had family members in Maryland, including her ten-year-old son, who was then living with her first husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The Grubers continued to correspond about their relationship. Ms. Gruber preferred e-mail communication because she felt that Mr. Gruber could not monopolize it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Mr. Gruber testified that from the time Ms. Gruber left Tennessee in March until late September, she continued to hold out the possibility of a reconciliation. He cited e-mail exchanges in June as evidence that Ms. Gruber asked him to be patient while she decided whether she wanted to stay in the marriage, and that she promised that she was not \u201cstringing him along,\u201d all in an effort to dissuade him from seeking custody of Katarina during the six months after she arrived in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">In a June 17, 2000 e-mail, Mr. Gruber pressed Ms. Gruber for some indication of whether he should abandon his hope of reconciliation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">I don\u2019t see the problems as insurmountable, yet. It would be a long row to hoe, to be sure, but doable, at least at this point. But it would take two, and time is running out---[You] appear to still be stuck where you were when you left 3]\u00e9 months ago. I don\u2019t see any miraculous breakthroughs happening in the <em>2lk </em>months left in your self-imposed timeout, if ever. We\u2019re past the half way point, and we\u2019ve got Zippo good stuff going on, with no prospects or interest from you, indicated. I think we could still have something good together, if you spoke up RIGHT NOW, and told me you wanted to TRY to make something together, and we started working towards it. Only you know whether that\u2019s what you want to do, or not. All I\u2019m trying to say, is, NOW is the time to speak up, if you are ever going to do it. I\u2019ve had enough heartache, and I\u2019m ready to go on my life, with or without you in it. I want you to know that I miss you, and would REALLY like you to be a part of my life, but am ready to have a happy life without you, if that\u2019s what you choose to do. I can\u2019t make that choice for you, that\u2019s something only you can do. Right now you can choose to speak up, or choose to do nothing, and that will determine where things go. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On June 18, Mr. Gruber sent a follow up e-mail, specifically asking whether he had any reason to wait before filing \u201cdivorce papers.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>I have to confess being a bit concerned that I haven\u2019t heard from you in a while. In an earlier email, you said you weren\u2019t ignoring me, but it kind of looks that way. Maybe you\u2019ve been busy, or maybe it\u2019s something else. I would like to know why I haven\u2019t heard from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">If you have issues about us, there is still time to discuss them, and work something out, at least for a little' while longer. If you\u2019ve decided that you aren\u2019t interested in an \u201cus\u201d, then I deserve to know that, too, so I can go ahead and file the divorce papers, and not prolong this any longer than necessary. Lastly, if you aren\u2019t sure, you need to let me know just where you are at, so we can figure out TOGETHER where to go next. Your shields are WAY up, and you aren\u2019t letting me see anything.... I have more at stake in this deal, than anyone else in the whole world! I\u2019m fighting for me, I\u2019m- fighting for you, and most of all, I\u2019m fighting for Kat to have a family! (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In a June 19 reply, Ms. Gruber told him that she was not yet ready to answer , his questions, and that he should not expect an answer any time before six mbnths from when she left Tennessee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">You continue to ask the question I can\u2019t answer. I have told you repeatedly I am not prepared to answer the question now, that I *guessed* I\u2019d need the 6 months, and that it\u2019s looking like at least that much is the case. But you were pressing me less than a month after I left. I am working intensely on me; finding a job, place to live, setting up counseling.... I am NOT where I was when I left, AND I can\u2019t answer your question with the sort of information I had hoped to have when asked it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">If YOU can\u2019t wait that long, and you DO need to do what you need to for you. I will answer the question, prepared or not, at that 6 month mark, unless I KNOW something sooner. Right now, I\u2019m still reacting to you, so I know I haven\u2019t got what it takes to work on \u201cus\u201d if I wanted to. It wouldn\u2019t be a healthy move....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>I don\u2019t mean to string you along. I have said, and I\u2019ll say again, I do NOT wish to commit to filing until I can work through some of these issues. I don\u2019t want to do something I regret. AND, I still feel everything I have said. That I can\u2019t change you and I can\u2019t live with your ways. And away from [my son]. I haven\u2019t waffled about this. I\u2019ve been a broken record. It\u2019s NOT that I\u2019ve been stuck; I guess it\u2019s that I\u2019m not yet strong enough to be able to even Choose a yes answer. I\u2019m still reacting into the \u201cno\u201d zone. I have no idea how long it will take; 6 months was a guess....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">Anyway, if you need to file, you need to. I understand about the limbo. But, please, stand by your own previous words where you said it\u2019s up to me to say something, to initiate. You have never been patient.... I feel pressured and everything takes a step backward....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">I\u2019ll try to communicate better, but, ... I have been doing the best I can! (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">What Ms. Gruber did not say in this correspondence was that she already had filed a complaint seeking sole custody of Katarina. Twelve days before her June 19 e-mail, on June 7, 2000, she filed a complaint against Mr. Gruber,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asking the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to award her \u201csole legal and primary physical custody\u201d on the grounds that she had been Katarina\u2019s primary caretaker and was \u201ca fit and proper person to have custody of the parties\u2019 child.\u201d She alleged that \u201cit is in the best interest of the child ... that this Court assume jurisdiction,\u201d but did not state that Katarina had been living in Maryland for only eleven weeks. Instead, she asserted a \u201csubstantial contacts\u201d basis for jurisdiction\u2014 that \u201c[t]here is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Ms. Gruber maintained her silence about her custody complaint in her subsequent correspondence with Mr. Gruber. She did not mention it in her e-mail of June 30, in which she discussed arrangements for Mr. Gruber to come to Maryland for a visit with Katarina, and again emphasized that his inquiries about her intentions would drive her away.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Let me say it AGAIN, maybe in different words. I do NOT want to connect at this time. I am AFRAID to because I am STILL reacting to you.... You ARE pushing, have been pushing, keep pushing, won\u2019t stop pushing, causing me to want to increase the distance and CREATING stress that has otherwise eased incredibly. You continue to ask the \u201cus\u201d question when I tell you the answer is \u201cno,\u201d because you\u2019re asking now. I HAVE NO FUTURE GUARANTEES, but I guarantee that your asking now will get a no. If that means that the options aren\u2019t open, in your mind, then I can do nothing about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Nor did she mention it during Mr. Gruber\u2019s ensuing visit with Katarina.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Ms. Gruber waited until September 26, five days after the six-month anniversary of Katarina\u2019s arrival in Maryland, to advise Mr. Gruber that she did not intend to reconcile. In a single sentence e-mail, Ms. Gruber informed Mr. Gruber that \u201c[a]s the 6 months are up, and you deserve the answer, I still realize that I can\u2019t be in a relationship, therefore I\u2019ve seen a lawyer to draw up papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">On the previous day, Ms. Gruber had signed an amended complaint seeking both divorce and custody, and adding an allegation that Katarina had resided in Maryland \u201ccontinuously for at least six months.\u201d The amended complaint was filed on October 11, 2000, and served on Mr. Gruber on October 14, 2000, while he was in Maryland making an unsuccessful attempt to visit Katarina. He testified that it was only after he was served that he discovered Ms. Gruber had filed for custody in Maryland, just seven weeks after she and Katarina left Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Immediately upon his return to Tennessee, on October 18, 2000, Mr. Gruber filed a complaint for divorce and custody, in which he alleged that the separation occurred on September 29, 2000. While Mr. Gruber\u2019s petition for pendente lite custody was pending in the Tennessee court, the parties discussed a consensual resolution of custody pending resolution of the continuing jurisdictional dispute. On November 2, they appeared in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court to put on the record a pendente lite agreement regarding custody and visitation. That agreement explicitly preserved the jurisdictional dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">On November 9, 2000, the Circuit Court of Shelby County, Tennessee exercised jurisdiction to adjudicate the question of Katarina\u2019s custody. It entered an ex parte order giving Mr. Gruber temporary custody and ordering Ms. Gruber to return Katarina to Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The Tennessee order, however, did not resolve the dispute in Maryland. In an order dated November 16, 2000, Judge Cawood recounted the parties\u2019 judicial skirmishes in Maryland during the preceding two weeks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also noted that Mr. Gruber had indicated to authorities that he intended to come to Maryland and take the child, pursuant to the Tennessee court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On November 20, the court entered a Consent Order that the Grubers would share joint legal custody, and that Ms. Gruber would have temporary physical custody, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>subject to a specific visitation schedule through February 2001. By separate order dated November 21, Judge Cawood denied Mr. Gruber\u2019s motion for an immediate hearing on jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The next week, on November 29, the Tennessee court held a hearing regarding the jurisdictional and pendente lite issues raised by Mr. Gruber\u2019s petition. By order dated December 1, 2000, the Tennessee court held that it had \u201csubject matter and in personam jurisdiction to adjudicate this cause as Tennessee is the home state of the minor child.... \u201d It also ordered the parties to submit to \u201ca custodial and psychological evaluation\u201d with a court-appointed psychologist, scheduled a final hearing on custody for December 18, 2000, and extended its ex parte orders until that time. Once again, it ordered Ms. Gruber \u201cto forthwith return the minor child to her home in Shelby County, Tennessee where said child shall remain until further orders of the court.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Katarina, however, remained in Maryland with her mother, who continued her efforts to persuade Judge Cawood to assert jurisdiction. On January 5, 2001, the Anne Arundel Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing regarding its jurisdiction over the custody dispute. In a January 16 written order, the court rejected Mr. Gruber\u2019s argument that the six-month period necessary to establish home state jurisdiction began only after Ms. Gruber notified him of her intent not to reconcile, because a contrary rule would require \u201ca mini-merits hearing in most jurisdictional cases.\u201d It concluded that Maryland became Katarina\u2019s home state six months after she arrived with her mother. The remaining issue was whether Maryland or Tennessee was the most convenient forum under FL \u00a7 9-207. The court reserved its decision on that question pending further discussion with the Tennessee judge. The court expressed its hope that the two courts could agree on \u201cwhat state is appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In March 2001, counsel for both Mr. Gruber and Ms. Gruber requested that the circuit court make a decision about whether it would decline to exercise jurisdiction on forum non conve-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>niens grounds. Mr. Gruber\u2019s counsel also advised the court that the Tennessee court recently had entered a Final Decree of Divorce, dated nunc pro tunc to January 31, 2001, after finding again that Tennessee was the most convenient forum for litigating the custody dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">In response, the Anne Arundel court issued a March 20 written opinion stating that it \u201cwill try the case.\u201d After a review hearing at which counsel for both parties appeared, the court entered a March 30, 2001 order. \u201cBased on the Opinion of March 20 ... this Court assume[s] jurisdiction of this matter.\u201d Mr. Gruber then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Throughout the Maryland proceedings, Mr. Gruber consistently argued that Ms. Gruber \u201cacquired the residency time in Maryland ... through fraud and deception towards me, and so should not be allowed to reap benefits from those reprehensible actions.... \u201d He reiterates that argument here, complaining that the trial court erred in failing to consider Ms. Gruber\u2019s deceptive conduct in determining that the six months Katarina lived in Maryland were sufficient to establish Maryland as the child\u2019s home state. In addition, he argues that the trial court erred in failing to treat the child\u2019s presence in Maryland from March through at least June 7 (when Ms. Gruber filed for custody) as a \u201ctemporary absence from Tennessee.\u201d He correctly characterizes both questions as \u201cmatters of first impression in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Ms. Gruber counters that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider parental uncertainties regarding reconciliation as the yardstick by which the length of a child\u2019s home state residency should be measured. She also argues that, in the absence of any proof of a wrongful taking, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to exercise jurisdiction over the custody dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">For the reasons that follow, we agree that in deciding to exercise home state jurisdiction, the trial court erred in failing to consider the substantial evidence that Ms. Gruber obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the six-month residency for Katarina by misrepresentations that Mr. Gruber relied upon to his detriment. We do not agree, however, that the trial court was required to treat the time between Katarina\u2019s departure from Tennessee and Mr. Gruber\u2019s realization that the marriage was over as \u201ca temporary absence\u201d from Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Motion To Dismiss Interlocutory Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Preliminarily, we must address Ms. Gruber\u2019s motion to dismiss this interlocutory appeal. She argues that the appeal is premature because the circuit court\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">March 30, 2001 order does not deprive [Mr. Gruber] of the custody or care of his child, nor change the terms of such an order. Rather, the Order assumes jurisdiction in order to reach an initial custody decision. [Mr. Gruber\u2019s] accepting the benefit of <em>pendente lite </em>visitation and evaluation orders of the Maryland court should result in dismissal of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">We reject the notion that Mr. Gruber\u2019s November 2000 appearance and consent to a temporary custody and visitation order by the circuit court estopped him from challenging the court\u2019s subsequent decision to exercise jurisdiction. The record shows that Mr. Gruber preserved his jurisdictional objections. After listening to the tapes of that hearing, the circuit court explicitly ordered \u201cthat this Consent Order is without prejudice to any argument pertaining to jurisdiction.\u201d So it was, both in the circuit court and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">We conclude that Mr. Gruber\u2019s appeal is authorized under Md.Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), section 12-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which provides that \u201c[a] party may appeal from ... [a]n [interlocutory] order .... [depriving a parent ... of the care and custody of his child, or changing the terms of such an order.\u201d In the unusual circumstances of this case, a Maryland court decided to exercise jurisdiction over a child custody dispute that was already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the subject of another court\u2019s pendente lite order giving one parent certain custodial and visitation rights. The Maryland court did so in order to address the very same pendente lite and permanent custody issues. We conclude that the Maryland court\u2019s decision to exercise home state jurisdiction was an appealable interlocutory order that changed the terms of a child custody and visitation order, because the effect of that decision was to render the Tennessee court\u2019s pendente lite order unenforceable in the state where Mr. Gruber sought to enforce it. The March 30 order of the circuit court prevented Mr. Gruber from enforcing his rights under the pendente lite order of the Tennessee court, thereby depriving Mr. Gruber of the pendente lite care and custody of Katarina that he enjoyed under the Tennessee order. We hold that the circuit court\u2019s order falls within the purview of section 12-303(3)(x), and is an appealable interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Maryland Court\u2019s Exercise Of Home State Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">One purpose of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (\u201cUCCJA\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is to prevent parents battling over the custody of their children from engaging in the type of forum shopping that prolongs custody disputes and breeds parental resistance to custody orders. \u201cIt is well known that those who lose a court battle over custody are often unwilling to accept the judgment of the court. They will remove the child in an unguarded moment or fail to return him after a visit and will seek their luck in the court of a distant state where they hope to find ... a more sympathetic ear for their plea for custody.\u201d <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>64 Md.App. 154, 160, 494 A.2d 737 (1985) (quoting UCCJA, 9 U.L.A. Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note at 111-12 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">To avoid forum shopping and to promote both finality and acceptance of child custody orders, \u201call 50 states and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>District of Columbia have adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.\u201d <em>Gestl v. Frederick, </em>133 Md.App. 216, 224, 754 A.2d 1087 (2000). In Maryland, the UCCJA is codified at Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 9-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) (the \u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">To avoid judicial turf wars, the Act establishes ground .rules for determining which court should exercise jurisdiction over a child custody dispute. <em>See Gestl, </em>133 Md.App. at 225, 754 A.2d 1087. Although there are four alternative bases for exercising jurisdiction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the state with \u201chome state jurisdiction\u201d generally has priority. <em>See id. </em>at 226, 754 A.2d 1087. The Act provides that a court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination. by initial decree ... if ... [that state] is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding ..., or ... had been the child\u2019s home state within 6 months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from [that] state because of the child\u2019s removal ... by ... a [parent] claiming custody ..., and [that] parent ... continues to live in that state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(l). A child\u2019s home state is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKu\">the state in which the child, immediately preceding the time involved, lived with the child\u2019s parents [or] a parent.... for at least 6 consecutive months.... Periods of temporary absence of any of the named persons are counted as part of the 6 month ... period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">FL \u00a7 9-201(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Thus, even after the child leaves a state, that state remains the home state for another six months. The purpose of this \u201cextended home state jurisdiction\u201d is \u201cto protect a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>parent who has been left by his spouse taking the child along. The provision makes clear that the stay-at-home parent, if he acts promptly, may start proceedings in his own state if he desires, without the necessity of attempting to base jurisdiction on [the child\u2019s significant contacts with that state].\u201d UCCJA \u00a7 3 comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">When it becomes apparent that a proceeding concerning the custody of a child is pending in a court in another jurisdiction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a Maryland court must determine whether to exercise jurisdiction. <em>See Paltrow v. Paltrow, </em>37 Md.App. 191, 196, 376 A.2d 1134 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>283 Md. 291, 388 A.2d 547 (1978). Except in emergencies, a court \u201cshall not exercise its jurisdiction under this subtitle if, at the time of filing the petition, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child was pending in a court of another state exercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this subtitle, unless the proceeding is stayed by the court of the other state because this State is a more appropriate forum or for other reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> FL \u00a7 9-206(a). Once the court is aware of a pending custody proceeding in another state, \u201cit shall direct an inquiry to the state court administrator or other appropriate official of the other state.\u201d FL \u00a7 9-206(b). Depending upon when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>respective custody petitions were filed, and whether one of the states already has assumed jurisdiction, the two courts may be able to agree upon which state is the more appropriate forum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">If the court is informed during the course of the proceeding that a proceeding concerning the custody of the child was pending in another state before the court assumed jurisdiction, it shall stay the proceeding and communicate with the court in which the other proceeding is pending to the end that the issue may be litigated in the more appropriate forum and that information be exchanged....

A temporary restraining order regarding pendente lite custody and visitation is a \u201cproceeding\u201d under the Act. <em>See Cronin v.

In January 2001, the court concluded that Maryland became Katarina\u2019s home state six months after she arrived with her mother. In March, the court decided to exercise home state jurisdiction for the following reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">The child here is very young.

We believe that is dispositive here and will try the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Mr. Gruber complains that the trial court erred (1) in concluding that it had home state jurisdiction, because a portion of Katarina\u2019s first six months in Maryland was merely a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d from Tennessee; and (2) in \u201crejecting] the notion that [Ms. Gruber\u2019s] deceptive tactics had any bearing on whether she had successfully acquired Maryland jurisdiction____\u201d We shall address these questions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u201cTemporary Absence\u201d Caused By Marital Separation</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In its January findings, the Anne Arundel court observed that the Act \u201cdeals primarily with physical presence,\u201d and that \u201cjurisdiction will attach unless there is some factor other than time which is controlling.\u201d It concluded that Maryland had home state jurisdiction because Katarina\u2019s residency in Maryland since March satisfied the six month test. In doing so, it explicitly rejected Mr. Gruber\u2019s argument that Katarina\u2019s Maryland residency \u201cwas only temporary because [Mr. Gru-ber] held out the hopes [Ms. Gruber] might come home\u201d along with Katarina. That reasoning, the court explained, would require courts to \u201cstart this six month clock when the marriage appeared irretrievably broken.\u201d Determining that date would require an inappropriate \u201cmini-merits hearing in most jurisdictional cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Mr. Gruber argues that the circuit court erred by predicating its finding that Maryland was Katarina\u2019s home state on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>six months she spent here between March and September 2000. He contends that her \u201cpresence in Maryland was a temporary absence from Tennessee\u201d until sometime in June, which is the earliest date that he might have realized Ms. Gruber intended to stay in Maryland with Katarina.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In Mr. Gruber\u2019s view, \u201cTennessee was still the child\u2019s home state when\u201d he filed his complaint for custody in Tennessee on October 18, 2000, less than six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Ms. Gruber counters that the circuit court properly made its home state determination without excluding any time during which Mr. Gruber failed to realize the \u201cnon-temporary nature\u201d of Ms. Gruber\u2019s move to Maryland. Moreover, she points out, even if the court had considered \u201cthe parties\u2019 intent and any agreement between them,\u201d that \u201cwould not affect the result here\u201d because \u201cthere was no agreement between the parties that [Ms. Gruber\u2019s] move with Katarina would be temporary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The Act does not define \u201ctemporary absence.\u201d Nor is there any Maryland case law construing that term. Mr. Gruber relies on extra-jurisdictional cases holding that a court may determine whether a child\u2019s absence from her home state was temporary by examining the parents\u2019 mutual understanding about both the reasons for the child\u2019s presence in another state, and the anticipated duration of that residency. He cites the majority opinion of a divided Illinois appellate court in <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>255 Ill.App.3d 1099, 193 Ill.Dec. 1, 625 N.E.2d 1122 (1993), which held that the \u201ctemporary absence\u201d clause covered eleven months that a child spent in Illinois in order to attend school, with the permission of both parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The <em>Richardson </em>majority rejected a strict physical presence analysis. <em>Id. </em>193 Ill.Dec. 1, 625 N.E.2d at 1124. \u201cIn deciding whether a child \u2018lived\u2019 in a particular state for purposes of determining whether that state qualifies as the child\u2019s home state, a court must not only examine whether the child was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>physically in that state, but1 also, under what circumstances the child came to and remained in the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When, as in that case, the parents agreed that the child\u2019s presence in the new state was for a specific period and reason \u2014 for the school year \u2014 the child\u2019s absence from her home state could not be counted toward the six months necessary to establish home state jurisdiction. Mr. Gruber points out that other courts have adopted <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Howard, </em>291 Ill.App.3d 675, 225 Ill.Dec. 703, 684 N.E.2d 178, 181 (1997); <em>In re Frost, </em>289 Ill.App.3d 95, 224 Ill.Dec. 409, 681 N.E.2d 1030, 1035-36 (1997); <em>In re S. M., </em>938 S.W.2d 910, 918 (Mo.App.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Ms. Gruber counters that the better rule is the one announced in the <em>Richardson </em>concurring opinion, which rejected the reasoning of the majority, concluding instead that Illinois had become the child\u2019s home state six months after she arrived for the school year. <em>See Richardson, </em>193 Ill.Dec. 1, 625 N.E.2d at 1127. It criticized the majority\u2019s \u201copen-ended definition\u201d of \u201ctemporary absence,\u201d because it would render the six-month statutory benchmark \u201cvirtually meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather than straining to conclude that Illinois was not a home state, the preferable analytical framework would be to conclude that Illinois had become the child\u2019s second home state, and then proceed to determine whether Illinois should decline to exercise its home state jurisdiction under principles of <em>forum non conveniens. Id. </em>193 Ill.Dec. 1, 625 N.E.2d at 1128. Under that analysis, \u201cIllinois [was] the least convenient forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>193 Ill.Dec. 1, 625 N.E.2d at 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Mr. Gruber argues that instead of following the majority in <em>Richardson, </em>the circuit court approved and applied the reasoning of the concurring opinion, which was followed in another Illinois case that the circuit court also cited as persuasive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Whether a court should decide home state jurisdiction by inquiring into the parents\u2019 intentions regarding the child\u2019s move raises an issue that Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have not yet addressed. This case, however, does not require us to answer that question, because even under a \u201cparental intent\u201d standard, Mr. Gruber has not shown that the trial court erred in finding that Katarina\u2019s presence in Maryland from March to June was not merely a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d from Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We may not reverse a court\u2019s determination that it has home state jurisdiction under the Act unless the findings of fact upon which it was based were clearly erroneous. <em>See Gestl v. Frederick, </em>133 Md.App. 216, 231, 754 A.2d 1087 (2000). Here, the court made a factual finding that when Ms. Gruber and Katarina left Tennessee in March, \u201cthere was an intent to separate, and the child clearly went to Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We find substantial evidence in the record to support that finding. The record shows that Ms. Gruber departed Tennessee with Katarina in order to take a \u201ctime-out\u201d from the marriage, during which she considered whether to end it or to reconcile. Both parents acknowledged that Ms. Gruber\u2019s departure from Tennessee might not be temporary. Given that Katarina\u2019s departure was directly related to Ms. Gruber\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>departure, the nature of Katarina\u2019s move to Maryland was similarly uncertain. There was no evidence that both parents agreed that Katarina\u2019s move to Maryland was for some inherently \u201ctemporary\u201d purpose. Nor was there any evidence that both parents agreed that the duration of Katarina\u2019s residency would be for a particular length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Even when viewed under the legal standard most favorable to Mr. Gruber, and in the factual light most favorable to Mr. Gruber, we cannot say that Katarina\u2019s presence in Maryland was simply a \u201ctemporary absence\u201d from Tennessee. The circuit court\u2019s finding that Katarina began living in Maryland upon her arrival was not clearly erroneous. That finding led the court to conclude that Maryland had become Katarina\u2019s home state during the time that Ms. Gruber\u2019s initial custody petition was pending, but not disclosed to Mr. Gruber. Based on that conclusion, the court decided that, as a home state forum where the first custody petition was filed, it would exercise jurisdiction to decide the custody dispute. We examine that decision to exercise jurisdiction next.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Deception Inducing Forbearance During The Six-Month Residency Period</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">As we see it, this jurisdictional conflict between Maryland and Tennessee comes down to one troubling issue: whether the circuit court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction because Ms. Gruber deceived Mr. Gruber into forbearing from legal action during the six month period that Katarina\u2019s only home state was Tennessee. The record contains substantial evidence that might support a finding that Ms. Gruber engaged in deliberate concealment and deception in order to obtain home state jurisdiction in Maryland. There was evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">\u2022 Ms. Gruber was aware of the six-month residency requirement for establishing home state jurisdiction. She obtained legal advice about seeking court-ordered custody of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Katarina, including an explanation of the six-month benchmark for home state jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">\u2022 At the time Ms. Gruber filed her initial custody complaint, on June 7, 2000, Katarina\u2019s home state was still Tennessee. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9 \u2014 201(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u2022 During the next three and a half months, Ms. Gruber continued to communicate with Mr. Gruber, via e-mail and when he traveled to Maryland to visit Katarina, but never told him that she had filed a custody complaint against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u2022 During this period, Mr. Gruber expressed a desire to proceed with filing legal papers if Ms. Gruber decided she did not want to reconcile. In response, Ms. Gruber asked Mr. Gruber to \u201cbe patient\u201d for a six-month period while she decided whether to reconcile, and warned him that she would not reconcile if he filed before she made that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u2022 Ms. Gruber promised Mr. Gruber that she was not stringing him along and that she would let him know as soon as she knew what she wanted to do about their marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\u2022 Ms. Gruber finally told Mr. Gruber that she did not wish to reconcile on September 26, five days after Katarina reached the six-month residency benchmark, and one day after she signed an amended complaint asserting home state jurisdiction based on that residency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Citing this evidence, Mr. Gruber complained to the circuit court that throughout the six-month period between Ms. Gru-ber\u2019s arrival in Maryland (March 21) and her \u201cfinal answer\u201d about reconciliation (September 26), Ms. Gruber \u201cactively discouraged [Mr. Gruber] from filing suit in Tennessee, ... claiming that she needed as much as six months away from him in order to decide whether she. wanted to reconcile.\u201d He testified that Ms. Gruber persuaded him to forbear from filing for custody in Tennessee during the six months after she left Tennessee, by warning him that if he \u201cpushed\u201d her to give a final answer during that period, or filed legal papers himself, the reconciliation he hoped for would not occur. These repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>sentations, he argued, were misleading both in what they said <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cI do NOT wish to commit to filing until I can work through some of these issues\u201d) and what they did not say <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cBut I already have filed for custody, in Maryland\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In its January 16 written \u201cfindings\u201d after the evidentiary hearing, the circuit court recognized that Ms. Gruber \u201cheld out some hopes that [she and Mr. Gruber] might reunite, quite possibly to avoid a confrontation, or to establish jurisdiction.\u201d Nevertheless, it \u201csaw no reason to go beyond the six month test\u201d in deciding that Maryland had become Katarina\u2019s home state. Later, in its March 30 decision, the court decided to exercise home state jurisdiction without addressing the possibility that Ms. Gruber\u2019s conduct might be a reason for declining to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">On appeal, Mr. Gruber argues that the court erred by treating the home state finding as dispositive, instead of considering whether jurisdiction should be declined by reason of Ms. Gruber\u2019s reprehensible conduct. This argument raises two legal issues: (1) whether the type of fraudulent conduct that Ms. Gruber allegedly committed constitutes \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d under section 9-208(a), and (2) whether the circuit court erred by failing to consider whether it should decline to exercise jurisdiction due to Ms. Gruber\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The Use Of Deception To Obtain Home State Jurisdiction Is \u201cReprehensible Conduct\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">In <em>Gestl v. Frederick, </em>133 Md.App. 216, 754 A.2d 1087 (2000), we recently affirmed that \u201c[g]enerally, a \u2018home state\u2019 should be the jurisdiction to hear and decide custody disputes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 754 A.2d 1087. Nevertheless, we also recognized that Maryland courts may be \u201cprecluded from exercising jurisdiction\u201d for other reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 227, 754 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>A.2d 1087. In particular, we cautioned that when a custody-action is pending in another state, a Maryland court must determine whether it should exercise its home state jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In doing so, the court must consider the resident parent\u2019s conduct. Section 9-208(a) authorizes the court to decline jurisdiction when that jurisdiction results from the petitioning parent\u2019s misconduct: \u201cIf the petitioner for an initial decree has wrongfully taken the child from another state or has engaged in <em>similar reprehensible conduct, </em>the court may decline to exercise jurisdiction if this is just and proper under the circumstances.\u201d FL \u00a7 9-208(a) (emphasis added). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that fraudulent or intentionally misleading conduct may be \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d warranting a refusal to exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We have not found a reported Maryland opinion involving reprehensible conduct other than the wrongful taking or concealment of a child. <em>See, e.g., Cronin v. Camilleri, </em>101 Md.App. 699, 709-10, 648 A.2d 694 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 166, 661 A.2d 700 (1995) (father\u2019s wrongful removal of children from Maryland to avoid court ordered appearance was reprehensible); <em>Malik v. Malik, </em>99 Md.App. 521, 532-33, 638 A.2d 1184 (1994) (mother\u2019s wrongful taking and retention of child was reprehensible); <em>cf. Etter v. Etter, </em>43 Md.App. 395, 405, 405 A.2d 760 (1979) (mother\u2019s justified taking of child was not reprehensible). We note that courts in other states, including Tennessee, have found conduct other than \u201cchild stealing\u201d sufficiently reprehensible to decline jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Stokes v. Stokes, </em>751 P.2d 1363, 1365-66 (Alaska 1988) (mother\u2019s dismissal of petition in another state and removal of child to Alaska without notice to the father justified dismissal of her petition); <em>Marcus v. Marcus, </em>993 S.W.2d 596, 602-03 (Tenn.1999) (mother\u2019s violations of child custody orders in North Carolina warranted dismissal of her Tennessee petition for custody); <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>847 S.W.2d 496, 506 (Tenn.1993) (father\u2019s violation of visitation order precludes any petition for modification of custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>But none of these cases involved the alleged misconduct at issue in this case \u2014 the use of deception to obtain home state jurisdiction. Thus, we must determine whether section 9-208(a) required the court to consider whether Ms. Gruber engaged in deceptive conduct that should not be rewarded by the exercise of Maryland jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">As we do in construing any statute, we look to the language and purpose of section 9-208(a). The Act does not explicitly define \u201creprehensible conduct,\u201d but does implicitly recognize that conduct other than the wrongful taking or retention of a child may warrant a refusal to exercise jurisdiction. The ordinary meaning of \u201creprehensible\u201d is \u201c[djeserving rebuke or censure; blameworthy.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, </em>4th ed. (2000). Synonyms include \u201ccensurable, culpable, guilty.\u201d <em>See Roget\u2019s II: The New Thesaurus, </em>3d ed. (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The commissioners who drafted this section of the UCCJA described reprehensible conduct in terms of the established doctrine that equity will not assist a complainant who has gained an advantage by fraudulent means. <em>See Townsend v. Morgan, </em>192 Md. 168, 174-75, 63 A.2d 743 (1949). In the official comment, they explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\"><em>[sjubsection (a) extends the clean hands principle to cases in which a custody decree has not yet been rendered in any state. </em>... \u201cWrongfully\u201d taking under this subsection does not mean that a \u201cright\u201d has been violated... but that <em>one party\u2019s conduct is so objectionable that a court in the exercise of its inherent equity powers cannot in good conscience permit that party access to its jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\"><em>See UCCJA </em>\u00a7 8 comment (emphasis added). In a similar vein, this Court has characterized the analogous provision in section 9-208(b), relating to petitions for modification, as being directed at \u201ccase[s] in which [a parent] seeks the assistance of the Maryland courts to legitimize improper conduct on his [or her] part.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>64 Md.App. at 164, 494 A.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Fraud traditionally has been the type of \u201cblameworthy,\u201d \u201ccensurable,\u201d and \u201cobjectionable\u201d conduct that courts will not aid.

Impala Sales (USA), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 322, 389 A.2d 887 (1978) (citations omitted). Through the doctrine of unclean hands, courts avoid endorsing or rewarding fraudulent conduct. <em>See, e.g., Manown v. Adams, </em>89 Md.App. 503, 511, 598 A.2d 821 (1991), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>328 Md. 463, 615 A.2d 611 (1992) (\u201cthe idea being that judicial integrity is endangered when judicial powers are interposed to aid persons whose very presence before a court is the result of some fraud or inequity'\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Based on both the language of the statute and the drafters\u2019 intent, we conclude that fraudulent conduct designed to obtain child custody jurisdiction constitutes \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d within the meaning of section 9-208(a). Section 9-208(a) is targeted at \u201cthose situations where jurisdiction exists because of the unjustified conduct of the person seeking to invoke it,\u201d <em>Child Custody &amp; Visitation, supra, </em>App. 3C-43, whether the misconduct is the wrongful taking of a child or the wrongful deception of the other parent. This construction is also consistent with the Act\u2019s direction that it \u201cshall be construed to promote the general purposes\u201d stated in the Act. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 9-202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">One critical goal of the UCCJA is to avoid the ills resulting from forum shopping, including the type of jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>deadlock we see in this case. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 9-202(a)(l). When a mother misrepresents and conceals material information in order to persuade a father to refrain from initiating custody proceedings during the six-month period when he easily could have obtained extended home state jurisdiction, her conduct is precisely the type of bad faith forum shopping that the UCCJA seeks to deter. Treating deception that creates home state jurisdiction as \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d ensures that the deceptive parent will not gain an advantage from such objectionable conduct. By declining to reward fraudulent tactics used to obtain home state jurisdiction, courts discourage forum shopping and its concomitant ills. <em>See Malik, </em>99 Md.App. at 531, 638 A.2d 1184 (exercising jurisdiction created by parent\u2019s wrongful taking of child \u201cwould only encourage such behavior\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">They also protect the stay-at-home parent\u2019s opportunity to obtain extended home state jurisdiction by filing for custody within six months of the child\u2019s departure from the family home. \u201cExtended home state\u201d jurisdiction is an important \u201cequalizer\u201d for the stay-at-home parent, because it \u201cmitigate[s] the advantage enjoyed by the party who has physical possession of the child.\u201d <em>Malik, </em>99 Md.App. at 529, 638 A.2d 1184; <em>see </em>UCCJA \u00a7 3 comment. Allowing a departed parent to prevent the stay-at-home parent from obtaining extended home state jurisdiction through fraudulent conduct would defeat this feature of the UCCJA, and consequently invite the \u201cwin the race to the courthouse at any cost\u201d tactics that the UCCJA seeks to prevent. <em>See </em>1 <em>Child Custody &amp; Jurisdiction, supra, </em>at App. 3C-43 (\u201cIf the conduct that creates the jurisdiction is unjustified, courts must decline to exercise jurisdiction that is inappropriately invoked by one of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">We hold that deception directly resulting in the establishment of home state jurisdiction is reprehensible conduct that may be \u201cso objectionable that a court in the exercise of its inherent equity powers cannot in good conscience permit that party access to its jurisdiction.\u201d UCCJA \u00a7 8 comment; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>FL \u00a7 9-208(a). Now we must apply that holding to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The Court Erred In Failing To Consider Whether To Decline Jurisdiction Based On Ms. Gruber\u2019s Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision to exercise home state jurisdiction, we must determine whether the court correctly followed the applicable law, and whether it abused its discretion in applying it. <em>See Gestl, </em>133 Md.App. at 229, 754 A.2d 1087. Here, the circuit court explained that it had decided to exercise jurisdiction because Maryland became Katarina\u2019s home state. In its March order, the court explicitly stated that there was no factual basis for declining jurisdiction on the basis of a wrongful taking. It concluded that in the absence of any evidence that Ms. Gruber wrongfully took the child from Tennessee, it would treat Maryland\u2019s status as the home state where the first custody petition was filed as \u201cdispositive.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">What the court failed to do in its March order, however, was to address the alternative possibility that it had raised in its January findings \u2014 that Ms. Gruber knowingly deceived Mr. Gruber in a successful effort \u201cto obtain jurisdiction.\u201d Although the circuit court made a factual finding that Ms. Gruber did not obtain jurisdiction in Maryland by wrongfully taking Katarina from Tennessee, it did not make any finding about whether she obtained jurisdiction by intentionally deceiving Mr. Gruber into forbearing from legal action during the six months that Tennessee was still Katarina\u2019s home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">We agree with Mr. Gruber that the circuit court erred in failing to consider whether Ms. Gruber\u2019s representations and nondisclosures constituted \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>that merited a decision not to exercise jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Rashid v. Drumm, </em>824 S.W.2d 497, 502 (Mo.App. 1992) (trial court erred by failing to make finding that mother\u2019s acts constituted \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d and failing to determine whether to decline jurisdiction for that reason). As we noted, Mr. Gruber offered sufficient evidence to establish that Ms. Gruber may be equitably estopped from invoking a Maryland court\u2019s jurisdiction. We shall remand this case to the circuit court to determine whether Ms. Gruber engaged in deceptive misrepresentation or concealment that allowed her to win a jurisdictional battle that she anticipated. That is a first level factual finding that an appellate court cannot make. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Nasica, </em>12 Kan.App.2d 794, 758 P.2d 240, 244, <em>rev. denied, </em>248 Kan. 778 (1988) (\u201cwhether a parent has engaged in wrongful or reprehensible conduct is a question of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">If the court determines that Ms. Gruber came into court with unclean hands, in that she won the race to the courthouse by deceptive tactics, then the court must determine whether she should be denied access to our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-208(a); <em>Malik, </em>99 Md.App. at 531, 638 A.2d 1184. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the exercise of Maryland jurisdiction would be in Katarina\u2019s best interests notwithstanding her mother\u2019s misconduct. <em>See id. </em>at 532-33, 638 A.2d 1184. This is not an ordinary \u201cbest interests\u201d decision, however. As we pointed out in <em>Malik v. Malik, </em>the parent who engaged in the reprehensible conduct bears the substantial burden of proving that the harm to the child from declining jurisdiction would outweigh the harm perpetrated by the deception. <em>See id. </em>at 525-34, 638 A.2d 1184. Only in \u201cthe most extraordinary circumstances\u201d should that parent be per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>mitted to obtain relief from a Maryland court. <em>See id. </em>at 525, 688 A.2d 1184. Unless the other forum state applies a law \u201cso contrary to Maryland public policy as to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d of a custody proceeding, the circuit court should decline to exercise jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 534, 638 A.2d 1184. Given that Tennessee applies the best interest of the child standard to determine custody in accordance with UCCJA procedures, that Mr. Gruber expressed his desire to initiate legal action as early as June 18, and that Tennessee would have had exclusive and continuing home state jurisdiction if he had filed there before September 21, 2000, it appears that Ms. Gruber\u2019s burden would be a heavy one.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">JURISDICTIONAL ORDER OF MARCH 30, 2000 VACATED.
