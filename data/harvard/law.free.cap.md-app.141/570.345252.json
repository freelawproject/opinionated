John B., Jr. (\u201cJohn\u201d), appellant, the minor child of Sheri H. and John B., Sr., complains, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City erred or abused its discretion when it did not permit him to withdraw his \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to a Petition for Guardianship, with the Right to Consent to Adoption or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Long Term Care Short of Adoption (\u201cthe Petition\u201d). The Petition was filed on February 23, 2000, by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d or \u201cDSS\u201d), appellee, when John was ten years of age. The circuit court subsequently granted the Petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">From the time that John came into the Department\u2019s care in 1995, he was placed with his paternal grandparents, Christine and Melvin G. Because John was happy with that placement, he did not object to the Petition and was deemed to have consented to it. However, both before and at the termination of parental rights (\u201cTPR\u201d) hearing on March 28, 2001, John\u2019s counsel advised the court that John no longer agreed to the Petition. Claiming that John is deeply \u201cattached\u201d to his mother and has \u201cstrong ties\u201d to his two siblings, his attorney sought to revoke John\u2019s statutory consent, and voiced John\u2019s opposition to the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">On appeal, John presents three questions for our review, which we have reordered and rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">I. Did the trial court err in failing to consider whether the child\u2019s changed circumstances warranted relief from the 30-day response deadline to the show cause order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">II. Did the trial court err in failing to consider evidence regarding John\u2019s family ties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">III. Was the evidence sufficient to support the termination of parental rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">John was born on July 10, 1989. He has a younger half sister, Shunta F., born on January 3, 1993, and an older half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>brother, James H., born on March 12, 1984. The Department filed a termination petition as to John and Shunta, but not as to James.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DSS acknowledges that John is \u201cclose\u201d to his siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Shortly after Shunta\u2019s birth, the hospital reported that both she and Ms. H. tested positive for drugs. Nevertheless, the three children did not come into care until August 1995; when they were removed because Ms. H.\u2019s drug problem interfered with her ability to care for the children. At the time, the children ranged in age from eleven to two. When John was removed, he was immediately placed with his paternal grandparents, with whom he has resided ever since. In his brief, appellant recognizes that \u201c[t]here is no question but that John\u2019s current placement with his grandparents affords him a stable environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On September 14, 1995, by agreement of the parties, the children were found to be children in need of assistance (\u201cCI\u00d1A\u201d) and committed to the Department. Thereafter, beginning in 1995, Ms. H. entered several service agreements. In John\u2019s brief, he concedes that his mother \u201cfailed to adhere\u201d to those agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On August 4, 1995, Ms. H. entered her first service agreement, in which she agreed to obtain drug treatment and attend parenting classes. On August 15,1995, she also agreed to a safety plan, in which she acknowledged her drug problem and her failure to provide proper care for her children. Further, she agreed to enter a drug detoxification and treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Ms. H. executed a second service agreement on November 22, 1995, in which she again agreed to complete drug treatment, obtain a stable home, and attend parenting classes. On the same day, she entered a residential drug treatment program, but left just three days later. She did not comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the provisions of the service agreement or the safety plan. Ms. H. subsequently had \u201csporadic contact\u201d with her caseworker. On November 23, 1999, Ms. H. entered yet another service agreement, which again provided for drug treatment, parenting classes, and stable housing. Ms. H. did not comply with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Throughout this time, John consistently desired both sibling and parental visitation. Although the Department recommended regular sibling visits, John frequently complained about the inadequacy of visitation. In its transfer summary dated August 12, 1996, the Department acknowledged that \u201cJohn needs to visit with his siblings. He is very close to his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">When John was nine years old, he expressed a desire \u201cto grow up with his paternal grandparents.\u201d At that time, neither of John\u2019s parents had maintained regular contact with the Department, even though they saw John occasionally. Accordingly, on or about March 22,1999, the parties agreed to a permanency plan for John of relative placement for the purpose of adoption or custody and guardianship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On July 28,1999, the Department wrote a letter to John Sr., informing him that DSS was initiating termination of parental rights because John had been in care for \u201ctoo long.\u201d In a stipulation of September 29, 1999, the Department noted that the permanency plans for all three children were subject to change and were pending reevaluation by the Show Cause Committee. The Department subsequently changed the permanency plan for John and Shunta to adoption, while the permanency plan for James H. continued to be long-term foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">As we noted, DSS filed the Petition on February 23, 2000, when John was ten years old. A Show Cause Order was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>served on Ms. H. on April 17, 2000, and she timely objected. John\u2019s father was served with the Petition on June 4, 2000, and did not object. By motion on May 2, 2000, John\u2019s counsel complained about service of the Show Cause Order on appellant. As a result, on May 5, 2000, when John was about two months shy of his eleventh birthday, the Department reserved the Show Cause Order on John\u2019s attorney. Accordingly, at a hearing on June 6, 2000, John\u2019s counsel withdrew her motion challenging service of the Show Cause Order. She also said: \u201cWe have no objection to the TPR at this time.\u201d Nevertheless, John\u2019s attorney expressly sought to preserve John\u2019s \u201cright to be able to participate\u201d fully at the TPR hearing. DSS did not object to that request, and the court responded: \u201cJust in case. Right, right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">John explains that, initially, he did not oppose the termination of parental rights, because he \u201cwas in a stable situation with his grandparents and was happy to stay with them.\u201d Over the next several months, however, as John continued to mature and grow \u201cvery close\u201d to his family, he changed his mind. Accordingly, at a conference on January 9, 2001, John\u2019s counsel informed the circuit court that John had \u201cundergone developmental changes and [he] was no longer in favor of the termination.\u201d The court gave John\u2019s lawyer an opportunity to speak with John and to determine whether counsel had to withdraw from her dual representation of John and Shunta, to avoid a possible conflict. John\u2019s counsel subsequently advised the court on January 16, 2001, that John was, indeed, \u201cadamantly opposed to termination.\u201d Accordingly, the court appointed a new attorney for Shunta.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">At the termination of parental rights hearing on March 28, 2001, neither Ms. H. nor John was present, but both were represented by counsel. John\u2019s counsel advised the court, without objection, that John wanted to remain in the care of his paternal grandparents, but opposed the severance of legal ties to his parents and siblings. Further, she explained that John \u201cconsidered himself a part of his biological family,\u201d and wanted to maintain a relationship with his siblings. Suggesting to the court that termination of parental ties' would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u201cdevastate\u201d John, his lawyer urged the court to allow John to withdraw his prior consent to the Petition and to deny DSS\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">At the TPR hearing, all the parties proceeded by proffer, without any limitation imposed by the court. In connection with its proffer, the Department offered its entire record as an exhibit, although the court admitted only those portions \u201cwhich do not contain inappropriate hearsay.\u201d With respect to the proffer made by John\u2019s counsel, the following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">[THE COURT]: [John\u2019s lawyer], any evidence or proffer as to John\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor. Let me say that if John B. was here he would try to explain to the court at 11 years old exactly what has personally happened to him with regard to both his mother, his father and now his caretaker[s], his paternal grandparents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">As the State has shown, John has, in fact, been with the department since the early age of 1995[sic], has had the department\u2019s involvement, but from his perspective he\u2019s been with his family. His primary caretakers are his grandparents, his paternal grandparents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">If he was here he would talk about how he treasured the visits that he does have with his mother, and that he honors and would love to be able to keep a relationship with his mother that would not entail termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">In addition to that, he does have contact with his father because he\u2019s with his paternal grandparents and, in fact, would find it devastating if, in fact, his parents\u2019 legal ties and all other ties were terminated at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">To the extent that a child can understand what termination of parental rights mean, and to the extent that counsel could explain that, I think that John clearly did not understand the magnitude of what that meant until January 2000, at which time he intimated to his counsel that he was not in favor of TPR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In this instance at one time I thought there was some confusion as to whether\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">[THE COURT]: For January 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: 2001, I\u2019m sorry, Your Hon- or. Thank you. Counsel talked with John extensively about his comprehension of that, and I think it was at that time that he clearly said no, I really don\u2019t want this to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">What we\u2019re asking for the court to do is to recognize first of course his right to be able to get a cognitive point of understanding what that meant, and two, to respect that with regard to the emotional, psychological, and legal ramifications of his right to be terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">I know for the record it was the early stipulation intimate to that [sic]. At one time James (inaudible) was part of this, his brother. The Department did not choose to request termination of parental rights for him. He\u2019s 16 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">I think that those boys are very, very close and bonded, and, in fact, we represent all three children, and I think to the extent that both of these boys understand now what that means it is incumbent upon the court for the best interests of this child, given the psychological and emotional damage that could happen to him, that termination of parental rights not be entered, an order for that not be entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">[THE COURT]: And with that John rests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: John rests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">Ms. H.\u2019s attorney made the following proffer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">[THE COURT]: [Mother\u2019s attorney], any evidence on behalf of Ms. H?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor. Other than my client is not here today, she did, through her objection, advise the court and has indicated that her desire is to not have her rights terminated with regard to her children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">Your Honor, as you heard that particularly with John, although she has not been around, she\u2019s not here today and she\u2019s had a rocky experience with the Department of Social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Services, she has always, throughout all these proceedings, maintained some contact with the Department of Social Services and with her children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">And, in fact, apparently it\u2019s been enough that it\u2019s been demonstrated by the 11 year old that her involvement and contact has been enough to maintain his bonding with her. And, Your Honor, I would ask today that her rights not be terminated and that this child\u2019s desires be acknowledged and that his acknowledgment also go for the benefit of the parent, and that her contact is enough that it warrants her being able to maintain her parental rights with regard to this child, and, in fact, with regard to both children. So Your Honor, I\u2019d ask that the Department\u2019s petition for termination be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The Department argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: ... Your Honor, without going through the details of my proffer, I would state to the court that clearly in this case the Department has shown that we did make efforts to work with the mother. As late as 1999 the Department of Social Services did enter into a service agreement with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">As far as the father is concerned, again even we [sic] signed a service agreement well after the 18 month period in 1998, and even at the most recent court review in 2000 when he expressed an interest in a relative resource we did explore that resource, so clearly, Your Honor, we have made efforts in this case to continually work with the parents well beyond statutory requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">Your Honor, as to Shunta clearly she\u2019s in a stable placement. There seems to be no argument from child\u2019s counsel as to Shunta. As to John, however, the testimony has been clear that he is in a stable and loving placement. It is a family placement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">He is \u2014 because of that placement he does have some access to his biological family, which is a benefit for him, and [that] will continue to take place, my guess is, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>termination of rights takes place if this court does grant it....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">After a review of the requisite statutory factors set forth in Md.Code (1999 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), \u00a7 5-513 of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L\u201d), the court granted the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">It is beyond cavil that a parent has a fundamental right to raise his or her own child. <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 782 A.2d 332(2001); <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 218, 721 A.2d 662 (1998); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112, 642 A.2d 201 (1994); <em>see also Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000); <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (recognizing the \u201cfundamental liberty interest\u201d of the parent \u201cin matters of family life----\u201d); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. J970013, </em>128 Md.App. 242, 247, 737 A.2d 604 (1999); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058/CAD, </em>120 Md.App. 88, 97, 706 A.2d 144 (1998); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. 443, 454, 696 A.2d 1102 (1997). Similarly, this Court has recognized that a child has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the preservation of parental rights. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 6Z970003, </em>127 Md.App. 33, 50-51, 731 A.2d 467 (1999). Although the Court of Appeals has not decided that precise constitutional issue, it has said that a child \u201cordinarily has an interest in maintaining a close familial relationship with siblings\u201d and other family members. <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. T97036005, </em>358 Md. 1, 16, 746 A.2d 379 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">In <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388 the Supreme Court said that, \u201c[wjhen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d Similarly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Court of Appeals recognized the seriousness of such a proceeding in <em>Walker v. Gardner, </em>221 Md. 280, 284, 157 A.2d 273 (1960), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">(AJdoption decrees cut the child off from the natural parent, who is made a legal stranger to his offspring. The consequences of this drastic and permanent severing of the strongest and basic natural ties and relationships has led the Legislature and this Court to make sure, as far as possible, that adoption shall not be granted over parental objection unless that course clearly is justified. The welfare and best interests of the child must be weighed with great care against every just claim of an objecting parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Accord Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d 201; <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058/CAD, </em>120 Md.App. at 97-98, 706 A.2d 144; <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. at 454, 696 A.2d 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeals recently reiterated, the parents\u2019 \u201cfundamental interest ... is not absolute and does not exclude other important considerations.\u201d <em>In Re Mark M., </em>at 343. Indeed, notwithstanding the harsh nature of a termination proceeding, it is unassailable that the paramount consideration is the best interest of the child. <em>Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 219, 721 A.2d 662; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 323-24, 701 A.2d 110 (1997); <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 112, 642 A.2d 201; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. J970013, </em>128 Md.App. at 247, 737 A.2d 604. As the Court underscored in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A </em>334 Md. 538, 561, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">[W]e have ... made clear that the controlling factor, or guiding principle, in adoption and custody cases is not the natural parent\u2019s interest in raising the child, but rather what best serves the interests of the child. We have said that in all cases where the interests of a child are in jeopardy the paramount consideration is what will best promote the child\u2019s welfare, a consideration that is of \u201ctran-scendant importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Given the gravity of a TPR case, and the compelling nature of the best interest standard, the General Assembly has provided a detailed statutory scheme that must be satisfied before termination may be ordered. To determine what is in a child\u2019s \u201cbest interest,\u201d the trial court must consider and address all relevant statutory criteria. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 87A262, </em>323 Md. 12, 19-20, 590 A.2d 165 (1991); <em>see In re Abiagail C., </em>138 Md.App. 570, 587, 772 A.2d 1277 (2001); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T98314013, </em>133 Md.App. 401, 416, 758 A.2d 552 (2000). The Court has said: \u201cIn cases where parental rights are terminated, it is important that each factor be addressed specifically not only to demonstrate that all factors were considered but also to provide a record for review of this drastic measure.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 87A262, </em>323 Md. at 19-20, 590 A.2d 165; <em>see In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T97036005, </em>358 Md. at 23, 746 A.2d 379; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T96318005, </em>132 Md.App. 299, 311, 752 A.2d 646 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Because a TPR decree severs the legal ties of parent and child, the burden falls on the State to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T98314013, </em>133 Md.App. at 412, 758 A.2d 552. Accordingly, F.L. \u00a7 5-313(a) provides: \u201cA court may grant a decree of adoption or a decree of guardianship, without the consent of a natural parent [only] ... if the court finds <em>by clear and convincing evidence </em>that it is in the best interest of the child to terminate the natural parent\u2019s rights as to th[at] child____\u201d (Emphasis added).

In making this decision, we must assume the truth of all the evidence, and of all the favorable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, tending to support the factual conclusion of the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. T98314013, </em>133 Md.App. at 415-16, 758 A.2d 552 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Appellant lodges numerous challenges to the court\u2019s ruling granting the Petition. John maintains that the trial court erred when it refused to consider whether his changed circumstances \u2014 increased maturity and heightened appreciation for the significance of a TPR ruling \u2014 warranted relief from his deemed consent to the Petition. At the hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered that, \u201c[a]s [John] grew older and gathered a greater understanding of the long-term consequences of termination, the potential for psychological and emotional damage arising from termination of [parental] ties was likely to increase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">John also relies on F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(c)(2)(iii), and complains that the court failed to consider his emotional ties to his parents and siblings when it determined his best interests. He asserts that the court erred because it \u201cignored the consistent and uncontroverted evidence in the record of John\u2019s strong [familial] ties to his siblings\u201d and his mother. In this regard, John points to his consistent efforts to maintain visitation with his family and his feelings of affection for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Further, John complains that \u201c[l]ittle evidence was proffered\u201d as to the statutory factors, apart from the service agreements. For example, appellant suggests that the court gave \u201cextremely short shrift\u201d to F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(i), concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ing the extent of services offered by DSS to his mother to facilitate reunification. Apart from furniture provided in 1995 and some referrals for drug treatment, John observes that there was no evidence of services to his mother to facilitate reunification, a factor that \u201cdeserves particular attention....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">John also claims that, on the whole, the record is insufficient to support the court\u2019s ruling that it was in his best interest to grant the Petition. He maintains that the Department presented \u201cflimsy evidence\u201d that did not support termination, and complains that the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cbased on the slimmest of proffers, hardly the weighty \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence required to support a severance of parental rights.\u201d Rather, he asserts that DSS did not meet its \u201cexacting burden,\u201d and that the weight of the evidence \u201ctips decisively against termination.\u201d In support of his position, John observes that the trial court issued its decision immediately after the parties rested, and perfunctorily \u201cwent through the motions of addressing\u201d the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">According to appellant, the Department and the court also erred in assuming that John would be able to maintain his \u201ccritical\u201d family ties even if the Petition were granted. John argues that \u201cthe Department\u2019s decision to proceed with termination was not based on the application of permanency plan priorities, but on the amount of time that had elapsed since John had been brought into care.\u201d He relies on F.L. \u00a7 5-525(e), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">(e) Development of a permanency plan. \u2014 (1) In developing a permanency plan for a child in an out-of-home placement, the local department of social services shall give primary consideration to the best interests of the child____ (2) To the extent consistent with the best interest of the child in an out-of-home placement, the local department shall consider the following permanency plans, in descending order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">(i) returning the child to the child\u2019s parent or guardian, unless the department is the guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>(ii) placing the child with relatives to whom adoption, guardianship, or care and custody, in descending order of priority, are planned to be granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">(iii) adoption in the following descending order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">(1) by a current foster parent with whom the child has resided continually for at least the 12 months prior to developing the permanency plan or for a sufficient length of time to have established positive relationships and family ties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">(2) by another approved adopted family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(iv) an independent living arrangement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT_\">(5) in long-term foster care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Appellant argues that DSS had an alternative to termination of parental rights, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">There is no question but that John\u2019s current placement with his grandparents affords him a stable environment. There is also no question, as set forth above, that his stability is fostered, if not dependent upon, his continued visits with his siblings and family members. Both goals can be achieved by keeping John in the long term care of his relatives. John\u2019s counsel urged the Court to consider the existence of an alternative to termination \u2014 continued relative placement with his grandparents \u2014 as in his best interest and therefore a strong reason to deny the Petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">We first consider John\u2019s claim that the trial court erred or abused its discretion in refusing to consider whether a child\u2019s change in circumstances warrants relief from the 30-day response deadline to a show cause order. We begin with a review of the applicable statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 317(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-14\">(c) <em>Requirements for granting petition. </em>-Except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 5-313 and 5-313.1 of this subtitle, the court may grant a decree awarding guardianship only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(1) after any investigation and hearing the court considers necessary; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">(2) with the consent of each living natural parent of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">F.L. \u00a7 5-317(e) is also pertinent. It states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">(e) <em>Revocation of consent. </em>\u2014 In a proceeding for guardianship, consent may be revoked at any time within 30 days after the consent is signed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Further, F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">(d) <em>Failure to respond or waiver of notification. </em>\u2014 If a person is notified under this section and fails to file a notice of objection within the time stated in the show cause order or if a person\u2019s notification has been waived under subsection (c) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">(1) the court <em>shall </em>consider the person who is notified or whose notice is waived to have consented to the adoption or to the guardianship; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">(2) the petition shall be treated in the same manner as a petition to which consent has been given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Title 9 of the Maryland Rules is called \u201cFamily Law Actions.\u201d Maryland Rule 9-107(a) states: \u201cAny person having a right to participate in a proceeding for adoption or guardianship may file a notice of objection to the adoption or guardianship .... \u201d Rule 9-107(b)(1) states, in part: \u201c[A]ny notice of objection to adoption or guardianship <em>shall </em>be filed within 30 days after the show cause order is served.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">(3) John\u2019s attorney was served with the Petition and Show Cause Order on May 11, 2000, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-322(a)(l)(ii)(l). No objection was ever filed on John\u2019s behalf. Therefore, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d), John was deemed to have consented to the Petition. Nevertheless, John claims that the trial court erred or abused its discretion because it did not allow him to withdraw his deemed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Appellant states that \u201cthere are situations, which we expect will be relatively infrequent, when changed circumstances should require the trial court to consider whether relief from those timelines is necessary to enable the court to protect the best interest of the child.\u201d Because children continue to mature and gain greater appreciation for the significance of a termination proceeding, John urges that, upon request, \u201cthe trial court should determine whether the child\u2019s changed circumstances warrant relief from his earlier position.\u201d Therefore, he maintains that a trial court must have discretion to allow a child to change his or her mind, based on changed circumstances. John points to his increased maturity and corresponding appreciation for the importance of a TPR order as the kind of change in circumstances that justified his request to revoke his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It is undisputed that John\u2019s failure to object was not inadvertent. Indeed, he acknowledges in his brief that he wanted \u201cto grow up with his paternal grandparents,\u201d and \u201cwas happy to stay\u201d with them. On the other hand, John was just ten years old when the Petition was filed in February 2000. A year later, he sought to withdraw his consent, as a result of ensuing \u201cdevelopmental changes\u201d and his increasing maturity. John maintains that \u201c[h]is intervening intellectual and emotional development led him to [gain] a greater understanding of the significance of termination....\u201d At that point, although John still \u201cwanted to remain with his paternal grandparents, he was strongly opposed to cutting off\u2019 his legal ties to his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">To be sure, in the life of a child, a year hopefully provides an opportunity for significant intellectual and emotional growth, of a kind that is not generally associated with a comparable period in adulthood. Based on the circumstances of this case, however, we are satisfied that, in effect, John was allowed to withdraw his consent, because he had a full opportunity to advise the court of his opposition to the TPR. Moreover, the court considered John\u2019s view, even though the court was not certain whether the statute permitted John to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>interpose a belated objection or revoke his consent. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">As we observed, John\u2019s attorney expressly represented to the court that John, who was eleven at the time of trial, had changed his mind and opposed termination of parental rights. John\u2019s lawyer explained that, until January 2001, John \u201cclearly did not understand the magnitude\u201d of a termination ruling. In view of John\u2019s \u201ccognitive point of understanding what termination meant,\u201d and his close familial bonds, his counsel asked the court to deny the Petition. Significantly, DSS did not object to the proffer made by John\u2019s lawyer, nor did the court restrict John\u2019s opportunity to present his proffer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">Subsequently, in closing argument, counsel for DSS said: [COUNSEL FOR DSS]: Your Honor, I do feel compelled to bring to your attention that this case is one of those cases that straddles the Christopher [C.] time lines. On May 11th of 2000 we served [child\u2019s counsel] ... as to this petition ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">And, Your Honor, we have no indication in our file that there is an objection on behalf of either of her clients at the time both children were her clients and there\u2019s no indication that there is an objection. So, Your Honor, according to Christopher [C.] standards her client has consented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">And, Your Honor, I can see that I feel that this is an ugly way to go when you\u2019ve heard the expression of her client. However, we served her in May. She had 30 days at that time to object, and there is no objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">THE COURT: To the extent- \u2014 and [John\u2019s counsel], I\u2019d love to hear from you in a few minutes, but to the extent that [counsel] on behalf of a child post Christopher [C.][is] clearly entitled to participate and participated by way of proffering his position, and I assume you\u2019d argue not just in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>rebuttal but would argue that position, [DSS\u2019s attorney], what weight, if any, do you think the court should give or could give the testimony \u2014 to the extent there was any testimony that was adverse to a consenting position and whatever argument is inconsistent to a consenting position because I think you are right under Christopher [C.], if a timely objection was not filed then John is deemed to have consented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: Your Honor, my understanding or my interpretation of the continued presence of children\u2019s attorneys where we have a child who has consented is to protect the rights of the minor child who, under the law, is considered to be disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">THE COURT: Disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: And that is my understanding or that\u2019s my interpretation of why the attorneys continue to participate. But, Your Honor, if we are to interpret Christopher [C.], Christopher [C.] was very clear that the child is a party as the parents are....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">I don\u2019t believe you can <em>attach </em>\u2014 you. <em>can attach only minimal weight to tkat testimony. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible necessarily for the court to entirely ignore it, but frankly she failed to file notice of objection.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">This child is deemed to have consented by operation of law, and, Your Honor, frankly it\u2019s an issue for growing children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">[JOHN\u2019S ATTORNEY]: There are two narrow issues, as I see it. One is that \u2014 and I\u2019m going to say some things that I think that are in some ways procedural in terms of all of our interpretation of Christopher [C.] and that period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-12\">If the court will recall, when service was not made on this I filed a motion objecting to the improper service. We came into court. We had a hearing, and we \u2014 I withdrew my motion on the basis of the show cause because later we were served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>At that hearing I recalled saying that we were reserving our right to participate because I think that at that time everyone was thinking that \u2014 the interpretation of Christopher [C.] you, in fact, were still allowed to participate then you were okay, that the child\u2019s rights would be protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">Subsequent to that I think there has been some interpretation by case law where parents, in fact, have come in arguing about the 30 day. I believe that for the best interests of the child there is a differential that should be recognized by the court with regard to why counsel is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">And I think that but for the fact \u2014 but for the court allowing to stand here to talk about John I would have been outside this courtroom and not be able to express what really I think is John\u2019s right to be present and to hear this and to be able to say what his opinion is. That is the first issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">The second issue\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">THE COURT: But let me stop you there. But isn\u2019t the theory \u2014 and I don\u2019t know whether the theory is right or wrong. Maybe some appellate court will tell us whether it\u2019s right or wrong, but the whole concept of Christopher [C.] as it pertains to children\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">[JOHN\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 is that even if they are consenting that they can be there as a second voice, so to speak\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">[JOHN\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">THE COURT: \u2014 to make sure that the department \u2014 if they\u2019re consenting to make sure the department does its job right presenting its case. We sort of buy that as being the- and obviously if you object then you\u2019re not on the department\u2019s team.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">You\u2019re likely probably on the parents\u2019 team, or even in the strictest interpretation of Christopher [C.], in Christopher [C.] you\u2019ve got two consenting parents then you\u2019ve got the child there, the lone person in the wilderness sort of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>being counterpoint to the slam dunk case of the department otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">[JOHN\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And from John\u2019s perspective, Your Honor, that is very true, and we were consenting to the extent that he could understand consenting. <em>I\u2019m saying that the law should allow him also to be able to recognize his gradation of understanding that consent, </em>and at this time in 2000 John was 9 \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. He was 10. He\u2019s 11 now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-5\">So we then have a child, and quite frankly just at the line of that kind of standing, <em>we\u2019re now at a place where a child was one year later and saying </em>\u2014 and it used to be that their levels of reason \u2014 people being able to understand and reason things, and I think that that one year was a good thing, but I also think that on the second issue of whether, in fact, a child for all intent and purposes understood his right to be present to discuss whether his parents would be \u2014 his parents\u2019 rights would be terminated and that everything was done properly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">[COUNSEL FOR DSS]: ... I do wish again to speak to this issue of John B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Your Honor, when [child\u2019s counsel] expressed to the court that she needed to separate the two children from her case, that was for purposes of conflict. That was a conflict that she had in her representation. That still did not create an objection where there had not been one before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">Your Honor, [child\u2019s counsel\u2019s] argument was entirely in the language of should.

They have different understanding.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>The department acknowledges that, but the Court of Appeals didn\u2019t acknowledge it, Your Honor, and it didn\u2019t seem to be an argument. It wasn\u2019t an argument that was foreseen by those parties that argued their cases. They wanted party status and they got it.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">[John\u2019s attorney] <em>did not object on behalf of her client, and therefore, despite what she said to the court, she has no right to stand here today and act as if she has a rash objection when, in fact, this court must treat her client\u2019s position as a consent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Thereafter, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">As to the legal discussion that did arise in closing argument, <em>the court certainly in considering all the factors and [the] proffer [of John\u2019s counsel] as to what John does or does not want, the court is really sort of tom.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-11\">I don\u2019t think that specifically plays into, and certainly if I look at substantively John\u2019s position, the fact that he lives with his paternal grandparents, has contact with his mother and has other relationships, I\u2019m not certain how that factors into the 2(iii) or (iv) factors, so I really don\u2019t \u2014 so even if I were to consider it I\u2019m not sure where it clearly fits within the factors the court is to consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">And if, on the other hand, though, I give it a strict Christopher [C.] interpretation I would then have to discount it completely if any evidence presented is inconsistent with John\u2019s consent. <em>So I think either way it really makes no difference, that if I do consider it I don\u2019t see where it </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>falls into a specific (c) or (d) factor, and if I didn\u2019t consider it giving it a strict Christopher [C] consideration it goes out the window anyway, but it\u2019s anecdotal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">But having considered all the factors this court is convinced by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interests of John ... to grant the department\u2019s petition----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The foregoing makes clear to us that the court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying John\u2019s request to revoke his deemed consent. John was afforded a full opportunity to present his objection to the court; John\u2019s attorney elected to proceed by proffer, and was not limited in doing so. Moreover, no motion was made to strike the proffer. Clearly, then, the court was cognizant of John\u2019s position. Nevertheless, the court determined that John\u2019s view \u201cmakes no difference ...,\u201d because application of the best interest standard warranted termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Even assuming that the court did not credit John\u2019s position, because of its uncertainty as to whether a child may withdraw a deemed consent, we remain satisfied that the court neither erred nor abused its discretion. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">With respect to whether the statutory scheme permits a parent in a TPR case to revoke a deemed consent, <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055/CAD, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681 (1997), is instructive. There, the Court heard several consolidated cases and considered whether a parent who neglected to file a timely objection could, instead, file a belated objection, and whether a parent who consented based on a failure to file a timely objection could later revoke that \u201cdeemed consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 687 A.2d 681. As to the first question, the Court answered \u201cordinarily no.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 687 A.2d 681. As to the second, it said \u201c \u2018no\u2019 with a caveat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Writing for the Court, Judge Wilner stated, at 344 Md. at 481, 687 A.2d 681:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">A deemed consent under [F.L.] \u00a7 5-322(d) may not be revoked [under F.L. \u00a7 5-317(3) ], for it is not a volitional consent but one arising by operation of law. If the parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>fails to file a timely objection, no further notices need be given to the parent, prior to or upon the entry of a judgment of guardianship. This conclusion is clear from both the structure and the history of the relevant statutes and rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In explicating its ruling, the Court reviewed the legislative history of F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 5-317(e) and 5-322(d), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">From this legislative history, it is evident that, in enacting HB 590, the General Assembly intended to eliminate any uncertainty over the effect of a parent\u2019s failure, after proper notice, to file a timely objection. The sole purpose of regarding such a lapse as statutory consent imposed by operation of law and directing the court to proceed accordingly was to treat the case thereafter as though it were uncontested \u2014 to avoid the need for further notice and hearing and thus to speed up the judicial component of the permanency planning process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">That same purpose is equally clear in the 1992 and 1994 amendments to \u00a7 5-317(e). Until 1992, a parent who consented to a guardianship could revoke the consent at any time before judgment was entered....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">At the urging of the Rules Committee, the General Assembly amended the statute in 1994 to fix the revocation period, in all cases, to 30 days after the consent was signed. 1994 Md. Laws, ch. 234. That change created a fixed, ascertainable expiration date \u2014 one that would allow DSS, the court, and all other interested parties to rely on the consent once the 30-day period expired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">In light of this history, <em>it is evident that any construction of \u00a7 5-317(e) or \u00a7 5-322(d) that would have the effect of engendering further delays or imposing additional impediments to achieving permanent and stable family settings for children placed in foster care, usually as a result of a CINA proceeding, would be flatly inconsistent with and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>antithetical to the clear legislative purpose, and is to be avoided unless absolutely required.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><em>Id. </em>at <em>483-84, 687 A.2d </em>681 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Appellant seizes on the \u201cabsolutely required\u201d language quoted immediately above. Unlike in this case, he argues that the untimely filings there were not based on developmental changes in the children that occurred with the undue passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">To be sure, the Court in <em>In re Adoption No. 93321055 </em>considered the effect of a deemed consent only with regard to a parent. Nonetheless, it recognized that a deemed consent arises by \u201coperation of law.\u201d <em>Id.' </em>at 481, 687 A.2d 681. In rejecting the parents\u2019 position advocating the right to revoke a deemed consent, the Court observed that the revocation period provided under F.L. \u00a7 5-317(e) is \u201cclear, fixed, and easily ascertained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 687 A.2d 681. Moreover, the Court said that the \u201ccertainty\u201d obtained with strict adherence to the statute is \u201cessential,\u201d so that DSS, the court, and the parties may know what right to notice and participation \u201cthe parent retains.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Of significance here, the Court reasoned that if a parent is permitted to challenge a DSS petition at any time up to the entry of judgment, F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d) would be \u201cessentially meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 687 A.2d 681. Further, the Court recognized that if a parent can revoke a deemed consent, this would \u201chave the effect of giving a defaulting parent greater rights than one who affirmatively consents, and no rational justification\u201d exists for that position. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, given the legislative objective of cutting off the right of a parent who fails to file a timely objection, the Court said: \u201cWe can find nothing in the Legislative history [of] \u00a7 5-322(d) ... suggesting an intent to attach a right to revoke to the statutory consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court added that the necessary \u201ccertainty would not exist if a right to revoke is attached to the \u2018deemed\u2019 consent under \u00a7 5-322.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its view, any other analysis would be tantamount to an unfettered right to revoke, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the Legislature expressly rejected. Thus, the Court held, at 344 Md. at 486, 687 A.2d 681:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">As a matter of statutory construction, therefore, we conclude that there is no right to revoke a statutory consent arising under \u00a7 5-322(d). That is a consent, as we have said, arising by operation of law, not by volition, and it is not within the power of the parent to revoke it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Further, the Court concluded, at 344 Md. at 494, 687 A.2d 681:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">[T]he statutory scheme of regarding the failure to file a timely objection as an irrevocable deemed consent to the petition does not facially offend any due process right of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In addition, the Court considered whether a trial court has authority to consider a belatedly filed objection. The parents argued that the trial court had such discretion and that the failure to afford such discretion would deny parents due process and equal protection. The Court rejected those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The Court reasoned that if a trial judge \u201chad the general discretion to accept and consider a late-filed objection, no one could safely rely on the absence of a timely objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 687 A.2d 681. Moreover, in the context of a neglectful failure to object, the Court said: \u201c[W]e believe that the risk of error in establishing an absolute deadline for filing a notice of objection is relatively small.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 687 A.2d 681. It added: \u201c[I]n the normal case ... the parent is given fair and adequate notice of what is required and a fair and adequate opportunity to file a timely notice of objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recognizing the interest in the \u201cspeedy resolution\u201d of termination cases, <em>id. </em>at 495, 687 A.2d 681, the Court found no equal protection violation in regard to the refusal to accept a belatedly filed objection. It explained, at 344 Md. at 496, 687 A.2d 681:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">[E]ven under a strict scrutiny analysis, we find no denial of equal protection of law in regarding the consent arising under \u00a7 5-322(d) as irrevocable and not allowing the court routinely to entertain late \u2014 filed objections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>As we indicated, the Court expressly addressed the issue of revocation of a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d and belated objections in a TPR case only with regard to the parent, not the child. Although there are important considerations that distinguish a parent from a child in the context of a TPR case, the Court surely was aware that a parent may also be a minor. If, as John urges, the child in a termination case ought to be treated more leniently than a parent for purposes of revocation of a deemed consent or the filing of a belated objection, it would seem that the same rationale would apply when the parent in a TPR case happens to be a minor. Yet, the Court did not carve out an exception in those cases in which the parent in a TPR case also holds the status of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On the other hand, the Court did recognize that a due process issue \u201cmight indeed\u201d arise if a parent is precluded from withdrawing a deemed consent that resulted from certain circumstances beyond the parent\u2019s control, such as when a parent was unable to timely respond because he or she was in a coma. <em>Id. </em>at 493, 687 A.2d 681. In our view, the circumstances presented by John to justify his revocation of consent are not comparable to the kind of dire circumstances identified by Judge Wilner.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">When we couple the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681, with its decision in <em>In Re Adoption/Guardianship No. T97036005, </em>358 Md. 1, 746 A.2d 379 (2000), we are all the more convinced that no error or abuse of discretion occurred here. <em>In re Adoption No. T97036005 </em>involved children in several TPR cases who complained on appeal that the trial court had wrongfully denied them party status. Although the parents had affirmatively consented to termination or were statutorily deemed to have consented, the children had objections that the trial court did not consider. The Court of Appeals agreed with the children that they were, indeed, parties, with a corresponding right to participate and to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">One of the children was nine-year-old Christopher C., whose parents had consented to termination. Nevertheless, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>child\u2019s lawyer sought a postponement of the trial to ascertain Christopher\u2019s view. Because the attorney was concerned that termination was \u201ctherapeutically contraindicated,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10, 746 A.2d 379, she wanted to investigate further. Although the child\u2019s lawyer argued that Christopher was a party to the proceedings, with a right to present evidence, the trial court disagreed and granted the termination petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Writing for the Court, Judge Raker \u201cagree[d] with the children that ... they have a right to a hearing on the merits,\u201d and the denial of a hearing on the merits violated their statutory rights. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 746 A.2d 379. In reaching that decision, the Court relied on Md.Code (1998), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), \u00a7 3-801(n), which defines \u201cpart/\u2019 to include \u201ca child who is the subject of a petition,\u201d and C.J. \u00a7 3-804(a), which establishes that a \u201cchild who is the subject of a petition includes a child in a termination of parental rights proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 746 A.2d 379. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">We hold that in creating the statutory scheme governing the status of a child in a termination of parental rights action following a CINA action, the Legislature intended to make the child a party to the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 746 A2d 379.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">We hold that when the child <em>timely </em>requests a hearing and opposes the petition, the trial judge does not have discretion to deny the child\u2019s request for hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">The best interest of the child must be determined only after the court considers the required [statutory] factors ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>whenever [the court] conducts a hearing in.a guardianship action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 22-23, 746 A.2d 379 (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Clearly, the Court recognized that a child in a TPR case is entitled to the same rights and protections as a parent. It would seem, then, that as a party, the child is also bound by the same obligations generally imposed by statute or rule upon other parties. As we observed, F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d) and Rule 9-107 both apply to any \u201cperson;\u201d neither the statute nor the rule makes any distinction between children and other persons. In other words, the provisions do not carve out an exception when the person happens to be a child.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It follows that the rationale of the Court in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681, which expressly barred a parent\u2019s revocation of deemed consent or the filing of a belated objection, applies with equal force to the child in a TPR case.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We recognize that there may be extreme circumstances that justify providing the child in a TPR case with an opportunity to revoke a statutory consent. But maturation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>which is foreseeable and generally inevitable, does not seem comparable to the example utilized by Judge Wilner to illustrate a possible due process concern. Moreover, although there may be compelling reasons to distinguish a child from a parent in a TPR case, whether such distinctions necessarily wairant the relief that John requested is a matter for the General Assembly or the Court of Appeals to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">To the extent that the court below failed to permit John to withdraw his deemed consent, we conclude that the court neither erred nor abused its discretion. We hasten to add, however, that our conclusion does not alter the paramount principle in cases of this kind; even if the child is deemed to have consented, and cannot withdraw that consent, the court may not grant a TPR petition unless it is satisfied, by clear and convincing evidence, that such a ruling is in the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We next consider whether the court adequately considered John\u2019s family ties, and whether the evidence was legally sufficient to justify termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The court first addressed F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(c)(1), which requires it to consider \u201cthe safety and health of the child.\u201d The court found that the Department met John\u2019s safety and health needs, but the mother did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Under F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(i), the court must consider \u201cthe timeliness, nature and extent of the services offered by the child placement agency to facilitate reunion of the child with the natural parent.\u201d DSS proffered that it had offered Ms. H. the services she needed: drug treatment, parenting training, and housing assistance. The court below found that the Department offered Ms. H. timely and appropriate services, including furniture, drug treatment, and other referrals. That finding is not demeaned because, alternatively, the court waived DSS\u2019s obligation to provide further services. In any event, John does not dispute DSS\u2019s proffer, nor does he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>suggest any other services that Ms. H. should have been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Under F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(c)(2)(ii), the court is required to consider \u201cany social service agreement between the natural parent and the child placement agency, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under the agreement.\u201d The court observed that Ms. H. entered several service agreements and safety plans between August 4, 1995, and November 22, 1999. Each agreement required Ms. H. to complete drug treatment, maintain stable housing, and complete parenting classes. The court was satisfied that the Department made the necessary referrals, but Ms. H. failed to fulfill her obligations. John concedes in his brief that his mother did not fulfill any service agreements. Nor does he dispute the proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">With respect to the factors under F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(c), John seems to focus on the trial court\u2019s findings under F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(iii), which required the court to consider \u201cthe child\u2019s feelings toward and emotional ties with the child\u2019s natural parents, the child\u2019s siblings, and any other individuals who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d John contends that the court ignored important evidence regarding his feelings for his mother and half siblings. To the contrary, as we noted, the court considered the proffers of all the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The evidence and proffers demonstrated that John feels affection for his mother. But, the proffers also showed Ms. H.\u2019s failure over the course of several years to take the necessary steps to overcome the drug abuse that led her to neglect John in the first place. Moreover, DSS\u2019s counsel proffered that Ms. H. did not visit John regularly, and Ms. H.\u2019s own lawyer acknowledged that she \u201chas not been around.\u201d John\u2019s counsel did not dispute those proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Further, the court found that \u201cthere is a relationship between John and his mother ... but that\u2019s not a parental bond.\u201d Instead, the court found a parental bond between John and his paternal grandparents, who have been his caretakers since 1995. Although John quarrels with that conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>sion, the record supports the court\u2019s finding that the grandparents have functioned as John\u2019s parents since 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Relying on <em>In re Tamara R., </em>136 Md.App. at 243, 764 A.2d 844 (2000), John emphasizes the importance that both federal and state courts have placed on sibling relationships. Indeed, we have said that \u201cthe sibling relationship has been widely recognized as an important one, which will be given significant consideration and protection by courts in cases involving the family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 764 A.2d 844. DSS maintained, however, that there was no evidence that termination would mean that John would be denied a relationship with his half-siblings. As we noted, the Department did not pursue termination as to James, who is now almost eighteen. Moreover, Shunta wanted to be adopted by her foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">John\u2019s emotional ties toward his mother and his siblings are, of course, important factors for the court to consider. F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(iii). But, no one factor is controlling. Rather, the court must \u201creview all of the relevant factors and consider them together.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058, </em>120 Md.App. at 105, 706 A.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Under F.L. \u00a7 513(c)(2)(v)(l), the court must consider \u201cthe extent to which the natural parent has maintained regular contact with the child under a plan to reunite the child with the natural parent.\u201d The court did not err in finding that Ms. H. has not maintained regular contact with John.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">As to the \u201cd\u201d factors, John asserts that no findings were made that were relevant to him. Therefore, he asserts that the court had no basis to waive the Department\u2019s obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">F.L. \u00a7 513(d)(1)(f) requires the court to evaluate whether \u201cthe natural parent has a disability that renders the natural parent consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the child for long periods of time.\u201d The court stated that no evidence existed of any disability as to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 513(d)(l)(ii), the court must address whether \u201cthe natural parent has committed acts of abuse or neglect toward any child in the family.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATO\">[T]here is evidence that Shunta was born in 1993 and mother tested positive for drugs. The court does find this to be acts of abuse and neglect, so the court is making that finding as to mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">John asserts that the court improperly found that this was an aggravating factor as to him. DSS counters that John\u2019s claim is \u201coff the mark.\u201d It notes that F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(d)(l)(ii) requires the court to consider actions by the parent toward <em>\u201cany </em>child in the family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In our view, the trial court did not err when it found that the serious risk of harm to which Shunta had been exposed during Ms. H.\u2019s pregnancy was an aggravating factor. As DSS correctly observes, \u201c[t]he parents\u2019 ability to care for the needs of one child is probative of their ability to care for other children in the family.\u201d <em>In re William B., </em>73 Md.App. 68, 77, 533 A.2d 16 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 719, 537 A.2d 272 (1988). Moreover, \u201cit has been long since settled that a parent\u2019s past conduct is relevant to a consideration of his or her future conduct.\u201d <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 731, 614 A.2d 999 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 Md. 480, 620 A.2d 350 (1993). The undisputed proffer of DSS established that Ms. H.\u2019s drug problem led to the children\u2019s removal, nor did she take steps to ensure that her drug dependency would not endanger the health and safety of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">F.L. \u00a7 513(d)(l)(iii) requires the court to determine whether \u201cthe natural parent has failed repeatedly to give the child adequate food, clothing, shelter, and education or any other care or control necessary for the child\u2019s physical, mental, or emotional health, even though the natural parent is physically and financially able.\u201d The court found no evidence that Ms. H. repeatedly failed to give the children adequate food, clothing, and shelter, when she had the ability to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Under F.L. \u00a7 5\u00cd3(d)(l)(iv), the court must determine whether \u201cthe child was bom: (A) addicted.to or dependent on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cocaine, heroine, or a derivative thereof; ...\u201d The court noted that \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that John was bom drug exposed. There is some evidence suggesting that Shunta was. However, this was prior to this legislation of the statute being amended, so the court is not applying that factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 513(d)(l)(v), the court must consider whether \u201cthe natural parent has: 1. subjected the child to: A. torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse; or B. chronic and life-threatening neglect; ...\u201d The court found no evidence of such abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Finally, F.L. \u00a7 513(d)(3) requires the court to \u201cconsider the evidence under paragraph (l)(i) through (iv) of this subsection regarding continuing or serious conditions or acts and may waive the child placement agency\u2019s obligations ... if the court, after appropriate evaluation of all efforts made and services rendered, finds by clear and convincing evidence that the waiver of those obligations is in the best interest of the child.\u201d The court below stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">[T]he court is convinced by clear and convincing evidence that it is in ... John\u2019s best interests to waive the department\u2019s obligations to mother under [the] subsection because of the specific (D)(l)(ii) finding that the court made as to Shunta being born while mother had a positive toxicology, so Pm waiving as to mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 120, 642 A.2d 201, is instructive. There, the Court considered \u201cwhether the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying the Department\u2019s petition for guardianship based on its finding that the termination of parental rights was not necessary to achieve permanency with custodial grandparents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that the court\u2019s finding that termination of parental rights was unnecessary for the child to remain in the custody of the grandparents did not justify a denial of the petition. <em>Id. </em>It said, at 335 Md. at 120, 642 A.2d 201:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWH\">Nowhere does F.L. Title 5 list necessity of terminating parental rights as a factor in determining whether it is in the child\u2019s best interests to terminate a natural parent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>rights to the child. Only termination of parental rights and a subsequent permanent placement, such as the adoption sought by the grandparents here, can provide [the child] with the permanency he needs and the Legislature has mandated. [The child\u2019s] continuation in foster care lacks the permanent legal status required by state law. He remains within the foster care system and thereby subject to administrative review every six months. He also remains under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, subject to periodic judicial review. This constant administrative and judicial supervision is disruptive to the lives of [the child] and his grandparents, and is the type of uncertainty the child welfare statutes were designed to avoid____ More importantly, while the grandparents have expressed their unequivocal desire to adopt [the child], if they are not his legal parents, they can later decide for whatever reasons, that they are no longer in a position to care for [the child]. If this were to occur, the grandparents would simply inform the juvenile court that retains jurisdiction over [the child] that they can no longer care for him and the court would have no alternative but to place him back in the foster care system. This possible \u201cfoster care drift\u201d is exactly what Congress and our General Assembly desire to avoid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlP\">Appellant argues that DSS\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941 </em>is misplaced, because \u201cthere is no assurance on this record that John\u2019s grandparents can or will adopt him.\u201d John is also concerned that an outside adoption would risk severance of his relationship with his grandparents, and prevent him from maintaining a relationship with his siblings. Thus, he contends that this case \u201cis critically different\u201d from the situation presented in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941- </em>Further, John argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Any-\">[Termination creates uncertainty for the child and may well work against permanency. Once the parental tie is severed, the child is a candidate for adoption. If the grandparents do not or cannot adopt the child \u2014 and there is no indication on this record that the grandparents can or are willing to adopt John \u2014 the child remains a ward of the State and may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>be removed from their care to encourage the child to bond with another adoptive resource. While such decision by the Department might be ill-advised, it could withstand scrutiny under a more deferential standard of review than the clear and convincing standard applicable to termination proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Certainly, there is no guaranty that John will remain with his grandparents, but life has no guaranties. Significantly, even if a problem arises with John\u2019s grandparents, John cannot be adopted by anyone without his consent. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5 \u2014 311(a)(3) (stating that a child who has reached the age of ten may not be adopted unless he or she consents). Therefore, John\u2019s concerns about the loss of contact with his biological family are completely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-13\">.

In view of the Court's decision, which was based on the statute, the Court declined to resolve the question of whether the children's rights were constitutional in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 642 A.2d 201. Although the Court did not reach the constitutional issue, it recognized, as we noted earlier, that a child \"ordinarily has an interest in maintaining a close familial relationship with siblings\u201d and other family members. 358 Md. at 16, 746 A.2d 379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">. Both F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d) and Rule 9-107(b) use the term \u201cshall.\u201d For example, F.L. \u00a7 5-322(d) provides that the court <em>\"shall </em>consider\u201d the failure to object as a consent. The term \"shall\u201d generally \"indicates a mandatory intent, unless the context of the statute indicates otherwise.\u201d <em>Burch v. State, </em>358 Md. 278, 284, 747 A.2d 1209 (2000); <em>see In Re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 60, 763 A.2d 136 (2000); <em>see Branch v.

But, the term \u201cshall\u201d does not always have a mandatory meaning. <em>See In Re Abiagail C., </em>138 Md.App. 570, 581, 772 A.2d 1277 (2001). (\"Depending on the context, placement, and use of the word 'shall,' and the nature of the constitutional provision or statute in which it appears, the word may have a mandatory connotation, so as to require that the action that 'shall' be done must be done, or may be directory in meaning, so as to exhort the doing of the thing that 'shall' be done without requiring it.\u201d). For cases in which the term \"shall\u201d was not considered mandatory by the Court of Appeals, <em>see, </em>e.g., <em>McCalls Ferry Power Co. v.
