WENNER (Retired, specially assigned), JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b345-8\">KRAUSER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Appellant, Howard Hopkins, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleging that he had been the subject of two negligently performed penile implant surgeries: the first was performed by appellee, Stanley R. Silber, M.D., and the second by Horst K. Schirmer, M.D. A jury found both doctors negligent and awarded appellant $15,000 in past medical expenses and $20,000 in non-economic damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Although the jury rejected appellees\u2019 defense of contributory negligence, it nonetheless found that appellant, by his post-surgery conduct, had negligently contributed to the injuries he sustained. This finding, appellant claims, unfairly depressed the amount of non-economic damages the jury awarded because, according to appellant, the issue of contributory negligence should not have been submitted to the jury in the first place. For that reason, among others, appellant now seeks a new trial solely on the question of non-economic damages. Because of a post-trial settlement of his claim against Dr. Schirmer, this appeal only involves appellant\u2019s claim against Dr. Silber. In turn, Dr. Silber has filed a cross-appeal against appellant, claiming that the circuit court should have set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the verdict because the jury found contributory negligence, if only as to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The specific issues presented by appellant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in permitting the issue of contributory negligence to go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that appellant had a duty to reduce his injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in instructing the jury on intervening superseding causes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">IV. Whether the circuit court erred in failing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial after appellee made a \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In his cross-appeal, appellee raises, as noted earlier, only one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">Whether the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the verdict and award of damages in favor of appellant because the jury found contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Appellant developed prostate cancer, requiring the surgical removal of his prostate gland and radiation treatment. As a result of the radiation treatment, appellant became impotent and consulted appellee, Stanley R. Silber, M.D. Appellee recommended at first a prescription drug, then a vacuum pump, and finally, penile injections. When these measures failed to cure the problem, appellee suggested penile implants, and appellant agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">On January 2, 1996, appellee surgically implanted two prostheses in appellant\u2019s penis. After surgery, Dr. Silber instructed appellant to refrain from sex for \u201cfive or six weeks,\u201d and to keep his penis in an upright position and in an erect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>state until it healed from the surgery. He further instructed appellant to return periodically to appellee\u2019s office for an examination to determine whether he could resume sex. As instructed, appellant returned to appellee\u2019s office on January 11, January 19, and February 2 of 1996. But, in disregard of appellee\u2019s instructions, appellant \u201ctr[ied] to have sex\u201d six different times before the recommended waiting period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Four weeks after surgery, appellant\u2019s post-operative pain \u201chad subsided somewhat,\u201d leaving him with a \u201csmall amount of pain.\u201d At his February 2 appointment with appellee, however, appellant informed appellee that he could not deflate his implants. They failed to function, according to appellant, as appellee had promised they would.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Unhappy with his penile implants, appellant canceled his sixth week appointment with appellee, scheduled for February 16. He thereupon made an appointment to see Horst Schirmer, M.D., later to be named appellee\u2019s co-defendant. On February 23, 1996, appellant met with Dr. Schirmer. At that consultation, appellant informed Dr. Schirmer that two prostheses had been implanted in his penis and that he was unable to deflate them. He also complained that \u201cthe prosthesis on the right side was pressing on the skin just behind the penis glans, the bulb on the end of the penis.\u201d It was, according to appellant, \u201cquite painful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Dr. Schirmer examined appellant and found ischemia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the right side of appellant\u2019s penis. Dr. Schirmer informed appellant that the prosthesis on the right side of his penis was too long and that it was causing the ischemia by \u201cputting too much pressure on the penis and starving the tissue in that area from getting blood.\u201d There was a danger, Dr. Schirmer explained, that the implant would extrude through the tissue \u201cout to the skin.\u201d He therefore recommended that the implant be removed. Until that could be done, Dr. Schirmer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>suggested relieving \u201csome of the pressure off of the right device by sticking a needle in the cylinder on the right side and pulling fluid out.\u201d Appellant agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">When appellant returned to his office, Dr. Schirmer performed that procedure but to no avail; appellant\u2019s penis remained erect and, according to appellant, \u201cpainful and swollen.\u201d Dr. Schirmer then advised appellant that the implants should be removed and replaced with, what he described as \u201cmalleable rods.\u201d The implants were removed, and the rods implanted in May, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">After surgery, however, the implant on the right side of appellant\u2019s penis broke through the right corporal body<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> inside his penis, requiring removal of the implant. The removal was performed by Harold J. Alfert, M.D., at Johns Hopkins Hospital in November of 1996. After removing the device, Dr. Alfert showed it to appellant. It was not a malleable rod, but, according to appellant, a \u201crubbery device,\u201d known as a \u201csizer,\u201d and, on the side of that device, were imprinted the words \u201cnot for implant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Alfert did not remove the malleable rod that Schirmer had implanted on the left side of appellant\u2019s penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Following the removal of the sizer, Dr. Alfert' referred appellant to Arthur Burnett, M.D. Dr. Burnett met with appellant and discussed with him the risks of undergoing another penile prosthesis surgery. The risks, according to Dr. Burnett, included \u201cdevice infection, erosion, malfunction, [and the] need for replacement.\u201d Dr. Burnett also informed appellant that \u201crepeated penial prosthesis surgeries can be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>problematic in terms of risks.\u201d \u201cThe concern,\u201d he explained, \u201cis that some of the penial tissues with scarring and perhaps poor circulation [may not] hold the device.... \u201d And he stated that \u201cthe risk of device failure for repeated surgeries are higher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A pre-surgical consultation with Dr. Burnett was scheduled as appellant appeared \u201cinclined to proceed ahead with penial prosthesis surgery.\u201d At that consultation, Dr. Burnett informed appellant that his \u201cbest recommendation for a successful surgery [was] to replace the [malleable rod] in the more healthy side of the penis ... with an inflatable device.\u201d The likelihood of success, Dr. Burnett opined, was \u201cactually very good.\u201d Dr. Burnett scheduled appellant for surgery and for a pre-operative evaluation. After undergoing the pre-operative evaluation, however, appellant canceled the surgery and never returned to Dr. Burnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">At trial, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Judith Tarleton, testified that appellant\u2019s pain from the operation performed by appellee subsided within three or four weeks of the surgery. She further testified that, following that three or four week period, she and appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse six times. Those attempts were both painful and unsuccessful. Consequently, appellant went to Dr. Schirmer for treatment. Tarleton stated that she and appellant have not been able to engage in sexual intercourse since November of 1996, notwithstanding the remaining left implant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Appellant\u2019s first expert witness was Dr. James Smolev, a urologist. Based on his review of appellant\u2019s medical records, Dr. Smolev testified that \u201c[i]t appeared that [appellee] put in a prosthesis on ... the right side of [appellant\u2019s] penis that was too large for the tissue to accept.\u201d Unable to deflate the device, appellant was in \u201cconstant pain.\u201d The implantation was, Dr. Smolev testified, a deviation from \u201caccepted standards of medical care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Later, according to Smolev, Dr. Schirmer correctly found that the implanted prosthesis was too long and had cut off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>blood supply of the surrounding tissues, causing ischemia. Dr. Smolev described the dangers of this condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Well tissues that don\u2019t have good blood supply cannot resist infection either. So if you combine a piece of plastic with an area of necrotic or dead tissue, that will automatically get infected, it will spread the infection at least in the penis and eventually that tissue will not be able to resist or hold in the plastic and the plastic will come piercing out of the end of the penis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Consequently, the implants should have been removed by Dr. Schirmer \u201cas soon as possible----\u201d \u201c[C]ertainly no more than two days\u201d after Dr. Schirmer had determined that appellant\u2019s right implant was \u201ctoo long,\u201d he opined. Nonetheless, Dr. Schirmer waited two- months before removing the right implant. This two-month wait, according to Dr. Smolev, \u201cmade [appellant\u2019s situation] worse.\u201d Dr. Smolev further testified that had Dr. Schirmer promptly removed appellant\u2019s right prothesis, there would have been \u201ca very reasonable chance within medical probability that [appellant\u2019s] penis could have been salvaged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Dr. Smolev also stated that the penile implant appellee inserted was not the type that could be deflated by drawing its fluid. He therefore opined that Dr. Schirmer\u2019s removal of fluid from appellant\u2019s implant \u201cwas not in accordance with the standard of care.\u201d He added that Dr. Schirmer also violated the standard of care when he implanted the sizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">As to whether appellant was a candidate for re-implantation, Dr. Smolev asserted that, based on the condition of appellant\u2019s penis, he \u201cwould have to give [appellant] a very high chance of failure\u201d and that it might \u201cmak[e] his condition much worse.... \u201d He explained that \u201cthe fact that there has been an erosion of the right cylinder ... [,] there\u2019s [no] spongy tissue or erectile tissue left.\u201d Dr. Smolev added that \u201cthere are a few surgeons who are experts ... who possibly could do it, but certainly it\u2019s heroic surgery.\u201d Appellant\u2019s condition, Dr. Smolev concluded, was permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Appellant\u2019s next expert witness was Dr. Burnett. In addition to the testimony that we have previously discussed, Dr. Burnett testified that, although he told appellant that there was a very good chance that the surgeiy he proposed would be successful, he did not think it was unreasonable for appellant not to go through with that surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Appellee\u2019s defense consisted of his testimony and the testimony of Michael Nasland, M.D. Appellee testified that appellant\u2019s January 19 and February 2 examinations revealed \u201cvery little discoloration.\u201d While acknowledging that appellant \u201cwas certainly having discomfort,\u201d he observed that that \u201cwas not extremely abnormal.\u201d Moreover, he claimed that there did not appear to be anything wrong with the size or placement of appellant\u2019s implants. \u201cThey seemed to be in good position,\u201d he opined.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Appellee also testified that his post-surgical examinations of appellant did not disclose any signs of ischemia. In fact, he stated that he was surprised that, several weeks later, Dr. Schirmer found ischemia. He further testified that he had told appellant \u201cit would be approximately six weeks before he could resume intercourse.\u201d He gave that instruction because time was needed \u201cfor both the incision to heal, [and] for the prosthesis to seat adequately in the corporal [body].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">At the close of his testimony, appellee stated that, \u201cto the best of his knowledge,\u201d he had performed the surgery on appellant correctly; had placed the correct size prosthesis in appellant; and had never \u201cobserved anything that led [him] in anyway to think that perhaps the wrong size prosthesis had been used on [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Appellee\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Michael Nasland, a urologist with the University of Maryland Hospital and director of the Maryland Prostate Center, testified that he had reviewed the medical records of Doctors Schirmer, Alfert, and Burnett, among others. He stated that a patient\u2019s premature attempts at sexual intercourse, shortly after penile implant surgery, could break the surgical incisions. He added that \u201cif you start to have sexual activity early, that hasn\u2019t healed completely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>there\u2019s the potential for more damage to the corporal bodies to occur then would normally occur from the operation.\u201d Dr. Nasland further testified that the malleable rod remaining in the left corporal body of appellant\u2019s penis was adequate for sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">According to the briefs of the parties, Jonathan Jarow, M.D. also testified. Because the testimony of Jarow was not included in the extract, we shall not consider what he might or might not have said at trial, regardless of the representations of the parties. <em>See Tretick v. Layman, </em>95 Md.App. 62, 79 n. 4, 619 A.2d 201 (1993) (holding that appellant failed to preserve issue for review because he failed to include in the extract pertinent portions of the trial transcript).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict of $15,000 for past medical expenses and $20,000 for non-economic damages. Dissatisfied with the non-economic damages award, appellant noted this appeal. We now turn to the issues presented by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Both parties claim that the circuit court erred in the manner in which it handled the issue of contributory negligence though, of course, for different reasons. Appellant contends that the issue should not have been submitted to the jury; appellee claims that it should have but not with the instructions given by the circuit court. Because these claims are intertwined, we shall consider them together. We turn first to appellant\u2019s claim, questioning the propriety of submitting this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in permitting the issue of contributory negligence to go to the jury because appellee purportedly failed to present any evidence that appellant\u2019s \u201cinjuries were caused by his actions.\u201d In addition, appellant claims that appellee\u2019s failure \u201cto assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>or claim contributory negligence in [his] answer to interrogatory bars the issue of contributory negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As to the latter argument, we note that neither the extract nor the record contains a copy of either appellant\u2019s interrogatories or appellee\u2019s answers. We therefore decline to address this argument. <em>See Salem Constr. Corp. v. Tompkins, </em>259 Md. 345, 346, 269 A.2d 824 (1970) (\u201cThe Court will not pass upon matter[s] not printed in the extract____\u201d). We note in passing, however, that the record contains appellee\u2019s answer to appellant\u2019s complaint, which asserts contributory negligence as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to send this issue to the jury. Maryland law requires \u201cthe submission of even meager evidence [of contributory evidence] to the jury,\u201d <em>See Chudson v. Ratra, </em>76 Md.App. 753, 769-70, 548 A.2d 172 (1988), and the evidence adduced in the instant case was substantially more than meager.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Both parties testified that appellee instructed appellant to refrain from sexual intercourse for \u201csix weeks.\u201d In fact, appellant testified that it was his understanding that \u201cthe plan\u201d called for him to return periodically to appellee\u2019s office for the purpose of determining whether he could resume having sexual intercourse. Appellant therefore knew that his premature attempts to engage in sexual intercourse involved some risk. Nonetheless, he attempted to have sexual intercourse no less than six times within the six week period during which he was to refrain from such activities. He did so in disregard of his doctor\u2019s orders. Moreover, appellee testified that the six week waiting, period was to allow \u201ctime for both the incision to heal, [and] for the prosthesis to seat adequately in the corporal [body],...\u201d And Dr. Nasland opined that a patient\u2019s premature attempts at sexual intercourse, shortly after penile implant surgery, could break the surgical incisions. He added that \u201cif you start to have sexual activity early, that hasn\u2019t healed completely, there\u2019s the potential for more damages to the corporal bodies to occur then would normally occur from the operation.\u201d Indeed, appellant\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>expert witness, Dr. Smolev, warned that the device should not be used for at least six weeks and compared a premature use of the device to \u201crunning a 100 yard dash a week after you have [had] a hip replacement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Furthermore, there is evidence that up to the time he attempted to have' intercourse, everything appeared to be going well. Indeed, appellant testified that, at his four week examination by appellee, his post-operative pain \u201chad subsided somewhat,\u201d leaving him with a \u201csmall amount of pain.\u201d Ap-pellee concurred with that assessment and added that, at the four week examination, nothing appeared wrong with the size or placement of appellant\u2019s implants. \u201cThey seemed to be in good position,\u201d he opined. Moreover, he did not notice any signs of ischemia. Appellant\u2019s only problem, at that time, was that he could not fully deflate the implants.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Judith Tarleton, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, also testified that appellant\u2019s post-surgical pain had subsided within three or four weeks of the surgery. She further stated that, after that three or four week period, she and appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse six times, and that, after those six attempts, appellant went to Dr. Schirmer with complaints of severe pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Notwithstanding this testimony, appellant argues that, without expert testimony \u201cto prove contributory negligence and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the claimed injuries,\u201d the issue should not have been permitted to go to the jury. As detailed above, there was considerable lay and expert testimony that, other than the difficulty in deflating the implants, appellant appeared to be having no unusual problems following the surgery performed by appellee. That absence of problems continued until, against doctor\u2019s orders, he repeatedly attempted to have sexual intercourse within weeks of his surgery. Moreover, experts for both sides testified as to the inadvisability of premature sexual activity and the consequences that would flow from making premature demands on the implanted devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Appellee contends that the circuit court\u2019s \u201ccontributory negligence instruction was erroneous\u201d for two reasons. First, appellee argues that, because the Court of Appeals reversed <em>Santoni </em>in <em>Moodie v. Santoni, </em>292 Md. 582, 441 A.2d 323 (1982), the Santoni-based instruction given by the circuit court was not a correct statement of the law. Second, appellee maintains that the circuit court\u2019s contributory negligence instruction was tantamount to an instruction on comparative negligence, a doctrine rejected by our appellate courts and legislature. <em>See, e.g., Franklin v. Morrison, </em>350 Md. 144, 167, 711 A.2d 177 (1998); <em>Harrison v. Montgomery County Board of Education, </em>295 Md. 442, 463, 456 A.2d 894 (1983). Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The instruction at issue stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">The rule of contributory negligence requires that the patient\u2019s negligence must be concurrent with that of the physician. If it occurs after the physician\u2019s negligence and merely adds to the effects, as opposed to being the cause of the patient\u2019s problem, it will not relieve the physician from liability. It may serve to mitigate or lessen the amount of damages that you award, however.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">And there is a question on the verdict sheet that asks you, \u201cIs contributory negligence in this case an affirmative defense?\u201d This is what it\u2019s referring to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">An affirmative defense is a bar. Think of it as the example of self-defense in an assault case. That prevents Howard Hopkins from holding the physician liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">If you find instead that it merely added to the effect, as opposed to being the cause of the patient\u2019s problem, it won\u2019t relieve the physician from liability. You can go on to consider damages and you can consider that as a mitigating factor in your deliberation as to the amount that you award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">That instruction was based upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Santoni v. Schaerf, </em>48 Md.App. 498, 428 A.2d 94 (1981). In that case, we quoted -with approval the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cThe rule of contributory negligence requires that the patient\u2019s negligence must be concurrent with that of the physician. If it occurs after the physician\u2019s negligence and merely adds to the effects, as opposed to being the cause of the patient\u2019s problem, it will not relieve the physician from liability; it will merely serve to \u2018mitigate\u2019 or lessen the amount of damages awarded to the patient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><em>Santoni </em>48 Md.App. at 505, 428 A.2d 94 (quoting Holder, <em>Medical Malpractice Law, </em>p. 302 (2nd ed.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><em>Santoni </em>as appellee claims, was reversed by the Court of Appeals but not for the reasons appellee implies. In <em>Santoni, </em>the issue before this Court was whether there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of contributory negligence. <em>See id. </em>at 505, 428 A.2d 94. Central to that question was the appropriate standard to be applied in making that determination. In <em>Santoni </em>we applied a \u201cmore likely than not test\u201d to the evidence, which consisted principally of \u201ca series of inferences.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 509, 428 A.2d 94. That approach was rejected by the Court of Appeals in <em>Moodie. </em>In so doing, the Court of Appeals held that the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d test \u201c[did] not correctly state the Maryland law.\u201d <em>See Moodie, </em>292 Md. at 590, 441 A.2d 323. \u201cThe proper test,\u201d the Court held, \u201cis ... that one would be entitled to an instruction that he was free of contributory negligence \u2018if there was no evidence from which a reasonable mind could find or infer that he had directly contributed to his own injury by behaving as an ordinarily prudent man would not behave, under the circumstance.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Lindenberg v. Needles, </em>203 Md. 8, 15, 97 A.2d 901 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Thus, the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of our decision in <em>Santoni </em>rested solely on the question of the appropriate standard to be applied to evidence of contributory evidence. In other words, this Court\u2019s determination in <em>Santoni </em>still stands: if contributory negligence \u201coccurs after the physician\u2019s negligence and merely adds to the effects, it will merely serve to \u2018mitigate\u2019 or lessen the amount of a damages awarded to the patient\u201d still stands. Consequently, the circuit court\u2019s instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tion, based on that determination, was not erroneous. Nor did it amount to a comparative negligence instruction, as appellee contends. It was a proper and, we believe, an appropriate recitation of the law concerning contributory negligence that merely aggravates an injury that is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">To bar recovery, the plaintiffs contributory negligence must have \u201csignificantly contributed to the injury.\u201d <em>See Smith v. Pearre, </em>96 Md.App. 376, 393, 625 A.2d 349 (1993)(quoting <em>Chudson, </em>76 Md.App. at 774, 548 A.2d 172). But if, on the other hand, the \u201cinjury flowing from the primary negligence is essentially complete prior ... to any negligence on the part of\u2019 the plaintiff and the plaintiffs negligence \u201csimply enhances the injury,\u201d it \u201cmay be an entirely correct approach\u201d to reduce the damages to the extent that the plaintiffs negligence \u201cenhances the injury.\u201d <em>See Chudson, </em>76 Md.App. at 772-73, 548 A.2d 172 (relying on 70 C.J.S. <em>Physicians and Surgeons </em>\u00a7 80(a) (1987)). Indeed, we believe this principle has been repeatedly recognized by the appellate courts of this State, whether it was dubbed \u201ccontributory negligence,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the \u201cdoctrine of avoidable consequences,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the \u201cdoctrine of minimization of damages.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Other contributory negligence states have adopted the same rule. <em>See, e.g., Lawrence v. Wirth, </em>226 Va. 408, 412, 809 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1983) (\u201c[A] patient\u2019s neglect of his health following his physician\u2019s negligent treatment may be a reason for reducing damages, but does not bar all recovery.\u201d); <em>Brazil v. United States of America, </em>484 F.Supp. 986, 991 (N.D.Ala. 1979) (\u201c \u2018Where liability for negligence or malpractice has been incurred by a physician, subsequent negligence of the patient, which aggravates the injury primarily sustained at the hands of the physician, does not discharge the latter from liability, but only goes in mitigation of damages.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In sum, we hold that the circuit court\u2019s contributory negligence instruction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Appellant next claims that there was no evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s instruction regarding his duty to mitigate damages in connection with his failure to have corrective surgery. Specifically, appellant states that \u201c[ajppellee did not prove Appellant\u2019s injuries could be minimized, did not prove that Appellant was aware his injuries could be minimized, and did not prove that Appellant should have accepted the risks of additional surgery.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u201c \u2018A litigant is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury, but only if that theory of the case is a correct exposition of the law and there is testimony in the case which supports it.\u2019 Thus, the general rule regarding instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tions to the jury has two aspects: (1) the instruction must correctly state the law, and (2) that law must be applicable in light of the evidence before the jury.\u201d <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 194, 401 A.2d 651 (1979) (citations omitted); <em>see also Wegad v. Howard Street Jewelers, Inc., </em>326 Md. 409, 414, 605 A.2d 123 (1992); <em>Kelbaugh v. Mills, </em>108 Md.App. 89, 94, 671 A.2d 41 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Appellant does not dispute the first aspect of that rule, that is, that the mitigation instruction correctly stated the law. But, he does dispute the second aspect, claiming that the evidence did not warrant such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The duty to mitigate damages \u201cserves to reduce the amount of damages to which a plaintiff might otherwise have been entitled had he or she used all reasonable efforts to minimize the loss he or she sustained as a result of a breach of duty by the defendant.\u201d <em>See Schlossberg, </em>73 Md.App. at 421-22, 534 A.2d 1003. \u201c[I]n order for the doctrine of minimization of damages to apply, there must first have been a breach of duty on the part of the defendant, who then raises an issue as to the propriety of the losses or damages claimed by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 422, 534 A.2d 1003. \u201c[T]he burden of proving that a loss could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable effort on part of the plaintiff is upon the defendant____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Appellant testified that, notwithstanding the remaining malleable rod in the left corporal body of his penis, he still could not achieve an erection, and Dr. Smolev testified that the damage to appellant\u2019s penis was permanent and that corrective surgery might make his condition worse. In contrast, Dr. Nasland testified that the remaining malleable rod was adequate for sexual intercourse. Furthermore, Dr. Burnett, appellant\u2019s own expert witness, stated that he had informed appellee that he believed that by replacing the malleable rod with an inflatable device, he could correct appellant\u2019s problem. He rated appellant\u2019s chances of success as \u201cvery good.\u201d Thus, the testimony of Drs. Nasland, Smolev, and Burnett justified an instruction on mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Appellant next contends that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by instructing the jury that it could consider a break in damages by a superseding intervening cause when it determined the damages caused by appellee\u2019s negligence.\u201d Unfortunately, appellant fails to state why the giving of that instruction constituted error. It is unclear to us whether he is challenging the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the instruction in question, or whether he is questioning the legal adequacy of the instruction itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5) provides that a brief must contain \u201c[a]rgument in support of the party\u2019s position.\u201d In the event that it does not, this Court \u201cmay dismiss the appeal or make any other appropriate order with respect to the case.\u201d Md. Rule 8-504(c). Accordingly, we have held that arguments not presented with particularity will not be considered on appeal. <em>See Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994). Unable to discern any reason why we should depart from this holding now, we shall give this issue no further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial because of the comments appellee made to the jury during closing argument. In his opening argument, appellant had asked the jury to award him one million dollars in non-economic damages. In response to that request, appellee argued to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">[APPELLEE]: ... [W]hat does [appellant] think this is, the Lotto or some Big Game, asking for a million dollars? How many years is it going to take you to work eight hours a day\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">At this point, appellant objected. When the court sustained that objection, appellee continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">[APPELLEE]: How many hours will it take you to achieve a million dollars when\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Once again, appellant objected. This time, however, appel-lee asked to approach the bench. When counsel assembled at the bench, appellant argued that the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d precluded appellee from \u201casking the jury to put themselves in somebody\u2019s position,\u201d and that a violation of that rule was \u201ctotally wrung and totally irreversible error.\u201d Appellant then requested a mistrial, whereupon the following discussion between the court and counsel ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">THE COURT: [Appellant], couldn\u2019t [appellee] say if someone earned $20 an hour and worked a 40-hour week, that\u2019s $800 or $40,000 a year, so then it would take\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">[APPELLANT]: I think probably he could say that, but he can\u2019t put the jury in that position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">[APPELLEE]: I\u2019ll do it that way just to move this along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">[APPELLANT]: You can\u2019t put the jury in the position of \u201cHow about you? How about your job? How are you going to come out of this?\u201d And I\u2019ve asked for a mistrial based on that improper argument on the part of defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019ve already told them \u2014 I instructed them on the per diem argument, which is the same thing. It\u2019s argument. They can accept it or reject it. But I\u2019ll sustain your objection and he said he would stay away from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnB\">Appellant argues that \u201c[t]he failure of the trial court to grant the requested mistrial or to properly instruct the jury resulted in the jury giving very little in the way of non-economic damages for a horrible injury.\u201d Appellant further contends that a violation of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d requires a mistrial. \u2022 We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u201c \u2018Ordinarily, the decision whether to grant a motion for a mistrial rests in the discretion of the trial judge,\u2019 and that appellate review \u2018is limited to whether there has been an abuse of discretion in denying the motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v. State, </em>355 Md. 206, 221, 734 A.2d 199 (1999) (quoting <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 277, 604 A.2d 489 (1992)). The failure to declare a mistrial after counsel has made improper remarks to the jury does not usually constitute an abuse of discretion. Indeed, \u201c[e]ven when a clearly improper remark is made, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>mistrial is not necessarily required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 734 A.2d 199. Instead,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">improper or prejudicial statements, remarks or arguments of counsel generally are cured by reproof by the trial judge; to his discretion customarily is left the choice of methods to protect the fair and unprejudicial workings of the judicial proceedings and his decision as to the effect of that choice upon the jury and only in the exceptional case, the blatant case, will his choice of cure and his decision as to its effect be reversed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>DeMay v. Carper, </em>247 Md. 535, 540, 233 A.2d 765 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Similarly, this Court has held that in responding to improper comments made by counsel to the jury, the trial judge \u201chas many options.\u201d <em>See Ferry v. Cicero, </em>12 Md.App. 502, 509, 280 A.2d 37 (1971). \u201c[H]e may fit the pattern to the cloth. He may conclude to take no action, he may admonish the jury, he may restrict or forbid altogether any further argument on the point, he may permit opposing counsel to respond, he may declare a mistrial, he may take any other appropriate action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The action taken by the trial judge in this case was appropriate and, we believe, cured whatever prejudice was generated by the comments in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Before closing arguments, the trial judge provided the jury with life expectancy tables, which they were told to use \u201cin determining the probable life expectancy of [appellant] as it bears on future losses and damages.\u201d The judge also instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he argument of counsel are not evidence and any dollar amount suggested by counsel and any damage formulation method recommended by counsel are merely suggestions of counsel as to the amount of damages that could be awarded.\u201d The judge further informed the jury that \u201c[e]ach side [was] free to argue,\u201d but that it was \u201cat liberty to accept all, part, or none of it.\u201d Given these measures, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s claim that the jury reduced the amount of non-economic damages it awarded because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>comments in question is groundless. Any number of factors, including the evidence that appellant may have been contribu-torily negligent, or failed to mitigate damages, or was not permanently impaired by appellee\u2019s negligence may have had a reductive effect on the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-17\">.
