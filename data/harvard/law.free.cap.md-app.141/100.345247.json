It requires that we construe section 734 of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (\u201cLEOBR\u201d), Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 734, and address how the right of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in that section inter-relates with an appeal under section 732 of LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">This appeal presents two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">I. Did appellee have standing to bring a petition for pre-hearing relief under LEOBR section 734?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">II. May the circuit court disturb a final administrative decision based on a petition brought under section 734 of LEOBR, or may it only alter a final agency decision when presented with an appeal under section 732?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We conclude that appellee had standing to file a petition under section 734 because he was denied the right to summon a witness under LEOBR section 730(j). Further, we hold that the circuit court, in the course of deciding appellee\u2019s section 734 appeal, properly vacated the decision on the merits of the disciplinary case. We shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision to remand appellee\u2019s case for a new administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Maryland Transit Authority (\u201cMTA\u201d), appellant, employed Paul Hayden, appellee, as a transit law enforcement officer. Hayden was assigned to the Light Rail Division. MTA charged Hayden with several violations of agency policy, including failing to carry a weapon while responding to a call, improperly using emergency equipment on a police vehicle, and inadequately supervising subordinates. An administrative hearing to consider these charges was originally scheduled before a hearing board convened under LEOBR for May 7, 1999, but later rescheduled to July 2, 1999. Because the officer originally named to chair the hearing board retired, Lt. Richard Wheeler was appointed chair in his place, by order dated May 16,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Hayden testified that he learned Wheeler had been appointed as substitute chair on May 21, 1999. He also claimed that he had provided a list of mitigation witnesses, including Lt. Wheeler, to his attorney on April 28, 1999. Hayden included Lt. Wheeler on the witness list because he had worked for him for a period of approximately eight years, and believed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>would be able to testify as to Hayden\u2019s work habits during that time. At the time he submitted the witness list to his attorney, Hayden believed another officer would be chairing the hearing board. Hayden did not file his witness list with MTA, however, until June 22,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">After seeing his name on Hayden\u2019s witness list, Wheeler asked Hayden whether it was a mistake that his name was included on the list. It is unclear from the record exactly when this conversation took place. According to Wheeler, Hayden responded that his attorney had advised him that putting Wheeler\u2019s name on the witness list would mean Wheeler would have to withdraw as chair of the hearing board. Wheeler then sought the advice of MTA counsel. He had no further personal contact with Hayden until the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">A preliminary meeting was scheduled for July 1, 1999, \u201cto discuss all outstanding issues.\u201d Hayden testified that he received notice of this meeting by letter, and that he was aware the issue of Wheeler being named as a witness would come up at that meeting. Neither Hayden nor his attorney attended the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The next day, on July 2, 1999, the administrative hearing was commenced. Both Hayden and his attorney were present. At the start of the hearing, the hearing board addressed Hayden\u2019s preliminary motion to sequester witnesses, including Wheeler. The board noted that this motion raised the issue of whether Wheeler could be summoned and, therefore, whether Wheeler could continue to chair the hearing board. At the end of the hearing, Wheeler stated that he would remain chair of the hearing board, and that the board would not issue a summons requiring him to testify.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">After meeting with the Board members and consulting with the Board\u2019s legal advisor ..., the decision of the Board was not to issue a summons for Lt. Wheeler as it is an improper use of a summons to change a Board member and that I will remain as the Board Chairman and reaching a decision in this case, it is on the record that the Board will restrict all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>conclusions to the evidence as presented to the Board and nothing else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In response, Hayden\u2019s attorney advised that he would be going to court that day to get a show cause order. Wheeler then replied, \u201cO.K. I presume at this point the Board will sit in adjournment and re-proceed whenever the court\u2019s made a decision. Would that [be] a correct response.\u201d At this point, all parties agreed to await the circuit court\u2019s decision on Hayden\u2019s section 784 petition. The hearing board adjourned until October 14, 1999, to allow time for that resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Four days later, on July 6, 1999, Hayden filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking an order \u201cto show cause why he should not be afforded his rights under the LEOBR to call witnesses of his choice.\u201d The court issued a show cause order on July 9, 1999. MTA answered the order on August 3,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The circuit court did not hold a hearing on Hayden\u2019s section 734 petition before the October 14 date that the hearing board set to reconvene. On October 20, 1999, Lt. Wheeler notified Hayden that the hearing board would proceed with the disciplinary hearing. In a letter to Hayden\u2019s attorney, Wheeler explained why.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">MTA has consistently attempted to elicit any proffer of testimony which you would expect in my role as a potential witness. You have refused to attend a pre-hearing meeting in an attempt to resolve this, and ... I have no personal knowledge as to your client\u2019s performance which would enable me to be a competent witness on his behalf. I still await to hear any proffer from you to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">Because of this, there seems to be no valid reason why this administrative proceeding can\u2019t proceed as planned____ We will convene the Board as previously scheduled. At that time, if a proffer is made which would indicate that I, as Chairman of the Board, could be a competent mitigation witness on your client\u2019s behalf, then, and only then, will this Board take action to ensure that a replacement Chairman is appointed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The next day, on October 21, 1999, the hearing board resumed the disciplinary proceedings against Hayden. With the circuit court proceeding on Hayden\u2019s petition under section 734 still pending, the hearing board, chaired by Wheeler, considered MTA\u2019s charges of misconduct. Neither Hayden nor his attorney was present at the hearing. On October 26, the board found Hayden guilty of the three charges against him, and recommended a 14 day suspension. On February 17, 2000, the police chief adopted that recommendation, and ordered Hayden\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">More than one year after the hearing board issued its recommendation, on October 27, 2000, the circuit court issued its decision on Hayden\u2019s petition. It reversed the hearing board\u2019s decision to deny Hayden\u2019s request to summon Wheeler, and vacated the disciplinary order against Hayden. MTA filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The Hearing Board\u2019s Denial Of Appellee\u2019s Request To Summon Lt. Wheeler As A Witness Under LEOBR Section 730(j)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">LEOBR was enacted \u201cto guarantee that certain procedural safeguards be offered to police officers during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.\u201d <em>Abbott v. Admin. Hearing Bd., </em>33 Md.App. 681, 682, 366 A.2d 756 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 727 (1977). Section 734 of LEOBR provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">[a]ny law enforcement officer who is denied any right afforded by this subtitle may apply at any time prior to the commencement of the hearing before the hearing board ... to the circuit court of the county where he is regularly employed for any order directing the law enforcement agency to show cause why the right should not be afforded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The purpose of section 734 is \u201cto enforce the accused officer\u2019s rights under the Act, not to restrict the agency\u2019s legitimate right to discipline errant officers.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Anderson, </em>73 Md.App. 604, 616, 535 A.2d 955 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In his petition to the circuit court, Hayden asserted that the hearing board denied his right to summon an important witness under LEOBR. section 730CJ),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by refusing to summon Wheeler as a witness, or to force Wheeler to withdraw as chairman of the hearing board. The circuit court agreed. Based on Hayden\u2019s section 734 petition, it reversed the hearing board\u2019s denial of the summons, vacated the disciplinary order, and remanded for a new administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">On appeal, MTA asserts that at the time Hayden filed his petition in the circuit court, he had not been \u201cdenied any right afforded\u201d under LEOBR. Without such a denial, it argues, Hayden had no standing to seek relief under section 734. MTA relies on the hearing board\u2019s request that Hayden submit a proffer of Wheeler\u2019s expected testimony before the board ruled on Hayden\u2019s request to summon Wheeler as a witness. It insists that because Hayden failed to respond to the board\u2019s proffer request, the board never actually <em>denied </em>Hayden the right to call Wheeler as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We are not persuaded by MTA\u2019s contentions. Requiring a proffer before issuing a summons in an administrative hearing is approved procedure. <em>See Forman v. MVA, </em>332 Md. 201, 208, 630 A.2d 753 (1993). There is nothing in the record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>however, to indicate that the hearing board requested a proffer before the July 2,1999 hearing, at the end of which the board denied Hayden\u2019s request to summon Wheeler as a witness. The hearing board explicitly stated that \u201cthe decision of the Board was not to issue a summons for Lt. Wheeler as it is an improper use of a summons to change a Board member and ... [Wheeler] will remain as the Board Chairman[.]\u201d The record before us shows that the hearing board did not request a proffer from Hayden until October 20, 1999, more than three months after it denied Hayden\u2019s request for a summons, and after Hayden obtained a show cause order from the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">We hold that Hayden had standing to petition for relief under section 734 because the hearing board denied his request to summon a witness. Even though we agree with MTA in principle that the \u201cright to compulsory process is not absolute,\u201d we cannot conclude that the hearing board\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>demand for a proffer somehow \u201cundid\u201d its denial of Hayden\u2019s request. For this reason, we reject MTA\u2019s complaint that a proffer was necessary to prevent Hayden from tactically abusing his right to call witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s Use Of LEOBR Section 734 To Vacate A Final Decision Of The Hearing Board</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">MTA argues that the circuit court erred when it construed section 734 as the proper vehicle for Hayden to seek an order vacating the decision to suspend Hayden. MTA asserts that an officer may appeal from a final agency decision, and that the circuit court may grant relief, only under LEOBR section 732. Section 732 allows an officer to challenge a \u201cdecision\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>rendered by the police chief following the findings and recommendations of the hearing board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 732. In essence, MTA asks us to hold that Hayden\u2019s section 734 claim became moot on October 26, 1999, the date that the hearing board rendered its decision and recommendation. Hayden counters that interpreting the statute as MTA advocates would allow MTA and hearing boards to circumvent an officer\u2019s section 734 rights. He suggests that a hearing board, in the face of an officer\u2019s petition to show cause, could expedite the disciplinary hearing, and, by reaching a quick decision, moot the officer\u2019s section 734 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In construing a statute, our task is \u201cto discern and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>FOP, Montgomery County Lodge No. 35 v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 173-74, 680 A.2d 1052 (1996). \u201cThe words actually used in the statute, and their \u2018plain meaning\u2019 are the best indicator of that intent.\u201d <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation v. Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 11 n. 9, 702 A.2d 690 (1997). When a statute is silent about an issue, we should consider its purpose in construing it to address that issue. <em>See Papillo v. Pockets, Inc., </em>119 Md.App. 78, 87, 704 A.2d 448 (1997). \u201c[W]e-construe the statute as a whole, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Blondell v. Baltimore City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>341 Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639 (1996). The statute should be construed so as to avoid an \u201cillogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201c[I]n ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, all parts of a statute are to be read together to find the intention as to any one part and ... all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Police </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Comm\u2019r of Baltimore City, </em>211 Md. 357, 361, 127 A.2d 625 (1956). \u201cIf there is no clear indication to the contrary, and it is reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Following these canons of statutory interpretation, we look first to the plain language of section 734. Section 734 indicates that the Legislature intended to give police officers facing disciplinary charges the unusual right to appeal to a higher authority before the administrative hearing begins. In this respect, section 734 differs from section 732, which was designed as the mechanism for an officer to challenge a final administrative decision. As we said in <em>Cochran, </em>\u201csection 734 is not a general judicial review provision.... It is a very special provision, allowing resort to the court \u2018prior to the commencement of the hearing before the hearing board.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cochran, </em>73 Md.App. at 613, 535 A.2d 955 (quoting LEOBR \u00a7 734).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The plain language of section 734, however, does not speak directly to the question of what should happen to the underlying administrative proceeding while a section 734 petition is pending in circuit court. Thus, consistent with well established canons of statutory interpretation, we must construe section 734 in light of its objectives and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In <em>Cochran, </em>we recognized that \u201cLEOBR was enacted \u2018to guarantee that certain procedural safeguards be offered to police officers during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could lead to disciplinary action[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 535 A.2d 955 (citing <em>Abbott v. Admin. Hearing Bd., </em>33 Md. App. 681, 682, 366 A.2d 756 (1976), <em>cert. denied </em>280 Md. 727 (1977)). \u201cThe purpose of [section 734] ... is not to review what the trial board or police chief <em>has done </em>but to assure that the police agency <em>will do </em>what the law requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613, 535 A.2d 955. In light of this purpose, we held that although section 734 does not grant the circuit court explicit authority to terminate administrative proceedings, under certain circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>stances, \u201c[section] 734 must necessarily include\u201d that authority. <em>Id. </em>at 613, 535 A.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The instant case presents an analogous question that is not resolved by explicit language in LEOBR. We conclude that although section 734 does not grant the circuit court explicit authority to vacate an administrative decision that resulted from an improper denial of an officer\u2019s procedural rights under LEOBR, section 734 must necessarily include that authority. <em>See id. </em>To moot a section 734 action because it is not resolved before the administrative hearing that it challenges would defeat the \u201cpre-hearing review\u201d purpose of that statute. Section 734 provides that an aggrieved officer must <em>file </em>his petition to show cause before the administrative hearing. Thus, if an officer does not petition the circuit court for relief prior to the administrative hearing, he or she cannot use section 734 to challenge the administrative decision after the fact. When, however, an officer timely files a section 734 petition, the purpose of section 734 \u2014 \u201cto assure that the police agency <em>will do </em>what the law requires\u201d \u2014 mandates that the circuit court\u2019s section 734 decision, rather than the administrative decision handed down in the meantime, govern the outcome. <em>See id. </em>Any other interpretation would render section 734, and an officer\u2019s right to a pre-hearing remedy, a nullity. Further, to require an officer in appellant\u2019s position to file two appeals, one under section 734, and a later one under 732, both raising the same issue, is an illogical use of judicial resources, and imposes an unnecessary burden on the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">MTA faults Hayden for \u201cfailing] to request or press for any timely intervention in the proceedings of the administrative [hearing] board\u201d and for failing to obtain a hearing in circuit court prior to the conclusion of the hearing board proceedings. Although LEOBR does not contain a provision that the administrative proceeding must automatically be stayed pending resolution of the section 734 appeal, we agree with MTA that Hayden could have requested the circuit court to stay the administrative proceedings pending resolution of the section 734 appeal. Indeed, seeking a stay is a preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>approach. The circuit court had equitable authority to grant a stay, in accordance with established principles and procedures governing judicial review of administrative decisions. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7-205 (\u201c[u]pon motion and after hearing, the court may grant a stay\u201d of an \u201corder or action of [an] administrative agency\u201d pending judicial review authorized by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We do not agree with MTA, however, that Hayden was required to seek a stay. MTA was on notice that the circuit court proceeding was pending, and indeed, indicated initially that it would await the outcome of that appeal. Hayden should not be penalized for the slower pace of the circuit court proceedings as compared to administrative hearings. We hold that when MTA elected to proceed in the face of the circuit court\u2019s order to show cause, it did so at the risk of the court vacating any administrative decision resulting from the challenged proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">MTA insists that the circuit court \u201cconverted the prehearing remedial thrust of section 734 into the judicial review of a final agency action under section 732.\u201d Again, we disagree. The circuit court\u2019s reversal of the MTA hearing board\u2019s decision was not based on a review of the merits of the disciplinary decision. Rather, it vacated the administrative decision solely because the hearing board denied Hayden a specific procedural right protected by LEOBR, <em>i.e., </em>the right to summon a witness. <em>See </em>Art. 27, section 730(j). The denial of this right tainted the results of the administrative hearing because it excluded witness testimony before the hearing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Finally, MTA calls upon the \u201clong standing principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to judicial review,\u201d arguing that in asking the circuit court to reverse the MTA hearing board\u2019s decision, Hayden attempts improperly to by-pass MTA administrative proceedings. The simple answer to this argument is that section 734 is, quite clearly, a statutory exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>To construe section 734 as MTA advocates would frustrate its purpose and effectively deny officers the \u201cvery special\u201d procedural protection afforded them by the Legislature. <em>See Cochran, </em>73 Md.App. at 613, 535 A.2d 955. Our conclusion is consistent with the nature of section 734 as a pre-hearing remedy designed to ensure a law enforcement officer a fair hearing. We believe this holding protects a law enforcement officer\u2019s rights under LEOBR, while not \u201crestricting] the agency\u2019s legitimate right to discipline errant officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 535 A.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. Section 730(j) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\"><em>Summonses. </em>\u2014 (1) The chief, or hearing board ... shall in connection with any disciplinary hearing have the power to ... issue summonses to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses....

We were not persuaded by the MTA's assertion, during oral argument, that Hayden\u2019s mere awareness that the issue of Wheeler being called as a witness might come up during the preliminary meeting called on July 1, 1999 implies that the MTA or the board was requesting a proffer before the July 2, 1999 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">.
