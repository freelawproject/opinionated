At the conclusion of a bench trial, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County found appellant not guilty of negligent driving and reckless driving and guilty of, inter alia, two counts of manslaughter by automobile, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>was sentenced to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction for two consecutive ten year terms for manslaughter by automobile, concurrent terms of twenty years and five years for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, respectively, the sentences for possession of narcotics to run consecutive to one ten year term for manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On this appeal, appellant asks us whether the trial court erred when it found him guilty of two counts of manslaughter by automobile after having found him not guilty of reckless driving and negligent driving. Appellant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and manslaughter by automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s acquittal of appellant on the reckless driving and negligent driving charges precludes a finding of guilt on the two counts of manslaughter by automobile and hence we are constrained to overturn the manslaughter convictions, obviating the need to consider the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the manslaughter convictions. We affirm appellant\u2019s convictions for possession of cocaine with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>intent to distribute and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On February 21, 2000, at approximately 9:00 p.m., a car driven by Irving Edlow and a car driven by appellant collided near the intersection of Smith Avenue and Maurlene Road in Baltimore County, Maryland. Edlow was killed in the accident, but his two passengers \u2014 wife, Joan, and friend, Molly Bleakman \u2014 survived. In the vehicle driven by appellant; passenger Dawn Johnson was killed, while appellant and passengers Damien Green and Tania Wise survived. Recovered from the car driven by appellant after the accident were fifty glass vials of crack cocaine and fifteen small packets of marijuana from under the \u201cfront left driver\u2019s seat on the floorboard\u201d; a bag containing crack cocaine was found on the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Appellant was charged in a twenty-three count indictment with two counts of manslaughter by automobile, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, negligent driving, reckless driving, and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Several witnesses described the events leading up to the collision. Baltimore County Police Officer Kevin Jones testified that, when he attempted to stop appellant who was driving a white Oldsmobile Intrigue in the 5800 block of Park Heights Avenue, appellant took off \u201cat a high rate of speed.\u201d Officer Jones and an officer in a police cruiser gave chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Wise and Green were in the vehicle with appellant when appellant was stopped by the police. Wise testified that, when she saw a police officer behind the car, appellant \u201cput his feet [sic] on the gas and took off\u2019 and continued to \u201cride the car faster, faster.\u201d Wise further testified, on direct examination, that she estimated the speed of their vehicle to be at least eighty miles per hour. Appellant changed lanes and he passed more than one dozen cars during the chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>According to Green, appellant \u201cwas going kind of fast,\u201d as he eluded police. Despite Green\u2019s admonitions to slow down more than once, \u201c[b]ecause [appellant] was driving fast,\u201d appellant continued to speed. While standing near the corner of Smith Avenue and Seven Mile Lane smoking a cigarette, Batina Davis observed appellant\u2019s vehicle traveling at \u201ca high rate of speed.\u201d Davis estimated the car\u2019s speed in excess of seventy miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Another witness, Howard Blaecman, was driving his car on Smith Avenue at the time of the chase and watched appellant\u2019s car pass him; he recalled turning to his passenger and commenting, \u201cman, that is fast.\u201d Approximately five minutes after appellant\u2019s car passed him during the chase, Blaecman saw the same white car again at the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The car that appellant was driving struck Edlow\u2019s car as Edlow was making a U-turn at the intersection of Maurlene Road and Smith Avenue. Joan Edlow testified that she did not see any cars coming as they were making the U-turn. After the collision, Wise and appellant kicked out the windshield and fled from the scene. Wise was apprehended by Officer Jones a short distance from the scene. Appellant was not apprehended until sometime later.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Baltimore County Police Officer William Pumphrey, who was qualified as an expert in traffic accident reconstruction, examined the scene and the vehicle driven by appellant. The posted speed limit on Smith Avenue, according to Officer Pumphrey, was thirty miles per hour. Unable to accurately determine the speed of either car at the time of impact, he stated that appellant had been \u201c[g]oing at a high rate of speed.\u201d Inspection of the car driven by appellant revealed the baggie containing fifty vials of crack cocaine and fifteen small packets of marijuana on the floorboard under the driver\u2019s seat. A baggie containing crack cocaine was also found on the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Appellant was driving a rental car from Avis Rent-A-Car (Avis) at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. The car had been rented by Robert Hall and Howard Steptoe on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>February 11, 2000. Steptoe testified that, when Hall paid for the rental, he saw Hall give the keys to appellant. Thereafter, Steptoe saw appellant on at least two occasions with the car\u2014 once driving it and once standing next to it, with no one inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">David Evans, an employee with Avis, testified that it is normal procedure that every car turned in and prepared for rental is a \u201cquick turn around ... [in which] the car is ... regased, tires checked, fluids checked, vacuumed, windows cleaned, ashtrays emptied, all trash and everything is removed from the car.\u201d Evans further testified that the procedure includes inspection of the trunk, glove compartment, and the console area underneath the seats to reveal any property that may have been left by the previous renter. There was nothing to indicate that the procedure was not followed with the car Hall and Steptoe rented.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the trial court found appellant not guilty of the charges of reckless driving and negligent driving and guilty of the charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Also, based on appellant\u2019s recklessness, speed, and pre- and post-impact conduct, the trial court found appellant guilty of two counts of manslaughter by automobile. Additional facts will be supplied as needed in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Ank\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Relying on the fact that the trial court found appellant not guilty of reckless driving and not guilty of negligent driving, then finding appellant guilty of two counts of manslaughter by automobile shortly thereafter, appellant assigns error to the court\u2019s finding of guilt as to manslaughter because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">[t]hese guilty verdicts cannot stand. Once the court had found [a]ppellant not guilty of negligent driving and not guilty of reckless driving, the court was precluded under: (1) Maryland common law; (2) Maryland common law dou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ble jeopardy principles; and (3) the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy principles, from finding [a]ppellant guilty of manslaughter by automobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Citing <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 54, 512 A.2d 358 (1986), he further posits that \u201cinconsistent verdicts by a court in a criminal case are not ordinarily permitted as a matter of Maryland common law.\u201d He reminds us, citing Ford <em>v. State, </em>274 Md. 546, 553, 337 A.2d 81 (1975), that, by contrast, inconsistent verdicts by juries in criminal cases are generally tolerated. Ultimately, or possibly as a backstop position, relying on <em>Ferrell v. State, </em>318 Md. 235, 567 A.2d 937 (1990), double jeopardy\u2019s sibling, collateral estoppel, is offered as a bar to his two manslaughter convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Of the multi-faceted assail on his manslaughter convictions, the <em>Blockburgef</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test [or what has come to be known as the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test variety of double jeopardy] appears to be the touchstone of appellant\u2019s argument. Procedurally, relief from a subsequent prosecution would be via the doctrine of <em>autrefois acquit, </em>normally interposed by way of a plea. Seizing upon our seemingly unconditional language that \u201cappellant failed utterly to raise this issue [the double jeopardy claim] at the trial <em>now under review </em>and nothing is, therefore, preserved for appellate review,\u201d in <em>Howell v. State, </em>56 Md. App. 675, 678, 468 A.2d 688, <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 426, 474 A.2d 218 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1039, 105 S.Ct. 520, 83 L.Ed.2d 408 (1984), the State\u2019s principal argument is that the double jeopardy claim is not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In deciding whether there is merit to appellant\u2019s claim that his manslaughter convictions are barred by the findings of not guilty of negligent driving and reckless driving, we must first determine which, if any, of the theories advanced by appellant pertain to the case at hand. Not suggested by either party is what may in actuality have happened, to wit: the unfortunate findings and their sequence were simply a slip of the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>tongue by an accomplished and experienced trial judge attempting to wade through a sea of charges against appellant. Of note, in responding to appellant\u2019s claim that his convictions for manslaughter are precluded by not guilty findings of the lesser included charges, the State puts virtually all of its proverbial \u201ceggs in one basket,\u201d i .e., that the issue is not preserved. The State does make a valiant effort, much as an afterthought, that, \u201calthough the court below found that [appellant\u2019s] conduct did not meet the sufficiency of the two statutory offenses under the Transportation article, ... there is no doubt the evidence was sufficient for manslaughter by automobile.\u201d That argument is supported only by the court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s speeding at seventy or eighty miles per hour and his failure to keep a lookout for other vehicles constituted \u201cwanton and reckless disregard.\u201d Thus, the State, in essence, argues that, notwithstanding the court\u2019s finding that appellant was not guilty of negligent driving or reckless driving, the findings of guilt of excessive speed and failing to keep a proper lookout for other vehicles provided independent support for appellant\u2019s manslaughter convictions. For the reasons set forth, <em>infra, </em>we reject the State\u2019s \u201cindependent\u201d evidentiary predicate for appellant\u2019s convictions for manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Having set forth appellant\u2019s several related theories, the precise language the trial court employed in entering its findings of not guilty and guilty of the charges before it and the sequence of those findings is essential to which of the theories, if any, are applicable and whether there is merit to the State\u2019s assertion that appellant\u2019s challenge to his manslaughter convictions was not preserved. In finding appellant not guilty of reckless driving and not guilty of negligent driving, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">THE COURT: Reckless driving and negligent driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, for all the reasons I outlined in my argument for automobile manslaughter, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>opinion, I would ask the [c]ourt to find obviously there is negligence, but there is a lot more than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">It is not only reckless, this goes beyond\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">THE COURT: <em>But the only thing is speed. You got to have merger. Not guilty as to both.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">All right. Let me tell you where I am. Anybody want to hear \u2014 here is what I\u2019m going to do. I have found him not guilty of 7, not guilty of 8, not guilty of 9, not guilty of 10, guilty of 11, not guilty of 12, 13 merges into 11, guilty of 14, guilty of 15, guilty of 16, guilty of 17, guilty of 18, 19 merges into 20, 20 is failure to control speed, guilty, 21 [reckless driving] is not guilty, 22 [negligent driving] is not guilty, and 23 was not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Immediately thereafter, the court found appellant guilty of the first count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and the third count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and merged the second and fourth counts of simple possession of cocaine and marijuana, respectively, into the convictions for possession with intent to distribute. In finding appellant guilty of manslaughter by automobile, the court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">With regard to manslaughter by automobile, I\u2019m convinced that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to both. The individuals who testified that he was speeding, I believe their testimony. I believe that although not as definitive as some people with a stopwatch would be able to offer, that 70 or 80 as testified to was the speed that this gentleman was going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">With regard to whether it constitutes reckless and wanton conduct, I find that it does. He failed to maintain a proper lookout. He was going so fast he did not see the Camry. I believe the people \u2014 the lady when she says to me I was there, I looked, I saw, and it was safe to make that turn. He was going so fast to get away from the police at that particular point that he didn\u2019t care. He did not maintain a proper lookout. He was definitely doing excessive speed under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>I believe the witnesses who testified to that, he thought that out. He flew from the scene. He didn\u2019t care about anyone else but himself, responsibility, not getting caught. Anybody else was absolutely of no importance to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">Nature and force of the impact indicates to me that he was going very fast. He caused the accident, not anyone else. His speed, his intent on full speed ahead, let\u2019s get away from these police, the nature and injuries and damage to the vehicle involved is another factor which comes into my determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">The nature of the neighborhood and the environment where the accident took place. It is not school time at 2:80 in the afternoon, but it is a residential neighborhood that indicates to anyone that you do not go that fast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">His pre[-] and post[-]impact conduct. Pre meaning a police car is pulling up next to me, I know I\u2019m doing things wrong; let us floor it, something that bodes against him, plus his post[-]impact conduct in getting out and running away and saying the devil with anyone else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">I find those factors do exist and they convince me that this is wanton and reckless disregard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">That car at this [appellant\u2019s] hands was an absolute engine of destruction at that particular time, waiting for an accident to come because he was trying to get away from the police, he had drugs in the car, something else is going on. Whatever it is that he was trying to get away, he pushed them down, pushed it to the point that he was speeding as fast as he could possibly. He was an absolute engine of destruction at that particular point and unfortunately two people are dead as a result of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">I accept the testimony that the impact caused by him was the nexus of the death of both of these individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">I do know what you said about Mr. Green did not remember much as far as speed. I find Mr. Green has a very selective memory, just enough to get him off his own case but he is not going to go to anything else. Guilty of 5 and 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Our task, before addressing the State\u2019s non-preservation argument, simply put, is to determine what \u00e1re the legal consequences which flow from the court\u2019s not guilty verdicts. Because there could be no plea in bar prior to trial and the theories argued on appeal were not presented below, we must decide whether appellant\u2019s manslaughter convictions are precluded under Maryland common law double jeopardy principles, Fifth Amendment double jeopardy principles under the U.S. Constitution, inconsistent verdicts by a court in criminal cases under Maryland common law, or collateral estoppel under decisional authority. <em>See Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Inconsistent Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Inconsistent verdicts in a jury trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are generally tolerated under Maryland law. <em>See Shell, </em>307 Md. at 54, 512 A.2d 358; <em>Ford, </em>274 Md. at 553, 337 A.2d 81; <em>see also Johnson v. State, </em>238 Md. 528, 541-42, 209 A.2d 765 (1965)(holding that inconsistent verdicts may stand because, while the verdicts are perhaps the result of compromise or mistake, there should be no speculation into such matters). Inconsistent verdicts by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>trial judge, however, are not tolerated. <em>See United States v. Maybury, </em>274 F.2d 899, 903-05 (2d Cir.1960); <em>see also Shell, </em>307 Md. at 55-58, 512 A.2d 358 (stating that <em>Ford </em>does not justify inconsistent verdicts from a trial judge and discussing <em>Johnson, supra, </em>with approval); <em>Johnson, </em>238 Md. at 543-45, 209 A.2d 765 (discussing <em>Maybury </em>with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In <em>Shell, </em>the appellant argued that he should not have been convicted by the trial judge of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence after the trial judge had acquitted him of the predicate felonies or crimes of violence \u2014 attempted first degree and second degree murder. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. The Court of Appeals granted appellant\u2019s petition for a <em>writ of certiorari </em>and considered whether acquittal of the predicate felony or crime of violence required acquittal of the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of the felony or crime of violence; the Court reversed the appellant\u2019s conviction of the handgun offense. In holding that the verdicts were inconsistent at trial, the Court opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">commission of a felony or crime of violence is an essential ingredient of the ... handgun offense. It is an element of the crime. If the jury determines that the accused did not commit a felony or crime of violence but is guilty of use of a handgun in the commission of such felony or crime of violence, the jury has obviously rendered inconsistent verdicts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 53, 512 A.2d 358. The inconsistency resulted when the trial court acquitted appellant of the predicate felony, which was an element of the crime for which he was subsequently convicted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court of Appeals, quoting <em>Maybury, </em>held: There is no need to permit inconsistency in the disposition of various counts so that the judge may reach unanimity with himself; on the contrary, he should be forbidden this easy method for resolving doubts.... We do not believe we would enhance respect for law or for the courts by recognizing for a judge the same right to indulge in \u201cvagaries\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>disposition of criminal charges that, for historic reasons, has been granted the jury.... We reverse for inconsistency ... because we can have no confidence in a judgment convicting Maybury of one crime when the judge, by his acquittal of another, appears to have rejected the only evidence that would support the conviction here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>238 Md. at 543, 209 A.2d 765 (quoting <em>Maybury, </em>274 F.2d at 903, 905).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In <em>Shell, </em>the Court of Appeals relied on <em>Maybury </em>and its own decision in <em>Johnson, </em>holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">it would be the height of appellate inconsistency for us to depart from the principles of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Maybury </em>and hold that inconsistent verdicts in non[-]jury trials will generally be permitted and will be sustained in the present case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Shell, </em>307 Md. at 57, 512 A.2d 358. Based on the above, pellucidly inconsistent verdicts by a trial judge, under Maryland law, cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In the case at bar, appellant was acquitted of negligent driving and reckless driving but was convicted of manslaughter by automobile, pursuant to Md.Code (1996 Repl.Vol, 1999 Supp.), art. 27, \u00a7 388:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">Every person causing the death of another as the result of the driving, operation or control of an automobile, motor vehicle, locomotive, engine, car, streetcar, train, vessel, or other vehicle in a <em>grossly negligent manner, </em>shall be guilty of a felony to be known as \u201cmanslaughter by automobile, motor vehicle, locomotive, engine, car, streetcar, train, vessel, or other vehicle,\u201d and the person so convicted shall be sentenced to jail or the house of correction for not more than 10 years, or be fined not more than $5,000 or be both fined and imprisoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 388, <em>\u201cgrossly negligent </em>\u201d operation of a motor vehicle is clearly an element of the crime of manslaughter by automobile. By its terms, <em>grossly negligent </em>driving involves a higher degree of negligence than does <em>mere negligent </em>driving. Therefore, one convicted of a crime of which <em>grossly negligent </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>driving was an element, he or she would also be guilty of <em>negligent </em>driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Appellant, acquitted of the charge of negligent driving, was subsequently convicted of manslaughter by automobile. Appellant\u2019s guilt of manslaughter by automobile was predicated on grossly negligent driving, which rendered him irrefutably guilty of the lesser offense of negligent driving. The verdicts were inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">While the Court of Appeals has held that inconsistent verdicts in bench trials will not be tolerated, the Court set forth an apparent exception to that rule in <em>Johnson. </em>WTien a trial judge, on the record, explains an apparent inconsistency in the verdicts and, in doing so, demonstrates that the court\u2019s action was proper and that there was no unfairness, the verdicts will be sustained. <em>See Shell, </em>307 Md. at 56, 512 A.2d 358 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>238 Md. at 545, 209 A.2d 765). In the case at hand, however, the <em>Johnson </em>exception does not apply, because the trial judge gave no explanation, on the record, for his inconsistent verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">It should be noted that the State has offered no response in its brief to appellant\u2019s claim of error based on inconsistent verdicts. Unlike its response to the double jeopardy argument, patently, it was impracticable for appellant to argue inconsistent verdicts \u201cto the trial court prior to [his] conviction for manslaughter by automobile,\u201d as the State suggests appellant was required to do to preserve his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\n<em>Double Jeopardy: Fifth Amendment, U.S. Constitution; Maryland Common Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Appellant\u2019s claim of error bottomed on double jeopardy guaranteed by the Maryland common law and the Constitution of the United States is summed up in <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 577 A.2d 795 (1990). There, The Honorable Theodore G. Bloom, specially assigned, speaking for the Court of Appeals, explains:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">A comparison of the two statutes clearly demonstrates that in order to prove the greater offense, manslaughter by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>automobile, the State must necessarily prove the lesser offense, negligent driving. Article 27, \u00a7 388 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">Every person causing the death of another as the result of the driving, operation, or control of an automobile, motor vehicle, motorboat, locomotive, engine, car, streetcar, train or other vehicle in a grossly negligent manner shall be guilty of a misdemeanor....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Under \u00a7 21 \u2014 901.1(b) of the Transportation Article, one is guilty of negligent driving if he or she drives a motor vehicle in a careless or imprudent manner that endangers property or the life or person of an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">It is obvious that the offense of negligent driving requires no proof beyond that which is required for conviction of manslaughter by automobile or motor vehicle. The traffic offense requires proof of the operation of a motor vehicle in a negligent manner, <em>i.e., </em>in a careless or imprudent manner that endangers property or the life or person of an individual. Manslaughter by motor vehicle requires proof of grossly negligent driving, which necessarily includes negligent driving, plus proof that someone\u2019s death resulted from that conduct. Under the <em>Blockburger </em>or required evidence test, therefore, the offenses are the same for double jeopardy purposes, and a conviction of the lesser offense bars a subsequent prosecution for the greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 343-44, 577 A.2d 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><em>Gianiny </em>involved a fatal automobile crash which resulted in the issuance by the investigating officer of a traffic citation charging, <em>inter alia, </em>negligent driving. Gianiny paid a f\u00edne of $45 for negligent driving on January 30, 1989 and filed a motion to dismiss the manslaughter indictment returned on February 2,1989 on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\"><em>Gianiny, </em>to be sure, addressed the applicability of double jeopardy in the context of a prior <em>conviction </em>rather than a prior <em>acquittal, </em>as is presented by the facts of the case at hand. The effect on a subsequent prosecution for the greater offense, however, is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Nor is it significant that the prior acquittal occurred within the context of the same proceeding. In <em>Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157 (1986), the Court of Appeals reviewed the trial judge\u2019s grant of the appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the underlying felony, i.e., the attempted robbery charge and the court\u2019s subsequent submission to the jury of felony murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. In recognizing the validity of Wright\u2019s claim, Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court of Appeals, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">Since the petitioner Wright was, therefore, acquitted of the underlying offense, we believe that the later submission of the felony murder charge to the jury and Wright\u2019s conviction of felony murder was contrary to the settled principle, under both the Fifth Amendment and Maryland common law, that an acquittal on the merits is ordinarily final and precludes further trial proceedings upon the same charge. This is true even if the acquittal is based upon an error of law or an incorrect resolution of the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">The rule according finality to an acquittal on the merits is ordinarily applicable regardless of the nature of the post[-]acquittal criminal proceedings. Contrary to the view of the Court of Special Appeals, <em>the rule is not limited to the situation where the government attempts to institute a wholly new prosecution </em>on the. same charge after a judgment in an earlier prosecution. Rather, the acquittal on the merits terminates the initial jeopardy on a charge, normally precluding any type of further criminal proceedings on the same charge or, in some instances, on a related charge. In this respect, the double jeopardy effect of an acquittal is somewhat different than that of a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 562-63, 515 A.2d 1157 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Moreover, in <em>Farrell v. State, </em>364 Md. 499, 506-07, 774 A.2d 387 (2001), Judge Eldridge, for the Court of Appeals, explicated the legal consequence of a not guilty verdict intentionally rendered by a court:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>In holding that an intentionally rendered verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d is final and precludes, under Maryland common law, any further prosecution for the same offense, this Court in <em>Pugh v. State, </em>[ ] 271 Md. [701,] 705, 319 A.2d 542, 544 [ (1974) ] stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">From the earliest days, it has been clear that once a verdict of not guilty has been rendered at the conclusion of a criminal trial, that verdict is final and cannot be set aside. Any attempt to do so by the prosecutor is barred by what at common law was the plea of <em>autrefois acquit. </em>Thus, in <em>State v. Shields, </em>49 Md. 301, 303 (1878), our predecessors declined to construe a statute as permitting the State to appeal a verdict of acquittal, saying:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">It has always been a settled rule of the common law that after an acquittal of a party upon a regular trial on an indictment for either a felony or a misdemeanor, the verdict of acquittal can never afterward, on the application of the prosecutor ... be set aside....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">The Court in <em>Shields </em>went on to point out that it made no difference whether the acquittal was based on a mistake of law or a mistake of fact. <em>See also State v. Adams, </em>196 Md. 341, 348, 76 A.2d 575 (1950); <em>Cochran v. State, </em>119 Md. 539, 544, 87 A. 400 (1913); <em>State v. Campbell and Reeves, </em>[ ] 7 Md.App. [538] at 540-541, [256 A.2d 537-539 (1969)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The common law principle applied in <em>Pugh v. State, supra, </em>271 Md. 701, 319 A.2d 542, and <em>State v. Shields, supra, </em>49 Md. 301, has been reiterated by this Court on numerous occasions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 109, 695 A.2d 143, 146 (1997) (\u201ca not guilty verdict may not be disturbed or revised by any Maryland court ... if [the] verdict of not guilty has been intentionally rendered by a court\u201d); <em>Wright v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 562-563, 515 A.2d at 1162 (the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal, after the prosecution\u2019s case, precludes further trial proceedings and conviction for the same offense); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>[ ] 299 Md. [146,] 155, 472 A.2d [981,] 986 [ (1984) ], (\u201cOnce a trial judge intentionally acquits a defendant of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>criminal offense over which the court has jurisdiction, the prohibition against double jeopardy does not permit him [or her] to change his [or her] mind.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Finally, the finite nature of a trial judge\u2019s pronouncement of not guilty is captured in the following quote from <em>Daff v. State, </em>317 Md. 678, 684, 566 A.2d 120 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">The principle embodied in the plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>has been broadly interpreted. A verdict of not guilty, even though not followed by a judgment on the docket, is sufficient to invoke the protection. <em>Pugh v. State, supra, </em>271 Md. at 706-07, 319 A.2d 542. <em>Once a trial judge has intentionally rendered a verdict of not guilty, a subsequent change of mind is prohibited </em>even though the judge may be convinced, even moments later, that the verdict was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 319 A.2d 542; <em>Brooks v. State, supra, </em>299 Md. at 155, 472 A.2d 981. The court entering the acquittal must have basic subject matter jurisdiction, but procedural errors will not affect the efficacy of the acquittal for jeopardy purposes. 2 Hawkins, <em>Pleas of the Crown </em>521 (8th ed. 1824)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The State concedes that \u201cnegligent driving and reckless driving are lesser included offenses of manslaughter by automobile.\u201d It is undisputed that, whether appellant drove negligently and/or recklessly on the night in question had been judicially determined in appellant\u2019s favor prior to the finding of guilt on the two manslaughter charges. The State suggests that appellant should have interposed a double jeopardy argument prior to his conviction for manslaughter. The prosecutor and appellant\u2019s trial counsel presented their arguments on the facts and the law prior to the court undertaking to issue its judgment on the merits of the various charges before it. The verdict on the merits, as <em>Daff </em>makes clear, is fixed once announced. The court\u2019s pronouncements as to not guilty on the negligent and reckless driving charges followed by the guilty findings as to the drug charges and the ultimate finding of guilty on the two manslaughter charges was virtually a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>seamless pronouncement of the disposition of those charges which afforded no opportunity for appellant\u2019s trial counsel to interpose any objection on the basis of double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Citing <em>Ferrell, swpra, </em>appellant, it appears as an afterthought, raises the issue of collateral estoppel. In <em>Ferrell, </em>the State was precluded from retrying appellant for armed robbery after the jury in the previous trial, unable to reach a verdict as to armed robbery, found the appellant not guilty of using a handgun in the commission of a felony. The seminal case announcing the application of collateral estoppel to criminal cases is <em>Ashe v. Swenson, supra. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that collateral estoppel \u2014 or issue preclusion \u2014 was part of the guarantee under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court, in <em>Ferrell, </em>summarized the factual backdrop in <em>Ashe v. Swenson, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">[T]he defendant was charged with the robbery of one of six poker players who had been robbed by three or four armed men. The only contested issue in the case was whether the defendant was one of the robbers. At the end of the trial, the jury found the defendant not guilty. Six weeks later, the defendant was brought to trial and convicted for the robbery of one of the other poker players. The United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\"><em>Ferrell, </em>318 Md. at 241, 567 A.2d 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">In finding that Ashe\u2019s prosecution for the robbery of one victim during an incident for which he had been acquitted of robbing another victim was barred by collateral estoppel, the Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u201cCollateral estoppel\u201d is an awkward phrase, but it stands for an extremely important principle in our adversary system of justice. It means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. Although first developed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>civil litigation, collateral estoppel has been an established rule of federal criminal law at least since this Court\u2019s decision more than 50 years ago in <em>United States v. Oppenheimer, </em>242 U.S. 85, 37 S.Ct. 68, 61 L.Ed. 161 [ (1916) ]. As Mr. Justice Holmes put the matter in that case, \u201cIt cannot be that the safeguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn reverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt.\u201d 242 U.S.[ ] at 87[ ] n. 7, 37 S.Ct. 68[.] As a rule of federal law, therefore, \u201cit is much too late to suggest that this principle is not fully applicable to a former judgment in a criminal case, either because of lack of \u2018mutuality\u2019 or because the judgment may reflect only a belief that the Government had not met the higher burden of proof exacted in such cases for the Government\u2019s evidence as a whole although not necessarily as to every link in the chain.\u201d <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>289 F.2d 909, 913 [ (1961) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><em>Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Under both the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Maryland common law, it is established that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is embodied in the double jeopardy prohibition. <em>Ashe v. Swenson, supra; Ferrell, </em>318 Md. at 241, 567 A.2d 937. The critical language in the <em>Ashe </em>Court\u2019s decision is \u201cwhen an issue of ultimate <em>fact </em>has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <em>Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189. Here, the valid and final judgments before us are the guilty findings of negligent driving and reckless driving entered by the trial judge. <em>Ferrell </em>and <em>Ashe, </em>however, consider only whether issue preclusion operates as a bar to prosecution in \u201cany future lawsuit\u201d rather than within the same proceeding. Moreover, the sole disputed issue in Ferrell was the criminal agency of the accused, i.e., whether Ferrell robbed the' victims with a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>in rendering the guilty verdicts for negligent driving and reckless driving, the trial court conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ed: \u201cBut the only thing is speed. You got to have merger.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Not guilty as to both (reckless driving and negligent driving).\u201d Rather than the court\u2019s pronouncement constituting a determination on an ultimate issue of fact, the \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts are the disposition of <em>legal </em>issues \u2014 essential elements of the greater offense, automobile manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The discussion in <em>Ferrell </em>supports appellant\u2019s claim that an acquittal of the lesser included offense operates as a bar to conviction of the flagship offense. <em>Ferrell, </em>unlike the case at bar, however, involved a successive prosecution, the <em>sine qua non </em>for application of collateral estoppel. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Ashe:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">The federal decisions have made clear that the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality. Where a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general verdict, as is usually the case, this approach requires a court to \u201cexamine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter[s], and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d The inquiry \u201cmust be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Sealfon v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 575, 579, 68 S.Ct. 237, 92 L.Ed. 180 [ (1948) ]. Any test more technically restrictive would, of course, simply amount to a rejection of the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings, at least in every case where the first judgment was based upon a general verdict of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\"><em>If a later court is permitted to state that the jury may have disbelieved substantial and uncontradicted evidence of the prosecution </em>on a point the defendant did not contest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>possible multiplicity of prosecutions is staggering.... In fact, such a restrictive definition of \u201cdetermined\u201d amounts simply to a rejection of collateral estoppel, since it is impossible to imagine a statutory offense in which the government has to prove only one element or issue to sustain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">Straightforward application of the federal rule to the present case can lead to but one conclusion. For the record is utterly devoid of any indication that the first jury could rationally have found that an armed robbery had not occurred, or that Knight had not been a victim of that robbery. The single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been one of the robbers. And the jury by its verdict found that he had not. The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a second prosecution for the robbery of Roberts wholly impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">(Emphasis added; footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The <em>Ashe </em>Court had looked to a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, <em>Yawn v. United States, </em>244 F.2d 235 (1957), in crafting its thesis that collateral estoppel was applicable to criminal cases. Significantly, in <em>Yawn, </em>the prohibition against a subsequent prosecution was couched in terms of <em>res judica-ta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Ass\u2019n., </em>361 Md. 371, 389, 761 A.2d 899 (2000), quoting its prior decision in <em>FWB Bank v. Richman, </em>354 Md. 472, 731 A.2d 916 (1999), delineated the elements of <em>res judicata:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlA\">The basic rule of claim preclusion in this context is not difficult: \u201cA valid and final personal judgment rendered in favor of the defendant bars another action by the plaintiff on the same [cjlaim.\u201d RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS \u00a7 19 (1982)----[T]he traditional principle of <em>res judicata </em>has three elements: \u201c(1) the parties in the present litigation should be the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier case; (2) the second suit must present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the same cause of action or claim as the first; and (3) in the first suit, there must have been a valid final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>See also Gertz v. Anne Arundel County, </em>339 Md. 261, 661 A.2d 1157 (1995); <em>deLeon v. Slear, </em>328 Md. 569, 616 A.2d 380 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The purpose undergirding the application of collateral estoppel and <em>res judicata </em>is to prevent parties from re-litigating the same issues at successive judicial proceedings. The Court, in <em>Yawn, </em>reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">In the present case the Government had, and has, every right to establish the guilt of the accused of the separate offense of conspiracy to violate the liquor tax laws despite the acquittal of unlawful possession of the still. But to allow the Government to have a second opportunity to establish the precise fact of possession decided by another [cjourt of competent jurisdiction in favor of the accused is to ignore the rule that \u201c... <em>the same facts cannot be twice litigated by the same sovereign against the same defendant.\u201d ... </em>We hold that the Government was precluded as a matter of law under these circumstances from making such an attempt .... And to ascribe a different legal meaning to \u201cpossession\u201d is litigated in the first trial from \u201cpossession\u201d litigated in the second would be an exercise in semantics unwarranted in this fact situation both in law and in reason ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">(Emphasis added; citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In sum, double jeopardy and inconsistent verdicts, uniquely protections against multiple prosecution and punishment in a criminal setting, may be applicable in the same proceeding or in successive proceedings. <em>See Ferrell, </em>318 Md. at 250, 567 A.2d 937. Collateral estoppel, borrowed from civil jurisprudence and embodied in the double jeopardy prohibition, contemplates a second or subsequent prosecutions and precludes <em>re-litigation </em>of factual issues. The case, <em>sub judice, </em>does not involve re-litigation of issues and, hence, collateral estoppel is inapplicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\n<em>The State\u2019s Claim of Non-preservation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Luminously telling is the conspicuous absence of any rejoinder in the State\u2019s brief to appellant\u2019s inconsistent verdicts argument. Because appellant raises the issue of double jeopardy for the first time on appeal, posits the State, he has failed properly to preserve the issue for appeal. Maryland Rule 8-131 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, <em>but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">(c) Action tried without a jury. When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The State points out that the <em>Howell </em>Court considered the preservation issue in the context of Maryland Rule 1085, presently Maryland Rule 8-131, which provides that \u201c[t]his Court will ordinarily not decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court.\u201d Interestingly, <em>Howell </em>engages in an in-depth analysis of <em>Carbaugh v. State, </em>294 Md. 323, 449 A.2d 1153 (1982), wherein the Court of Appeals reviewed our decision in <em>Carbaugh v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 706, 435 A.2d 116 (1981), where we held that failure to raise double jeopardy by way of a pre-trial motion under then-Maryland Rule 736 constituted waiver for purposes of subsequent appellate review. Appellee expressly invokes Maryland Rule 8-131, yet argues \u201c[appellant] did not plead this doctrine <em>[autrefois acquit </em>], nor did he move to dismiss the two counts of manslaughter by automobile\u201d under double jeopardy principles. Patently, a plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>was unavailable to appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>lant, given the posture of the proceedings when the trial court found appellant not guilty of negligent driving and reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The State points out that, after appellant was found not guilty of negligent driving and reckless driving, he was then asked by the trial court whether he had anything to say about the remaining counts. The record transcript indicates that the trial court inquired, \u201cDoes anyone want to say anything else as far as to guilt or innocence in this regard, with regard to 1, 2, 4, 5, 6? Anything else from you [appellant\u2019s counsel]?\u201d Counts 5 and 6 charged appellant with manslaughter by automobile. Nevertheless, at that juncture, there was neither an attempt by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney to initiate a \u201csuccessive prosecution\u201d or an indication by the trial judge that he was about to convict appellant on the two counts of manslaughter. A plea of <em>autrefois acquit </em>or a motion to dismiss are responsive actions to the institution of initial proceedings. By the time appellant\u2019s trial counsel was in a position to know that the trial court would find him guilty of manslaughter, it was too late. The convictions were a <em>fait accompli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Neither can the State find solace in <em>Howell, Hewitt v. State, </em>242 Md. 111, 218 A.2d 19 (1966), or <em>Medley v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 225, 448 A.2d 363 (1982). Reminding us of the well-settled rule that even errors of constitutional dimension may be waived by failure to interpose a timely objection, these cases deal almost exclusively with what is now Maryland Rule 8-131. Judge Moylan, in <em>Howell, </em>instructs us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">We know of no principle or practice under which a judgment of a trial court may be reversed or modified on appeal except for prejudicial error committed by the trial judge. It is a misuse of language to label as error any act or failure to act by a party, an attorney, a witness, a juror, or by anyone else other than the judge. In other words, error in a trial court may be committed only by a judge, and only when he rules, or, in rare instances, fails to rule, on a question raised before him in the course of a trial, or in pre[-]trial or post-trial proceedings. <em>Appellate courts look only to the rulings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>made by a trial judge, or to his [or her] failure to act when action was required, to find reversible error.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">This philosophy finds expression throughout the appellate process and specifically in Maryland Rules 885 and 1085, which provide that the appellate courts will not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court, and further by the judicially expressed rule that the appellate court will consider only contentions raised and argued in the briefs. <em>See Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Mattingly Lumber Co., </em>176 Md. 217, 4 A.2d 447 [ (1939) ], <em>Harmon v. State Roads Comm., </em>242 Md. 24, 217 A.2d 513 (1966); <em>Ricker v.

Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 596, 463 A.2d 872 (1983). The following factors may be considered in determining joint or constructive possession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">1) proximity between the defendant and the contraband, 2) the fact that the contraband was within the view or otherwise within the knowledge of the defendant, 3) ownership or some possessory right in the premises or the automobile in which the contraband is found, or 4) the presence of circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the defendant was participating with others in the mutual use and enjoyment of the contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\"><em>Hall v.

State, </em>351 Md. 307, 315. n. 4, 718 A.2d 588 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Finally, evidence showing that a defendant fled or used a false name to conceal his or her identity following a crime can constitute relevant evidence on the issue of consciousness of guilt. <em>See Wright v. State, </em>312 Md. 648, 654-55, 541 A.2d 988 (1988); <em>accord Sorrell v. State, </em>315 Md. 224, 228, 554 A.2d 352 (1989); <em>Hunt v.

Whether appellant had knowledge of the presence of the narcotics and exercised control over them were questions of fact for the trial judge to decide. As stated above, Maryland law permits a trial judge to resolve these questions through rational inferences based on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">As to knowledge and possession, the evidence demonstrated that (1) appellant exercised a possessory interest in the car; (2) the narcotics were kept in close proximity to appellant; (3) at the time the car was rented by Hall, the drugs were not under the driver\u2019s seat; (4) appellant eluded police after the police attempted to affect a routine traffic stop; and (5) fled from the scene of the accident. With respect to appellant\u2019s intent to distribute the narcotics, the evidence showed that the narcotics were packaged in a baggie containing fifty vials of crack cocaine and fifteen small packets of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">We hold that the trial judge\u2019s findings and inferences as to possession and intent to distribute were rational and, ther\u00e9-fore, proper. As a result, we hold that the trial court was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>clearly erroneous in finding sufficient evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">CONVICTIONS FOR MANSLAUGHTER BY AUTOMOBILE REVERSED; CONVICTIONS FOR POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE AND POSSESSION OF COCAINE WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE-HALF BY BALTIMORE COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\">.
