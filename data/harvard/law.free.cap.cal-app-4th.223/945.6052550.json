J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQr\">In 2012, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) filed an application with the California Public Utilities Commission (the Commission) seeking approval of an agreement by which PG&amp;E would acquire a new gas-fired powerplant in Oakley, California (the Oakley Project). A principal issue in the application proceedings was whether there was a need for the Oakley Project. The need was said to arise in part from California\u2019s efforts to obtain a greater percentage of its energy from renewable sources, thus requiring additional conventional electrical generating capacity to cope with fluctuations in supply due to the intermittent nature of wind and solar power.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">As evidence of this claimed need, PG&amp;E presented a declaration from an executive of the California Independent System Operator (the CAISO) and a petition the CAISO had filed with a federal agency. Neither the CAISO executive nor the authors of the petition testified in the Commission\u2019s proceedings. Because of their hearsay nature, the administrative law judge (ALJ) presiding over the application case ruled these materials could not be used as evidence of the need for the Oakley Project. She later issued a proposed decision recommending denial of PG&amp;E\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The Commission did not adopt the ALJ\u2019s decision, and its decision approving PG&amp;E\u2019s application expressly relied on these hearsay materials in finding the Oakley Project is needed. The Utility Reform Network (TURN), Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF), and Independent Energy Producers Association (IEP), which had participated in the application proceedings, sought rehearing before the Commission. Among other arguments, they claimed the Commission had violated their substantial rights by relying on hearsay evidence the ALJ had ruled could not be used as proof of need for the Oakley Project and that the Commission\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence. After the Commission denied their applications for rehearing, they filed petitions for writs of review under Public Utilities Code section 1756, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">In the published portion of our opinion, we conclude the Commission\u2019s finding of need is unsupported by substantial evidence, because it relies on uncorroborated hearsay materials the truth of which is disputed and which do not come within any exception to the hearsay rule. Under established California law, such uncorroborated hearsay evidence does not constitute substantial evidence to support an administrative agency\u2019s finding of fact. Because the remaining evidence in the record fails to support the Commission\u2019s finding of need, the decisions must be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The Oakley Project approval process has been the subject of at least three Commission proceedings extending over several years. We will explain those proceedings in summary fashion and limit our factual statement to matters relevant to the issues presented in the petitions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">\n<em>The Initial Application for the Oakley Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Under the Commission\u2019s biennial procurement review process, investor-owned electric utilities such as PG&amp;E must submit long-term procurement plans (LTPPs) that serve as the basis for utility procurement activities. (See \u00a7 454.5, subd. (a); <em>Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement and Renewable Resource Development </em>(Jan. 22, 2004) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 04-01-050 [2004 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 28, pp. *11\u2014*12].) In a 2007 decision, the Commission approved PG&amp;E\u2019s 2006 LTPP, and among other things, directed PG&amp;E to issue a request for offers (RFO) \u201cto obtain contracts for 800 to 1,200 MW [(megawatts)] of new operationally flexible and dispatchable capacity by 2015.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">PG&amp;E issued the RFO in 2008. It later submitted an application to the Commission for approval of a proposed purchase and sale agreement (PSA) for the Oakley plant. In 2010, the Commission issued a decision denying approval for the Oakley Project. <em>(Decision on Pacific Gas and Electric Company\u2019s 2008 Long-term Request for Offer Results and Adopting Cost Recovery and Ratemaking Mechanisms </em>(July 29, 2010) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 10-07-045 [2010 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 289, p. *1] (hereafter Decision 10-07-045).) In that decision, the Commission chose to \u201cdeny the Oakley Project at this time\u201d and made a factual finding that the project was not needed. <em>{Id., </em>2010 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 289 at pp. *60, *79.) Nevertheless, the Commission believed the Oakley Project had \u201cnumerous beneficial attributes,\u201d so it allowed PG&amp;E to resubmit the application subject to various conditions. <em>{Id. </em>at p. *60.) Among other conditions, the Commission stated PG&amp;E could resubmit the application \u201c[i]f the final results from the CAISO Renewable Integration Study demonstrate[] that, even with the projects approved by the Commission, there are significant negative reliability risks from integrating a 33% Renewable Portfolio Standard.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>at p. *61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\n<em>The Commission\u2019s Approval of the Oakley Project Is Annulled</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">PG&amp;E modified the Oakley PSA to address D. 10-07-045, and then submitted a petition for modification of that decision. Acting sua sponte, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Commission treated the petition for modification as an application for approval of the project. <em>(Decision Authorizing Pacific Gas and Electric Company to Enter Into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Contra Costa Generating Station LLC </em>(Dec. 16, 2010) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 10-12-050 [2010 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 457, p. *2] (hereafter Decision 10-12-050).) A number of parties, including TURN and WPTF, filed comments opposing PG&amp;E\u2019s petition for modification, arguing that a new application, not a petition for modification, was the correct procedural vehicle for bringing the Oakley Project back for Commission consideration. <em>(Id., </em>2010 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 457 at p. *7.) Although the Commission agreed with this procedural objection, it went on to consider PG&amp;E\u2019s filing as an application. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. *11-* 12.) It concluded that the benefits of the amended Oakley Project justified approval of the amended PSA. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. *19-*20, *23.) After the Commission denied various parties\u2019 applications for rehearing, TURN sought writ review of Decision 10-12-050 and the Commission\u2019s decision denying rehearing, <em>Order Modifying Decision 10-12-050, and Denying Rehearing of Decision as Modified </em>(May 26, 2011) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 11-05-049 [2011 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 303] (hereafter Decision 11-05-049).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">In <em>The Utility Reform Network v. Public Utilities Commission </em>(Mar. 16, 2012, A132439) (nonpub. opn.) <em>(TURN I), </em>we annulled Decision 10-12-050 and Decision 11-05-049.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held the Commission could not treat PG&amp;E\u2019s petition for modification as a new application because the Commission had failed to follow its own rules of practice and procedure. <em>(TURN I, supra, </em>A132439.) We concluded the Commission\u2019s failure to proceed in the manner required by law had prejudiced the parties to the proceeding, and we therefore set aside the Commission\u2019s decisions. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\n<em>Proceedings on PG&amp;E\u2019s Renewed Application</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Shortly after issuance of our decision in <em>TURN I, </em>PG&amp;E filed with the Commission a new application for approval of the amended Oakley PSA. On May 21, 2012, PG&amp;E submitted prepared testimony in support of its application. The testimony addressed the need for and benefits of the Oakley Project, and it referred to a petition the CAISO had filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking a waiver to prevent the retirement of the Sutter Energy Center (the Sutter Waiver Petition). PG&amp;E asserted that the CAISO had supported the Sutter Waiver Petition with testimony describing CAISO studies that had \u201cidentified a need for new flexible generation capacity resources in 2017-2018 in order to integrate intermittent renewable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>resources.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> PG&amp;E relied in particular upon the declaration of CAISO executive director of market analysis and development, Mark Rothleder (the Rothleder Declaration). In his declaration, Rothleder stated that using certain assumptions, the CAISO\u2019s analysis had concluded \u201cthere will be a shortage or gap of 3,570 MW for meeting system-wide capacity needs in California by the end of 2017. This shortage would pose significant challenges to the reliable operation of the [CAISO] grid.\u201d According to Rothleder, CAISO was concerned about the problem caused by integration of renewable energy resources, \u201cespecially given the retirement of thousands of MWs of once-through cooling (OTC) units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">On May 25, 2012, the commissioner assigned to PG&amp;E\u2019s application, Michael R. Peevey, issued his \u201cScoping Memo and Ruling\u201d for the proceedings (the Scoping Memo). (See \u00a7 1701.1, subd. (b).) Among the issues identified in the Scoping Memo was the need for the Oakley Project. The Scoping Memo asked: \u201cIs the Oakley PSA barred or authorized pursuant to D. 07-12-052, which requires all UOG [utility-owned generation] to be selected through a competitive process unless it is needed to meet a specific, unique reliability issue? <em>This issue includes consideration of whether the Oakley project will meet a specific, unique reliability issue.'1'\u2019 </em>(Italics added &amp; fn. omitted.) A separate issue laid out in the Scoping Memo was whether the CAISO had \u201cissued its final report on its renewable resource integration study demonstrating significant negative reliability risks from integrating a 33% [RPS.]\u201d (Fn. omitted.) The Scoping Memo stated that the first issue\u2014the need for the Oakley Project\u2014was one of fact and was contested by the parties. Commissioner Peevey therefore determined evidence was required and scheduled evidentiary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In addition to its prepared testimony, PG&amp;E asked the Commission to take official notice of decisions of the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (the District) regarding each agency\u2019s review of elements of the Oakley Project. After submission of PG&amp;E\u2019s prepared testimony, the parties conducted discovery and responded with their own prepared testimony. PG&amp;E, in turn, submitted rebuttal testimony that included a copy of the entire Sutter Waiver Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">On August 14, 2012, the Commission\u2019s Division of Ratepayer Advocates (DRA) filed a motion to strike portions of PG&amp;E\u2019s prepared and rebuttal testimony on the grounds that the identified portions consisted of \u201chearsay or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>double hearsay statements by representatives of the . . . CAISO, which have been submitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein: namely, that new system resources are needed to support system-wide operational flexibility needs beginning in 2017-2018.\u201d The documents subject to DRA\u2019s motion to strike included both the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">\n<em>Evidentiary Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">On the first day of the evidentiary hearings, the presiding ALJ granted PG&amp;E\u2019s motion for official notice of the documents from the CEC and the District, but only \u201cfor the limited purpose of supporting the testimony that\u2019s already been given.\u201d With respect to the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition, the ALJ granted DRA\u2019s motion to strike in part, stating, \u201cRegarding all the other attachments which refer to the . . . CAISO . . . , at issue in this case is whether the [CAISO] has issued a final determination, a final report, a final result, . . . and PG&amp;E may offer evidence toward this issue. [][] And these documents ... on the issue of whether these very documents alone or in total satisfy the requirement, that requirement of [Decision] 10-07-045, this evidence goes to that and is not\u2014for that purpose it\u2019s appropriate. [][] I will not allow . . . this evidence ... to be used for the purpose of proving on this record the truth of the matter asserted; that is, for proving that there is a system reliability need or . . . for the purpose of proving that what [the CAISO] says is true, or that the Commission should find on the basis of what the [CAISO] says that. . . what the [CAISO] says is true. M] The [CAISO\u2019s] statements are not binding on the Commission, and in that way they are not judicially noticeable authority. And they are subject to dispute. They are being challenged before the [Commission], [f] And so again, I will not strike the attachments, but I will strike the testimony that does cite to those attachments for purposes of the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">During the course of the evidentiary hearings, the ALJ explained she would allow consideration of the CAISO materials for the purpose of showing whether the CAISO had reached a final determination on the issue of significant negative reliability risks, but not for the purpose of showing that the Oakley Project would meet a specific, unique reliability issue, i.e., whether there was a need for the Oakley Project. At one point, when DRA\u2019s counsel told the ALJ that her proposed cross-examination was seeking information about PG&amp;E\u2019s claim that there was a residual need for flexible energy resources that could only be met by the Oakley Project, the ALJ stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want hearsay evidence used for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>issue, . . . because we can\u2019t litigate that because we don\u2019t have the [CAISO] here. [][] [T]hat\u2019s why I struck a lot of testimony from PG&amp;E because it was using the third party statements for the truth of the matter asserted, [f] We cannot use the third party documentation for that. The third party documentation is for whether there\u2019s a final [CAISO] report.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">\n<em>The Proposed Decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">After briefing from the parties, the ALJ filed a proposed decision recommending denial of PG&amp;E\u2019s application. She found there was insufficient evidence of a specific, unique reliability need for the Oakley Project. The ALJ rejected PG&amp;E\u2019s reliance on various CAISO statements, including the Sutter Waiver Petition. She concluded PG&amp;E\u2019s use of the evidence violated her rulings and noted that because the CAISO was not a party to the proceedings, \u201cthere ha[d] been no opportunity to probe its out-of-record statements in the context of the specific issues presented here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The ALJ\u2019s proposed decision also relied on the fact that both the CAISO and PG&amp;E were parties to a settlement in a separate Commission proceeding in which they had stipulated that \u201c \u2018[t]he resource planning analyses presented ... do not conclusively demonstrate whether or not there is need to add capacity for renewable integration purposes through the year 2020, the period to be addressed during the current LTPP cycle ....\u2019\u201d In its decision approving the settlement in- that proceeding, the Commission explained the parties had agreed to defer determination of the utilities\u2019 future need for additional generation. <em>(Decision on System Track I and Rules Track III of the Long-term Procurement Plan Proceeding and Approving Settlement </em>(Apr. 19, 2012) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 12-04-046 [2012 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 192, p. *8] <em>(Decision Approving Settlement).)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Commission quoted the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, which expressed the settling parties\u2019 \u201c \u2018general agreement that further analysis is needed before any renewable integration resource need determination is made.\u2019 \u201d (2012 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 192 at p. *8.) In determining the reasonableness of the settlement, the Commission looked at the whole record and found \u201cclear evidence . . . that additional generation is not needed by 2020, so there is record support for deferral of procurement.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. *11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Assigned Commissioner Peevey issued a proposed alternate decision recommending approval of the Oakley PSA. The proposed alternate decision relied on the Sutter Waiver Petition and statements from CAISO\u2019s chief executive officer as evidence that \u201cretirement of OTC plants and integration of the 33% RPS by 2020 creates the potential for a significant reliability risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">\n<em>The Commission\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In <em>Alternate Decision of President Peevey Approving Application for Amended Purchase and Sale Agreement </em>(Dec. 20, 2012) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 12-12-035 [2012 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 594] <em>(Oakley </em>Decision), the full Commission adopted the proposed alternate decision and approved the amended Oakley PSA. The Commission referred to the ALJ\u2019s ruling allowing the CAISO materials into the record only for limited purposes but noted that hearsay evidence is admissible in Commission proceedings. <em>(Oakley Decision, </em>2012 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis at pp. *32-*33.) It therefore chose to accord the CAISO studies and statements PG&amp;E had introduced \u201cless weight than we would for a CAISO study that was subject to cross examination in a Commission proceeding.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. *33.) The Commission did not accept as true the CAISO\u2019s conclusion that there would be a shortfall of 3,750 megawatts by 2018, but following the alternate decision, it concluded the CAISO\u2019s findings were persuasive evidence demonstrating significant negative reliability risks from integrating a 33% RPS. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. *33, *61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\n<em>The Rehearing Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">IEP sought rehearing of the <em>Oakley Decision, </em>as did TURN and WPTE In their applications, the parties contended the Commission had improperly relied on hearsay evidence for its finding of significant reliability risk. The applicants also argued the Commission had failed to preserve the substantial rights of the parties and had not proceeded in the manner required by law when it relied on hearsay evidence despite the ALJ\u2019s ruling precluding use of the CAISO materials as evidence of need. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 20, \u00a7 13.6(a) (Rule 13.6(a)) [\u201cAlthough technical rules of evidence ordinarily need not be applied in hearings before the Commission, substantial rights of the parties shall be preserved.\u201d].) Furthermore, the applicants claimed the Commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In <em>Order Modifying Decision 12-12-035, and Denying Rehearing of Decision as Modified </em>(Apr. 18, 2013) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 13-04-032 [2013 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 134] <em>(Rehearing Decision), </em>the Commission addressed the parties\u2019 applications. It explained that in the <em>Oakley Decision, </em>it had intended to overrule the ALJ\u2019s evidentiary ruling and could thus rely on the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition to demonstrate the need for the Oakley Project. <em>(Rehearing Decision, </em>2013 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 134 at p. *9.) Because it had not expressly overruled the ALJ, however, the Commission acknowledged it had \u201cgenerated some confusion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Commission explained it had \u201creviewed the ALJ\u2019s ruling, and decided not to follow it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *10.) It therefore modified its earlier decision to make it expressly clear it was overruling the ALJ\u2019s ruling regarding the use of the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. *40.) It further ruled that the substantial rights of the parties had been preserved, because the parties had been given the opportunity to challenge the substance of the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition through their own testimony and through data requests to PG&amp;E. <em>(Id. </em>at p. *13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The Commission also reasoned that its rules of practice and procedure permitted it to rely on hearsay evidence for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>(Rehearing Decision, supra, </em>2013 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 134 at p. *10.) Under Rule 13.6(a), \u201c \u2018the Commission allows admissions of hearsay although it is given less weight than other evidence. In general, hearsay in administrative proceedings is admissible if a responsible person would rely upon it in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of its possible inadmissibility in civil actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rehearing Decision, </em>at p. *11.) Moreover, the Commission asserted, hearsay evidence is accepted in Commission proceedings when supported by other evidence, and administrative agencies are permitted to rely upon it. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. *11-* 12.) Since the Rothleder Declaration and Sutter Waiver Petition had been submitted to FERC under penalty of perjury, the Commission found the Sutter Waiver Petition was \u201can analysis upon which [it] could reasonably rely in conducting [its] affairs.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition to the Sutter Waiver Petition, the Commission cited statements from reports issued by the CEC and the District on the Oakley Project as the basis for its finding of a \u201csignificant negative reliability risk from integrating a 33% [RPS] by 2020.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">After considering and rejecting all of the parties\u2019 other arguments, the Commission denied the applications for rehearing. <em>(Rehearing Decision, supra, </em>2013 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 1342 at pp. *40-*41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>\n<em>The Petitions for Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">On May 20, 2013, TURN filed a petition for writ of review of the Commission\u2019s decisions in this court. (\u00a7 1756, subd. (a).) That same day, IEP and WPTF filed a combined petition for writ of review in the Court of Appeal for the Third Appellate District. On June 18, 2013, the Supreme Court ordered the latter proceeding transferred to this court. We consolidated the petitions on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Petitioners raise a number of challenges to the Commission\u2019s decisions. They devote the greater part of their briefing to their claim that the Commission failed to preserve the substantial rights of the parties because it relied on the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition to support the finding of need for the Oakley Project despite the ALJ\u2019s ruling that this evidence could not be used for that purpose. (See Rule 13.6(a).) They argue this prejudiced them because they were unable to challenge the claims made in these materials through cross-examination. In addition, they assert that if they had known the Commission would rely on these materials for the purpose of demonstrating the need for the Oakley Project, they would have presented their own evidence on that issue during the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">As we explain, we conclude we need not resolve petitioners\u2019 procedural challenges. Even if we assume the Commission\u2019s procedures sufficiently preserved the substantial rights of the parties, we do not find substantial evidence to support its finding that the Oakley Project is needed to meet a specific, unique reliability risk. Before addressing the issue of substantial evidence, we explain why writ review is appropriate and outline the scope of our review of the Commission\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">I. <em>Propriety of Writ Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Any party aggrieved by an order or decision of the Commission may petition for a writ of review from the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. (\u00a7 1756, subd. (a).) \u201cWhere, as here, \u2018writ review is the exclusive means of appellate review of a final order or judgment, an appellate court may not deny an apparently meritorious writ petition, timely presented in a formally and procedurally sufficient manner, merely because, for example, the petition presents no important issue of law or because the court considers the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>less worthy of its attention than other matters.\u2019 [Citation.] We are not, however, \u2018compelled to issue the writ if the [Commission] did not err ... .\u2019 <em>(Pacific Bell v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 269, 282 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 910], fn. omitted.)\u201d <em>(PG&amp;E Corp. v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1193 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 630].) We need not issue the writ \u201cif the petitioning party fails to present a convincing argument for annulment of the [Commission\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>(Pacific Bell v. Public Utilities Com., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">In accordance with this standard, after considering the briefing and exhibits submitted by the parties, we concluded the petitions appeared meritorious. We therefore granted the writ petitions and gave notice of our intent to decide the matter on the record provided, unless a party promptly filed an objection or a request for oral argument. Having received no such objection or request, we deem the matter submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Section 1757 delimits the scope of our review of Commission decisions. (\u00a7 1757, subd. (a).) In this case, the petitioners\u2019 challenges require us to determine whether (1) the Commission has proceeded in the manner required by law and (2) the findings in its decision are supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. (\u00a7 1757, subd. (a)(2), (4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In assessing whether the Commission proceeded in the manner required by law (\u00a7 1757, subd. (a)(2)), \u201cwe are mindful that \u2018[t]here is a strong presumption of validity of the [Commission\u2019s decisions . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Utility Consumers\u2019 Action Network v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 688, 697 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 475].) The Commission\u2019s interpretation of its own rules and regulations \u201cis entitled to consideration and respect by the courts.\u201d <em>(Southern Cal. Edison Co. v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1086, 1096 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 684].) We will not interfere with the Commission\u2019s choice of procedures \u201cabsent a manifest abuse of discretion or an unreasonable interpretation of the statutes governing its procedures.\u201d <em>(Pacific Bell v. Public Utilities Com., supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 283.) In addition, if we conclude the Commission has failed to proceed in the manner required by law, we will annul its decision only if that failure was prejudicial. (See <em>Southern California Edison Co. v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1106 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Under section 1757, subdivision (a)(4), we apply \u201cfamiliar principles to review for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(SFPP, L.P. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 784, 794 [159 Cal.Rptr.3d 10].) We must consider all relevant evidence in the record, but it is for the Commission to weigh the preponderance of conflicting evidence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe \u2018in light of the whole record\u2019 language means that the court reviewing the agency\u2019s decision cannot just isolate the evidence supporting the findings and call it a day, thereby disregarding other relevant evidence in the record. [Citation.] Rather, the court must consider all relevant evidence, including evidence detracting from the decision, a task which involves some weighing to fairly estimate the worth of the evidence.\u201d <em>(Lucas Valley Homeowners Assn. v. County of Marin </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 130, 141-142 [284 Cal.Rptr. 427] <em>(Lucas Valley).) </em>We may reverse the Commission\u2019s decision only if, based on the evidence before the Commission, no reasonable person could reach the conclusion it did. <em>(SFPP, L.P. v. Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at p. 794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">III. <em>Hearsay Evidence Is Admissible in Commission Proceedings but Cannot Be the Sole Support for a Finding of Disputed Fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The parties agree that the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition are hearsay evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, subd. (a) [defining hearsay evidence]; <em>Re Pacific Gas and Electric Co. </em>(1986) 23 Cal.P.U.C.2d 352, 354 [\u201cDocumentary evidence that is introduced for the purpose of proving the matter stated in the writing is hearsay <em>per se </em>because the document is not a statement by a person testifying at the hearing.\u201d].) The parties also agree that, as a general matter, hearsay evidence is admissible in Commission proceedings. In addition, although they disagree about the significance of petitioners\u2019 lack of opportunity to cross-examine Rothleder or other CAISO officials, there is no dispute that the statements contained in the CAISO materials were not tested by cross-examination in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Consequently, the issue before us is a narrow one. May the Commission base a finding of fact solely upon hearsay evidence where the truth of the extrarecord statements is disputed? The answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">A. <em>Standards Governing the Admission and Weight of Hearsay Evidence in Commission Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The Commission\u2019s proceedings are governed by its rules of practice and procedure, \u201cand in the conduct thereof the technical rules of evidence need not be applied.\u201d (\u00a7 1701, subd. (a); see Rule 13.6(a).) The Commission\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>precedent establishes that hearsay evidence is admissible in its proceedings. (See, e.g., <em>Investigation on the Commission\u2019s Own Motion Into the Fitness of the Officers, Directors, Owners and Affiliates of Clear World Communications Corporation </em>(June 16, 2005) Cal.P.U.C. Dec. No. 05-06-033 [2005 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 221, p. *81] <em>(Clear World Communications)', Re Landmark Communications, Inc. </em>(1999) 84 Cal.P.U.C.2d 698, 701 <em>(Landmark </em>Communications).) Administrative agencies like the Commission are given more latitude to consider hearsay testimony than are courts <em>(Landmark Communications, </em>at p. 701.), in part because \u201cfactfinders in administrative proceedings are more sophisticated than a lay jury\u201d <em>(Re Pacific Gas and Electric Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.PU.C.2d at p. 354).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">\u201cThe Commission generally allows hearsay evidence if a responsible person would rely upon it in the conduct of serious affairs.\u201d <em>(Landmark Communications, supra, </em>84 Cal.P.U.C.2d at p. 701.) The Commission may rely to some extent even on unverified prepared testimony, at least when it is submitted in anticipation of sworn oral testimony, and when due consideration is given to the fact that the sponsor of the testimony has not been subjected to cross-examination. <em>(Re American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>(1994) 54 Cal.P.U.C.2d 43, 49.) Hearsay evidence is given less weight, however, and if evidence is objectionable on hearsay grounds, \u201cthe Commission weighs it accordingly when all of the evidence in the case is reviewed.\u201d <em>(Landmark Communications, supra, </em>84 Cal.P.U.C.2d at p. 701.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">B. <em>Uncorroborated Hearsay Evidence Is Insufficient to Support a Finding of Fact.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">\u201cThe admissibility and substantiality of hearsay evidence are different issues.\u201d <em>(Gregory v. State Bd. of Control </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 584, 597 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 575].) As the California Supreme Court has explained, \u201cmere admissibility of evidence does not necessarily confer the status of \u2018sufficiency\u2019 to support a finding <em>absent other competent evidence.\u201d (Daniels v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 532, 538, fn. 3 [189 Cal.Rptr. 512, 658 P.2d 1313], italics added <em>{Daniels).) </em>\u201cThere must be substantial evidence to support ... a board\u2019s ruling, and hearsay, unless specially permitted by statute, is not competent evidence to that end.\u201d <em>(Walker v. City of San Gabriel </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 879, 881 [129 P.2d 349] <em>{Walker), </em>overruled on another ground in <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 37, 44 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29].)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">California decisions adhere to the so-called \u201cresiduum rule,\u201d under which the substantial evidence supporting an agency\u2019s decision must consist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>of at least \u201ca residuum of legally admissible evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 60, p. 72.) A version of the rule has been codified in this state\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.), which provides: \u201cHearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but over timely objection <em>shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding </em>unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (d), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">This provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11340 et seq.) does not apply to hearings before the Commission, and the agency has never expressly adopted the rules embodied in that statute. (\u00a7 1701, subd. (b); <em>Re Pacific Gas and Electric Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.P.U.C.2d at p. 354.) The Commission\u2019s decisions nevertheless follow the general rule stated in Government Code section 11513, subdivision (d) and articulated by the California Supreme Court in cases such as <em>Walker, supra, </em>20 Cal.2d 879. For example, in <em>Clear World Communications, supra, </em>2005 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 221 at page *81, the Commission noted that \u201c[w]hile hearsay is admissible in our administrative hearings, it cannot be the basis for an evidentiary finding without corroboration where the truth of the out-of-court statements is at issue. (Gov. Code \u00a7 11513(d).)\u201d Consequently, hearsay is admissible in Commission proceedings, but it \u201cmay not be solely relied upon to support a finding.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Re Communication TeleSystems Intemat. </em>(1996) 66 Cal.P.U.C.2d 286, 292, fn. 8.) Thus, like the California courts, the Commission has followed the residuum rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The residuum rule, and the California cases applying it, have been the subject of forceful criticism. (Collins, <em>Hearsay and the Administrative Process: A Review and Reconsideration of the State of the Law of Certain Evidentiary Procedures Applicable in California Administrative Proceedings </em>(1976) 8 Sw.U. L.Rev. 579, 591-598, 607-615.) The rule was abandoned in the federal courts after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Perales </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 389 [28 L.Ed.2d 842, 91 S.Ct. 1420]. (See, e.g., <em>Johnson v. U.S. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1980) 202 U.S.App. D.C. 187 [628 F.2d 187, 190] [\u201cWe have rejected a per se approach that brands evidence as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>insubstantial solely because it bears the hearsay label.\u201d].) Thus, in a case upon which the Commission relies, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected as unsupported the claim \u201cthat uncorroborated and untested testimony and hearsay testimony cannot constitute substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(EchoStar Communications Corp. v. FC.C. </em>(D.C. Cir. 2002) 292 F.3d 749, 753 <em>(EchoStar).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">As the foregoing discussion of California law makes clear, however, the Commission\u2019s reliance on <em>EchoStar </em>is necessarily misplaced. Unlike federal law, under California statutory and decisional law, as well as the Commission\u2019s own decisions, uncorroborated hearsay cannot constitute substantial evidence to support an agency\u2019s decision absent specific statutory authorization.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 536-537; accord, <em>In re Lucero L. </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1227, 1244 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 56, 998 P.2d 1019] [citing <em>Walker </em>with approval].) This means that even if it was proper for the Commission to consider and rely upon the Rothleder Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition over the petitioners\u2019 procedural objections, its finding that the Oakley Project is needed cannot rest on those materials alone. Having clarified that this hearsay evidence may not serve as the sole factual basis for the Commission\u2019s finding, we now consider whether there is other competent, substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">IV. <em>The Commission\u2019s Finding of Need Is Unsupported by Substantial Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Petitioners contend the Commission\u2019s finding of need for the Oakley Project is unsupported by substantial evidence. They concede hearsay evidence is admissible before the Commission, but they argue that the Rothleder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>Declaration and the Sutter Waiver Petition lack the \u201c \u2018satisfactory indicia of reliability\u2019 \u201d that make reliance on hearsay evidence appropriate. <em>(Rehearing Decision, supra, </em>2013 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 134 atp. *12, quoting <em>EchoStar, supra, </em>292 F.3d at p. 753.) In addition, they assert there is no corroborating evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that \u201cthe integration of the 33% RPS and phase-out of [OTC] plants creates the potential for a significant reliability risk before 2020.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">In response, both the Commission and PG&amp;E set forth lists of evidence they contend supports the Commission\u2019s finding of need. In accordance with our standard of review, we will examine the cited evidence in light of all relevant evidence in the record. <em>(Lucas Valley, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">A. <em>The Evidence Cited by the Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">We begin with the evidence upon which the Commission expressly relied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To support the finding of need, the <em>Oakley Decision </em>cited only the Sutter Waiver Petition and a statement by the CAISO\u2019s chief executive officer, Steve Berberich. <em>(Oakley Decision, supra, </em>2012 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 594 at pp. *31-*34.) Acknowledging their hearsay nature, the Commission gave these materials \u201creduced weight,\u201d but it adjudged them to be \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of the existence of a significant reliability risk. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>SEPE, L.P. v. Public Utilities Commission, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.4th at p. 794 [Commission may weigh value of conflicting evidence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Petitioners argue these hearsay materials are particularly unreliable based on a number of factors. Since the Commission has already recognized the materials are hearsay and has accorded them reduced weight, we need not determine whether they should be given <em>even less </em>weight because of the factors petitioners raise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As explained in part III.B., <em>ante, </em>unless the CAISO materials are corroborated by other competent evidence, they do not constitute substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s decision. Thus, whatever evidentiary weight is due the CAISO materials, they cannot alone support the Commission\u2019s finding of need for the Oakley Project. <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 538, fn. 3; <em>Clear World Communications, supra, </em>2005 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 221 at p. *81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>As further support for the Commission\u2019s finding of need, the <em>Rehearing Decision </em>cited a passage from the District\u2019s final determination of compliance for the Oakley Project. <em>(Rehearing Decision, supra, </em>2013 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 134 at p. *25.) The District stated: \u201cThe proposed facility will . . . provide energy-efficient electric generation capacity using new conventional generation technology, with operational flexibility to efficiently address grid fluctuations due to the intermittent nature of renewable generation such as wind and solar.\u201d This statement, however, says only that the Oakley facility would provide generation capacity to address <em>general </em>grid fluctuations due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. It does not address the actual question posed in the Scoping Memo, which was \u201cwhether the Oakley project will meet a <em>specific, unique </em>reliability issue.\u201d (Italics added.) Moreover, the District\u2019s passing statement was made in the context of its analysis of \u201chow the facility will comply with applicable air quality regulatory requirements.\u201d The District was <em>not </em>analyzing the issue of need for the Oakley Project,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and its statement therefore does not support the Commission\u2019s finding on that issue. (See <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 331, 349 &amp; fn. 11 [102 Cal.Rptr. 313, 497 P.2d 785] <em>(City of Los Angeles) </em>[evidence did not support increase in cost of service where it addressed only cost of establishing new service in one city but not costs in cities where service was already established].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The <em>Rehearing Decision </em>also quoted from the CEC\u2019s final permit decision on the Oakley Project. <em>(Rehearing Decision, supra, </em>2013 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 134 at pp. *24-*25.) After acknowledging the intermittent nature of wind and solar power, the CEC noted, \u201cin order to rely on such intermittent sources . . . , utilities must have available other, nonrenewable generating resources . . . that can fill the gap when renewable generation decreases. ... [1] [The Oakley Project] is likely to serve as an important firming source for intermittent renewable resources in support of California\u2019s RPS and [greenhouse gas] goals.\u201d The CEC explained, however, that its \u201csiting process is not intended to determine market need for power plants. That determination is made by the [Commission], which, in December 2010 approved the [PSA] between the Applicant and PG&amp;E for the [Oakley] Project.\u201d The CEC thus disclaimed any intention to determine whether the Oakley Project was needed, referring instead to the Commission\u2019s approval of the Oakley PSA in Decision 10-12-050, the decision we annulled in <em>TURN I. </em>In light of these limitations, the CEC\u2019s statement does not constitute substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s determination of need. (Cf. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 340 [where sole support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Commission decision was earlier decision annulled by Supreme Court, decision under review could not be sustained].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">B. <em>Other Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">In its answer, the Commission points to the testimony of a PG&amp;E witness as support for the claim that \u201cthe Oakley Project can provide a significant contribution to the integration of the 33% RPS.\u201d First, although the Commission has provided us with some excerpts of the reporter\u2019s transcript, the cited testimony does not appear to be among them. Second, testimony about whether the Oakley Project can contribute to meeting a possible need does not support the claim that the need itself exists. The remaining evidence cited in the Commission\u2019s answer addresses issues other than the Scoping Memo\u2019s question about whether the Oakley Project is needed to address a specific, unique reliability issue. We find no support for the finding of need in this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">PG&amp;E\u2019s answer lists other items of evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding of need, evidence not cited in the Commission\u2019s own answer. Much of the evidence simply refers to or relies on the CAISO\u2019s assessment of need. For example, the rebuttal testimony submitted by the Coalition of California Utility Employees and California Unions for Reliable Energy states, \u201cThe period during which there are <em>fears </em>that reliability needs <em>may occur </em>that a 2020 power plant cannot meet, <em>according to the </em>[CAISO], is every year from 2013 through 2019 . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The testimony makes no definitive statement that there will be reliability needs, but makes projections about \u201cpost-2016 Sutter costs\u201d <em>\u201cif </em>there are reliability needs in 2020 or before.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">PG&amp;E also cites its own testimony concerning the possible effect of the retirement of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and nonrenewal of the licenses for its Diablo Canyon nuclear powerplant. But this testimony is based in significant part on the <em>possibility </em>that licenses for the latter plant will not be renewed in 2024 and 2025. PG&amp;E claimed only that <em>if </em>its Diablo Canyon plant is not relicensed, there will be a greater need for new generation sources in Northern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>PG&amp;E also directs us to various attachments to DRA\u2019s testimony. Some of these are simply slides from a CAISO presentation showing how electrical generating capacity varies over the course of a day. They are thus both hearsay and unresponsive to the question of need. Another is a data response from PG&amp;E concerning the Oakley Project\u2019s effect on the retirement of OTC facilities. It also fails to address the issue of need for the Oakley Project. Yet another is testimony PG&amp;E and other utilities provided in the Commission\u2019s 2010 LTPP proceeding, but as explained earlier, in that proceeding PG&amp;E joined a settlement in which it agreed that further analysis would be needed \u201c \u2018before any renewable integration resource need determination is made.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Decision Approving Settlement, supra, </em>2012 Cal.P.U.C. Lexis 192 at p. *8.) Finally, PG&amp;E also cites a DRA cross-examination exhibit that consists of Rothleder\u2019s testimony in a separate Commission proceeding. This testimony does not appear to be sworn and is hearsay in any event. Furthermore, Rothleder states that the CAISO \u201crecommends that the Commission\u2019s assessment of the need for new system resources to meet renewable integration needs should take place <em>in this docket during calendar year 2013 </em>with a decision on system needs by December 2013.\u201d (Italics added.) Given that recommendation, this testimony would hardly seem to support a finding of need in <em>this </em>proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">In sum, the materials identified by PG&amp;E are either themselves based on CAISO\u2019s hearsay analysis or do not address the issue of need for the Oakley Project. They therefore cannot serve to corroborate the hearsay materials upon which the Commission relied to support its finding of need. Because the Commission\u2019s finding is based upon uncorroborated hearsay evidence, and the truth of the CAISO\u2019s extrarecord statements is disputed, the finding cannot be sustained. <em>(Clear World Communications, supra, </em>2005 Cal.P.U.C.

It appears PG&amp;E may have asked the CAISO to submit testimony, but the CAISO declined to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b868-8\"> On July 8, 2013, PG&amp;E filed a request that we take judicial notice of several Commission decisions, as well as a document from the Commission\u2019s records and an ALJ decision. We grant the request with respect to exhibits A through S, which are copies of Commission decisions. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c).) We deny as moot the request as to exhibits T and U.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b873-9\"> Neither the Commission nor PG&amp;E claims these documents fall within an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\"> Witkin calls hearsay falling within an exception to the hearsay rale \u201ccompetent hearsay.\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (5th ed. 2012) Introduction, \u00a7 67, p. 80.) \u201cIncompetent hearsay\u201d is hearsay evidence that would not be admissible over objection in a civil action. (See <em>id.., </em>\u00a7 68 at p. 81.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b875-8\"> The Commission does not appear to have concluded it may base a finding of fact solely upon uncorroborated hearsay evidence that does not fall within an exception to the hearsay rale. (See <em>Re Investigation into Possible Overassessment by the State Board of Equalization of Property Owned by Commission-regulated Utilities </em>(1998) 80 Cal.P.U.C.2d 685, 697, fn. 1 [declining to decide the question]; cf. <em>Re Pacific Gas and Electric Co., supra, </em>23 Cal.P.U.C.2d at p. 354 [\u201cWe . . . have not reached the question of whether documentary evidence, standing alone, would provide legally sufficient evidence of a disputed fact necessary to support our decision.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b876-7\"> Since the Commission\u2019s own precedent holds that uncorroborated hearsay is insufficient to support a finding of disputed fact, it does not appear to claim it possesses such specific statutory authorization. We note that in response to petitioners\u2019 procedural arguments, the Commission and PG&amp;E have relied on the following language of section 1701, subdivision (a): \u201cNo informality in any hearing, investigation, or proceeding or in the manner of taking testimony shall invalidate any order, decision or rule made, approved, or confirmed by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">The California Supreme Court has required very explicit statutory authorization before permitting an agency\u2019s reliance on uncorroborated hearsay. For example, hearings in workers\u2019 compensation cases are governed by Labor Code section 5709, which provides: \u201cNo informality in any proceeding or in the manner of taking testimony shall invalidate any order, decision, award, or rule made and filed as specified in this division. <em>No order, decision, award, or rule shall be invalidated because of the admission into the record, and use as proof of any fact in dispute, of any evidence not admissible under the common law or statutory rules of evidence and procedure.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) In <em>Daniels, </em>the court suggested that even this very broad statutory language \u201cdoes not necessarily sanction sole reliance on uncorroborated hearsay.\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 538-539, fn. 4.) We need not definitively resolve the issue, as the Commission\u2019s own rulings preclude reliance on uncorroborated hearsay to support a finding of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\"> The Commission\u2019s identification of the evidence upon which it relied in making findings of fact is helpful for purposes of judicial review, but there is no requirement that its decisions \u201ccontain a complete summary of all proceedings and evidence leading to the decision.\u201d <em>(Toward Utility Rate Normalization v. Public Utilities Com. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 529, 540 [149 Cal.Rptr. 692, 585 P.2d 491].) Our statutory standard of review requires us to evaluate the findings in the decision \u201cin light of the whole record.\u201d (\u00a7 1757, subd. (a)(4).) We therefore consider all record evidence, even if it was not specifically cited by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\"> Since we do not reach this issue, we deny as moot IEP\u2019s June 21, 2013 request for judicial notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b878-5\"> Indeed, while PG&amp;E\u2019s prepared testimony cited this passage from the District\u2019s determination, it did so only in the chapter of its testimony addressing the Oakley Project\u2019s development and construction status, not in the chapter addressing the issue of need.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\"> Citing an online news release, rather than material in the Commission\u2019s record, PG&amp;E tells us that Southern California Edison has announced plans to retire this plant.
