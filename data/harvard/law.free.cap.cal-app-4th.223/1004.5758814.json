J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATa\">\u2014In this postjudgment marital dissolution proceeding, the parties extensively litigated tire division of the proceeds from the sale of a parcel of community real property. On appeal from the resulting order, appellant Linda A. Boblitt (wife) contends\u2014among other things\u2014that the trial court violated her right to due process because, less than a month before the postjudgment evidentiary hearing, the court added an issue to those that were scheduled to be heard, thereby effectively precluding her from conducting discovery on the new issue because \u201cdiscovery is cut off 30 days before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>trial by statute.\u201d In the published portion of our opinion, we reject wife\u2019s due process claim because in a marital dissolution proceeding like this, once discovery closes before the initial date set for trial <em>of the action, </em>no provision of law operates to automatically reopen it upon or in connection with the filing of a postjudgment motion. Because wife never moved to reopen discovery following the filing of the postjudgment motion on which the evidentiary hearing was set, she was not deprived of any discovery rights by the trial court\u2019s ruling relating to the scope of the issues to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we reject the remainder of wife\u2019s arguments and affirm the trial court\u2019s postjudgment order relating to the division of the sales proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">We take the initial facts from our prior unpublished opinion in this case <em>(In re Marriage of Boblitt </em>(Oct. 15, 2010, C059747)): \u201c</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">\u201cWife and respondent Steven Boblitt (husband) were married in December 1989 and separated in January 2004. Wife filed the petition for dissolution of the marriage in January 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-8\">\u201cAt the time of separation, the parties were running two companies: Boblitt Trucking and Made Rite Concrete. In 2005, Scott German, a certified public accountant, was appointed as a \u2018sort of\u2019 receiver for the two companies plus a third, Steve\u2019s Rock N Ready Mix.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-9\">\u201cThe marriage was dissolved by a status only judgment of dissolution in October 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-10\">\u201cIn April 2007, a two-day trial was held before Judge Peter McBrien on the characterization of a parcel of real property (the Hedge Avenue property). The remainder of the case was tried over 19 days before Judge James Mize in July and August 2007.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Boblitt, supra, </em>C059747, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">On August 2, 2007, Judge Mize told the parties he was \u201cgoing to try to get all of [his], not just decisions, but thinking and analysis ... on the record so it w[ould] be available for production into the judgment in this case.\u201d As relevant here, the court divided numerous items of community property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>debt and resolved various claims for credits and reimbursements. Among other things, the court stated as follows: \u201cThe debt taken by wife of 77,246 will be credited to her account. Debts, see community property by husband of 27,096 will be credited to him.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court took under submission an issue regarding \u201cpre-marital tax debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The court asked the husband\u2019s (husband) attorney if he was going to prepare the judgment, and counsel agreed he would. The court reminded him to \u201csubmit it to [wife\u2019s] counsel for review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">At some point, husband\u2019s attorney wrote to the court \u201cconcerning the Statement of Decision and requesting a ruling on the submitted matters,\u201d and the court set a meeting with the parties and their attorneys for February 7, 2008. At that meeting, husband\u2019s attorney submitted a proposed judgment and statement of decision to the court and served it on wife\u2019s attorney. The court also set a briefing schedule on the premarital tax debt issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Wife did not file or serve any objections to husband\u2019s proposed statement of decision. Instead, wife filed and served her own proposed statement of decision on February 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">On April 2, 2008, the court issued an order after hearing that ruled on the premarital tax debt issue the court had taken under submission and that also addressed the court\u2019s statement of decision. With regard to the statement of decision, the order stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-9\">\u201cThe Court has reviewed [husband]\u2019s Proposed Statement of Decision in this case. [Wife] has not filed any objections to [husband]\u2019s Proposed Statement of Decision. [Wife] has filed a [wife\u2019s] Proposed Statement of Decision. The court has reviewed [wife]\u2019s Proposed SOD and found it significantly inconsistent with [husband]\u2019s Proposed SOD. Since [wife]\u2019s Proposed SOD is organized differently and is different in focus and style from [husband]\u2019s Proposed SOD, the Court is unable to determine what provisions of [husband]\u2019s Proposed SOD [wife] finds objectionable, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-10\">\u201cTo the extent that the two proposed SOD\u2019s are submitted for the Court\u2019s consideration, the court finds [husband]\u2019s Proposed SOD to be a more accurate reflection of the Court\u2019s findings at trial. In addition, since [wife] did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>not file any formal objections, the court has insufficient guidance to assist it in determining any possible objections [wife] may have had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-4\">\u201cNevertheless, in its own review of [husband]\u2019s proposed SOD, the Court found three items that needed correction or clarification: . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">After articulating these three items (which are not relevant for our purposes) and making its ruling on the tax issue, the court concluded as follows: \u201cSubject to the addition of the Court\u2019s ruling on the tax reimbursement matter, the Court will otherwise adopt [husband]\u2019s Proposed SOD as amended herein as the Court\u2019s Statement of Decision in this matter. [Husband] is ordered to prepare the formal final SOD with the above stated edits for the Court\u2019s execution and filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Thereafter, on April 14, 2008, the court filed the revised statement of decision and a judgment on reserved issues that incorporated the statement of decision. The bottom line of the property division and other determinations was that wife owed husband a small equalizing payment. The judgment and statement of decision did not conclusively and finally resolve all of the property issues, however. The court made some determinations regarding the Hedge Avenue property and another parcel of real property (the Ranchita Way property) that left certain issues for future resolution as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">\n<em>The Ranchita Way Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The court determined that the Ranchita Way property was community property and awarded it to wife, subject to an outstanding mortgage and home equity line of credit. The court further determined that husband was entitled to Epstein<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> credits for payments he had made on the mortgage and the line of credit after separation. The court ordered wife to \u201crefinance the Ranchita home and hold husband harmless from all debt on the home.\u201d The court further ordered that \u201c[i]f husband makes any additional mortgage payments due to Wife failing to do so, he shall have a right of reimbursement secured by all other property awarded to [wife] in this action.\u201d (These provisions were not part of the court\u2019s oral ruling in Aug. 2007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">\n<em>The Hedge Avenue Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The Hedge Avenue property, which had previously been determined to be community property, was \u201cprimarily a commercial property that the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>had utilized for their businesses,\u201d although \u201cthere [we]re also two small adjacent residences associated with the property.\u201d The court ordered the property sold and ordered that \u201cthe net proceeds shall be divided equally subject to equalization payments.\u201d The court also ordered that each party was to have \u201cthe right of first refusal to match any viable, good-faith offer to purchase the property from an \u2018arm\u2019s length\u2019, <em>bona fide </em>third-party, and purchase the property from the community.\u201d The court ordered wife to \u201cimmediately execute an Interspousal transfer deed on the . . . property in favor of Husband and Wife as tenants in common.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Additionally, the court noted that \u201c[tjhere were also residential rents paid by tenants\u201d on the Hedge Avenue property and ordered that the parties were \u201cto share equally in the net profit, if any, from the rental of the residential units at the property.\u201d The court ordered the parties \u201cto collaborate and render an accounting which takes into account the income and expenses of the property and each party is entitled to one-half of the net proceeds, if any.\u201d The court further ordered that there would be no \u201crent charged to either party for truck space rental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The court determined that wife was entitled to an <em>Epstein </em>credit for mortgage payments she made after separation on the Hedge Avenue property. The court also noted that \u201c[o]n this same asset, in a previous order, the parties agreed that the <em>[Watts] </em>charge for the Hedge Avenue property would be $3,000.00 per month payable to the community.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] As of trial, Mr. Boblitt had used the Hedge property exclusively for twenty two months and, therefore, owed the community $66,000.00 \u2018rent\u2019 for the property.\u201d The court \u201creserve[d] jurisdiction on updating these figures for equalization from the sale of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Wife filed a timely appeal from the judgment, and this court affirmed in October 2010. <em>(In re Marriage of Boblitt, supra, </em>C059747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">A year and one-half later, in March 2012\u2014four years after the entry of judgment\u2014a third party offered to buy the Hedge Avenue property for $350,000. That offer expired before it was accepted, but the potential buyer later expressed continued interest in buying the property and revived its offer toward the end of April, although the amount of the offer was to start dropping after five days. On May 4, 2012, husband filed a motion to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>the sale of the property. Husband also requested that the net sales proceeds be placed in a trust account pending further order, that the parties \u201cexchange a written accounting specifically setting forth their proposed credits with regard to post judgment contributions to the Hedge property,\u201d and that the court set a date for an evidentiary hearing on the division of the net sales proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">In her initial response, wife informed the court that she wanted to exercise her right of first refusal. At an ex parte hearing on husband\u2019s request for emergency relief or an order shortening time, the court ordered that wife could exercise her right of first refusal by depositing the same amount as the third party buyer would have to deposit in an account that could be withdrawn only upon order of the court. The court then set the hearing on husband\u2019s motion for May 18. Before that hearing, wife filed another response in which she requested that she be allowed to deposit the money necessary to buy out husband\u2019s interest in the Hedge Avenue property and that a \u201c[r]egular evidentiary hearing [be] set to determine each parties [szc] claims for reimbursements on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">At the hearing on May 18, husband\u2019s attorney informed the court (Judge Kevin Culhane) that the third party offer to purchase was now $329,000. Eventually, the parties worked out that wife would deposit $255,000, which was the difference between the $329,000 offer and the approximate amount due on the first mortgage, in an interest-bearing account by June 1, husband would execute a quitclaim deed, and wife would be entitled to exclusive use of the property as of that time. The court also ordered that husband\u2019s claim of damages to the community due to wife\u2019s failure to exercise her right of first refusal as to the first offer for $350,000 was preserved for trial, as were wife\u2019s claims for damages or offsets due to property use, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Husband\u2019s attorney asked for \u201ca hearing date ... to adjudicate . . . this division\u201d and \u201ca date before that for the parties to exchange their accountings.\u201d The court asked, \u201cis this going to be issues as it relates to this property or is it going to be all property issues involved in the marriage?\u201d Husband\u2019s attorney initially responded, \u201cNo, just as to this property.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney said, \u201cIt depends.\u201d Husband\u2019s attorney then spoke up again, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, there are some credits on page 5 [of the judgment] relating to husband making mortgage payments on another property.\u201d (This was a reference to the provision regarding the Ranchita Way property mentioned above.) Wife\u2019s attorney then said that wife had an issue regarding equipment that was awarded to her that she believed husband had destroyed. The court stated that it was \u201cjust trying to get how long a trial time [the parties] want[ed] for these issues.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney suggested two days \u201cwould be good.\u201d Ultimately, the court set trial for August 16 and 17 on \u201cfinancial claims as against the sales proceeds\u201d with settlement conference set for July 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>In mid-June, wife\u2019s attorney served husband\u2019s attorney with a request for production of documents, with the date of production set for July 13. On June 21, wife\u2019s attorney noticed husband\u2019s deposition for July 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">On June 26, the parties\u2019 attorneys exchanged letters. For her part, wife\u2019s attorney refused to limit husband\u2019s deposition \u201cother than to limit the inquiry into the current post-judgment issues before the court\u201d and refused to withdraw the request for production of documents. She also stated that this was her \u201cthird request to explain how your client\u2019s Ranchita reimbursement requests have anything to do with the motion which was set for trial.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney threatened to file a motion to compel husband\u2019s deposition with no restrictions and to include the Ranchita Way reimbursement issue in her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">For his part, husband\u2019s attorney asked wife\u2019s attorney to provide him with \u201cauthority that another deposition is allowed.\u201d (Underscoring omitted.) Regarding the Ranchita Way reimbursement issue, husband\u2019s attorney identified the relevant provision in the judgment and referred wife\u2019s attorney to an accounting he had provided to her in March 2011, which included copies of canceled checks. He stated that husband \u201cmade payments of $15,747.54 on the first mortgage and payments of $2,208.85 on the second mortgage.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">On June 29, husband filed a motion requesting that \u201call issues related to each party\u2019s request for credits/debts pertaining to their portion of the sale of the community property ... be heard at trial on August 16, 2012.\u201d The basis Tor this motion was the suggestion from the June 26 letter from wife\u2019s attorney that she was going to block any attempt by husband to introduce evidence regarding the posttrial payments he made on the Ranchita Way property. The hearing on husband\u2019s motion was originally set for August 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Around this same time, wife filed a motion to compel husband\u2019s deposition (even though the scheduled deposition date had not yet arrived), for evidentiary sanctions, and to exclude any claims related to the Ranchita Way property from the upcoming trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Wife\u2019s motion was set for hearing on July 24, the same day as the settlement conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Husband\u2019s deposition went forward on July 6 as scheduled, and he produced documents in response to wife\u2019s request for production on July 13 as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In a settlement conference statement filed July 18, husband set forth in detail his position regarding the rental income that was collected on the Hedge Avenue property, the mortgage payments and other expenses he paid on the property, and the amounts he paid posttrial on the mortgage and the line of credit on the Ranchita Way property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">On July 19, wife filed her response to husband\u2019s motion to have all issues of credits and debts heard at the August 16 trial. She argued that the request was \u201cvague and uncertain, which could easily lead to due process issues.\u201d She also asserted that because trial was \u201conly 3 weeks [away], adding new issues to trial would cut off any of my discovery rights on those issues.\u201d All that she said, however, about husband\u2019s claim for reimbursement for the posttrial mortgage and line of credit payments he claimed to have made on the Ranchita Way property was that this claim was \u201cnot in his prior motion and is not before the court at this time.\u201d Her greater focus was on new issues <em>she </em>wanted to raise about losing the Ranchita Way property in foreclosure because the loan was sold and husband refused to give her any information about the new mortgage company so she could make the mortgage payments and about a mechanic\u2019s lien that was on the Ranchita Way property that she discovered only after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">In her response, wife also asserted that the judgment, which by then was more than four years old, contained \u201c[cjlerical [ejrrors\u201d (underscoring omitted) that needed to be corrected, and she stated that she would be filing a motion to correct those errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">At the hearing on July 24 on wife\u2019s motion to exclude any claims related to the Ranchita Way property from the upcoming trial, the court (Judge Culhane) asked if wife\u2019s attorney had sent contention interrogatories to find out what all of husband\u2019s contentions were. Wife\u2019s attorney asserted that the Ranchita Way issues were \u201cnot before the Court,\u201d but the court disagreed, stating, \u201cThey\u2019re before the Court because when you folks were here and we had to figure out who was going to buy ... the Hedge Avenue property, one of the issues that your side raised was ... we should not have to match the number that the third-party buyer will match because we have any number of offsets and credits that we believe we\u2019re entitled to. Their side said, no, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>you\u2019re not entitled to those offsets or credits. They\u2019re disputed because we have a number of other issues back and forth. All we said was, look, let\u2019s get the property sold so that we convert the real property into a sum of cash without prejudice to all parties\u2019 rights to litigate whatever they want in terms of their entitlements to that money. That was all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">For his part, husband\u2019s attorney argued that the trial would be limited to the facts, issues, and contentions set forth in the settlement conference statements both parties had filed. Wife\u2019s attorney complained that \u201cthere was a motion\u201d but \u201c[n]ow he\u2019s raising these other issues, and he wants to exclude my client from raising other issues that she has because those aren\u2019t in the pretrial statement because my view was that those were not set for trial .... So what\u2019s happening is my client\u2019s going to trial on issues that she never got any due process to in the beginning as to what it was that she was\u2014that they were seeking so I could do any discovery on it.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney \u201cobjected] to anything other than what\u2019s in his motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Adverting to the deposition of husband, the court asked wife\u2019s counsel if she got \u201can order allowing [her] to take that second deposition as required by the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d She replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know that that\u2019s required because this is post judgment. It\u2019s a separate case.\u201d She later stated that she \u201cdidn\u2019t come for leave of Court because he said he would appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">As the discussion continued, the court asked if they could \u201call agree, you can\u2019t just send a second deposition notice just because you want to, right?\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney replied, \u201cI think in family law, not in civil law, but in family law there is a recognition that post-judgment motions act as a separate and individual case when it\u2019s post judgment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Turning back to the Ranchita Way issues, the court suggested that wife\u2019s remedy, if she was unprepared to try those issues, was not to seek to limit the issues that could be raised at trial regarding division of the money from the Hedge Avenue property but instead was to move to continue the trial. Wife\u2019s attorney claimed she had asked for that relief, but in support of that claim she pointed only to her response to husband\u2019s motion to have all credit/debt issues heard at trial on August 16, where she had stated that wife consented to an order that \u201call issues [be combined] into one trial with [a] clear record of issues set for trial, appropriate factual claims and responses and time for discovery.\u201d She could not and did not point to a specific request to continue the trial. The court later reiterated that wife\u2019s remedy regarding her alleged lack of readiness on the Ranchita Way issues was to file a motion to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>the trial. In its order, the court denied wife\u2019s motion \u201cto limit the credit and debit issues between the parties in connection with their claims to Hedge properties [sic].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Following the July 24 hearing, wife apparently filed an ex parte application to continue the trial, but that application does not appear in the record on appeal. Instead, what appears is a preliminary response filed by husband on August 1 in which husband argued that the application should be denied because wife \u201chad over two and a half months to bring a regularly noticed motion before the court seeking continuance of the trial date.\u201d No written disposition of the application is to be found in the record, but there is a transcript from a hearing on August 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">At that hearing, wife\u2019s attorney began by raising a new issue, arguing that husband\u2019s attorney would not give an accounting of the rents he collected on the Hedge Avenue property from the date of separation to 2007. Husband\u2019s attorney responded that the original accounting was provided in March 2011, an updated accounting had been provided, and \u201c[wje\u2019ve already briefed everything.\u201d He also argued that wife could \u201ctake [it] up with the trier of fact. And why is it an emergency today?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The court (Judge Sharon Lueras) stated that it was denying the continuance because it \u201cwould be for the trier of fact to make a determination whether [what husband had done] was sufficient; and if not, you ask for what you want.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney then asserted that she had \u201canother ground\u201d for a continuance, and she said that Judge Culhane had told her she could \u201cdo a continuance based on surprise,\u201d \u201cso that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this.\u201d She went on to argue that the issue of husband seeking \u201c$18,000 reimbursement for the Ranchita house\u201d was \u201cnot in his pleadings from May 4th\u201d and \u201cnot in the transcript when we set it, and therefore, it is not something that he can raise at trial.\u201d When the court asked wife\u2019s attorney if she was \u201caware of Ranchita,\u201d she admitted she knew of it but she argued that husband\u2019s motion was \u201cjust on Hedge.\u201d The court suggested that wife file a motion in limine. The court then denied the motion to continue the trial because \u201c[b]ased on the moving papers and argument, it appears that all parties are aware of the properties that are involved in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The evidentiary hearing regarding division of the funds from the sale of the Hedge Avenue property began on August 16 before Judge Jaime Rom\u00e1n. At the outset, wife\u2019s attorney reiterated her complaint about the scope of the issues to be tried. Among other things, she asserted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>\u201cIf you look at the motion we\u2019re here on today, there\u2019s specific issues that were raised for the hearing. A specific declaration saying these are the facts, this is what I want, it lists out exactly what he wants. There\u2019s never been an amendment to that motion saying I want to put before the Court this issue, this issue, this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">\u201c[S]o basically his Statement of Issues he added a bunch of stuff like, oh, well, my Statement of Issues says this, so I get to raise this, okay. So I go back to the motion and say, wait a minute, we were only set for your motion. We were not set on everything else. [][]... [][]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">\u201c[S]o I don\u2019t think some of the issues that he raises in his Statement of Issues that he\u2019s going to try to contend are before the Court and want to put evidence on, they aren\u2019t even before the Court. .

The stuff that he added in his Statement of Issues that aren\u2019t in his motion, I object to those issues being heard for due process and notice . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Eventually, rather than insisting on a ruling from the court at the outset on the scope of the issues to be tried, wife\u2019s attorney proposed that \u201cif I feel like they\u2019re raising issues that were not in the motion that I\u2014there was no declaration in support of it or anything like that, then I\u2019ll raise my objections [then].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Later, when husband\u2019s attorney began to question husband about the payments he made on the Ranchita Way property, as shown on the accounting prepared in March 2011, wife\u2019s attorney objected that the testimony was \u201c[u]tterly and completely irrelevant to what\u2019s before the Court.\u201d The court sustained the objection. When husband\u2019s attorney tried again, wife\u2019s attorney objected again, and the court stated that it was \u201cnot understanding the connection based on the issue that you\u2019re asking me to determine.\u201d After the court located the judgment in the court file and took judicial notice of it, husband\u2019s attorney pointed out the provision related to payments on the Ranchita Way property, and the court concluded that husband was \u201cseeking to enforce ... the right to reimbursement set forth in\" the judgment and overruled wife\u2019s objection to husband\u2019s testimony. Wife\u2019s attorney interjected that \u201cRanchita is no where [szc] in his May 4th pleading. The fact that these payments were made and that he wants credit for them, it\u2019s not in there.\u201d She then argued about how wife claimed to have lost the Ranchita Way property to foreclosure because husband had prevented her from obtaining information about the mortgage. From this, the court understood that wife wanted to raise the issue about the mortgage in defense to husband\u2019s claims for reimbursement for payments he claimed he made on the mortgage, and the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>going to allow wife to do that. Husband\u2019s attorney said, \u201cthat will be fine.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney then complained that she did not \u201chave the records on Ranchita with [her] because it was not an issue before the Court.\u201d The court stated that it would put the trial over for another day for wife to prepare. Wife\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cAs long as I get the opportunity to get the discovery so I can get the records to you, that would be fine.\u201d The court replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to do right by you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Wife\u2019s attorney then objected to the testimony regarding reimbursement for payments on the Ranchita Way property because she claimed the provision in the judgment on the subject was \u201cno where [jic] in the judge\u2019s [oral] ruling. [Husband\u2019s attorney] just added it\u201d to the statement of decision when he prepared it. Husband\u2019s attorney argued that \u201cthis issue\u201d had been dealt with on appeal from the judgment and that \u201cone doesn\u2019t look at transcripts. You look at the judgment, Statement of Decision. Despite any stray or conflicting comments before, this is the one that the Court ultimately approved, period and full stop.\u201d Ultimately, the court decided to take an early lunch break and use the time to read the transcript of Judge Mize\u2019s oral ruling, the statement of decision, and the appellate decision, while allowing wife\u2019s attorney time to read the appellate decision as well. Wife\u2019s attorney stated that there were \u201ctwo other issues\u201d she wanted to raise, but the court told her to \u201c[j]ust file it\u201d and get it to the court by 1:00 p.m., and the court would read it.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">During the break, wife\u2019s attorney prepared and filed a handwritten request to correct three \u201cclerical errors\u201d in the judgment (only two of which remain at issue on appeal). In addition to the Ranchita Way reimbursement provision that she asserted was not part of the trial court\u2019s oral ruling, wife\u2019s attorney complained that the court\u2019s oral ruling gave wife credit for $77,246 in community debts she paid, but that provision was omitted from the judgment and she received no credit for those payments. Wife\u2019s attorney requested that the court amend the judgment to conform to the oral ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">After the lunch break, husband\u2019s attorney argued that because wife failed to file any objections to husband\u2019s proposed statement of decision, any objection was \u201cwaived.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney argued that in the prior appeal from the judgment this court \u201cnever made a decision on the Statement of Decision,\u201d and a clerical error in a judgment can be corrected at any time, even after appeal. Judge Rom\u00e1n ultimately denied wife\u2019s request to correct the alleged clerical errors in the judgment because he believed the request should be made to Judge Mize and, more importantly, because any issue wife had with the statement of decision was \u201cforfeited]\" because wife did not raise it in her appeal from the judgment, which this court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In a written ruling the court issued later that same day, the court ruled that wife\u2019s request to correct the judgment \u201c\u2014even her effort to characterize the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>omission as clerical\u2014is barred by res-judicata. In other words, this issue has been put to rest by the appellate court\u2019s affirmation of her judgment. As reflected by the appellate court in her appeal, \u2018No error has been shown.\u2019 \u201d (Fns. omitted.) Accordingly, the court concluded that it \u201clack[ed] jurisdiction to do more than enforce the appellate affirmed judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Following the denial of wife\u2019s motion to correct the judgment, husband\u2019s attorney resumed his examination of husband regarding the various expenditures shown in the March 2011 accounting, and that document was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Thereafter, on cross-examination, wife\u2019s attorney questioned husband about his use of the Hedge Avenue property after the trial and about the provision in the judgment that charged him $66,000 for using the property exclusively for 22 months up until trial and that \u201creserve[d] jurisdiction on updating these figures for equalization from the sale of the property.\u201d Husband testified that he did not think he should be charged $3,000 per month for continuing to use the Hedge Avenue property after judgment, and when wife\u2019s attorney asked him why, he replied, \u201cBecause at that point it wasn\u2019t rentable. At any point it wasn\u2019t rentable. And why should I rent from myself? I owned half the property. What would I rent from? She had the ability\u2014she left equipment there. She had use of it. It was her own choice that she didn\u2019t come to the property.\u201d Husband later added, \u201cthe property itself other than the two houses [w]as not rentable in any way, shape or form. [It wasn\u2019t] zoned for anything that we did there, ever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">As wife\u2019s attorney argued to the court that the $66,000 figure from the judgment should be updated based on husband\u2019s continued use of the Hedge Avenue property after trial, the court observed that \u201c[t]he judgment . . . effectively transmuted [the property] from community property to tenants in common,\u201d and the court asked, \u201chow can you have a <em>[Watts] </em>charge on tenants in common?\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney responded that the Hedge Avenue property was \u201ccommunity property regardless of title.\u201d The court disagreed, saying that \u201cJudge Mize took it out of that characterization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Wife\u2019s attorney subsequently began examining husband about the rent he collected on the two residences on the Hedge Avenue property. Her examination eventually turned to rents collected before the trial in 2007. She asked if husband ever provided her \u201cwith an accounting of the amount of rents that [he] collected from February \u201904 through the date of [trial], August 2nd, 2007,\u201d and husband replied that he did not \u201cthink it was relevant.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney pointed out the provision in the judgment regarding an accounting of the income and expenses of the property and the division of the net profit and asked if husband ever \u201cengage[d] in that accounting of the profit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>Hedge Avenue property.\u201d Husband responded, \u201cThere weren\u2019t any.\u201d He later testified that the rents were paid \u201cto Boblitt Trucking probably for most of that time and [expenses were] paid from Boblitt Trucking for a lot of that time. We still had a joint business [in] common.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As wife\u2019s attorney continued her cross-examination, husband\u2019s attorney interjected that \u201c[t]his matter ha[d] been adjudicated by the Court of Appeal.\u201d He directed the trial court to a portion of this court\u2019s unpublished opinion on wife\u2019s appeal from the judgment that dealt with an \u201cundeveloped, unsupported argument\u201d regarding the rent and expenses on the Hedge Avenue property. The court then said to wife\u2019s attorney, \u201cCan we deal with the post August 2nd, 2007 period? [f] . . . [f] . . . I\u2019m here to deal with the events after the issuance of the judgment and the sale of this property. I can\u2019t change what took place before.\u201d Upon further argument from wife\u2019s attorney, the court stated that it would \u201cdeal with those rents collected after the issuance of the judgment, not before it\u201d \u201cbecause I can\u2019t redo your equalization payment up to that date that the order got issued.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney argued that Judge Mize had ordered the parties to do an accounting of the rents and expenses relating to the residences on the Hedge Avenue property for the period before trial and \u201c[t]hat has not occurred.\u201d Husband\u2019s attorney argued, \u201cThat was the claim on appeal, and [the Court of Appeal] dealt with it in the negative.\u201d Pointing the court back to our opinion, husband\u2019s attorney contended, \u201cshe brought up this claim that she was owed past due rent, and ... the Court of Appeal denied the claim.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cThey affirmed the judgment. It says it right in there. They didn\u2019t overrule what the judge said. They didn\u2019t overrule it.\u201d The trial court disagreed, saying, \u201cNo. What they did was they gave no credence to her contention.\u201d Wife\u2019s attorney countered, \u201cWell, they said she didn\u2019t even have [a] contention.\u201d The court said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m not going there. I\u2019m going to limit you to post.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Following a break, wife\u2019s attorney asked the court if it was holding that \u201cthe prejudgment for any monies that the parties may owe each other, any calculations prejudgment, you are saying that\u2019s not before the Court or cannot be addressed.\u201d The court reiterated, \u201cI\u2019m only going to deal with my world post this judgment.\u201d The court told wife\u2019s attorney, \u201cmaybe [wife will] have to force an accounting and get that, but not in this trial, not based on the issues that were framed for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The court later issued a written ruling on the subject, stating that it was \u201climiting] the parties to a post-judgment consideration, using the August 2, 2007 date set forth in the court\u2019s judgment, as the salient date for \u2018updating . . . figures for equalization from the sale of the property.\u2019 \u201d According to the court, its decision was based \u201con several factors: first, the judgment included amounts up to a set date; second, the court, having recharacterized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>the property\u2019s ownership from community property to a post-judgment tenancy in common, appropriately permitted further (but new) allocations of proceeds between the tenants upon the sale of the property; and third, the appellate ruling in this matter, having affirmed the earlier court\u2019s judgment, is not without effect re[:] guidance and limitation on the .instant post judgment proceedings.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)'</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Following a second day of testimony, the parties submitted closing briefs. In her closing brief, wife admitted that \u201c[t]he parties did not have an agreement for future payment of rent post-judgment [by husband on the Hedge Avenue property], but the court ordered such in the parties[\u2019] judgment.\u201d In support of this argument, wife referenced the provision in the judgment whereby the court \u201creserve[d] jurisdiction on updating these figures for equalization from the sale of the property.\u201d Wife requested that husband \u201cbe charged for 58 months of rent at $3,000.00 per month for a total of $174,000.00.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">In reply, husband argued that because the parties were tenants in common with respect to the Hedge Avenue property following Judge Mize\u2019s ruling in August 2007, they each had an equal right to possession of the property and therefore wife had no right to compel husband to pay rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">After hearing argument on September 20, the court issued its tentative ruling. Following written input from the parties, the court issued its statement of decision and order on October 12. As relevant here, the trial court awarded husband $17,956.39 for \u201cpayment re Ranchita.\u201d Based on this and other findings, the court ordered that some of the proceeds from the sale of the Hedge Avenue property to wife were to remain in the trust account, to be divided later following the resolution of a lien on the property and husband\u2019s removal of debris and other material on the property, and that some of the proceeds were to be paid to the county for code enforcement violations. From the remaining proceeds, wife was to receive just under $64,000 and husband was to receive just under $96,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Wife timely appealed the court\u2019s order. Husband did not file a respondent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">\n<em>Rules of Civil Procedure Do Apply in Family Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">On appeal, wife first contends the trial court (Judge Culhane) deprived her of due process when the court \u201cgrant[ed husband\u2019s] motion to add Ranchita <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>Way reimbursements as an issue just three (3) weeks and (2) days before trial.\u201d According to wife, by doing this the court \u201cterminated her discovery rights before they ever began, as discovery cut-off is 30 days before trial by statute.\u201d Without the right to conduct discovery and without \u201cany factual pleading in support of [husband\u2019s] Ranchita Way reimbursement claims,\u201d wife contends she was \u201cobliged to defend against [his] claims based on whatever occurred at trial.\u201d She concludes the \u201c[fundamental requirement of due process is [the] opportunity to be heard and the opportunity must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. [Citations.] A meaningful time for notice would include an opportunity to obtain evidence under the discovery statutes, an opportunity [wife was] denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Wife\u2019s due process argument is based on the assumption that she had the \u201cright\u201d to conduct discovery prior to the evidentiary hearing on husband\u2019s postjudgment motion to divide the proceeds from sale of the Hedge Avenue property. That assumption, in turn, appears to be based on the belief of wife\u2019s attorney that \u201cin family law, [but] not in civil law, . . . post-judgment motions act as a separate and individual case . . .\u201d for purposes of discovery. That belief is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Section 210 of the Family Code provides that \u201c[ejxcept to the extent that any other statute or rules adopted by the Judicial Council provide applicable rules, the rules of practice and procedure applicable to civil actions generally . . . apply to, and constitute the rules of practice and procedure in, proceedings under this code.\u201d (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.2(d); <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 1337, 1354 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 483, 163 P.3d 160] [\u201cAlthough some informality and flexibility have been accepted in marital dissolution proceedings, such proceedings are [generally] governed by the same statutory rules of evidence and procedure that apply in other civil actions . . . .\u201d].) No statute or rule of court exempts a marital dissolution proceeding from the application of the Civil Discovery Act (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2016.010 et seq.). Accordingly, the provisions of the Civil Discovery Act\u2014including those provisions that govern the time for completion of discovery (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2024.010 et seq.)\u2014apply to such proceedings. Under those provisions, discovery generally must be completed \u201con or before the 30th day . . . before the date initially set for the trial <em>of the </em>action\u201d <em>{id., </em>\u00a7 2024.020, subd. (a), italics added) and, absent court order (or an agreement of the parties), \u201ccontinuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings\u201d {id., \u00a7 2024.020, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>Here, it appears the date initially set for trial of <em>the action </em>was February 8, 2007.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the discovery cutoff date was in January 2007, and discovery closed at that time by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Wife does not point to, nor are we otherwise aware of, any provision that <em>reopens </em>discovery in a marital dissolution proceeding just because one of the parties has filed a postjudgment motion. The assertion of her attorney that \u201cpost-judgment motions act as a separate and individual case . . .\u201d for purposes of discovery finds no support in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">It is true that our Supreme Court has held that \u201cin the case of a mistrial, order granting a new trial, or remand for a new trial after reversal of a judgment on appeal, the last date for completing discovery is 15 days before the date initially set for the new trial of the action.\u201d <em>(Fairmont Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 247 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 70, 991 P.2d 156].) That holding does not inform or affect our decision here, however, because we are not dealing with a trial \u201cof the action.\u201d Rather, we are dealing with an evidentiary hearing on a postjudgment motion. As we have noted, once discovery closes before the initial date set for trial of the action, no provision of law operates to automatically reopen it upon or in connection with the filing of a postjudgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The Family Code does contain an article that allows for limited postjudgment discovery relating to the \u201cmodification or termination of an order for child, family, or spousal support.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3660 et seq.) Under the provisions of that article, a party may request that the other party produce a current income and expense declaration even if no motion for modification or termination of the support order is pending. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 3664, subd. (a).) Under certain circumstances, the requesting party may also request information on the other party\u2019s income and employment benefits from the other party\u2019s employer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3664, subd. (b).) \u201cMethods of discovery other than that described in this article may only be used if a motion for modification or termination of the support order is pending.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 3662.)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">We do not understand the foregoing provision to imply that once a postjudgment motion for modification or termination of a support order <em>is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>pending, discovery in the action automatically reopens and all of the other methods of discovery available under the Civil Discovery Act are available to the parties without agreement or court order. Rather, we understand the provision to mean simply that when there is no motion pending, the only discovery that may be conducted is a request for an income and expense declaration and, in some instances, a request for pay and benefit information from the other party\u2019s employer. In other words, if after judgment a party simply wants to explore the possibility of moving to modify support, the only discovery that is available is that provided for in Family Code section 3660 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">In any event, these provisions have no direct application here because husband\u2019s postjudgment motion did not seek to modify or terminate a support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Once the discovery cutoff date has run and discovery has closed, the only means provided in the Civil Discovery Act for reopening discovery is a motion for leave of court. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2024.050, subd. (a).) It is true that the statute specifically speaks only of the court granting \u201cleave ... to reopen discovery <em>after a new trial date has been set\u201d </em>(italics added), and that is not exactly the situation in a marital dissolution case where a postjudgment motion has been filed. Nevertheless, we construe the statute as allowing a motion to reopen discovery after judgment in a marital dissolution proceeding because otherwise, in light of the fact that there is no basis for concluding that discovery automatically reopens for each and every postjudgment motion, not construing the statute in this manner would leave the parties without any access to discovery on postjudgment matters where it may be needed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Thus, we conclude there is no automatic right to conduct discovery under the Civil Discovery Act in connection with a postjudgment motion in a marital dissolution proceeding. To secure the right to conduct such discovery, a party must secure the agreement of the other party or must obtain a court order for leave to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The practical effect of our conclusion here is that wife cannot complain she was deprived of due process because the trial court allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>husband to \u201cadd Ranchita Way reimbursements as an issue\u201d after the supposed discovery cutoff preceding the August 16 evidentiary hearing because discovery never reopened. It is true husband went along (albeit begrudgingly) with a deposition and a request for production of documents, but absent an order or formal agreement reopening discovery, wife had no legitimate basis to believe she was entitled to conduct discovery on the subject of husband\u2019s motion, including his claim for reimbursement for posttrial payments on the Ranchita Way property. If wife had obtained an order reopening discovery, and if husband had failed to disclose in response to proper discovery requests that he intended to seek reimbursement for posttrial payments on the Ranchita Way property, wife might have had a basis to complain. As it is, however, wife cannot complain that she was denied the opportunity to conduct discovery when she never properly sought to reopen it.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">In addition to the foregoing, there is another reason why wife\u2019s due process claim regarding husband\u2019s posttrial payments on the Ranchita Way property is without merit. Essentially wife\u2019s claim is that she was sandbagged: husband filed a motion that said nothing about the Ranchita Way property and then, barely three weeks before trial, the court allowed him to add his Ranchita Way claims, an issue she knew nothing about. Indeed, she asserts that husband\u2019s \u201cfactual bases for his Ranchita Way claims were never disclosed until he testified at trial.\u201d On the record before us, however, that assertion is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The evidence here showed that in March 2011, husband\u2019s attorney sent to wife\u2019s attorneys (both her postjudgment attorney and the attorney who represented her at trial in 2007) a document entitled \u201cRespondent\u2019s Accounting Concerning Hedge Property.\u201d The very first items listed in the accounting were husband\u2019s posttrial payments on the Ranchita Way property. Copies of canceled checks corresponding with those payments were attached. These payments\u2014totaling $17,956.39\u2014were included in the total of \u201capproximately $64,358.53\u201d that husband contended wife owed him. Furthermore, husband asserted that the amount owed was \u201cto be paid directly to [husband] from [wife]\u2019s share of the net sellers\u2019 proceeds\u201d and he requested \u201cthat the [Hedge Avenue] property be sold and the net sellers\u2019 proceeds be distributed as ordered in the judgment without any further delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">When the parties\u2019 attorneys argued in correspondence at the end of June 2012 about the Ranchita Way reimbursement issue, husband\u2019s attorney identified the relevant provision in the judgment and referred wife\u2019s attorney to the accounting he had provided to her in March 2011. He stated that husband \u201cmade payments of $15,747.54 on the first mortgage and payments of $2,208.85 on the second mortgage\u201d\u2014the same amounts shown in the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>When he ultimately testified at the hearing in August 2012 regarding his claim for reimbursement on the posttrial Ranchita Way payments, husband testified directly from the March 2011 accounting, and that document was admitted into evidence. Thus, his testimony added nothing to the information his attorney had provided to wife\u2019s attorney almost a year and one-half earlier. In fact, the amount the court ultimately awarded husband on his Ranchita Way claims was the very amount he first identified in the accounting to wife in 2011. Under these circumstances, wife cannot legitimately complain that she was sandbagged and that the court deprived her of due process by allowing husband to claim reimbursement for his posttrial payments on the Ranchita Way property from the proceeds of the sale of the Hedge Avenue property.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">To the extent wife also asserts she was deprived of due process when the trial court (Judge Lueras) denied her request to continue the evidentiary hearing \u201cto permit discovery\u201d because she was not allowed \u201csufficient time to obtain evidence\u201d regarding husband\u2019s Ranchita Way claims, we reject this argument for one of the same reasons we rejected the previous argument. Wife had reason to know almost a year and one-half before the evidentiary hearing in August 2012 that husband was claiming the right to reimbursement from the proceeds of the sale of the Hedge Avenue property for certain, specific posttrial payments he made on the Ranchita Way property. Given this fact, wife cannot reasonably claim she was surprised by his claim or by the evidence he presented in support of it at the evidentiary hearing. No violation of due process has been shown by the denial of wife\u2019s belated request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">\n<em>Accounting of Pretrial Rental Income and Expenses from the Hedge Avenue Property</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">\n<em>Clerical Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Wife contends the trial court (Judge Rom\u00e1n) erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to correct clerical errors in the judgment and in finding that correction of any clerical errors in the judgment was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>On the latter point at least, wife is correct. The trial court cited <em>Avery v. Avery </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 525, 529 [89 Cal.Rptr. 195] for the proposition that res judicata prevented wife from complaining of a clerical error in the judgment because the issue was \u201cput to rest by the appellate court\u2019s affirmation of [the] judgment.\u201d The <em>Avery </em>case, however, does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In Avery, the plaintiff wife brought an action in California to establish as a California judgment a Missouri divorce decree that contained an award of alimony that the husband had not paid. <em>(Avery v. Avery, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d at p. 527.) Four days after commencing the California action, the wife remarried in Missouri. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thereafter, the husband filed an answer and alleged the wife\u2019s remarriage as an affirmative defense. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nine months later, the parties\u2019 attorneys stipulated that the wife was to have judgment against the husband for the arrears owed under the Missouri decree, and judgment was entered on that stipulation. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 527-528.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">When the husband failed to satisfy the California judgment, the wife levied on his wages. <em>(Avery </em>v. <em>Avery, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d at p. 528.) The husband moved to recall and quash the writ of execution based on the wife\u2019s remarriage. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court granted the husband\u2019s motion. <em>(Ibid.) </em>On the wife\u2019s appeal, the appellate court reversed because the judgment entered on the stipulation was \u201cres judicata on the issue of termination of [the husband]\u2019s liability for payment of alimony in gross upon [the wife]\u2019s remarriage and [the husband] is barred from relitigating the issue.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 528-529.) The court explained that \u201c[o]n [the husband\u2019s] motion [to recall and quash the writ of execution] the issue [he] sought to have adjudicated [wa]s identical with that raised by him in the main action; by stipulating therein that judgment be rendered against him, knowing the existence and the importance of the fact of [the wife\u2019s] remarriage, he consented to an adjudication adverse to him on that issue.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">The foregoing reasoning has no application here to wife\u2019s claim that the judgment contains clerical errors. There is no evidence in the record that before the evidentiary hearing in August 2012, wife ever raised a claim that there was a specific clerical error in the judgment. Certainly no issue of a clerical error was raised in wife\u2019s appeal from the judgment, nor could it have been, because wife would have had to first raise the issue in the trial court before she could raise it in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">It is true that in her response to husband\u2019s motion in June 2012 requesting that \u201call issues related to each party\u2019s request for credits/debts pertaining to their portion of the sale of the community property ... be heard at trial on August 16, 2012,\u201d wife asserted (almost as an aside) that the judgment, contained \u201c[cjlerical [e]rrors\u201d (underscoring omitted) that needed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>corrected. At that time, however, wife did not attempt to identify any specific errors; instead, she stated that she would be filing a motion to correct the errors she had found but that motion was \u201cnot done yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Witkin explains that \u201c[a] court of general jurisdiction has the power, after final judgment, and regardless of lapse of time, to correct clerical errors or misprisions in its records, whether made by the clerk, counsel, or the court itself, so that the records will conform to and speak the truth.\u201d (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Judgment, \u00a7 67, p. 603.) \u201cThe correction may be made even though an appeal has been taken and is pending. [Citations.] <em>And it may also be made after affirmance of the judgment on </em>appeal.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 603-604, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Thus, the claim preclusion aspect of the doctrine of res judicata\u2014which bars a party from asserting \u201c \u2018 \u201ca civil claim arising from a transaction with respect to which he has already prosecuted such a claim, whether or not the two claims wholly correspond to each other\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Benasra v. Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 96, 104 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 644])\u2014 does not operate to preclude a party from asserting a clerical error in a judgment just because the party could have made that assertion sometime earlier in the action. The <em>issue preclusion </em>aspect of res judicata\u2014which provides that \u201c \u2018 \u201ca party ordinarily may not relitigate an issue that he fully and fairly litigated on a previous occasion\u201d \u2019 \u201d (ibid.)\u2014would apply to an assertion of clerical error if that assertion had already been made and fully litigated. That did not happen here, however, because there is no indication that wife ever identified any specific alleged clerical errors in the judgment before she did so in the handwritten document she filed at the evidentiary hearing in August 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">While we agree with wife that the trial court erred in finding her assertion of clerical error barred by the doctrine of res judicata, that does not fully resolve the issue before us because ultimately we review the court\u2019s ruling, not its rationale. (See <em>Sackett v. Wyatt </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 592, 598, fn. 2 [108 Cal.Rptr. 219] [demurrer]; <em>Stratton v. First Nat. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1083 [258 Cal.Rptr. 721] [summary judgment].) Thus, the question for us is whether the trial court committed prejudicial error by refusing to correct clerical errors wife identified in the judgment. For the reasons that follow, we find no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">As we have previously noted, wife\u2019s attorney claimed there were three \u201cclerical errors\u201d in the judgment, only two of which remain at issue on appeal. First, she asserted that the provision allowing husband to be reimbursed for posttrial payments he made on the mortgage on the Ranchita Way property was not part of the trial court\u2019s oral ruling. Second, she asserted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>the court\u2019s oral ruling gave wife credit for $77,246 in community debts she paid, but that provision was omitted from the judgment and she received no credit for those payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Wife\u2019s claim of clerical error rests on the fundamental premise that Judge Mize intended the oral ruling he made on the record in August 2007 to be his final ruling, and that any variation between his oral ruling and the statement of decision he signed in April 2008 was unintended and should be corrected as \u201cclerical error.\u201d We reject this premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Wife herself cites <em>Benway </em>v. <em>Benway </em>(1945) 69 Cal.App.2d 574, 580 [159 P.2d 682] for the proposition that \u201cfindings and conclusions, made and filed, constitute the decision of the court, and the entry of judgment thereon is a ministerial act to which the signature of the judge gives no additional validity.\u201d What wife fails to appreciate, however, is that the <em>Benway </em>court was specifically speaking of \u201c[findings and conclusions made and filed pursuant to ... a statute\u201d such as \u201csection 632 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, those \u201cfindings and conclusions\u201d were those contained in the written <em>statement of decision </em>Judge Mize made and filed in April 2008, not those he made in his earlier oral ruling. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 632 [\u201cIn superior courts, upon the trial of a question of fact by the court, written findings of fact and conclusions of law shall not be required. The court shall issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal controverted issues at trial upon the request of any party appearing at the trial. ...[][] The statement of decision shall be in writing, unless the parties appearing at trial agree otherwise . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">What Judge Mize stated orally on the record in August 2007 was a <em>tentative </em>decision. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1590(a) [\u201cOn the trial of a question of fact by the court, the court must announce its tentative decision by an oral statement, entered in the minutes, or by a written statement filed with the clerk.\u201d].) A tentative decision \u201cdoes not constitute a judgment and is not binding on the court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>rule 3.1590(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Just because the statement of decision the court signed and filed is not entirely consistent with the earlier, tentative oral ruling does not mean there is a clerical error in the statement of decision subject to correction. Because the tentative decision is not binding on the court, the court remains free to change any part of its ruling up until the statement of decision itself is signed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>filed. Thus, a variation between the tentative decision and the statement of decision may reflect a conscious choice by the court, rather than a clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Here, wife asserts that it is \u201c[c]lear as a bell\u201d that Judge Mize intended to enter a statement of decision that conformed precisely to his tentative decision because \u201c[a]fter [wife]\u2019s and [husband]\u2019s attorneys had each drafted a statement of decision and a hearing was held related to such, the court chose to accept [husband]\u2019s attorney\u2019s drafted statement of decision as \u2018a more accurate reflection of the Court\u2019s findings at the trial.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">We agree that Judge Mize\u2019s statement in choosing to adopt the proposed statement of decision prepared by husband\u2019s attorney as the court\u2019s statement of decision\u2014that husband\u2019s proposal was \u201ca more accurate reflection of the Court\u2019s findings at [the] trial\u201d\u2014could be construed as supporting the proposition that Judge Mize intended to adhere to the terms of his tentative decision and did not intend to vary from it. However, the court\u2019s ruling on the matter further reflects that the court conducted its \u201cown review of [husband]\u2019s proposed [statement of decision]\u201d and as a result of that review \u201cfound three items that needed correction or clarification.\u201d None of those items had anything to do with the two supposed clerical \u201cerrors\u201d wife has raised here. Thus, wife would have us presume that while Judge Mize caught other errors in the proposed statement of decision, he overlooked the \u201cerrors\u201d wife has now identified. Wife would also have us conclude that the \u201cerrors\u201d to which she points were clerical errors when (as Judge Mize noted in his ruling) she did not file any objections to husband\u2019s proposed statement of decision and thus did not bring these supposed \u201cerrors\u201d to the court\u2019s attention when she had the opportunity to do so <em>before </em>the statement of decision was finalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Under all of these circumstances, we decline to conclude that the variances wife has identified between Judge Mize\u2019s tentative oral decision and the statement of decision he decided to sign and file after reviewing husband\u2019s proposal and catching other items that needed to be corrected or clarified were \u201cclerical errors\u201d subject to correction. Accordingly, the trial court (Judge Rom\u00e1n) did not err in denying wife\u2019s belated request to correct those \u201cerrors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">IV-VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The October 12, 2012 order is affirmed.
