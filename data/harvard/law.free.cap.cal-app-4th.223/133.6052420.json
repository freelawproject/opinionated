INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants Kumho Tire U.S.A., Inc. (Kumho), and Korea Express U.S.A., Inc. (Korea Express), on plaintiffs\u2019 unverified complaint for breach of contract and common counts. The motion was based on plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfactually devoid\u201d responses to defendants\u2019 \u201cstate all facts\u201d special interrogatories and requests for production in which plaintiffs generally stated <em>they did not know </em>whether any facts or documents supported various allegations of their complaint. <em>(Union Bank v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 580-581 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 653] [motion for summary judgment may be based on discovery responses indicating the plaintiffs have no evidence to support their claims]; Code Civ; Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">In opposing the motion, plaintiff Steve Ahn, the sole owner and principal of plaintiff New Star Transport, Inc. (New Star), adduced a declaration explaining the evidentiary basis of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Plaintiffs also adduced amended responses to their initial discovery responses along with a declaration by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explaining that the initial discovery responses were \u201ca mistake.\u201d The trial court granted the motion after disregarding substantially all of the statements of fact in Ahn\u2019s declaration on the ground they were inconsistent with plaintiffs\u2019 initial, factually devoid discovery responses. The trial court relied on <em>D\u2019Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21-23 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10] <em>(D\u2019Amico), </em>which held that a party\u2019s statements of fact adduced on a motion for summary judgment must be disregarded as insubstantial or incredible to the extent they contradict the party\u2019s prior \u201cclear and unequivocal admission[s]\u201d of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>As we explain, this was an overly broad and erroneous application of the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule. In light of all the evidence adduced on the motion, a reasonable trier of fact could have credited counsel\u2019s explanation that the discovery responses were a mistake and found the contradictory statements in Ahn\u2019s declaration credible. <em>(Mason v. Marriage &amp; Family Center </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 537, 546 [279 Cal.Rptr. 51] <em>(Mason).) </em>Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses were not \u201cclear and unequivocal admission[s]\u201d of fact which, in light of all the evidence adduced on the motion, could not be credibly contradicted or amended. (See <em>Price v. Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 465, 482 [261 Cal.Rptr. 735], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Riverisland Cold Storage, Inc. v. Fresno-Madera Production Credit Assn. </em>(2013) 55 Cal.4th 1169, 1179-1182 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 93, 291 P.3d 316].)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we explain why all of the papers on the motion show there are triable issues of fact on plaintiffs\u2019 claims. We therefore reverse the judgment in favor of defendants. We affirm a postjudgment order denying defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions against plaintiffs and their counsel for allegedly filing a complaint without evidentiary support. (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Summary judgment is appropriate when all of the papers submitted show there are no triable issues of any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].) \u201c \u2018The purpose of a summary judgment proceeding is to permit a party to show that <em>material </em>factual claims arising from the pleadings need not be tried because they are not in dispute.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Teselle v. McLoughlin </em>(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 168 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 696]; see \u00a7 437c, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">A defendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the plaintiff\u2019s causes of action have no merit. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at pp. 849-850.) A defendant meets this burden if it makes a prima facie showing that one or more elements of each cause of action cannot be established or is subject to a complete defense. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 849.) If the defendant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of material fact. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 849-850; \u00a7 437c, subd. (p)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We review the entire record de novo, considering \u201c \u2018all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blanco v. Baxter Healthcare Corp. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1046 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 566].) We disregard evidence to which a sound objection was made but consider any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>evidence to which no objection or an unsound objection was made. <em>(McCaskey v. California State Automobile Assn. </em>(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 947, 957 [118 Cal.Rptr.3d 34], citing <em>Reid v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A. <em>The Evidence Adduced on the Motion for Summary </em>Judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Ahn, a former truck driver, is the sole owner and president of New Star, a trucking services company. Kumho is the American distribution arm of Kumho Tire Company, an international tire manufacturer. Sometime during 2008, Kumho \u201coutsourced\u201d its entire logistics department to Korea Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">In 2005, Ahn began providing consulting and trucking services to Kumho without a written agreement. In December 2006, New Star and Kumho entered into a written \u201cdedicated fleet trucking services\u201d agreement whereby New Star made available to Kumho a certain number of trucks, trailers, and drivers in exchange for weekly fees. The 2006 agreement had a one-year term with automatic one-year extensions and could be terminated by either party on 30 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">In March 2008, New Star and Kumho entered into a successor \u201cdedicated fleet operations\u201d agreement requiring New Star to make available \u201cfor the exclusive use\u201d of Kumho no fewer than eight trucks, eight drivers, and 16 trailers. Under the 2008 agreement, Kumho agreed to pay New Star \u201cFixed Charge[s]\u201d of $1,196 per week for each dedicated truck, plus additional charges based on miles driven, fuel, and unloading. New Star agreed to invoice Kumho on a weekly basis for all charges due under the 2008 agreement. The 2008 agreement states its term \u201cwill be for a minimum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>three (3) years with a 90-day cancellation option for Kumho Tires or New Star after 1 year,\u201d but the \u201cafter 1 year\u201d clause is crossed out and initialed by the signatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">According to Ahn, he and Mike Newman, Kumho\u2019s transportation manager, discussed the term and termination clause before they signed the 2008 agreement and agreed that terminating the agreement on 90 days\u2019 notice after one year or at any time within the three-year term was inconsistent with the agreement\u2019s three-year term. To confirm their understanding that the 2008 agreement could not be terminated until after its three-year term expired, Ahn and Newman initialed and crossed out the \u201cafter 1 year\u201d clause. New Star performed its obligations under the 2008 agreement by providing Kumho with the dedicated trucks, trailers, and drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Chong Ha Nam was employed by Kumho from 1985 to 2008. When he left Kumho in 2008, Nam was its senior manager for logistics, responsible for overseeing the distribution and transportation of Kumho tires. Nam negotiated and signed the December 2006 agreement on behalf of Kumho and was in charge of overseeing New Star\u2019s performance of the 2008 agreement. According to Nam, sometime during 2008 Kumho \u201coutsource[d] its logistics department\u201d to Korea Express. Nam then stopped working for Kumho and became the branch manager for Korea Express in Rancho Cucamonga. According to Ahn, in January 2009, Kumho\u2019s logistics department began using the name Korea Express with \u201cthe same group of people working at the same office at [the] same location . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In April 2008, Kumho notified New Star it was reducing the number of dedicated trucks it would be using from eight to six, and in October 2008, it notified New Star it was further reducing the number of trucks from six to four. According to Nam, New Star \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the reductions because they were \u201cnecessitated by the level of business,\u201d and Ahn did not object to Nam concerning the fleet reductions. Ahn claims neither he nor New Star ever agreed to the fleet reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">New Star invoiced Kumho for all trucks dedicated to Kumho pursuant to the 2008 agreement, including the unused trucks. Kumho refused to pay the invoices for the unused trucks; required Ahn to submit separate invoices for the used and unused trucks; and paid only the invoices for the trucks it used. Ahn claims he asked Nam about the unpaid invoices \u201con numerous occasions\u201d and Nam told him Kumho would pay the invoices for the unused trucks \u201cwhen the business got better.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In a December 29, 2008, letter to Ahn at New Star, Nam advised that Kumho was outsourcing its warehouse and logistics operations to another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>company (apparently Korea Express) effective January 1, 2009, and Kumho was giving 30 days\u2019 notice of its intent to terminate <em>the December 2006 agreement. </em>The letter does not mention the 2008 agreement, but according to Nam, he met with Ahn in January 2009 to discuss the termination of \u201cthe contract\u201d and Ahn agreed \u201cthe contract\u201d would terminate on June 15, 2009. Ahn denies he met with Nam during January 2009 and also denies he agreed the 2008 agreement was or could be terminated before its three-year term expired or on 30 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">New Star continued to provide trucks to Korea Express during 2009. Finally, on August 28, 2009, Korea Express terminated the 2008 agreement on 30 days\u2019 notice effective September 30, 2009, approximately 78 weeks before its three-year term expired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ahn claims New Star is owed $746,304 for all trucks dedicated to Kumho and Korea Express pursuant to the 2008 agreement based on the $1,196 weekly rate. Of the $746,304 sum, $301,392 is due and unpaid for trucks <em>used </em>by Kumho or Korea Express through September 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In his declaration, Ahn claims Kumho approached him during 2007 about placing \u201cKumho Tires\u201d advertising signs on all trailers operated by New Star, including trailers not dedicated to or used by Kumho. Around July 2007, Mr. Chu Hwan Kim of Kumho and Ahn orally agreed that Kumho would pay New Star $1,000 per month per trailer for the advertising, and Kumho had Kumho Tires placed on all 40 of New Star\u2019s trailers. According to Ahn, $1 million is due for the Kumho Tires advertising placed on New Star trucks from July 2007 to August 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">B. <em>The Allegations of the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In May 2010, Ahn and New Star filed an unverified complaint against Kumho and Korea Express alleging five causes of action: (1) against both defendants for breach of the 2008 agreement (first); (2) against Korea Express for breach of an oral agreement to assume the 2008 written agreement (second); (3) against both defendants for breach of a 2007 oral agreement to pay New Star $1,000 per month to place Kumho Tires advertising on 40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>New Star trailers (third); and (4) against both defendants for common counts and quantum meruit (fourth and fifth).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The allegations of the complaint are fairly detailed and are entirely consistent with Ahn\u2019s declaration. The complaint explains the origins of the 2006 and 2008 agreements, their terms and termination clauses; alleges Kumho reduced the dedicated fleet from eight trucks to six in April 2008 and from six trucks to four in November 2008; alleges on information and belief that sometime after the 2008 agreement was signed Korea Express assumed all of Kumho\u2019s business operations, including its obligations under the 2008 agreement; and alleges Korea Express unilaterally terminated the 2008 agreement on 30 days\u2019 notice in August 2009, before its three-year term expired. The complaint further alleges that in 2007 Kumho approached plaintiffs about placing advertising signs on plaintiffs\u2019 trailers and agreed to pay plaintiffs $1,000 per month per trailer, due to the increased risk of theft resulting from the placement of the advertising signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The complaint seeks $765,440 in damages from both defendants for their alleged breach of the 2008 agreement (first cause of action); the same amount in damages from Korea Express for its breach of an alleged oral agreement to assume Kumho\u2019s obligations under the 2008 agreement (second cause of action); and an additional $1 million from both defendants for their breach of the alleged 2007 oral agreement to pay New Star $1,000 per month per trailer for placing advertising on all New Star trucks (third cause of action). Plaintiffs seek both amounts, or $1,765,440, from defendants in their fourth and fifth causes of action for common counts and quantum meruit. Attached as exhibits to the complaint are copies of the 2006 and 2008 agreements and photographs showing \u201cKumho Tires\u201d advertising on New Star trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">C. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 \"Factually Devoid\u201d Discovery Responses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Defendants answered the May 2010 complaint in July 2010. In October 2010, plaintiffs responded to defendants\u2019 \u201cstate all facts\u201d special interrogatories and requests for production. Most of the discovery was directed to the allegations of the complaint. For example, one interrogatory asked Ahn and New Star to state all facts supporting their allegation that \u201cthere is now owing and due from defendants the sum of at least $1,765,440.00 . . . .\u201d Each plaintiff responded: \u201cAt this time, responsive party does not know whether any facts responsive to this request exist. Discovery is continuing.\u201d Yet the complaint itself explained that plaintiffs were seeking $765,440 for trucks dedicated to defendants pursuant to the 2008 agreement but not paid for, and $1 million for Kumho\u2019s breach of the alleged 2007 oral advertising agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Plaintiffs gave similar \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cdiscovery is continuing\u201d responses to defendants\u2019 other \u201cstate all facts\u201d special interrogatories and production requests. In December 2010, plaintiffs supplemented some of their interrogatory responses and agreed to produce some additional invoices and other documents, but they did not change most of their original responses indicating they did not know whether any responsive facts or documents existed. In a December 23, 2010, e-mail to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, defendants\u2019 counsel summarized the parties\u2019 \u201cmeet and confer\u201d or discussion concerning plaintiffs\u2019 original and first amended responses. In the e-mail, defendants\u2019 counsel asserted plaintiffs would \u201cbe bound by their original responses,\u201d together with their \u201cadmissions\u201d that they did not know whether any responsive facts or documents existed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">D. <em>Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion for Sanctions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In March 2011, defendants moved for summary judgment without deposing Ahn, even though the complaint indicated he had personal knowledge of the factual bases of plaintiffs\u2019 claims as alleged in the complaint. Based on plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfactually devoid\u201d responses to defendants\u2019 \u201cstate all facts\u201d special interrogatories and requests for production, defendants argued plaintiffs admitted their causes of action \u201clacked any factual basis.\u201d (See <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th at p. 593 [motion for summary judgment may be based on discovery responses indicating the plaintiffs have no evidence to support their claims]; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Foster Wheeler LLC </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 106-107 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 229] [the plaintiffs\u2019 nonresponsive answers to comprehensive special interrogatories in effect admitted the plaintiffs had no further information].) The motion also claimed Ahn had no contractual relationship with either defendant, and Korea Express had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>agreement with Ahn or New Star; thus, Ahn was entitled to no relief against either defendant and neither Ahn nor New Star was entitled to any relief against Korea Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In support of the motion, defendants adduced the declarations of Nam and other employees of Kumho and Korea Express averring to the facts described above, including that (1) New Star never objected to Kumho\u2019s April and October 2008 fleet reductions; (2) Kumho paid New Star in full for all trucks used and other services rendered pursuant to the 2008 agreement; (3) New Star never told Kumho it had not been paid in full for its services; (4) Kumho had no oral or written agreement with Ahn, only a written agreement with New Star; (5) Korea Express had no oral or written agreement with New Star or Ahn; (6) neither Kumho nor Korea Express agreed to pay for any advertising on New Star trucks; and (7) on behalf of New Star, Ahn agreed to Kumho\u2019s termination of the 2008 agreement effective September 30, 2009. In a further declaration, defendants\u2019 counsel authenticated defendants\u2019 discovery responses and other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In opposition to the motion, plaintiffs submitted the declaration of Ahn explaining the factual bases of plaintiffs\u2019 claims consistent with the allegations of the complaint. Plaintiffs also served amended responses to defendants\u2019 \u201cstate all facts\u201d special interrogatories and requests for production, essentially repeating the allegations of the complaint and the additional detail in Ahn\u2019s declaration. In a further declaration, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained the amended discovery responses: \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 initial discovery responses contain certain responses that were inadvertently omitted and mistakenly stated. As [a] result, plaintiffs have served and submitted . . . amended responses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In reply, defendants objected to nearly every statement in Ahn\u2019s declaration on the ground it violated the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule because it was contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 initial, factually devoid discovery responses and no explanation for the discrepancies had been given. Defendants also adduced excerpts of Ahn\u2019s deposition which defendants took shortly after plaintiffs filed their opposition, and argued, based on Ahn\u2019s deposition testimony, that plaintiffs\u2019 claims still lacked evidentiary support. With their reply, defendants filed a motion for sanctions against plaintiffs and their counsel on the ground the allegations of the complaint were, \u201cby plaintiffs\u2019 own admission, completely lacking in factual support,\u201d and by signing the complaint plaintiffs\u2019 counsel falsely certified that the allegations had evidentiary support. (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (b)(3).) Plaintiffs and their counsel opposed the sanctions motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">E. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">At a combined hearing on the motions for summary judgment and sanctions, the court first asked plaintiffs\u2019 counsel why plaintiffs\u2019 initial discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>responses omitted \u201ccritical facts.\u201d Counsel explained that a \u201cnew attorney\u201d in their offices had prepared the responses \u201csay[ing] that we did not have any evidence, which supported our contentions, which was obviously untrue, because we attached exhibits to our complaint . . . .\u201d The court noted the initial discovery responses \u201cwere not the result of a lack of merit in the case necessarily . . . because there were more facts contained in the complaint that could have been alleged in response to these discovery [requests].\u201d Rather, in the court\u2019s view the initial responses were \u201ca result of ineptitude and inexcusable neglect\u201d on the part of the attorney who prepared them. The court criticized plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for failing to admit their mistake in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment, for failing to address \u201cthe <em>D\u2019Amico </em>issue\u201d in their opposition to the motion for sanctions, and for \u201cblam[ing]\u201d defendants for misreading the initial discovery responses. Still, the court said it did not believe Ahn\u2019s declaration was \u201ccontrived\u201d or \u201cuntruthful\u201d and \u201ccertainly raise[d] triable issues of fact\u201d on plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel argued it would be an injustice to plaintiffs to grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on the mistake by plaintiffs\u2019 law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The court nonetheless granted the motion for summary judgment, reasoning it was required to disregard Ahn\u2019s declaration based on contradictions between it and plaintiffs\u2019 initial and factually devoid discovery responses. The court denied defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions against plaintiffs and their counsel, noting plaintiffs\u2019 claims had evidentiary support and the court was therefore \u201cunable to [find]\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 counsel violated the certification requirement. (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (b)(3).) Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment in favor of defendants, and defendants appeal from the postjudgment order denying their motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">A. <em>Ahn\u2019s Declaration Was Erroneously Disregarded Under the </em>D\u2019Amico <em>Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Plaintiffs claim the trial court misapplied the <em>D Amico </em>rule in disregarding Ahn\u2019s declaration in ruling on the motion for summary judgment. For their part, defendants argue the trial court acted within its discretion in disregarding the declaration because it was inconsistent with plaintiffs\u2019 initial and factually devoid discovery responses, in which plaintiffs stated they did not know whether any facts or documents existed to support various allegations of their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">As defendants point out, the weight of California appellate court authority holds that a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings in summary judgment proceedings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion <em>(Miranda v. Bomel Construction </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Co., Inc. </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1326, 1335 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 538]), but the California Supreme Court has yet to determine \u201cgenerally whether a trial court\u2019s rulings on evidentiary objections based on papers alone in summary judgment proceedings are reviewed for abuse of discretion or are reviewed de novo\u201d <em>(Reid v. Google, Inc., supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 535). Here it makes no difference whether the abuse of discretion or de novo standard of review applies to the trial court\u2019s ruling excluding Ahn\u2019s declaration. As we explain, the trial court misapplied the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule and, therefore, necessarily abused its discretion in excluding the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">1. <em>The </em>D\u2019Amico <em>Rule, Properly Applied</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In <em>D\u2019Amico, </em>the California Supreme Court held, \u201c \u2018[w]here . . . there is a <em>clear and unequivocal admission </em>by the plaintiff, himself, in his deposition\u2019 \u201d and the plaintiff contradicts that admission in a subsequent declaration, \u201c \u2018we are forced to conclude there is no <em>substantial </em>evidence of the existence of a triable issue of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 21, first italics added, quoting <em>King v. Andersen </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 606, 610 [51 Cal.Rptr. 561] [assault victim\u2019s affidavit stating unnecessary force was used disregarded in light of her prior deposition testimony that no force was used].) The court explained: \u201cAs the law recognizes in other contexts (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1220-1230) admissions against interest have a very high credibility value. This is especially true when ... the admission is obtained ... in the context of an established pretrial procedure whose purpose is to elicit facts.\u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico, supra, </em>at p. 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In <em>Price v. Wells Fargo Bank, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at page 482, the court warned that, \u201can uncritical application of the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>decision can lead to anomalous results, inconsistent with the general principles of summary judgment law.\u201d The <em>Price </em>court cautioned that <em>D\u2019Amico </em>should not be interpreted \u201cas saying that admissions should be shielded from careful examination <em>in light of the entire record.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added.) This is because the record may contain evidence that <em>credibly contradicts or explains </em>what might appear to be clear and unequivocal admissions, if the admissions are viewed in isolation and without reference to the other evidence. (See <em>ibid. </em>[\u201csummary judgment should not be based on tacit admissions or fragmentary and equivocal concessions, which are contradicted by other <em>credible </em>evidence\u201d (italics added)].) In the case before it, the <em>Price </em>court concluded the trial court properly relied on the plaintiffs\u2019 admissions \u201conly\u201d because nothing in the record was \u201cmaterially\u201d inconsistent with them. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Courts have consistently refused to apply the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule to exclude evidence adduced in opposition to a summary judgment motion when either evidence adduced on the motion credibly explains or contradicts a party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>earlier admissions. (E.g., <em>Scalf, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1523 [party\u2019s deposition testimony that there were no defects in log cabin Mt credibly explained by other evidence showing the defects became apparent only after the kit was inspected]; <em>Niederer </em>v. <em>Ferreira </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1503 [234 Cal.Rptr. 779] [the plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony that note was never assigned to her credibly explained by the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental declaration stating she did not understand the question asked of her at deposition]; cf. <em>Whitmire v. Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1087 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 371] [the plaintiff\u2019s declaration stating he was exposed to asbestos while working at a plant while the defendant was working there was properly disregarded as not credible in view of the plaintiff\u2019s prior interrogatory responses unequivocally indicating that the defendant was working elsewhere at the time].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The <em>Scalf </em>court aptly summarized the proper application of the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule: \u201cWhile the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule permits a trial court to disregard declarations by <em>a party </em>which contradict his or her own discovery responses (absent a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy), it does not countenance ignoring other credible evidence that contradicts or explains that party\u2019s answers or otherwise demonstrates there are genuine issues of factual dispute.\u201d <em>(Scalf, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1524\u20141525.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">2. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The question presented here is whether plaintiffs\u2019 initial and factually devoid responses to defendants\u2019 \u201cstate all facts\u201d special interrogatories and requests for production\u2014in which plaintiffs stated they <em>did not know </em>whether any facts or documents supported various allegations of their complaint\u2014 constituted clear and unequivocal admissions of fact which plaintiffs could not credibly contradict by Ahn\u2019s declaration or other evidence adduced in opposition to the motion. In light of <em>all of the evidence </em>adduced on the motion, we conclude plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses fell well short of constituting clear and unequivocal admissions of fact which plaintiffs could not credibly contradict or amend in opposing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">To be sure, plaintiffs had a duty to answer the written discovery as completely and straightforwardly as the information available to them permitted <em>(Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Construction Co. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 76 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 360]; \u00a7\u00a7 2030.220 [obligations of responding party in answering interrogatories], 2031.220-2031.240 [compliance with inspection demands]) and they failed to do so. But evasive answers to written discovery do not constitute a legally sufficient ground for granting a motion for summary judgment, particularly when other evidence adduced on the motion shows there are triable issues of material fact. Summary judgment is proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>only if <em>all the papers </em>submitted on the motion show there are no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><em>Mason </em>is analogous and instructive. The defendants, a clinical psychologist and a marriage, family, and child counselor, moved for summary judgment on the ground the plaintiff\u2019s professional negligence claims against them were barred by the applicable three-year limitations period. <em>(Mason, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at pp. 540-541; \u00a7 340.5.) In a previous interrogatory response, the plaintiff stated her injuries began occurring in September 1977, more than three years before she filed her complaint. <em>(Mason, supra, </em>at pp. 540-541.) But in a declaration in opposition to the motion, the plaintiff explained that her previous response \u201cwas a mistake,\u201d and that September 1977 was actually the time her therapy with the defendants commenced. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 545.) The plaintiff further explained that one of the defendants initiated a sexual relationship with her in 1983, and as a result she began suffering mental and emotional distress symptoms in 1986 and 1987, within the limitations period. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The <em>Mason </em>court found the plaintiff\u2019s explanation credible and reversed summary judgment in favor of the defendants. <em>(Mason, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at p. 546.) The court reasoned that if a trier of fact believed the sexual relationship began in 1983, as the plaintiff claimed in her declaration, the trier of fact could also reasonably conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s initial interrogatory response stating that her injuries began occurring in September 1977 was \u201ca simple mistake.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>The <em>Mason </em>court accordingly refused to disregard the plaintiff\u2019s declaration explaining her prior interrogatory response under the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule, reasoning it was not \u201cfree\u201d to disregard the explanation because a trier of fact could find it credible. <em>(Mason, supra, </em>at p. 545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Similarly here, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained in an opposing declaration, and again at the hearing on defendants\u2019 motion, that plaintiffs\u2019 initial discovery responses were a \u201cmistake\u201d made by a \u201cnew\u201d and apparently unsupervised attorney employed by her law firm. In determining whether to disregard Ahn\u2019s declaration under <em>D\u2019Amico, </em>the question for the trial court was not whether the statements in the declaration were inconsistent with plaintiffs\u2019 initial discovery responses. (See <em>Scalf, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.4th at p. 1525.) Rather, the question was whether, in light of <em>all the evidence adduced on the motion, </em>a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 initial discovery responses were a mistake and that the contradictory statements in Ahn\u2019s declaration were credible. <em>(Mason, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d at pp. 545-546; accord, <em>Consumer Cause, Inc. </em>v. <em>SmileCare </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 473-474 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 627] [assessing discovery responses in light of entire record].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>As the trial court acknowledged, all of the evidence adduced on the motion showed that, contrary to their initial discovery responses, plaintiffs had credible evidence to support their claims. The parties did not dispute that New Star and Kumho entered into the 2008 agreement; that Kumho reduced the dedicated fleet of trucks from eight to six, then from six to four, during 2008; or that New Star placed Kumho Tires advertising on all 40 of its trucks. The parties submitted conflicting evidence concerning whether Ahn or New Star agreed to the 2008 fleet reductions; whether Ahn agreed to the termination of the 2008 agreement by Korea Express in August 2009; whether, in 2007, Kumho orally agreed to pay Ahn or New Star for placing advertising on New Star trucks; and whether Korea Express assumed Kumho\u2019s obligations under the 2008 agreement and the alleged 2007 oral advertising agreement. In light of the entire record, a reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 initial discovery responses were, as plaintiffs claimed, a mistake, and the statements in Ahn\u2019s declaration were credible. For this reason, the trial court misapplied the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule and abused its discretion in disregarding Ahn\u2019s declaration in ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">At times, courts have stated the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule in broad, summary terms which may be misconstrued as suggesting that prior discovery responses or purported admissions may be assessed in isolation and not in light of other evidence that credibly contradicts or explains them. (See, e.g., <em>Shin v. Ahn </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 482, 500, fn. 12 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 803, 165 P.3d 581] [flatly stating, \u201ca party cannot create an issue of fact by a declaration which contradicts his prior discovery responses\u201d]; <em>Benavidez v. San Jose Police Dept. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 853, 860 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 157], quoting <em>Preach </em>v. <em>Monter Rainbow </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1451 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 320] [\u201c[W]e are constrained by the well settled rule that \u2018[a] party cannot create an issue of fact by a declaration which contradicts his prior [discovery responses]. . . .\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Niederer v. Ferreira, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d at p. 1503, quoting <em>Leasman </em>v. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp. </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 376, 382 [121 Cal.Rptr. 768] [\u201c \u2018[W]hen a defendant can establish his defense with the plaintiff\u2019s admissions sufficient to pass the strict construction test imposed on the moving party [citations], the credibility of the admissions are valued so highly that the controverting affidavits may be disregarded as irrelevant, inadmissible or evasive.\u2019 \u201d].) Such summary statements of the <em>D\u2019Amico </em>rule must not be misconstrued as allowing summary judgment to be granted based on what may appear, in isolation, to be clear and unequivocal admissions, when the purported admissions are credibly contradicted or explained by other credible evidence in the record, and all the evidence in the record shows there are triable issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>B.-C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">V.

Plaintiffs objected to Nam\u2019s statement on hearsay grounds (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200), and the objection was properly sustained. Nam purported to introduce an out-of-court statement by S.H.
