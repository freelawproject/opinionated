Sentence to the penitentiary for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Pate was seen to come from a house. A police captain accosted him. The officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">\u201cQ. Tell the court and jury what if anything transpired there on that occasion in the presence of Mr. Pate, please sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">\u201cA. I was observing the house, which I had in the past, I had observed it before; and a F-85 green Oldsmobile was in front of the house, which it had been before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">\u201cMR. SAMPLES: I object to that, may it please the Court, and move to exclude it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained as to \u2018had been before.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-15\">\u201cQ. Just tell what was there at that time, Captain; go right ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">\u201cA. The Oldsmobile was sitting in front of the house. There was a little lady in the car. I went on down to the end of the street and parked, just observing it\u2014 which the street is a very short street. And as the car started to drive off I approached the car. He pulled across the street and attempted to turn around, and he backed up almost to the front of Mr. Elmer\u2019s house when he backed up and turned around to go back south on 19th Avenue. When I approached the car Mr. Pate jumped out and went behind a cedar tree, or ran around a cedar tree\u2014 not a very big tree, a small tree \u2014 and stooped over and throwed some articles under the tree, very light like; you know, just kind of tossed them up under the tree. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">The discarded articles were turned over to Dr. Purnell, State Department of Toxicology, who identified one of them as a vial which, on being tested, he testified as being pantopon, a derivative of opium.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">The defense adduced proof through one Robert \u201cRabbi\u201d Edwards tending to demonstrate that the yard where Pate apparently abandoned the pantopon as being literally seeded with narcotics. Such a narrative addressed itself only to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-20\">Defense counsel argues that the trial judge should have sustained a demurrer to the indictment. Basically it is argued here \u25a0that the expression, \u201c * * * did unlawfully have in their possession narcotic drugs, to-wit: Pantopon, contrary to law, to-wit: Title 22, Sections 242 and 255 of the Code of Alabama as recompiled in 1958 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and as amended in 1961, * * * \u201d<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is too vague and breaches the rule of Gayden v. State, 262 Ala. 468, 80 So.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Nowhere in \u00a7 242, T. 22, as amended, is there any prohibition against mere possession of a narcotic drug such as is contained in \u00a7 254 of that title. However, \u00a7 255, as amended in 1957, has such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Can we ignore the portion of the indictment following the specification \u201cTitle 22, Sections 242 and 255, etc.\u201d? We consider that in this indictment the references to the statutory source are matters of convenience and not of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">If for laymen ignorance of the law is no excuse, certainly courts must then take judicial notice of public laws. Thagard v. Brock, 282 Ala. 262, 210 So.2d 821. Code 1940, T. 15, \u00a7 243, obviates an indictment\u2019s stating presumptions of law or matters judicially noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Also, \u00a7 232, T. 15 dispenses with the former \u201c \u2018contrary to the form of the statute.\u2019 \u201d Whaley v. State, 17 Ala.App. 661, 88 So. 24, is not of controlling influence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Allen v. State, 33 Ala.App. 70, 30 So.2d 479, encapsulates the pertinent rule thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">\u201c * * * The misrecital of the code sections did not render the complaint void, if the facts set forth constituted an offense under any statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In this indictment, the references to citations in legal books are mere lapsus calami. The mistake therein was only of the proper place to find a law which unquestionably existed. Such a scrivener\u2019s slip should not hamstring the Statp.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">Pantopon was proved by Dr. Purnell\u2019s <em>testimony to </em>be a derivative of opium. We find no difficulty in finding that this was enough to make out a basis for the jury\u2019s inferring that this was a narcotic drug as charged in the indictment. Also, it brought the substance within the prohibition of Code 1940, T. 22, \u00a7 255(b), as found in \u00a7 5 of Act No. 397, approved September 4, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">This offense, according to the State, occurred May 17, 1967. Therefore, the definition of drugs in \u00a7 242, T. 22, as amended by Act 198, approved September 15, 1961, was controlling. \u00a7 232, as amended, defines \u201copium\u201d to include, inter alia, any derivative, etc., of opium.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">Under this view, it is not needful to determine the scope of the reference in Act 198, supra, to \u201cthe narcotics laws of the United States\u201d which appellant claims is an unconstitutional delegation of our Legislature\u2019s sovereign prerogative to the Congress or to Federal bureaucrats.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b186-18\">The final contention for error below is based on a ruling which appears during the examination in chief of defense witness Edwards :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-19\">\u201cA. Well, no, not exactly about no Pantopon being in there but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-20\">\u201cMR. BENTON: We object to anything further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-21\">\u201cQ. Do you know anything about any narcotics being in that yard ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-22\">\u201cMR. BENTON: We object to that, if the Court please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-24\">We find it unnecessary to pass on this latter ruling because the transcript shows immediately thereafter the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201cQ. Do you know what Pantopon looks like ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cQ. Have you seen it before ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cQ. Had you seen any at that house before Mr. Pate and Mr. McNurtry came there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u201cQ. Was there any in the back yard of that house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">\u201cMR. BENTON: We object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Back yard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">\u201cMR. SAMPLES: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">\u201cQ. Was there any hidden in the front yard before Mr. Pate and Mr. McNurtry came?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-16\">\u201cA. Well, we found some out there once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-17\">\u201cQ. Did you find it before this occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-18\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-19\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-20\">\u201cMR. BENTON: We object to anything further, may it please the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: Until you establish the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-22\">\u201cQ. When did you find Pantopon out there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-23\">\u201cA. Well, I don\u2019t remember. I cut that grass there once and I found some wasn\u2019t no label on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-24\">See Supreme Court Rule 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-25\">Under Code 1940, T. 15, \u00a7 389, we have read the entire record and consider the judgment below is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b187-42\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-13\">.
