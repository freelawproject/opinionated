The trial judge merged the convictions and sentenced defendant to ten years imprisonment with a parole disqualifier of three years and 120 days. The trial judge also suspended defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for one year and ordered that the period of suspension commence upon his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">On appeal, defendant claims (1) the trial judge committed plain error in his instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt, (2) the motion to suppress evidence was erroneously denied, and (3) the sentence was excessive. We find no basis to disturb defendant\u2019s conviction or sentence. However, we modify the date on which the license suspension is to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">In the early morning hours of June 9, 1990, a State Trooper stopped defendant\u2019s late model BMW for a traffic infraction. The officer\u2019s attention was attracted by a large \u201cwad\u201d of money protruding from defendant\u2019s shirt pocket. Defendant appeared nervous and gave inconsistent answers to the officer\u2019s preliminary questions. After being advised of his right to refuse to permit a search of the vehicle, defendant signed a written consent form. A large cache of cocaine, 264.1 grams, was found in the trunk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>automobile, and a subsequent search of defendant\u2019s person at the police station disclosed an additional 4.6 grams of cocaine. Defendant then executed a written waiver of his constitutional rights and gave a statement in which he claimed he had \u201cfound\u201d the cocaine in New York and planned to sell it in order to buy a tractor trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">At trial, defendant asserted that he was unaware of the cocaine in the BMW and first learned of its presence when it was found by the officer. Defendant denied that he had made a statement to the police, claiming that the trooper\u2019s account was a fabrication. The defense also presented evidence challenging the officer\u2019s testimony regarding his reason for stopping defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We first consider defendant\u2019s argument that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt. No objection was interposed at trial, and we thus consider defendant\u2019s contention within the rubric of the plain error doctrine. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The trial judge\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt tracked the model charge. Specifically, the jury was told that a reasonable doubt \u201cis an honest and reasonable uncertainty as to the guilt of the defendant existing in [the jurors\u2019] mind[s] after ... giv[ing] full and impartial consideration to all of the evidence.\u201d The judge stressed that a reasonable doubt could \u201carise from the evidence itself or from a lack of evidence.\u201d The jury was advised repeatedly that defendant was presumed innocent and that the State bore the burden of proving each element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The trial judge added that a reasonable doubt is not \u201cmerely fanciful or speculative,\u201d that it could not arise \u201cmerely from sympathy or from fear to return a verdict of guilt,\u201d and that it is not a doubt \u201cconjured up ... to escape the responsibilities of a decision.\u201d Finally, the jury was told of its \u201cduty to give the defendant the benefit of every reasonable doubt ... [in its] search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>for the truth\u201d and that a reasonable doubt is a \u201cdoubt for which a reason can be given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We do not endorse the trial judge\u2019s augmentation of the model charge. We suggest, for example, that a reasonable doubt may be one that defies the jury\u2019s ability to express or articulate the reasons for it. So too, the suggestion that a reasonable doubt \u201cis a simple search for truth may run the risk of detracting from both the seriousness of the decision and the State\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>State v. Purnell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>518, 545, 601 A.2d 175 (1992). In our view, the judge\u2019s comments beyond those contained in the model charge added nothing to the definition of reasonable doubt and were of questionable utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Having said this, we stress that portions of a charge alleged to be erroneous cannot be evaluated in isolation. <em>State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J </em>1, 135, 586 A.2d 85 (1991); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>330, 373, 558 A.2d 1259 (1989); <em>State v. Ravenell, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>171, 186-87, 203 A.2d 13 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>982, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>690, 13 L.Ed.2d 572 (1965); <em>State v. Hipplewith, </em>33 <em>N.J. </em>300, 317, 164 A.2d 481 (1960). Examining the jury charge \u201cas a whole to determine its overall effect,\u201d <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422, 307 A.2d 608 (1973), we are satisfied that the comments complained of did not dilute either the standard of reasonable doubt or the State\u2019s burden of proof. On the contrary, the State\u2019s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt permeates the trial judge\u2019s charge. <em>See State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 136, 586 A.2d 85. Our review of the instructions satisfies us that their overwhelming tenor was to convey to the jury the exacting standard and burden of proof assigned to the prosecution as well as the seriousness of the jury\u2019s task in determining whether the State had sustained its evidentiary obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Distinguishable are decisions finding error in instructions defining reasonable doubt as one for which a \u201cgood and sufficient reason\u201d can be given. <em>Compare State v. Rosenberg, </em>97 <em>N.J.L. </em>430, 433, 118 A. 207 (Sup.Ct.1922) <em>and State v. Parks, </em>96 <em>N.J.L. </em>360, 363, 115 A. 305 (Sup.Ct.1921) <em>with State v. Bailey, </em>3 <em>N.J.Misc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>210, 214, 127 A 589 (Sup.Ct.1925). Such instructions clearly tend to dilute the State\u2019s burden. The instructions given in this case did not suffer from this infirmity, but instead \u201c \u2018impress[ed] upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>-, -, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1239, 1247, 127 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>583, 596 (1994) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>307, 315, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2781, 2786, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 571 (1979)); <em>see also Cage v. Louisiana, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>39, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990). While we disapprove of the judge\u2019s comments beyond the model charge on reasonable doubt, we are convinced that the remarks were not capable of producing an unjust result. <em>See State v. Daniels, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>483, 489, 648 A.2d 266 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>443, 655 A.2d 446 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments clearly lack merit. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2). The record discloses that defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his automobile after being advised of his right to refuse. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 346 A.2d 66 (1975). Thus, the trial judge properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We also find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed. The judge\u2019s findings were supported by competent, credible evidence, and the sentence was based upon a conscientious balancing of the appropriate aggravating and mitigating factors. <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-64, 471 A.2d 370 (1984). The judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to impose a sentence appropriate to a crime of a lesser degree. See N.J.S.A 2C:44 \u2014 lf(2); <em>State v. Mirakaj, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 50, 632 A.2d 850 (App.Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">We modify the judgment of conviction only with regard to the order that the suspension of defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license commence upon his release from prison. Although the trial judge\u2019s decision to delay the suspension is consonant with common sense, the statute requires that the offender\u2019s license suspension must commence on the day sentence is imposed. N.J.S.A 2C:35-16; <em>State v. Alfana, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138, 143, 607 A.2d 1378 (Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Div.1992). <em>Cf. State in the Interest of T.B., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>382, 634 A.2d 473 (1993); <em>State in the Interest of J.R., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>630, 583 A.2d 376 (App.Div.1990). The State concedes as much in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The conviction and custodial sentence are affirmed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for modification of the judgment to reflect that suspension of defendant\u2019s license commenced on the date sentence was imposed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
