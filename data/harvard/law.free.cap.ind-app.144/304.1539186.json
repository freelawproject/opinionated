J.</author>\n<p id=\"axc-dedup-0\">This action was brought by the plaintiff-appellee, First Federal. Savings and Loan Association of Gary, Indiana, against the defendant-appellants, Mildred Houston, James Houston, Floyd Anderson and Leona Anderson, to foreclose a mortgage. The complaint alleges, in substance, that on August 24, 1960, Floyd and Leona And\u00e9rson, husband and wife, executed an installment note in the amount of $6,000, payable to the First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association \u2022 of Gary, which note- was secured by a mortgage on real estate owned by the appellants, Floyd and Leona Anderson, and located in the City of Gary. The complaint furth\u00e9r \u00e1ll\u00e9ges that on October 19, 1960, the appellants, Floyd and Leona Anderson, executed an additional promissory note in the -amount of $2,500; that on September 22, 1964, Floyd and L\u00e9ona Anderson conveyed the real estate, subject to the mortgage, to Mildred Houston, who at that time promised and agreed to assume the unpaid balance that was due and owing on said mortgage. The complaint alleges further that the parties are in arrears in their monthly payments in the amount ..of $3,036.89, as of December 31, .1964, and that by reason of being in default of such payments the appellee exercised its' option under the mortgage and declared the unpaid balanc\u00e9 of said notes and mortgage due and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">To appellee\u2019s complaint, appellants filed their answer in two paragraphs and appellee filed its reply to the second affirmative paragraph of answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">After closing the issues, appellee next filed its motion for summary judgment supported by an affidavit and also filed an additional affidavit, after which appellants filed a counter-affidavit contradicting the fact assertions contained in the affidavits and exhibits filed by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Thereafter, on December 27, 1967, the court granted the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment in favor of appellee for money damages in the amount of $14,698.45, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and ordered foreclosure of the mortgages in question. Said judgment reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cAnd it further appearing to the court that plaintiff has filed its motion for Summary Judgment herein on October 25, 1967, supported by affidavit and said motion having been duly set for hearing on November 8, 1967, that defendants filed motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, that argument was heard on both motions and the court duly continued the hearing until November 22, 1967, in order to give defendants the opportunity to file counter-affidavits, that plaintiff on November 20, 1967, filed supplementary affidavit in support of its motion for Summary Judgment with leave of court. And it further appearing that plaintiff appeared for hearing on November 22, 1967, and. that defendants had failed to file counter-affidavits, the court having heard the argument, took this matter under advisement and duly advised the parties that ruling would be made this date and hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">And the court now overrules the defendants\u2019 motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s affidavit filed with its motion for Summary Judgment, and now grants plaintiff\u2019s motion for Summary Judgment and finds that plaintiff is entitled to Judgment herein on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact in this action as appears from the pleadings filed herein and plaintiff\u2019s affidavits, and that there is due plaintiff from defendants, Fiord Anderson a/k/a Floyd Anderson and Leona M. Anderson, his wife, (jointly and severally) on the mortgage instruments sued upon, the sum of $14,698,45, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">9,361.13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASRo\">Principal 10,011.13</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7fq\">Interest 2^300:002,150.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a3m-dedup-0\">Taxes and Insurance 1,262.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsU8\">Attorney fees 1,100.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ald\">Title Report expense 25.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af3\">$14}69&amp;45 Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajk-dedup-0\">13,898.45</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Then, on January 19, 1968, the court, by <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry, modified the judgment and decree, reducing the amount of the judgment from $14,698.45 to $13,898.65. This entry reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">\u201cIt appearing to the court that there is an inconsistency in the finding on page 4 of the <em>form order </em>filed December 27, 1967, in that in the body of the finding the total amount is stated to be $14,698.45 and the total of the itemized amounts it is stated to be $13,898.45 which is the correct amount said figure of $14,698.45 is hereby modified to read $13,989.45, nunc pro tunc as of December 27, 1967.\u201d (Our emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">This <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry, as well as changing the amount of the finding also clarifies the reason for the original finding of the court showing \u201cdefendants had failed to file counter-affidavits\u201d, as the record disclosed a counter-affidavit was filed and considered by the court. There is not in the record any motion to strike appellee\u2019s affidavit, as was also set out in the <em>form order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In the record of December 27, 1967, setting out the principal, interest, et cetera, and the total amount of the award to appellee the principal of $10,011.13 was scratched out and the sum of $9,361.13 was inserted in its place; the interest of $2,300.00 was stricken out and inserted in its place were the numerals $2,150.00; and the total of $14,698,45 was stricken out and pencilled in its place were the numerals $13,898.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The same pencilled correction appears in the <em>form order </em>at two additional places.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Appellants appealed from the above adverse decision and judgment and from the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion for summary judgment and assigned as errors the court\u2019s granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment; that the court erred in entering judgment in favor of appellee and against appellants after sustaining appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>We are confronted with the question in this, as in all summary judgment cases, \u2014 was there a genuine issue as to any material fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In appellants\u2019 counter-affidavit, they contend \u201cthe motion for summary judgment should be denied for the reason that a bona fide triable issue existed in that payments made on said account are not reflected on the bookkeeping records of the appellee; that among those payments there was a payment of $650 which did not appear on appellee\u2019s record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">We must now consider appellee\u2019s affidavit in support of its motion for summary judgment which reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cAFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cLouis J. Paunicka, being first duly sworn, deposes and says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cI am the duly authorized and appointed Controller of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Gary, an Association organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, and have personal knowledge of the facts herein set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201cThis affidavit is submitted in support of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment herein, for the purpose of showing that there is in this action no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as prayed for in its complaint as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cThat as Controller, it is my job to insure the accuracy of all the accounting records of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Gary, and all debits, which include tax and insurance charges paid by the association and interest charges made by the association, and credits, which include payments by mortgagors, are applied to the account of each mortgate loan on the books of the association, under my personal direction and control, and it is my responsibility to insure that the record of each mortgage loan accurately reflects all of the debits and the credits applicable thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cThat the net total of all payments received from anyone on the account of the mortgages described in plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>complaint herein is $3009.85, after reducing the gross total by $70.00 from a check returned on February 10, 1961, and reducing the gross total by the sum of $70.00 for a check returned on November 16, 1961, up to the date of filing of the complaint in this cause of action on February 15, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201cThat two installments of $53.00 each and two installments of $75.00 each were due in the year 1960, twelve installments of $75&gt;.00 each were due in the year 1961, twelve installments of $75.00 each were due in the year 1962, twelve installments of $75.00 each were due in the year 1963, and twelve installments of $75.00 each were due in the year 1964 up and until. December 31, 1964 for the payment of principal and interest only by the terms of the mortgage instruments described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. And accordingly, the total sum of $3856.00 was due to be paid for principal and interest only on the mortgage instruments described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint up to December 31,1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\u201cThat the payments due on the mortgage instruments described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint were in default in the total sum of $846.15 on December 31,1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cThat in addition to principal and interest payments as set forth above, the mortgage instruments described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint provide for the payment of 1/12 of the annual tax and insurance charges to the secured property be paid monthly in addition to the principal' and interest payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cThat the plaintiff paid a total sum of $1766.78 up to December 31, 1964. for the payment of all taxes accruing on the real estate described in paragraph 3 of plaintiff\u2019s complaint and all insurance premiums for insurance, contracted with regard to the real estate described in paragraph 3 of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. And that this total sum has been added to the mortgage indebtedness described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">\u201cThat by reason of the default in the payment of principal and interest installments totaling $846.15 as of December 31, 1964, the plaintiff exercised its option under its notes described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint to declare the total principal balance with accrued interest and expenses immediately due and payable. That the balance due on the mortgage instruments described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint was $10,011.13 plus interest at the rate of <em>8% </em>per annum on December 31,1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>\u201cThat since December 31, 1964 the plaintiff has expended the sum of $25.00 for title continuation on the 16th day of January, 1965, and the total sum of $1262.32 for the payment of all taxes and insurance charges accruing on the real estate described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint up to March 1,1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">\u201cThat the plaintiff has received no payments whatsoever from any of the defendants in this cause of action to be applied to the account of the mortgage instruments described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint since August 6,1964.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We must also consider appellee\u2019s supplementary affidavit which reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cSUPPLEMENTAEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPOET OF MOTION FOE SUMMAEY JUDGMENT\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201c. .. That the balance of these mortgages as of December 31, 1964, is computed from the mortgage records of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Gary by. adding the balance shown on these records as of December 31, 1964, of $9,843.95 to the minus escrow balance of $167.19 making a total balance due as of December 31, 1964 of $10,011.13.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The appellants\u2019 affidavit in opposition to appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_n\">\u201cCOUNTEE-AFFIDAVIT\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u00cd\u00cd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">\u201cThat as the owner of the said premises, I have made payments and I caused to have payments made to the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Gary on Account No. 11856-7, same being the note and mortgage described in plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">\u201cThat plaintiff\u2019s mortgage [motion] for Summary Judgment should be denied for the reason that a bona-fide triable issue exists in that payments made on said account are not reflected on the bookkeeping records of the plaintiff, that among those payments there was a payment of $650.00 which did not appear on plaintiff\u2019s records and which payment was made at the special instance and request of the plaintiff in order to bring the account up-to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>date in 1963; that there were other payments made, the exact dates and amounts of which will be introduced at the trial, inasmuch as the payment books and records of the defendants are now in the possession of one L. Goodman, a certified public accountant of Chicago, and that defendant has been unable to obtain said records in said Goodman\u2019s possession, but that said records will be available at the time of the trial of this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">\u201cIn further support of this Counter-Affidavit, your af-fiant says that the delinquency as appears in the exhibits and in the supplemental affidavits do not coincide, and that the method of bookeeping used by the plaintiff does not truly reflect the condition of the account as of December 31,1964.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The record further, on December 20, 1967, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cComes now the plaintiff and in open court offers to give said defendant credit for the amount of $650.00, and to reduce plaintiff\u2019s demand in that amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cMotion for summary judgment again taken under advisement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">which was followed by the court\u2019s summary judgment without further pleadings on December 27,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Acts 1965, ch. 90, \u00a7 1, p. 126, the same being \u00a7 2-2524, Burns\u2019 1968 Replacement, are patterned after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and we shall therefore look to the Federal cases for our guidance as well as the cases handed down on this proposition in the State of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">In the case of <em>Carter v. Williams, </em>(7th Cir. 1966) 361 F. 2d 189, 193, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">\u201cWhile Rule 56 does contemplate that \u2018the allegations of fact in the pleadings may be pierced\u2019 by admissions, depositions and affidavits which show, in fact, that no genuine issues of fact exist <em>Albert Dickinson Co. v. Mellos Peanut Co., </em>7 Cir., 179 F. 2d 256, 267, unless such evidentiary matters submitted in a particular case clearly show \u2018that there was no issue of fact to be tried\u2019, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the court \u2018is not permitted to try on the affidavits submitted an issue of fact which is presented by the pleadings.\u2019 <em>Campana Corp. v. Harrison, </em>7 Cir., 135 F. 2d 334, 335-336. If, upon the proofs adduced in support of a motion for summary judgment, any doubt remains as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, such doubt must be resolved against the movant for summary judgment and the motion for summary judgment must be denied. <em>Mitchell v. Pilgrim Holiness Church Corp., </em>7 Cir. 210 F. 2d 879, cer-tiorari denied 347 U. S. 1013, 74 S. Ct. 867, 98 L. Ed. 1136</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This language was reaffirmed in the case of <em>Zahora v. Harnischfeger Corporation </em>(7th Cir. 1968), 404 F. 2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We agree with the appellants, as set forth in their brief, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cThe basic purpose of the Indiana Summary Judgment Statute is to provide a procedural device for prompt disposition of cases where there is, in reality, no genuine issue of fact to be determined in the trial, either by a court or a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">However, as stated by the United States Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, in dealing with summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cIn deciding whether there is an issue of material fact in the case <em>all doubts </em>must be resolved against the party asking for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Greenebaum Mortgage Co. v. Town &amp; Country Garden Association </em>(7th Cir., 1967) 385 F. 2d 347. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Our Supreme Court, in <em>Kapusta v. DePuy Mfg. Co., </em>(1968), 249 Ind. 679, 234 N. E. 2d 487, on denying petition to transfer said, in construing Section (e) of our Summary Judgment Act, <em>supra, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">\u201cWe construe the words \u2018if appropriate\u2019 in subsection (e) in light of subsection (c) <em>to still require a finding that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, whether or. not counter-affidavits are filed. </em>Our statute is patterned after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and we believe the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes of 1963 to the last two sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>of subdivision (e) are appropriate: . . The amendment (is not) designed to affect the ordinary standards applicable to the summary judgment motion.\u2019 \u201d (Our emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">This construction, like the Federal construction requires that there be no genuine issue as to any material fact before a summary judgment may be entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the case of <em>Pierce v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(4th Cir., 1951), 190 F. 2d 910, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cIt is only where it is perfectly clear that there are no issues in the case that a summary judgment is proper. Even in cases where the judge is of the opinion that he will have to direct a verdict for one party or the other on the issues that have been raised, he should ordinarily hear the evidence and direct the verdict rather than attempt to try the case in advance on a motion for summary judgment, which was never intended to enable parties to evade jury trial or have the judge weigh evidence in advance of its being presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Neither the complaint, the motion for summary judgment, nor the supporting affidavits thereto were amended to reflect the change and correct the $650 error which appellee confessed in open court in offering to credit that amount to appellants. This is an admission by appel-lee that their records are incomplete and incorrect and places the reliability and credibility of appellee\u2019s mortgage records in issue. We also believe that the affidavit and supplemental affidavit of appellee\u2019s Controller being in error would further place in issue his credibility as well as the issue of other amounts which may have been paid by appellants and not properly reflected in appellee\u2019s records. The trial court may not summarily pass over these issues by merely reducing appellee\u2019s demand by $650 in granting the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>We are therefore constrained to hold that there was a triable issue of fact presented to the court and that the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>should have been submitted to the court for trial on its merits, even though the court, in its wisdom, : probably was of the opinion that the same result was reached in the granting of a summary judgment that would have been reached had he tried the case on its merits. <em>Pierce v. Ford Motor Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">For these reasons, this cause is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Pursuant to Burns\u2019 Indiana Statutes Annotated, \u00a7 2-3237, the costs are taxed to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Carson, Cooper and Sullivan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 246 N.
