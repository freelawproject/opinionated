Following the injury, he received first aid on August 12, 1961; was sent to a doctor in Muncie, Indiana, several days later; was off work for three weeks for which he received compensation; and, subsequently sent to a specialist in Indianapolis, Indiana, on October 31, 1961. The Industrial Board approved a compensation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The case was first heard by a hearing member on September 21, 1965, and on January 12, 1966, the hearing member found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cThat on the 10th day of August, 1961, the plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant at an average weekly wage in excess of $65.00; that on said date he sustained personal injuries by reason of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with the defendant, of which said accidental injury the defendant had knowledge and did pay for the statutory medical attention and supplies; that the said accidental injury consisted of an irritation of the left eye;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cThat thereafter, on October 13, 1961, the Industrial Board of Indiana approved a compensation agreement entered into by said parties; that pursuant to the said compensation agreement the defendant paid plaintiff compensation at the rate of $39.00 per week for twenty-nine (29) days in the total sum of One Hundred Sixty-One Dollars and Fifty-Seven Cents ($161.57).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cIt is further found that the plaintiff\u2019s temporary total disability on account of the said accidental injury of August the 10th, 1961, terminated on September 11,1961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cIt is further found that the plaintiff\u2019s condition has now reached a permanent and quiescent state and that as a result of the said accidental injury of August 10, 1961, he has sustained no permanent partial impairment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cThat prior to the filing of plaintiff\u2019s application a good faith effort was made by said parties to adjust said claim, which effort resulted in a disagreement between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cSaid hearing member now finds for the defendant and against the plaintiff on plaintiff's Form 9 application for the adjustment of claim for compensation, filed on January 29,1965.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The plaintiff filed application for review on Form 16 which was heard by the Full Board on July 5, 1967, and an award made on July 13th.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The pertinent part of the award of the Full Board, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cThat oh the 10th day of August, 1961, the plaintiff was in the \u00e9mploy of the defendant at an average weekly- wage in excess of $65.00; that on said date he sustained personal injuries by reason of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with the defendant, of which said accidental injury the defendant had knowledge and did pay for the statutory medical attention and supplies; that the said accidental injury consisted of an irritation of the left eye;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201cThat thereafter, on October 13,1961, the Industrial Board of Indiana approved a compensation agreement entered into by said parties; that pursuant to the said compensation agreement the defendant paid plaintiff compensation at the rate of $39.00 per week for twenty-nine (29) days in the total sum of One Hundred Sixty-One Dollars and Fifty-Seven Cents ($161.57).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">\u201cIt is further found that the plaintiff\u2019s temporary total disability on account of the said accidental injury of August the 10th, 1961, terminated on September 11,1961;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201cThat plaintiff\u2019s condition has now reached a permanent and quiescent state and that as a result of the said accidental injury of August 10, 1961, he has sustained no permanent partial impairment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">\u201cThat prior to the filing of plaintiff\u2019s application, a good faith effort was made by said parties to adjust said claim, which effort resulted in a disagreement between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">\u201cThe full Industrial Board of Indiana now finds for the defendant and against the plaintiff on plaintiff\u2019s Form 9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>application for the adjustment of claim for compensation, filed on the 29th day of January, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201cAWARD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201cIT IS THEREFORE CONSIDERED, ORDERED, AND ADJUDGED by the full Industrial Board of Indiana that plaintiff, shall take nothing by his Form 9 application for the adjustment of claim for compensation, filed on the 29th day of January, 1965, and that he shall pay the costs, if any, taxed in said cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The evidence shows no conflict concerning the. time, place and circumstances that required the first aid treatment and appellant\u2019s subsequent reference to the doctor in M\u00fcncie, the company doctor and Dr. Raab, the specialist in Indianapolis!</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The sole assignment of error is that the award of the Full' Industrial Board is contrary to law in that it is not supported by the evidence. This assignment presents the entire case for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The record discloses that the pertinent evidence consisted of testimony by the claimant; the deposition of Dr. Frank M. Rabb; the deposition of Dr. Joseph J. Spaulding; and, the testimony of Dr. Donald W. Tharp. The evidence was conflicting on the question of whether or not the resulting impairment of the claimant\u2019s eyesight was caused by an accident which occurred during his employment for the ap-pellee.</p>\n<p id=\"A35F\">This being an appeal from a negative finding of the Board, the assignment of error requires us to consider only the evidence most favorable to the appellee. <em>Rauh &amp; Sons Fertilizer Co. v. Adkins, et al. </em>(1955), 126 Ind. App. 251, 129 N. E. 2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Where this court had a similar responsibility in reviewing an award of the Full Industrial Board affirming an award of the hearing member, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJOY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cThe Industrial Board as the trier of the facts had the right to believe that evidence which it finds creditable and by the same token the right to disbelieve such evidence as it does not find worthy. The board apparently did not feel that this case came within the principles heretofore announced by this court in the cases of <em>Standard Cabinet Co. v. Landgrave </em>(1921), 76 Ind. App. 593, 595, 596, 132 N. E. 661 and <em>American Maize Products v. Nichiporchik </em>(1940), 108 Ind. App. 502, 510, 511, 29 N. E. 2d 801. The evidence having been considered by the full board in a hearing <em>de novo </em>and the board having an opportunity to weigh the evidence and apply the law to the facts before it, reached a decision adverse to the claimant, we conclude that the decision of the full Industrial Board should be affirmed.\u201d <em>Hendrickson v. Contracting &amp; Material Co. </em>(1966), 138 Ind. App. 193, 212 N. E. 2d 903.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">For the reasons thus announced, we conclude that the decision of the Industrial Board should be affirmed. The costs are taxed against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Lowdermilk, P. J., Cooper and Sullivan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 245 N.
