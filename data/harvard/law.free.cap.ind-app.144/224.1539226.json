On June 28, 1968, appellees filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On the same date, appellees filed a petition for extension of time to file an answer brief from the date of the ruling on the motion to dismiss. Several intervening motions and petitions were filed in this court, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>on September 25, 1968, we denied the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. On September 27, 1968, we denied appellees\u2019 petition for extension of time to file an answer brief, the same not having been timely filed. Then, on September 27, 1968, in aid of our appellate jurisdiction, we entered an order directing appellees to file their answer brief on or before October 28, 1968. Instead of complying with that order, appellees filed on October 22, 1968, a motion to reconsider our ruling of September 25, 1968, denying their motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative to dismiss the cause <em>sua sponte. </em>Also, on October 22, 1968, appellees filed a petition for extension of time to file their answer brief after the ruling on their alternative motion to dismiss. On October 31, 1968, appellant filed its petition to advance this cause. It is the latter three pleadings with which we are now confronted.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">First, we will consider appellees\u2019 alternative motion to dismiss. That motion, including formal caption, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cAPPELLEES\u2019 PETITION IN THE ALTERNATIVE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">(1) TO RECONSIDER DENIAL, AND, INSTEAD, SUSTAIN MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION: OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">(2) TO DISMISS ACTION SUA SPONTE ON COURT\u2019S OWN MOTION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cAppellees Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc., City of Fort Wayne and its Board of Public Works petition the Court to either reconsider the September 25, 1968 denial of Ap-pellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, and upon such reconsiderations to sustain said Motion to Dismiss, or, in the alternative, on its own motion, <em>sua sponte, </em>to dismiss this statutory action over which it is now conclusively apprised it has no jurisdiction, and in support thereof alleges and says as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201c1.

In culmination of proceedings before the commission, appellee, Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc., was granted a certificate of territorial authority to render sewer service to an area contiguous to both the City of Fort Wayne and the City of New Haven, Indiana. The record reveals that the City of New Haven operates its own municipal sewer service through its Board of Public Works. The City of New Haven intervened and opposed the application of Indiana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Suburban Sewers, Inc., asserting that it (City of New Haven) was ready, willing and able to provide sewer service to the area; and, that a substantial portion of the area lies within an area in which the City of New Haven is authorized to provide sewer service under Indiana law and within the six-mile area in which municipal utilities are exempted from commission jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The commission originally, on July 14, 1967, denied the application of appellee, Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc. However, following a rehearing, the commission reversed itself and granted the application in part on September 1, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In designated Paragraph 2 of appellees\u2019 motion, they refer to the order of September 1, 1967, and to Acts of 1957, ch. 189, \u00a7 1, <em>et sea.; </em>Burns\u2019 Ind. Ann. Stat., 1968 Cum. Supp., Sections 54-443, <em>et seq. </em>Those sections of Burns\u2019 Ann.

Appeal to Appellate Court from final decision, ruling or order of commission \u2014 Transfer to Supreme Court \u2014Assignment of errors. \u2014 Any person, firm, association, corporation, city, town or public utility adversely affected by any final decision, ruling, or order of the public service commission of Indiana, may, within thirty [30] days from the date of entry of such decision, ruling, or order, appeal to the Appellate Court of Indiana for errors of law under the same terms and conditions as govern appeals in ordinary civil actions, except as otherwise herein provided, and with the right in the losing party or parties in the Appellate Court to apply to the Supreme Court for a petition to transfer the cause to said Supreme Court as in other cases. An assignment of errors that the decision, ruling or order of the commission is contrary to law shall be sufficient to present both the sufficiency of the facts found to sustain the decision, ruling or order, and the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of facts upon which it was rendered.

[Acts 1957/ch. 189, \u00a7 5, p. 395.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Under designated Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of their alternative motion, appellees appear to selectively state the record. However, it appears from a review of the record that subsequent to the commission\u2019s order of September 1, 1967, appellant filed on September 19, 1967, a \u201cPetition for Rehearing and/or Additional Hearing\u201d. After an intervening motion to strike, the commission entered an order on November 2, 1967, denying appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing. Then, on November 21, 1967, appellant filed with the commission, a \u201cRequest for Certified Transcript\u201d and a \u201cCertificate of Service\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Thereafter, on November 27, 1967, and February 16, 1968, appellant filed in this court, separate petitions for extensions of time in which to file the transcript and assignment of errors, which were granted by this court. The order granting the petition of February 16, 1968, extended the time for filing the transcript and assignment of errors until May 15, 1968. Appellant filed the transcript and assignment of errors in this court on May 14, 1968. Appellant, thereafter, filed its \u201cAppellant\u2019s Brief\u201d on May 29,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Under designated Paragraph 4 of appellees\u2019 motion, they incorporate the motion to dismiss filed on June 28, 1968. Ap-pellees contend that \u00a7 54-443, <em>supra, </em>requires that a review proceeding be filed in this court within thirty days of the date of the commission\u2019s decision. However, the time for filing in this court is extended, if a petition for rehearing is filed in the commission, to thirty days after the determination on the petition for rehearing. The commission denied appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing on November 2, 1967; appellant filed his request for record on November 21, 1967; and, appellant filed his first petition for extension of time to file the transcript and assignment of errors in this court on November 27, 1967. In our opinion, appellant has unquestionably complied with the provisions of Burns\u2019 Ann. Stat., \u00a7 \u00a7 54-443, 54-444 and 54-446, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Next, appellees contend that appellant is not \u2018adversely-affected\u2019 hy the decision of the commission and therefore, has no basis for appeal. From our review of the record, we cannot agree. However, the decision as to whether appellant has been sufficiently harmed to warrant a reversal of the commission\u2019s order, will be determined upon a hearing of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Appellees next contend that appellant has violated the jurisdictional mandates of \u00a7 54-447, <em>supra, </em>in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\"><em>\u201c'Alppellant did not serve copies of its assignment of errors </em>upon any parties as shown by the record, and only served copies upon some of the attorneys of record, but did not serve a copy <em>upon an entire law firm and its three attorneys of record, </em>as shown by the commission record filed;...\u201d (Appellees\u2019 Emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The commission record conclusively shows that Arthur H. Gemmer and Matthew E. Welsh (the latter of the firm of Bingham, Summers, Welsh and Spilman) were (are) attorneys for applicant, Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc.; James R. Arnold and Robert E. Meyers are attorneys for joint supporting petitioners, City of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the Board of Public Works, thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The record also reveals that applicant\u2019s principal place of business is located in the First Federal Building, Suite 808, 11 North Pennsylvania Street, Indianapolis, Indiana. The record shows the law office of Mr. Gemmer to be of the same address. The record shows Mr. Gemmer to be president, general counsel and major stockholder of Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc. We further, judicially know that Mr. Gemmer is listed as resident agent for applicant, with the corporations division of the Secretary of State\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The proof of service filed by appellant in relation to the filing of petitions for extensions of time and the filing of appellant\u2019s brief, reveal that appellant served copies of same upon Mr. Gemmer, Mr. Meyers and Mr. Arnold. Mr. Welsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>was not served with copies. Section 54-447, <em>supra, </em>provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>copy of any assignment of errors . . . filed in the Appellate Court shall be served by mail, on or before the date of such filing, upon all parties <em>or </em>their attorneys of record as shown by the commission record filed; . . .\u201d (Our Emphasis.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Service upon Mr. Gemmer, due to his legal relationship with Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc., constituted in fact and in law, service upon Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc. The phraseology of \u00a7 54-447, <em>supra, </em>requires only that the parties <em>or </em>their attorneys of record be served with copies; it is not necessary to serve copies upon both. Appellant served copies upon all attorneys of record for the joint supporting petitioners, City of Fort Wayne; and the Board of Public Works, thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In conclusion, we feel that appellant has complied with the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 54-447, <em>supra; </em>that ap-pellees\u2019 alternative motion to dismiss is without merit and is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">It should be stated, in response to appellees\u2019 designated Paragraph 6 of their alternative motion, that we know of no authority (nor have appellees cited any) requiring this court to state in writing, its reasons for overruling a motion to dismiss. Neither should our doing so, be construed as the product of appellees\u2019 inference that we should. We only write our reasons herein so that a final disposition might be made of the dilatory matter heretofore filed and that this cause might be directed to a speedy decision upon the merits,</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">In relation to appellees\u2019 petition for extension of time to file an answer brief, it is ordered that appellees file their answer brief with the clerk of this court within thirty days from the filing date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Appellant\u2019s petition to advance this cause is hereby granted, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 2-26, Rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Appellees\u2019 Petition in the Alternative to Reconsider or Dismiss on the Court\u2019s Own Motion is denied; Appellees\u2019 Petition for extension of time to file Answer Brief, is granted to and including thirty days from the filing date of this opinion; and, Appellant\u2019s Petition to Advance this cause, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Sullivan, J., concurs with opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">A11 italized portions of this motion is the emphasis of the appellees and not this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Concurring Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b264-7\">Sullivan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXH\">I concur in the Opinion of my associates but feel that a more appropriate construction should be placed upon Burns\u2019 Section 54-447 in order to fulfill more completely the purpose of that statute and all similar statutes and rules relative to the giving of notice of legal proceedings. Notices of legal proceedings contemplate responsive action on the part of the person served or notified. The response contemplated is normally fraught with technicalities and niceties of procedure, legal draftsmanship, and time deadlines which only an attorney at law can understand and resolve. For this reason I feel that the statute here in question and all similarly worded statutes and rules should be construed so as to require service upon at least but not more than one attorney of record for each party. It is only where a party has no attorney of record that notices, pleadings, briefs, assignments, of error and the like should be served upon the party himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">I do not feel, however, that more than one attorney of record for the same party need necessarily be served in order to fulfill notice requirements though such practice should be, in most instances, a standard courtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Service upon Mr. Gemmer in this cause was in my opinion proper and fulfilled the notice requirements of Burns' 54-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>447 not only because he was an officer and the resident agent of the appellee, Indiana Suburban Sewers, Inc., but because he was also an attorney of record for said appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 245 N. E. 2d 668.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
