Choate and Mildred Choate, by filing a complaint to cancel conditional sales contract, ejectment and restraining orders wherein the Appellants, Jerry Sehill and Mary Sehill and also Picciones, Indianapolis Fruit Company, Inc., and A. J. Cornelia, were named party defendants. The salient allegations of the complaint are (a) the appellees are the owners of certain real estate in Marion County, Indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ana and of certain personal property located on said real estate, (b) that Appellees and Defendants, Picciones, entered into a conditional sales contract on January 15, 1962, where Appellees were sellers and Picciones were buyers, the subject of which was the real estate and personal property referred to, which contract provided for the payment by the Picciones to Appellees of the sum of $200.00 per month as principal and interest and Picciones have failed to make these payments as agreed, also Picciones failed to keep the property insured as agreed and failed to pay the taxes on the property as agreed, that the delinquency on principal and interest is in excess of $1600.00, that Appellees have made demands on defendants, Picciones, to no avail, (c) Appellants have an interest in the above described property by virtue of a judgment against the Defendants, Picciones, by virtue of a purported sale of Picciones\u2019 interest in the above contract at a Sheriff\u2019s sale upon execution of their judgment and Appellants are made party defendants to present whatever claim they may have as to the property above described, (d) the Defendants, Indianapolis Fruit Co., Inc., and A. J. Cornelia, are attempting to assert an interest in this property by virtue of an action filed in the Marion Circuit Court and are made parties to present whatever claim they have, (e) request restraining order to prevent removal of any personal property, (f) contract should be cancelled, and (g) Appellees should have immediate possession of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The Defendants, Indianapolis Fruit Co., Inc., and A. J. Cornelia, have filed answer and disclaimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On March 15, 1967, the trial court granted a default judgment against the Defendants, Picciones. This judgment can-celled any right, title or interest which the Picciones as the contract purchasers had in this instant conditional sales contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The Appellees thereafter filed a verified Motion for Summary Judgment against Appellants, Jerry Schill and Mary Schill, which motion, without formal parts, states: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201cCome now the plaintiffs and move the Court for a Summary Judgment in their favor in the above-captioned cause against the defendants, Jerry Schill and Mary Schill, Indianapolis Fruit Co., Inc., and A.

That the only claim of interest that the defendants, Jerry Schill and Mary Schill are maintaining as to an interest in the property described in \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 is virtue of their purchase of the Conditional Sales Contract equity of Angelo Piccione and Pasqualina Piccione upon execution by the Sheriff of Marion County on a matter which is not related to the property described in \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 and which the plaintiffs had no knowledge at the time of said alleged purchase at Sheriffs Sale, nor did the plaintiffs in any way consent to a transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Piccione\u2019s interest to Jerry Schill or Mary Schill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201c12.

That defendants, Jerry Sehill and Mary Sehill obtained a valid court order, under proceedings supplementary in the Marion Municipal Court Room No. 2, on July 18th, 1966, directing the Sheriff of Marion County to sell the real estate in controversy herein. That such order was under proceedings supplemental, and the resulting sheriff\u2019s sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>was a sale under such theory and not under-the doctrine of execution. That the sheriff did sell, and the defendants, Jerry Schill and Mary- Schill were the highest bidders at such sale and did purchase the interest of Angelo Piccione and Pasqualina Piccione in said real estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">\u201c3.

The issue of estoppel was in no way properly suggested to the trial court. Since estoppel is an affirmative defense, the Appellees had the burden to suggest facts which would invoke that doctrine before the trial court. From a careful examination of the record we find no facts upon which estoppel could be based or even inferred. It is a well settled rule in Indiana that an estoppel must be <em>pleaded </em>to be available, whether it is relied on as a defense or as an element of a cause of action. Thus, ordinarily the defense of estoppel is not available under the general answer or under a plea of payment. Where an estoppel is relied on in avoidance of a defense it must be set up in the reply. <em>Town of St. John v. Gerlach, </em>197 Ind. 289, 150 N. E. 771 (1926), <em>Ederer v. Froberg, </em>115 Ind. App. 414, 59 N. E. 2d 595 (1945), <em>Allen Realty Co. v. Uhler, </em>83 Ind. App. 103, 146 N. E. 766 (1925), and West I.L.E., Vol. 12, <em>Estoppel, </em>\u00a7 61, p. 391. When an estoppel is relied upon it must be pleaded with particularity and precision, with every essential fact being set forth, for nothing can be supplied by inference or intendment and, indeed, if there is any ground for inference or intendment, it will be against and not in favor of estoppel. <em>Richardson v. St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Inc., </em>135 Ind. App. 1, 191 N. E. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>337 (1963). In order to constitute an equitable estoppel or estoppel <em>in pais </em>there must exist a false representation or concealment of material facts; it must have been made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of the facts; the party to whom it was made must have been without knowledge or the means of knowledge of the real facts; it must have been made with the intention that it should be acted upon; \u2022and the party to whom it was made must have relied on or acted on it to his prejudice. See <em>Richardson v. St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Mills v. Criss, </em>205 Ind. 578, 187 N. E. 375 (1933) held that the contract buyer had no interest which was subject to execution under a conditional sales contract which retained title in the Seller until full performance by the Buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In the instant contract, title was retained by Appellees as Sellers until full performance. It also provided the Buyers\u2019 interest in the contract should not be assigned, sold, or otherwise transferred by the Buyers without the written consent of the Sellers (Appellees).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">See also, <em>International Harvester Co. v. Holley, Sheriff, </em>106 Ind. App. 329, 18 N. E. 2d 484 (1939). In <em>Keck v. State ex rel. National Cash Register Co., </em>12 Ind. App. 119, 39 N. E. 899 (1895), this court held that the interest of a buyer under a conditional sale is not analogous to the interest of a mortgagor in possession and such interest is not subject to sale on execution against the buyer. In oral argument the Appellants stated that the buyers under this type of conditional sales contract had no interest which was subject to execution sale. They, however, relied upon certain negotiations between Appellants and Appellees in an attempt to raise a genuine issue as to a material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Bums\u2019 Ind. Stat. Ann., \u00a7 2-2524(c) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u201cThe judgment sought, shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Appellants contend without citing authority that certain issues of fact are reflected in the briefs filed1 with the trial court. In <em>Pomerenke v. National Life and Accident Insurance Co., </em>143 Ind. App. 472, 241 N. E. 2d 390 (1968), this court stated at page 391 of 241 N. E. 2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cAppellee contends, without citation of authority, that a motion for a summary judgment is a \u2018pleading\u2019 and that anything attached as an exhibit to the motion is a part of the pleading and is considered by the trial court, even though there is no attempt to comply with \u00a7 2-2524 (e), Burns\u2019 1968 Repl. We do not believe that the summary judgment statute uses the word \u2018pleadings\u2019 in such a broad sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In <em>United States v. Tuteur, </em>215 F. 415 (7th Cir. 1954), the court stated at page 417:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201cThere was attached to the motion as an exhibit what purports to be a transcript of testimony . . . This document is not sworn to in any way. It is not an affidavit. Respondent contends that it is not proper to consider it in support of the motion for summary judgment. We agree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AClS\">A brief is not a pleading, deposition, admission, answer to interrogatories or affidavit within the meaning of Burns\u2019 Ind. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2-2524 (c) and the court cannot look to a brief to determine the existence of a genuine issue as to a material fact. Of course, the court should consider the legal propositions set forth in briefs in considering a motion for summary judgment. In the oral argument the Appellants stated that there were no genuine issues as to a material fact apparent in the record except by reference to the Appellants\u2019 brief filed in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Even if the trial court could properly consider the statements made in the Appellants\u2019 brief filed in the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>there'is an. absence of any genuine issue as to a material fact in this.case. The statements in the brief at most disclose preliminary negotiations between the Appellees and Appellants which did not result in any binding contractual relationship. The brief referred to does not explicitly mention the doctrine of estoppel in a single instance. The brief does not set forth facts which would constitute an estoppel under the law of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"a2r-dedup-0\">In this case the granting of summary judgment was appropriate since the undisputed' facts lead solely to the conclusion which the trial court reached. This case comes within the confines of <em>Kapusta v. Depuy Manufacturing Co., </em>249 Ind. 679, 234 N. E. 2d 487 (1968), <em>Personnett v. Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., </em>142 Ind. App. 698, 237 N. E. 2d 281 (1968) and <em>Markwell v. General Tire and Rubber Co., </em>142 Ind. App. 188, 233 N. E. 2d 676 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Our consideration on the merits of this case renders moot the Appellees\u2019 Motion to dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The Appellees were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Affirmed. Costs v. Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Pfaff, C.J., Hoffman and White, J.J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 247 N. E. 2d 688.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
