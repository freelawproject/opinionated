W. Clisby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">The only facts alleged in the appellant\u2019s petition as grounds for revoking the probate are in effect that one of the numbers appearing in the document was altered, all of the numbers then erased, and the last paragraph written, on a day subsequent to the writing of the first part of the will; but all of this, it is alleged, was done by Clisby himself. A demurrer to the petition was interposed, and sustained, without leave to amend; and thereupon the judgment or order appealed from was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-21\">Upon the facts stated\u2014which are confessed by the demurrer\u2014it is claimed by the appellant: 1. That on the face of the document it appears not to have been dated; and 2. That the concluding paragraph was written on a subsequent day.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>In support of the former proposition it is urged, \u201cthat the words and figures \u2018October 1, 1902,\u2019 were not intended by the testator to express <em>the date of the instrument, </em>but merely the date <em>upon which he was the owner of the specified property.\u201d </em>But this contention is untenable. There is indeed a certain ambiguity in the instrument. For, grammatically, the date used may be regarded either as the date of the memorandum or as the date of the will. But the difference is immaterial. For, on the former construction, the memorandum being part of the will, its date would be the date of the will also. Nor do we doubt the right of the testator to adopt as the date of his will the date previously written by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Nor is the case affected by the fact alleged, that the concluding part of the will was not written on the day the will was commenced. It is a very common thing for men to commence a letter or other document on one day and to finish it on the next or some subequent day; and in such case the date, whether written at the beginning\u2014as is usually the case\u2014or at the end\u2014as is sometimes done\u2014is, according to the common and received usage of language, the proper date of the writing; and this is equally true of legal documents, though these do not take effect until completed and delivered. We do not doubt, therefore, that the ease comes within the meaning and intention of the enactments concerning holographic wills (Civ. Code, secs. 1276, 1277; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1309); which, it is provided, are to be construed according to \u201cthe approved usage of the language.\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 13; <em>Estate of Fay, ante, </em>p. 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In the argument on this point, it is assumed by the appellant\u2019s counsel that it appears from the allegations of the petition that the memorandum of property was written by the testator on the date given with \u201cno thought of making a will\u201d; and, in effect, that the intention of using it as part of a will was an afterthought. But this\u2014assuming it to be material\u2014is not alleged. All that is alleged is simply that the writing of the concluding part of the will was on a day subsequent to its commencement. Nor is there anything in the petition to indicate that the document probated as a will Was not in intention \u201cone continuous instrument.\u201d <em>(Estate of Taylor, </em>126 Cal. 98, 99.) Whether, were it otherwise, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>fact would be material is another question, which, as in the case cited, we leave undetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Respondent\u2019s counsel are also in error in supposing that \u201cit did not appear in the Skerrett case (67 Cal. 585), that the letter annexed to the deed was written at a date <em>other than the date when the deed was made.\u201d </em>The contrary appared from the records before the court. The deed was dated \u2018\u2018April 26, 1881,\u2019\u2019 and was acknowledged April 27th, aAd the letter, as appears from its recitals, was written subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We advise that the judgment appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Gray, C., and Chipman, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Angellotti, J., Shaw, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Van Dyke, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
