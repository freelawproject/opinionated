Such instruction would mislead the jury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b763-9\">Id.\u2014Instruction as to Acquittal\u2014Phase of Evidence.\u2014A requested instruction, stating in effect that a verdict of acquittal should be rendered on a certain phase of the evidence, regardless of whatever else might be developed in the case, was properly refused.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b763-10\">Id.\u2014Grand Larceny Included in Robbery\u2014Distinction\u2014Refusal of Request not Prejudicial.\u2014Robbery includes grand larceny, and, under a charge of grand larceny, the defendant could not be acquitted though the evidence shows robbery; and he could not be prejudiced by the refusal of a requested instruction distinguishing between grand larceny and robbery.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b763-11\">Id.\u2014Petit Larceny\u2014Omission of Form of Verdict.\u2014The defendant cannot complain of the omission to give the jury a form of verdict permitting them to find him guilty of petit larceny where he did not request an instruction that he might be so convicted, and where it appears that he was guilty of grand larceny from the person if he was guilty of anything. The natural presumption is, that the jury, unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of grand larceny, would perform their duty and acquit him altogether.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b764-5\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County and from an order denying -a new trial.

He complains of the refusal of the court to give one of his requested instructions, commencing as follows: \u201cIn order to convict the defendant on circumstantial evidence it is necessary,\u201d etc. This instruction assumes that a conviction, if had, must necessarily be based on circumstantial evidence. At the same time appellant concedes in his brief that there was direct evidence that defendant committed the crime charged, in the testimony of the complaining witness, Caler. Therefore, this cannot properly be called a ease of circumstantial evidence, and the court rightly refused an instruction assuming, that it was such a case. <em>(People </em>v. Lonnen, 139 Cal. 634; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>121 Cal. 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">2. That part of requested instruction No. 4, which was t\u00bb the effect that the jury might reject any theory or supposition on which the evidence might point to defendant\u2019s guilt, \u201ceven though such theory may be reasonable and much more-probable than the one which admits of his innocence,\u201d was. properly refused and stricken out. The instruction on that subject given to the jury reads as follows: \u201cIn considering-the evidence if you can reasonably account for any fact in this case upon a theory or hypothesis which will admit of the-defendant\u2019s innocence, it is your duty under the law to do so, and if you have a reasonable doubt of his guilt, you should acquit him.\u201d This was a proper instruction on the subject, and as full and favorable to defendant as he could reasonably ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>3. The court refused the request of defendant to instruct as follows: \u201cUnless there is evidence in this case to justify the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant and not some one else took and carried away the money from the person of the prosecuting witness, as alleged in the information, you cannot find the defendant guilty.\u201d This instruction was properly refused for the reason that the information charged the defendant and one Perry jointly with the crime in question, and the evidence tended to show that the larceny was the result of their joint efforts. It would mislead the jury in such a case, and it would be improper to tell them in effect that they could not find the defendant guilty unless they were satisfied that he committed the crime alone. The refused instruction might be understood as above indicated, and was therefore properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">4. Requested instruction No. 9 was properly refused because it stated in effect that a verdict of acquittal should be rendered on a certain phase of the evidence regardless of whatever else might be developed in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">5. The defendant was in no way injured by the refusal of the court to give the requested instruction distinguishing between grand larceny and robbery. The defendant was charged with larceny from the person, and was not charged with robbery. He could not be acquitted of larceny if the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the facts showed him guilty of robbery, because \u201cit is settled law that robbery involves grand larceny.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Church, </em>116 Cal. 303.) \u201cRobbery is larceny, with the element of force or intimidation added.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>72 Cal. 61.) The doctrine is well settled that a defendant cannot complain because the information and the instructions of the court confine his conviction to the lesser crime included within what the evidence might otherwise warrant the jury in finding to be a greater crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Muhlner, </em>115 Cal. 303; <em>People </em>v. Clary, 72 Cal. 61.) It would have been a vain thing for the court to define robbery and state its various elements in a ease where the information would not admit of a conviction of robbery. The court did very distinctly and plainly give to the jury the elements of grand larceny, and that was all that was necessary in a distinctly grand larceny case.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">6. The defendant complains that the court failed to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the jury a form of verdict permitting them to find him guilty of petit larceny. There is no reasonable ground upon which a defendant can be heard to complain that the action of the trial court has prevented his conviction of any particular crime either great or small. His plea of not guilty shows that he does not desire to be convicted of anything embraced in the information. It will not be presumed for a moment that the jury will do so base a thing as to convict of the higher offense because they are not permitted to convict him of the lesser; but on the contrary the natural presumption is, that unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt of the'higher offense they will perform their duty and acquit him altogether, even though they be satisfied that he is guilty of the lesser offense. \u201cThe error then, if any was committed, was favorable to defendant, and the case should not be reversed on account of it.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>135 Cal. 25.) Besides, defendant did not request an instruction that he might be convicted of petit larceny, and, further, was guilty of larceny from the person, or grand larceny, if he was guilty of anything. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>142 Cal. 434; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>141 Cal. 690.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">7. There is no merit in the contention that the evidence fails to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Cooper, C., and Smith, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">For the reasons, given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Van Dyke, J., Angellotti, J., Shaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
