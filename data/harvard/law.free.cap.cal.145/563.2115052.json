The petitioner alleges that there is no affidavit accompanying the demand upon the governor of this state, as required by law, and that the indictment is not in legal form, and was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>without any legal evidence before the grand jury, and there was no evidence before the governor of this state to show that petitioner was a fugitive from justice, and that the contrary was established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avn\">The return of 'Garret Fox showed that he is the authorized agent of the state of Ohio and that the petitioner was arrested by Chief of Police George W.

The regularity of the proceedings had in that state before extradition is not reviewable by us in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Upon the proposition as to whether or not the petitioner is a fugitive from justice within the meaning of the constitution of the United States, that question seems to be absolutely decided against petitioner\u2019s contention by the supreme court of the United States in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>116 U. S. 80, and the decision of that court upon this constitutional question is absolutely binding upon this tribunal. Whether or not the facts in the case of petitioner are such as to call for a modification of the views expressed in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Reilly </em>is a question which can only be decided by the federal courts, whose writs and processes are open to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The petitioner is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
