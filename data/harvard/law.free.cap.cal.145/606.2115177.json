Prior to this time the superior-court of that county had adopted a rule, which was then in force, fixing the compensation of its official reporter at seven dollars per day, and declaring that \u201cThe per diem herein fixed shall, upon the opening of court and before the taking of notes by the reporter, be deposited, one half thereof by the respective parties, with the clerk of the court for the use and benefit of said reporter, said amount to be thereafter taxed as costs by the party in whose favor judgment is rendered.\u201d Upon the expiration of the time named in the order, and the defendant having failed to deposit the reporter\u2019s fee as required by the order, the court, without any trial of the cause, ordered judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff, and thereupon judgment was entered in his favor for the recovery from the defendant of the possession of the property described in the complaint. From the judgment thus entered the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The judgment thus entered by the court cannot be sustained. It was not within the power of the court to render a judgment giving to the plaintiff the right to property of which the defendant was in possession, without any evidence-</p>\n<p id=\"b644-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>of such right, or affording to the defendant an opportunity to reply to whatever evidence the plaintiff might adduce. The failure or refusal of a defendant to pay the costs of an action, or any portion thereof, in advance of a trial, does not authorize the court to deprive him of his defense to the action. The guarantee of the constitution that he shall not be deprived of his property without due process of law gives him the right to be heard in its defense against any claim that may be made against him for its possession; and he is not to be deprived of this right as a penalty for failing to comply with some rule of court. (See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>120 Cal. 33;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>136 Cal. 682.) Not only has the legislature not attempted to vest the court with such authority, but in section 274 of the Code of Civil Procedure, under which the reporter\u2019s right to compensation is derived, as that section stood at the time the judgment herein was rendered (Amendments of Codes, 1880; Code Civ. Proc., page 54), the legislature has expressly declared: \u201cThe reporter\u2019s fees for taking notes in civil eases shall be paid by the party in whose favor judgment is rendered and shall be taxed up by the clerk of the court as costs against the party against whom judgment is rendered.\u201d The amendment of this section in 1885 (Stats. 1885, p. 218), requiring each party to pay the reporter\u2019s per diem before judgment or verdict is entered, was held unconstitutional. (See <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Truman, </em>127 Cal. 155.) If upon the refusal of the defendant to comply with the order of the court, the plaintiff had desired a trial of the cause, he could have deposited with the clerk the whole of the reporter\u2019s per diem, and, if he had obtained judgment, included the amount in his cost-bill, but he was not authorized to take judgment in his favor without a trial of the issues. In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>116 Cal. 495, it was held that if the plaintiff, after demanding a jury, did not comply with a rule of the court requiring a deposit of the jury fee, the court did not err in refusing his demand and trying the case without a jury; but there is nothing in the opinion therein which justifies the action of the court in rendering a judgment without any trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\">The court also erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the complaint. The complaint alleges that at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the commencement of the action the plaintiff was the owner of and <em>in possession </em>of the entire tract of land therein described; and it also alleged that for about one year prior thereto the defendant \u201chad been and now is\u201d unlawfully <em>in the possession, </em>without any right or title, of a portion of the above-described premises, and unlawfully withholds the same from the plaintiff\u2014describing the portion so withheld. The defendant demurred to the complaint for ambiguity, pointing out in its demurrer these averments as the particulars in which it was ambiguous, and its demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Gray, C., and Cooper, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Van Dyke, J., Shaw, J., Angellotti, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-4\"> 65 Am.
