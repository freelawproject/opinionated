The appeal is by the people from an order granting the defendant a new trial. The grounds of the ruling were:\u2014 \u201cThat there was a misconduct on the part of the district attorney in asking the defendant when a witness in his own behalf upon cross-examination of said defendant the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201cQ. \u2018During last November, were you offering for sale across the track a roll of silk?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201cAnd thereafter arguing to the jury that the defendant was a <em>fence-keeper, </em>and that such misconduct was prejudicial to the substantial rights of the defendant, and by reason of such misconduct a fair and impartial trial was not had.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASX\">Objection was made to the question on various grounds; and upon the statement of the district attorney that he had no evidence that the property referred to was stolen\u2014unless it could be drawn out of the witness\u2014the question was ruled out. In the passages in the argument of the district attorney referred to in the order, the defendant was alluded to as a \u201cfence-keeper,\u201d or \u201ccriminal fence-keeper\u201d; and following the use of the expressions \u201chole in the wall\u201d and \u201cfence,\u201d the jury were told that -it was believed by the people \u201cthat the evidence shows that the defendant in this ease is keeping just that sort of a joint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The case, we think, is similar in principle to that of <em>People </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>127 Cal. 66, where the judgment and order denying the defendant a new trial were reversed for language of the district attorney to the jury substantially similar to the language used here. In that case, the defendant being on trial for larceny, the district attorney told the jury, in effect, that there was another theft committed by the defendant \u201cthat [he knew] of his own knowledge.\u201d Here the jury was told by the district attorney, in effect, that he believed the evidence showed that the defendant was keeping a place for the habitual reception of stolen goods. This\u2014though the contrary is urged\u2014was something quite different from the charge on which the defendant was tried; and it may be said of it, as was said in the former case, that the statement made \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>in the nature of evidence. It was the assertion of a damaging fact not only not proven, but in regard to matters that had been expressly ruled out.\u201d We are of the opinion, therefore, that this is not a case in which the discretion of the lower court in granting a new trial should be interfered with. Also, we think, the eighth instruction asked by the defendant should have been given; and especially that part of it instructing the jury not to consider \u201cany proposed evidence which has been offered and disallowed by the court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\">We advise that the order appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Chipman, C., and Cooper, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">McFarland, J., Lorigan, J., Henshaw, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
