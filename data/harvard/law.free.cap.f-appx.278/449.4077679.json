The sole issue raised by Smith is whether the district court erred in denying her a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Smith contends that she demonstrated her acceptance of responsibility notwithstanding that she filed objections to the probation officer\u2019s drug-quantity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Deferring to the trial court\u2019s unique position, this court examines the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 705 (5th Cir.2003). This court \u201cwill affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The district court determined that Smith contested drug quantities that she knew she had received and therefore did not clearly demonstrate that she was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Because there was a foundation for the district court\u2019s determination, its finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d at 705; <em>Solis </em>299 F.3d at 458. Accordingly, Smith\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
