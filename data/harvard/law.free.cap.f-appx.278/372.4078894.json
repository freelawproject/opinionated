That judgment dismissed the action filed by Buras alleging employment discrimination; specifically, constructive discharge resulting from alleged male-on-male sexual \u201chorseplay\u201d by fellow employees and supervisors of Buras. The district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissed Buras\u2019s complaint for failure to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of employment discrimination, granting the motion because of the total absence of probative evidence: Nothing was before the court except (1) the unsworn conclusional and self-serving statement of Buras, (2) a short, hearsay statement from his brother (also unsworn), and (3) the deposition of one Otis Earlycutt, formerly an employee of the defendants and supervisor of Buras, which deposition was totally devoid of evidence supporting allegations of the Buras complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The sole basis of the appeal is the purported post-judgment \u201cerrata\u201d statement by Earlycutt, which Buras claims sheds a different light on the matter. Our careful examination of the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties refutes that contention and satisfies us that the district court correctly granted summary judgment dismissing Buras\u2019s action; moreover, that even if the errata attributed to Earlycutt had been before the district court, the result would have been the same and the summary judgment would stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
