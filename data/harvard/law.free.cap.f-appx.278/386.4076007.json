Salinas asserts that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), based on the determination that Salmas\u2019 prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine is a \u201cdrug-trafficking offense\u201d under that Guideline. Salinas contends Texas law defines a \u201cdelivery\u201d to include an \u201coffer to sell,\u201d which is conduct that is not punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. Tex. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 481.002(8), 481.112(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-25\">Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Salinas\u2019 indictment and judgment for his prior conviction, which were included in the district court record, establish he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with knowing and actual possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Because Salinas admitted to conduct which expressly constitutes a drug-trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court did not err in enhancing his sentence. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717-18 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Salmas challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
