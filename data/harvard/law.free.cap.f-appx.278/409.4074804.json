Jackson\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), for possession of firearms in connection with the offense. Jackson argues that the Government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the weapons were connected with her drug dealing activity and contends that there was no showing that she either knew of the presence of the firearms or intended to possess the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">This court reviews the decision by the district court to enhance under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for clear error. <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>77 F.3d 1480, 1498 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 770 (5th Cir.1993). A finding is clearly erroneous only if, based on its review of the record, this court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 238 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">The Government must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant. <em>Eastland, </em>989 F.2d at 770; <em>United States v. Hooten, </em>942 F.2d 878, 882 (5th Cir.1991). To satisfy this standard, \u201cthe Government must provide evidence that the weapon was found in the same location where drugs or drug paraphernalia are stored or where part of the transaction occurred.\u201d <em>Eastland, </em>989 F.2d at 770 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 430 (5th Cir.2001). This court has previously noted that \u201cneither the sentencing guidelines nor the case law requires that the Government prove a defendant had knowledge of a weapon\u2019s existence.\u201d <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 179 (5th Cir.1996). Rather, \u201cthe adjustment <em>must </em>be made when a weapon is found at the scene of a crime <em>unless </em>there is a clear improbability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>that the weapon is connected to the offense.\u201d <em>Flucas, </em>99 F.3d at 179 (citations omitted) (emphasis supplied); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The evidence presented to the district court demonstrated that the guns were found in the house over which Jackson had control and in which she engaged in drug related activities, including the offense conduct. The district court was not persuaded by the testimony at sentencing that the weapons were not connected with the offense and concluded that it was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the weapons were connected to the offense. Based on the record and the district court\u2019s credibility findings, the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
