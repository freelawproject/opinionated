In his complaint, Spencer alleged more than twenty violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131, and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a), and advanced as well several constitutional claims against individual defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. After a complex procedural history which we recount below, the state defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court granted the motion and dismissed Spencer\u2019s complaint in its entirety. Spencer appealed only the district court\u2019s decisions with respect to \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">Because the district court erred in dismissing Spencer\u2019s claims under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, we reverse and remand with instructions to reinstate those claims. As to the Title II claims, however, counsel informed the court at oral argument that Spencer agreed to their dismissal. We therefore decline to reach the question of the constitutionality of Title II\u2019s abrogation of sovereign immunity for claims against state entities not alleging constitutional violations argued in Spencer\u2019s brief. <em>See Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988) (\u201cA fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">Spencer is currently an inmate in the federal correctional system. According to his complaint, he suffers from a variety of mental and physical ailments, including a \u201cseizure disorder, neurological damage, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>farction (in the brain), involuntary movement disorder, memory deficit disorder, cognitive dysfunction, mobility disability, and a myriad of non-psychotic mental disorders.\u201d J.A. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In 2001, while incarcerated by the Virginia Department of Corrections (\u201cVDOC\u201d) at the Brunswick Correctional Center, Spencer filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia seeking damages and injunctive relief against the former Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley, the former and current Directors of VDOC, VDOC itself, the Brunswick Correctional Center Office of Health Services, and prison psychologist Eric Madsen. He contended that defendants discriminated against him because of his disabilities, in violation of Title II of the ADA, \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the United States Constitution. Spencer\u2019s twenty-four claims assert an extensive pattern of wrongful behavior. For example, Spencer alleges that he was locked in the building during a fire drill, despite defendants\u2019 knowledge of his disabilities, and threatened with disciplinary action for delaying and interfering with the drill. He also contends that he was improperly denied single-cell housing and the medical services accommodations necessitated by his disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In May 2003, the district court dismissed Spencer\u2019s complaint in its entirety. The court concluded that: (1) his Title II claims against state entities and individuals in their official capacities were barred by the Eleventh Amendment; (2) his claims for injunctive relief were moot as he had been released from VDOC custody; (3) his Title II claims against named defendants in their individual capacities were improper because there is no individual liability under the ADA; (4) his Rehabilitation Act claims lacked factual support; and (5) he failed to successfully allege a violation of the Constitution, as is required to sustain a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. On appeal, this court summarily affirmed the dismissal \u201cfor the reasons stated by the district court.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Earley, 88 </em>Fed.Appx. 599, 600 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">.Spencer then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, asking the Supreme Court to review the portion of our decision finding that the Eleventh Amendment barred his claims against the state entities under Title II of the ADA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings in light of <em>Tennessee v. Lane, </em>541 U.S. 509, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004), in which the Court held that Title II validly abrogates states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity in the context of access to judicial services. <em>See Spencer v. Earley, </em>543 U.S. 1018, 125 S.Ct. 657, 160 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004). This court, in turn, remanded the case to the district court with the same instruction. <em>See Spencer v. Earley, </em>No. 037037 (4th Cir. Jan. 20, 2005). On remand, Virginia filed a motion to dismiss, asserting its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to suit. The district court subsequently stayed all proceedings pending the outcome of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Georgia, </em>546 U.S. 151, 126 S.Ct. 877, 163 L.Ed.2d 650 (2006), which presented the question of whether Title II validly abrogates states\u2019 sovereign immunity from suit in the prison context.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Georgia </em>that Title II does abrogate such immunity in the prison context for claims that also allege constitutional violations. <em>Georgia, </em>546 U.S. at 158-59, 126 S.Ct. 877. The Supreme Court declined, however, to decide the extent to which sovereign immunity is vitiated for non-constitutional Title II claims because the lower courts had not yet determined whether the claims in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>case asserted independently viable constitutional claims or purely statutory ones. The Supreme Court instructed on remand that the lower courts must determine, \u201con a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which aspects of the State\u2019s alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct also violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress\u2019s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 126 S.Ct. 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">On the heels of the decision in <em>Georgia, </em>the state defendants filed, and the district court granted, the motion to dismiss which forms the basis of this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To frame our analysis, we set forth the district court\u2019s rationale in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The district court first found that the Supreme Court\u2019s prior order in this case, and the decisions in <em>Tennessee v. Lane </em>and <em>United States v. Georgia, </em>did not call \u201cinto question\u201d the district court\u2019s previous dismissal of (1) Spencer\u2019s claims for injunctive relief; (2) his Title II claims against named defendants in their <em>individual </em>capacities; (3) Spencer\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims; or (4) his \u00a7 1983 claims, which were previously dismissed for failure to allege a constitutional violation. <em>Spencer v. Earley, </em>No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5-6 (E.D.Va. Jan. 30, 2007). With respect to Spencer\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims, the district court elaborated further and reiterated its view that Spencer failed to present evidentiary support for his allegations. <em>See id. </em>at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">Turning to Spencer\u2019s Title II claims against the state entities and actors in their <em>official </em>capacities, the district court applied the framework mandated by the Supreme Court in <em>Georgia. </em>In doing so, it first concluded that Spencer had stated twelve valid Title II claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>then found, however, that none of the twelve claims alleged an actual constitutional violation, and Title II does not \u201cvalidly abrogate[ ] [Eleventh Amendment] state sovereign immunity in the prison context for [Title II] claims not based on unconstitutional conduct.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Earley, </em>No. 1:01-cv-01578, *16 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007). Accordingly, the court dismissed Spencer\u2019s remaining Title II claims, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We now consider the dismissal of Spencer\u2019s claims under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. We review the granting of a motion to dismiss de novo. <em>See Veney v. Wyche, </em>293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court summarily dismissed these claims on the grounds that Spencer failed to present arguments in support of them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both Appellants, Spencer and the United States, respond that \u201c[b]ecause Title II of the ADA and [\u00a7 504 of] the Rehabilitation Act provide for identical causes of action, all of ... Spencer\u2019s [twelve] claims that made out a prima facie case under [Title II of] the ADA also state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 58. For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). The Supreme Court has recently emphasized that the purpose of this rule is to provide the defendant with \u201cfair notice of what ... the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. </em>Twombly,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). Thus, while a complaint comprised solely of labels and conclusions is insufficient to satisfy this rule, specific facts, elaborate arguments, or fanciful language are not necessary. <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">More specifically, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that in the context of a motion to dismiss, a district court must construe a pro se complaint liberally. Such a complaint, \u201chowever inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Dismissal of a pro se complaint such as Spencer\u2019s for failure to state a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>claim is therefore only appropriate when, after applying this liberal construction, it appears <em>\u201cbeyond doubt </em>that the plaintiff can prove <em>no set of facts </em>in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 521, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Viewing Spencer\u2019s complaint under this standard, its dismissal was inappropriate. Spencer plainly provides the defendants with notice of his claims and the grounds therefor. It could scarcely be clearer that he is alleging overlapping disability discrimination claims under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA, and he sets forth in some detail the alleged conduct giving rise to such claims. For example, Spencer\u2019s original complaint is entitled, \u201cComplaint Under Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act/ \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\u201d J.A. 18, and he refers throughout to the defendants\u2019 violations of his rights under the \u201cRA,\u201d or Rehabilitation Act. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 21, 46. Perhaps the strongest refutation of the district court\u2019s conclusion can be found in Claim B of Spencer\u2019s complaint, in which he states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">B. (1). Spencer\u2019s March 2001 \u201cInstitutional Treatment Plan\u201d at [Brunswick Correctional Center] indicated that he needed to complete a so-called \u201cBreaking Barriers\u201d program. Due to Spencer\u2019s Disabilities, i.e., memory deficit disorder, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety [and] panic disorder, (others omitted) he is unable to attend a classroom setting, Spencer submitted a request ... for \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d under the ADA <em>and RA ([Rehabilitation Act]) </em>to borrow the programs books and study them in his cell or a private room, in April 2001. On 4-13-01 by written response to Spencer\u2019s <em>KDA/RA </em>reasonable accommodations request to participate in said program, [the Assistant Warden of Programs] <em>illegally discriminates against Spencer and illegally excludes him from said program by reason of his disabilities, by denying him access/accommodation to participate in the program.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">J.A. 21 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>\u00a7 504 of Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a), (prohibiting exclusion from programs \u201csolely by reason\u201d of one\u2019s disabilities). After setting forth evidence supporting the allegation that he was excluded from the program \u201csolely by reason\u201d of his disability, Spencer concludes Claim B by asserting that he was injured as a result of such exclusion and seeking damages and relief of any \u201ctype as may be found to be merited after trial.\u201d J.A. 21-22. Further, in the amendments to his complaint, Spencer, again, specifically alleges that defendants violated his rights \u201cunder the Rehabilitation Act,\u201d and repeatedly cites \u00a7 504. J.A. 45-47. Thus, we reject the district court\u2019s contention that Spencer made \u201cno arguments\u201d under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Spencer\u2019s complaint, with respect to the twelve claims at issue, also contained \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief [under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act] that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974. Our conclusion in this regard is reinforced by the district court\u2019s finding that those claims successfully alleged violations of Title II of the ADA. Both \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA were enacted, in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>to prohibit public entities from subjecting any person to discrimination on the basis of disability. <em>See Baird v. Rose, </em>192 F.3d 462, 469 (4th Cir.1999). Title II provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Similarly, \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, or be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">This court has repeatedly held that \u201c[t]he ADA and Rehabilitation Act generally are construed to impose the same requirements,\u201d and \u201c[b]ecause the language of the Acts is substantially the same, we apply the same analysis to both.\u201d <em>Baird, </em>192 F.3d at 468 (quoting <em>Doe v. University of Mainland Medical System Corp., </em>50 F.3d 1261, 1264 n. 9 (4th Cir. 1995)). Thus, although the two statutes have minor differences, in general, a plaintiff seeking recovery under \u201ceither statute\u201d must allege that (1) he has a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified to receive the benefits of a public service, program, or activity; and (3) he was \u201cexcluded from participation in or denied the benefits of such service, program, or activity, or otherwise discriminated against, on the basis of h[is] disability.\u201d <em>Constantine, </em>411 F.3d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">While Spencer may not mention \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in each of his successfully pleaded Title II claims, he initially states that his claims are brought under both statutes and none of the Acts\u2019 established differences are implicated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that Spencer successfully pleaded twelve claims under Title II should have foreclosed the blanket dismissal of the same twelve claims brought pursuant to \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Nonetheless, Virginia contends that the law of the case doctrine precludes our review of the district court\u2019s decision regarding Spencer\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims. It asserts that \u201c[bjecause Spencer did not seek Supreme Court review of the dismissal of the \u00a7 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act] claims, these claims are not implicated in the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision to grant certiorari, vacate, and remand [this case] to this [c]ourt.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 37. Contrary to this assertion, however, the law of the case doctrine cannot pose an insurmountable obstacle to our reaching the conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The law of the case doctrine \u201cposits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u201d <em>Arizona v. California, </em>460 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). After the district court\u2019s first dismissal of his claims, Spencer appealed them <em>all, </em>including his \u00a7 504 claims, to this court. This court, with no independent analysis, summarily affirmed \u201cfor the reasons stated by the district court.\u201d <em>See Spencer v. Earley, </em>88 Fed.Appx. at 600. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s <em>entire opinion, </em>including the decision with respect to \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and remanded the case to this court for reconsideration. <em>See Spencer v. Earley, </em>543 U.S. 1018, 125 S.Ct. 657, 160 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004). This court, in turn, vacated and remanded the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Spencer v. Earley, </em>No. 037037 (4th Cir. Jan. 20, 2005). Given this procedural history, we are hard-pressed to find any remaining, decided \u201claw of the case\u201d from this court\u2019s earlier opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Johnson v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chicago, </em>457 U.S. 52, 53-54, 102 S.Ct. 2223, 72 L.Ed.2d 668 (1982) (\u201cBecause we have vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgments in this case, the doctrine of the law of the case does not constrain either the District Court or, should an appeal subsequently be taken, the Court of Appeals.\u201d); <em>Adams v. Aiken, </em>41 F.3d 175, 179 (4th Cir.1994) (\u201cInasmuch as the Supreme Court vacated our judgment, we are not precluded from reconsidering [another issue not affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate] in the light of the Court\u2019s most recent opinion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Assuming for argument\u2019s sake, however, that the law of the case doctrine does apply here, it still does not \u201climit th[is] court\u2019s power\u201d to review the dismissal of Spencer\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims. <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 384, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003) (internal quotations omitted). It is well established that the law of the case doctrine \u201cmerely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided, [and is] not a limit to their power.\u201d <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 817, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cA court [therefore] has the power to revisit prior decisions of its own or of a coordinate court <em>in any circumstance,\u201d </em>and should readily do so where, as here, \u201cthe initial decision was clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Thus, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision as to Spencer\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims and remand with instructions to the district court to reinstate the twelve claims found to properly allege violations of Title II of the ADA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As previously noted, Spencer has abandoned his appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims under Title II of the ADA. We therefore decline to answer the constitutional questions implicated in those claims, and instead affirm that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment on abandonment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">. While the district court's ruling was pending, the United States intervened as an appellant, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403, to defend the constitutionality of Title II of the ADA, as applied in the prison context, and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\">.

Although Virginia argues vigorously on appeal that even if Spencer has stated valid claims under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act they are nevertheless barred by state sovereign immunity, its contentions in this regard are foreclosed by circuit precedent. This court has previously held that state agencies that knowingly and willingly accept clearly conditioned federal funding validly waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to claims for damages under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Constantine v. Rectors and Visitors of George Mason Univ., </em>411 F.3d 474, 495-96 (4th Cir.2005). Virginia does not dispute that it receives federal funding for its prison system and the programs therein. Thus, Spencer\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-19\">. Although it is not completely clear from the district court's opinion, we assume that the court dismissed Spencer's Rehabilitation Act claims for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">. Curiously, after concluding that \"Spencer presented no arguments\u201d under the Rehabilitation Act, the district court, in the same opinion, notes several times that Spencer \"allege[s] that defendants' conduct violated ... \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Earley, </em>No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5, 7, 12 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007) (memorandum opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b287-6\">. \"Despite the overall similarity of ... Title II of the ADA and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the language of these two statutory provisions regarding the causative link between discrimination and adverse action is significantly dissimilar.\u201d <em>Baird, </em>192 F.3d at 469. However, the failure to show causation was not the basis of the district court's dismissal of Spencer's Rehabilitation Act claims. Spencer\u2019s complaint plainly alleges both that he was discriminated against \"solely by reason\u201d of his disability, as required by the Rehabilitation Act, and that he was \"otherwise qualified\u201d for the program or protection at issue, as required by Title II. We do not hold here that every successfully pleaded claim under Title II of the ADA necessarily states a valid claim under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b288-5\">. The district court appears to have been operating under the same assumption. Rather than concluding that it was precluded by the law of the case doctrine from considering Spencer's Rehabilitation Act claims, as Virginia contends, the district court merely concluded that its previous ruling on this subject had not been \"call[edj ... into question,\u201d and then proceeded to make findings and, again, issue a ruling on the subject. <em>See Spencer v. Earley, </em>No. 1:01-cv-01578, *5-6 (E.D. Va. Jan. 30, 2007) (memorandum opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\">.
