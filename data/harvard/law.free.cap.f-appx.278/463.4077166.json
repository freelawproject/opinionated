Zubair petitions this court for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying him asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We do not have jurisdiction to review the discretionary determination of the Immigration Judge (IJ) and the BIA that Zubair\u2019s asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). The petition for review in thus dismissed as to the claims concerning asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">Additionally, Zubair, who is represented by counsel, does not challenge the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that he is not eligible for withholding of removal or relief under CAT. Thus, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-24\">Accordingly, Zubair\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>IN PART. Zubair\u2019s motion to stay removal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
