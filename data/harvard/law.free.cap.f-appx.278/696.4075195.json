The court sentenced Martin to consecutive sentences of 172 months on the first count and 120 months on the second count, for a total of 292 months in prison. Martin argues that his prison sentence is unreasonable because (1) his prior conviction for improper contact with a child resulted in an unduly harsh punishment, especially given his age; (2) the court may have believed a higher \u201ccareer offender-type\u201d sentence was warranted based upon some of his past convictions; and (3) his total sentence on both counts of conviction should have been limited by the 20-year statutory maximum because his criminal conduct was \u201cmore in the nature of one ongoing wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-21\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Martin at the bottom of his undisputed advisory Guidelines range. Nothing in the record indicates the court overlooked a relevant factor, gave significant weight to an improper factor, or committed a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (factors to consider in imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>sentence); <em>United States v. Boss, </em>493 F.3d 986, 987 (8th Cir.2007) (abuse-of-discretion standard of review); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005) (listing circumstances that may constitute abuse of discretion); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (approving appellate presumption of reasonableness for sentences within Guidelines range). Further, nothing in the record indicates the court treated Martin as a career offender. Rather, the court properly considered Martin\u2019s past convictions in determining a reasonable sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (directing court to consider history and characteristics of defendant). Finally, there is no merit to Martin\u2019s argument that the court should have treated his offenses as one crime for sentencing purposes. He pleaded guilty to two separate child-pornography counts and stipulated to possessing multiple disks containing pornographic images of children. <em>See United States v. Planck, </em>493 F.3d 501, 503-05 (5th Cir.2007) (affirming conviction on three separate counts of possessing child pornography under \u00a7 2252A(b)(5)(B) where images were found in three different places: desktop computer, laptop computer, and diskettes); <em>Swepston v. United States, </em>289 F.2d 166, 168 (8th Cir.1961) (right to impose consecutive sentences for separate counts is inherent in federal courts); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) (if sentence imposed on count carrying highest statutory maximum is less than total punishment, sentence imposed on other counts shall run consecutively to extent necessary to produce combined sentence equal to total punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-15\">.
