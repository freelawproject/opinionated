California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Gonzalez has filed a response wherein he suggests that his trial counsel was ineffective. Because Gonzalez did not raise this claim in the district court, the record is not sufficiently developed to permit consideration of this claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). Gonzalez also suggests that his appellate counsel has been ineffective for failing to raise certain sentencing arguments on appeal. Gonzalez\u2019s argument is without merit, however, because the claims are barred by the appeal waiver provision of the plea agreement. Counsel is not required to raise meritless arguments on appeal. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 527 (5th Cir.1990). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Gonzalez\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
