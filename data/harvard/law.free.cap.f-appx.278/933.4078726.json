For these convictions, Stites received consecutive sentences of 15 and 12.89 years\u2019 imprisonment. Shortly after the affirmance of his convictions, Stites filed a Fla. R.CrimP. 3.800(c) motion to reduce a legal sentence. After conducting a hearing on the motion, the trial court, by way of an amended judgment dated 2 June 2000, reduced Stites\u2019s 12.89-year sentence to 7.31 years, to run concurrently with the 15-year sentence. On 31 October 2000, Stites filed a Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.850 motion; proceedings on this motion ended when the appellate court affirmed the denial of relief and issued its mandate on 18 June 2004. Stites filed his section 2254 petition on 30 December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The district court calculated the start of the limitations period based on the date the state appellate court originally affirmed Stites\u2019s convictions. The court concluded that Stites\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion did not toll the limitations period, and dismissed the petition as time-barred. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether the district court properly dismissed Stites\u2019s petition as untimely in the light of <em>Ferreira v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>494 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.2007) , <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Jan. 30, 2008) (07-1008).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-12\">On appeal, Stites argues that his petition was timely under <em>Ferreira </em>because his modified sentence became final on 2 June 2000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a habeas petition is time-barred. <em>Moore v. Crosby, </em>321 F.3d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-13\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year limitations period on all habeas corpus petitions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (measuring this one-year period from, among other things, \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d). While a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d is pending, however, the limitations period is tolled. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">In <em>Ferreira, </em>we concluded that \u201cAED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations begins to run from the date both the conviction <em>and </em>the sentence the petitioner is serving at the time he files his application become final because judgment is based on both the conviction and the sentence.\u201d 494 F.3d at 1293 (emphasis in original) (relying on <em>Burton v. Stewart, </em>549 U.S. 147, 127 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>793, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the logic of <em>Ferreira, </em>Stites was \u201cin custody\u201d pursuant to his 2 June 2000 resentencing judgment \u2014 which was based on his 7 September 1999 conviction \u2014 when he filed his federal habeas petition. <em>See Ferreira, </em>494 F.3d at 1292 (\u201cthe judgment to which [section 2254(a) ] refers is the underlying conviction and <em>most recent sentence </em>that authorizes the petitioner\u2019s current detention\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, under <em>Ferreira, </em>the 2 June 2000 judgment that imprisoned Stites controls the start of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. When Stites filed his tolling Rule 3.850 motion, 149 days in the limitations period had gone untolled. Between the time his Rule 3.850 proceedings ended and when he filed his section 2254 petition, another 194 days of untolled time passed. So, a total of 343 days of untolled time had passed when Stites filed his section 2254 petition; and his petition was timely. The district court erred in not calculating the limitations period from the date of the resentencing judgment as mandated by <em>Ferreira. </em>Accordingly, we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-6\">. The district court previously dismissed Stites\u2019s section 2254 petition as time-barred, and Stites appealed to this Court. We vacated and remanded for determination of whether Stites's Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.800(c) motion tolled the one-year statute of limitations. His case is back on appeal after remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">. Stites did not raise his <em>Ferreira </em>argument below; and we generally do not consider issues not raised before the district court. <em>See Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1265 (11th Cir.2000). But we will address the argument here because it specifically was addressed in the COA and <em>Ferreira </em>was decided after the district court issued its order dismissing Stites\u2019s petition. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (scope of review on appeal from dismissal of a post-conviction motion is restricted to issue specified in the COA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b960-16\">. In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b961-7\">. The petitioner in <em>Ferreira </em>had been resentenced pursuant to a Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.800(a) motion .to correct a sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b961-8\">. The certificate of appealability also asked whether the district court erred in the light of <em>Delancy v. Fla. Dep't of Corr., </em>246 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2001). In <em>Delaney, </em>we determined that Delaney's Rule 3.800(a) motion challenging consecutive sentences properly was filed under section 2244(d)(2) and tolled the limitations period \u2014 even though the state court had dismissed it as being brought pursuant to the wrong statutory vehicle \u2014 because the motion, on its face, complied with state procedural and filing requirements. 246 F.3d at 1330-31. But here, at issue was not whether Stites\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion complied with state procedural and filing requirements, but whether the motion constituted an \"application for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d We have concluded that a Rule 3.800(c) motion to reduce a legal sentence is not an application for post-conviction relief or other collateral review within the meaning of section 2244(d)(2): the motion does not challenge the legality of the sentence. <em>Alexander v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>523 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2008). We, therefore, do not address Stites's appellate arguments about <em>Delaney </em>and whether the Rule 3.800(c) motion tolled the limitations period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
