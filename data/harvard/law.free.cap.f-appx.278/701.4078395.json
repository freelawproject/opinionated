Johnson appeals the 120-month prison sentence the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed after he pleaded guilty to possessing with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and distributing a cocaine-base mixture, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) and (C). Johnson\u2019s counsel has requested leave to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in determining Johnson was ineligible for safety-valve relief and in sentencing Johnson to the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-23\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Johnson safety-valve relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(2) and USSG \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Warford, </em>439 F.3d 836, 844 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). The court found that Johnson failed to show that he did not use violence or credible threats of violence in connection with the offense, because Johnson \u201cresisted arrest to the point that he had to be tasered and was told to stop and continued to resist, even after being told to stop.\u201d (S. Tr. 25). This record is sufficient to support the court\u2019s determination. Consequently, we conclude that Johnson\u2019s sentence, the statutory minimum, is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Gregg, </em>451 F.3d 930, 937 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-24\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We grant counsel leave to withdraw, subject to the condition that counsel promptly comply with the requirements of Part V of this Court\u2019s Plan to Implement the Criminal Justice Act by advising Johnson of the procedures for filing a petition for writ of certiorari pro se.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-20\">.
