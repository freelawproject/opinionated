He appeals his fifty-seven-month sentence, arguing that it is unreasonable. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. After calculating the appropriate advisory guidelines range, a district court should consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">This court reviews a sentence to determine whether it is reasonable, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This court presumes that a sentence imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir.2008); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A district court must explain the sentence it imposes sufficiently for this court to effectively review its reasonableness, but need not mechanically discuss all the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3044, 168 L.Ed.2d 759 (2007). The district court\u2019s explanation should indicate that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the arguments raised by the parties. <em>Id. </em>This court does not evaluate the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d but also considers \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-27\">On appeal, Ibarra-Zelaya does not contest the calculation of his guidelines range. Rather, he argues that the district court failed to consider the impact of the sixteen-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2006), which he claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>was unduly severe and resulted in a sentence longer than necessary to achieve the purposes of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3558(a). Specifically, he argues that this immigration guideline was enacted by the Sentencing Commission \u201cwith little deliberation and no empirical justification,\u201d and is therefore not entitled to the same deference as other guidelines. He further posits that the enhancement, by double-counting his criminal history and distorting both the severity of the offense and the potential for recidivism, undermines the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We find that Ibarra-Zelaya has not overcome the presumptive reasonableness of his sentence within the guidelines range. The heart of Ibarra-Zelaya\u2019s appeal amounts to a policy attack on the applicable guidelines enhancement provision. A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court misapplies the guidelines or \u201crejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.2006). Here, Ibarra-Zelaya argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court <em>failed to reject </em>a policy adopted by the Sentencing Commission. At sentencing, the district court, aware of its discretion to impose a sentence below the advisory guidelines range, specifically considered and rejected Ibarra-Zelaya\u2019s position as to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 based on the facts of this case. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at length and concluded that neither Ibarra-Zelaya\u2019s criminal history category nor total offense level was overstated in any way and that the advisory guideline range was properly calculated and appropriate. We therefore find that Ibarra-Zelaya has not demonstrated that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Ibarra-Zelaya\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
