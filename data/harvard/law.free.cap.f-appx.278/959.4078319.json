Brazel et al., </em>102 F.3d 1120 (11th Cir.1997), we affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences for conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and for use of a firearm during the commission of a drag trafficking crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Burgess (Burgess I), </em>190 F.3d 540 (11th Cir.1999) (unpublished), we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his life sentence pursuant to Amendment 505 to the Sentencing Guidelines. On August 15, 2007, appellant again moved the district court under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his life sentence pursuant to Amendment 505, and again the court denied his motion. He now appeals its ruling, contending that the court, in denying his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, failed to take into consideration the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-22\"><em>Booker </em>is inapplicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As for appellant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) argument, it is barred by the law of the case doctrine. Under that doctrine, \u201cthe trial court and appellate courts are bound by any findings of fact or conclusions of law made by the appellate court in a prior appeal of the case at issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Burns, </em>662 F.2d 1378, 1383-84 (11th Cir.1981) (applying the law-of-the-case doctrine to this Court\u2019s conclusion, on prior appeal, that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendants\u2019 guilty verdict). The doctrine precludes courts from revisiting issues that were decided both explicitly and by necessary implication in a prior appeal. <em>See Luckey v. Miller, </em>929 F.2d 618, 621 (11th Cir.1991) (civil context). Implicit in <em>Burgess I </em>panel\u2019s disposition is the holding that the district court properly took the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account in denying appellant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-19\">. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the conspiracy count and a consecutive five-year prison sentence on the firearm count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b985-25\">. <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions, and cannot serve as the basis for reducing a prisoner's sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
