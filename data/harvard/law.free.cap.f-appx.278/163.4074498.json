The District Court dismissed it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Chatman appealed, and we dismissed his appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), too. Chatman then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, but his petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-25\">Chatman recently returned to the District Court and filed a \u201cmotion for leave to file demand for jury trial.\u201d Through his motion, Chatman was apparently trying to revive the claims he presented in his \u00a7 1983 complaint, although he also provided more specific information about how a state court allegedly wronged him by denying his demand for a jury trial. The District Court denied his motion. Chat-man appeals <em>in forma pauperis. </em>In his notice of appeal, he explains that he wanted a jury trial in state court and in his District Court case, and he states that the District Court erred in previously dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-26\">We have jurisdiction over Chatman\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Isidor Paiewonsky Assocs., Inc. v. Sharp Properties, Inc., </em>998 F.2d 145, 151 (3d Cir.1993). However, we must dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) because it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). The District Court long ago dismissed Chatman\u2019s complaint, we affirmed the order of dismissal, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Chatman was not entitled to a jury trial or other relief in his closed case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
