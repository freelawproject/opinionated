We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-20\">Cole argued below that he had not received notice of the forfeiture proceedings, whereas the government asserted it had mailed notice of the proceedings to Cole and his attorney, and had received a return receipt indicating that someone in the attorney\u2019s office had signed for the notice. In reply, Cole argued, as relevant to this appeal, that the government failed to submit proof substantiating its attempts to provide him with notice of the proceedings. Without requiring evidence from the government, the district court denied Cole\u2019s motion, concluding that the government\u2019s service of notice on Cole\u2019s attorney satisfied due process. Because the government did not submit evidence below to support its assertions that it mailed notice of the forfeiture proceeding to Cole\u2019s attorney and that someone in the office signed for the mailing, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings as to the sufficiency of notice regarding the forfeiture proceedings. <em>See Dusenbery v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 161, 168-71, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002) (describing what constitutes notice \u201creasonably calculated\u201d to apprise inmate of forfeiture proceeding); <em>cf </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (person aggrieved by deprivation of property may move for return of property and court \u201cmust receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
