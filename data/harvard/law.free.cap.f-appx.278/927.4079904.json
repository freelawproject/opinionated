No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-18\">At sentencing, Defendant admitted generally his relevant conduct but took exception to two factual particulars to which he had agreed at his plea colloquy: (1) that he trafficked in methamphetamine \u2014 he claimed personal use only of this drug; and (2) that he had cocaine dealings with confidential informant Nunez. Defendant took issue with these particular facts only; he admitted facts sufficient to support his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">Once Defendant placed in issue his relevant conduct, testimony was taken from a Special Agent who had worked the conspiracy. This testimony included hearsay statements of a co-conspirator about Defendant\u2019s methamphetamine trafficking activity. The Special Agent also testified that he found information provided by the co-conspirator to be reliable and corroborated by other evidence. Because Defendant failed to take responsibility on these particulars, the district court denied Defendant an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-21\">Defendant first argues that his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were violated when the district court allowed the Special Agent to include hearsay statements made by Defendant\u2019s co-conspirator in the Agent\u2019s testimony in support of the disputed conduct. This contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1146 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Cantellano </em>rejected specifically the argument raised by Defendant that <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), should apply to make impermissible the use of out-of-court statements at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cantellano </em>we said these things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\"><em>Crawford </em>dealt with trial rights and we see no reason to extend <em>Crawford </em>to sentencing proceedings. The right to confrontation is not a sentencing right. The sentencing court did not err, under <em>Crawford, </em>when it considered hearsay evidence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-6\"><em>Id. </em>We are bound by the prior-precedent rule: \u201c[t]he law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997). We do not \u2014 nor could we \u2014 accept Defendant\u2019s invitation to revisit <em>Cantellano </em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The district court committed no error \u2014 plain or otherwise \u2014 when it admitted hearsay testimony at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Defendant next argues that even if the hearsay properly is considered, the district court was clearly erroneous when it determined that Defendant should be awarded no acceptance of responsibility adjustment. Defendant points out that the only evidence that he did not accept responsibility was the hearsay testimony of the Special Agent and that this testimony was insufficient to counter Defendant\u2019s account. We \u201cwill not set aside a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not entitled to a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment unless the facts in the record clearly establish that the defendant has accepted responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022-23 (11th Cir.2005). And the burden of establishing entitlement to an acceptance of responsibility downward reduction rests upon the defendant. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">That Defendant pled guilty is significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility. But \u201ca defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be trae has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a)); <em>Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756. The Special Agent testified he found the information provided by the co-conspirator to be reliable or corroborated by other evidence, including intercepted telephone conversations between Defendant and the co-conspirator. The district court found the Special Agent\u2019s testimony about the disputed conduct to be credible; it considered Defendant\u2019s denials to be incredible. Defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledged expressly that the government would be able to prove the disputed conduct during his Rule 11 plea colloquy. On this record, we can not say the district court clearly erred when it determined that Defendant had not shown his entitlement to an acceptance of responsibility adjustment. <em>See Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1022-23; <em>see also Williams, </em>408 F.3d at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\"> Defendant cites us to <em>Proffitt v. Wainwright, </em>685 F.2d 1227 (11th Cir.1982), in support of his argument that <em>Crawford's </em>Confrontation Clause holding should apply in sentencing proceedings. <em>Proffitt </em>recognized a right to cross-examination in the context of capital sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1254-55. To the extent Defendant argues that <em>Proffitt </em>is a precedent prior to <em>Cantellano </em>and vitiates the validity of the latter case, we disagree. <em>Proffitt </em>is a capital sentencing case; it intended to set out \u2014 and can set out \u2014 no binding precedent for non-capital sentencing proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
