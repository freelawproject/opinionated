Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">Conchas first challenges the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of cocaine attributable to him, specifically challenging the estimate by co-defendant Jose DeJesus Rodriguez that he supplied Conchas with 20 kilograms of cocaine. Conchas also contends that the district court\u2019s reliance on Rodriguez\u2019s estimate violates the Sixth Amendment rule of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was not based on facts admitted by Conchas or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\"><em>Booker </em>eliminated any Sixth Amendment error caused by judicial factfinding with respect to sentencing determinations by rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory rather than mandatory. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, district courts continue to find all facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. Conchas\u2019s constitutional challenge is without merit. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 797-98 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1199, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">To the extent that Conchas contends that the evidence was not sufficiently reliable to support the drug quantity calculation, given the general reliability of the presentence report and the lack of any rebuttal evidence, we find no clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). Even if there were error, it was harmless, given the district court\u2019s statement that it would have imposed the same sentence of 262 months in prison had it sustained the objection to drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>We also reject Conchas\u2019s challenge to the imposition of a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. There was sufficient unrebutted evidence in the PSR to show that Conchas had a significant role in the operation and directed and coordinated the activities of others. Accordingly, the district court did not commit clear error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">For the reasons discussed with respect to drug quantity, Conchas\u2019s constitutional challenge to the leadership enhancement is without merit. Given our conclusion regarding the \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement, Conchas\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
