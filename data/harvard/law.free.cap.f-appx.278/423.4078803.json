The court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decisi\u00f3n, a decision that Nugent appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Nugent applied for disability insurance and supplemental income benefits in September 2002, alleging a disability onset date of October 1, 2000, due to lower back pain. After the Commissioner denied Nu-gent\u2019s claims initially and on reconsideration, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on December 16, 2003, pursuant to Nugent\u2019s request. Nugent appeared at the hearing and testified with the assistance of her attorney. A vocational expert was also present throughout the hearing and testified as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">On April 8, 2004, the ALJ rendered an unfavorable decision, finding that Nugent is not disabled under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g) and is not entitled to the requested benefits. In so doing, the ALJ found that although Nugent suffers from \u201csevere\u201d lower back pain, the impairment is not severe enough to meet or medically equal, either singly or in combination, one of the impairments listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulation No. 4. In addition, after evaluating Nugent\u2019s testimony and the medical evidence, the ALJ found that her subjective complaints lack credibility and that she retains the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to \u201cperform light work that allows for a sit/stand option, requires no excessive standing or walking and requires only simple one or two step tasks.\u201d Finally, based on this RFC and on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, the ALJ found that although Nugent cannot return to the work she performed in the past, she can perform other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>After the Appeals Council denied Nu-gent\u2019s request for review on October 4, 2004, she filed her complaint with the district court seeking review of the final administrative decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A magistrate judge recommended that the decision be affirmed, and the district court adopted the recommendation on November 15, 2007. Nugent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to two inquiries: (1) whether substantial evidence supports the decision; and (2) whether the decision comports with relevant legal standards. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). If substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision, the findings are conclusive and the decision must be affirmed. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that which is relevant and sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it must be more than a scintilla, but it need not be a preponderance.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 295 (5th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). It is the role of the Commissioner, and not the courts, to resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). As a result, this court \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence, but may only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). A finding of no substantial evidence is warranted only \u201cwhere there is a conspicuous absence of credible choices or no contrary medical evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343-44 (5th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">III. Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">A claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined in the Social Security Act if she is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The Commissioner uses a sequential, five-step approach to determine whether a claimant is so disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nugent carried the burden of proof under the first four parts of the inquiry. <em>Leggett, </em>67 F.3d at 564. The burden of proof then shifted to the Commissioner at the fifth step to establish the existence of other available substantial gainful employment that Nugent could perform. <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1301-02 (5th Cir.1987). Once the Commissioner identified suitable alternative employment, the burden of proof shifted back to Nugent to prove that she could not perform the alternative work identified. <em>Id. </em>at 1302. Throughout the process, however, the ultimate burden of establishing disability remained with Nugent. <em>Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 165 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">IY. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Nugent appears to allege three points of error in the district court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>that substantial evidence supports the final administrative decision that she is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act: first, the Commissioner failed to properly evaluate the physician opinions of record; second, the Commissioner\u2019s finding that Nugent retains the RFC to perform other work existing in significant numbers in the national economy lacks substantial evidence; and third, the Commissioner failed to properly assess her credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\n<em>A. Physician Opinions of Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Nugent first argues that the Commissioner erred in giving little weight to the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Basil Younis. It is well settled that although the \u201copinions, diagnoses, and medical evidence of a treating physician who is familiar with the claimant\u2019s injuries, treatments, and responses should be accorded considerable weight in determining disability,\u201d such evidence is not conclusive; rather, the ALJ bears \u201cthe sole responsibility for determining the claimant\u2019s disability status.\u201d <em>Greenspan, </em>38 F.3d at 237 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As this court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">[W]hen good cause is shown, less weight, little weight, or even no weight may be given to the physician\u2019s testimony. The good cause exceptions we have recognized include disregarding statements that are brief and conclusory, not supported by medically acceptable clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques, or otherwise unsupported by the evidence. <em>Scott [v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 482, 485 (5th Cir.1985) ]. In sum, the ALJ \u201cis entitled to determine the credibility of medical experts as well as lay witnesses and weigh their opinions accordingly.\u201d <em>Id.) see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) (\u201cIf any of the evidence in your case record, including any medical opinion(s), is inconsistent with other evidence or is internally inconsistent, we will weigh all the other evidence and see whether we can decide whether you are disabled based on the evidence we have.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\"><em>Greenspan, </em>38 F.3d at 237; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) (stating that in weighing medical opinions, the ALJ should consider the examining relationship, the treatment relationship, supportability, consistency with the record, and specialization).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Here, the ALJ was entitled to discount Dr. Younis\u2019s conclusory October 2002 statement that Nugent cannot work because it contradicts his earlier treatment notes, the objective medical findings, and the other examining physicians\u2019 opinions. Dr. Younis observed in his December 2001 notes that Nugent was \u201cdoing well\u201d with her steroid injections, and the record reflects that he never restricted her walking, standing, sitting, lifting, or working activities. Further support that Nugent\u2019s condition was improved appears in Dr. B.J. Daneshfar\u2019s January 2002 statement that \u201cPt. [patient] states last injections provided much relief for her,\u201d and also in Dr. Kent Gray\u2019s December 2000 finding, on chiropractic examination, that the digital and motion palpation of Nugent\u2019s lumbar spine \u201cis 70% improved.\u201d Finally, when Dr. Grace Stringfellow examined Nugent at the request of the Texas Rehabilitation Commission in December 2002 \u2014 just two months after Dr. Younis\u2019s \u201cdisabled\u201d assessment in connection with Nugent\u2019s food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>stamp application \u2014 she opined that Nu-gent is capable of \u201clight to medium woi\u2019k responsibilities avoiding repetitive bending and lifting greater than 20-80 pounds.\u201d <em>See Bradley v. Bowen, </em>809 F.2d 1054, 1057 (5th Cir.1987) (concluding that an ALJ may rely on a well-supported consultative examiner\u2019s opinion over a poorly supported treating physician\u2019s opinion). Accordingly, substantial evidence indicates that the Commissioner properly evaluated the physician opinions of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\n<em>B. RFC Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Nugent\u2019s argument that the Commissioner erred in finding that she retains the RFC for a modified range of light work is similarly unavailing. First, as noted above, Dr. Stringfellow determined that Nugent is capable of \u201clight to medium work responsibilities avoiding repetitive bending and lifting greater than 20-30 pounds.\u201d Second, in his January 2003 RFC evaluation, Dr. M. Dolan determined that Nugent can occasionally lift and/or carry (including upward pulling) twenty pounds; can frequently lift and/or carry (including upward pulling) ten pounds; can stand and/or walk (with normal breaks) for a total of about six hours in an eight-hour workday; can sit (with normal breaks) for a total of about six hours in an eight-hour workday; can push and/or pull (including operation of hand and/or foot controls) to an unlimited degree other than as shown for lifting and/or carrying; has postural limitations in that she can only occasionally climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; and has no manipulative, visual, communicative, or environmental limitations. In so doing, Dr. Dolan specifically noted that he considered treating or examining source statements regarding Nu-gent\u2019s physical capacities and that none of the source conclusions about her limitations or restrictions differed significantly from his own. Accordingly, given that the ALJ was entitled to discount Dr. Younis\u2019s unsupported, inconsistent \u201cdisabled\u201d finding of October 2002, substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s RFC finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\n<em>C. Nugent\u2019s Credibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Finally, Nugent contends that the Commissioner\u2019s finding that her subjective complaints lacked credibility does not constitute substantial evidence that she is not disabled. The mere existence of pain is not an automatic ground for obtaining disability benefits. <em>See Cook v. Heckler, </em>750 F.2d 391, 395 (5th Cir.1985). Rather, \u201cpain, in and of itself, can be a disabling condition ... only when it is \u2018constant, unremitting, and wholly unresponsive to therapeutic treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrell v. Bowen, </em>862 F.2d 471, 480 (5th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 166 (5th Cir.1983)). Moreover, \u201c[t]he evaluation of a claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms is a task particularly within the province of the ALJ, who has had an opportunity to observe whether the person seems to be disabled.\u201d <em>Loya v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 211, 215 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). As such, \u201c[tjhese determinations are entitled considerable deference.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 524, 527 (5th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). \u201c[Wjhere the uncontroverted medical evidence shows a basis for the claimant\u2019s complaints,\u201d however, an ALJ\u2019s unfavorable credibility finding will not be affirmed \u201cunless the ALJ weighs the objective medical evidence and assigns articulated reasons for discrediting the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain.\u201d <em>Abshire v. Bowen, </em>848 F.2d 638, 642 (5th Cir.1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Here, as the district court explained, the ALJ not only found Nugent\u2019s statements regarding her limitations to lack credibility but also cited the objective medical evidence he considered in discrediting her subjective complaints of pain. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>he noted, \u201cwhile the claimant alleges severe disabling back pain, objective findings on physical examination and x-ray and MRI studies have been minimal,\u201d and then went on to discuss the results of those studies in detail in the next paragraph. In addition, as discussed above, the objective medical evidence from Nugent\u2019s treating and examining physicians comports with this determination. Accordingly, the Commissioner was entitled to discredit Nu-gent\u2019s testimony, and substantial evidence supports his conclusion that she is not disabled within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Finding that substantial evidence and relevant legal standards support the final administrative decision to deny Nugent\u2019s application for disability insurance and supplemental income benefits, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. The steps include: (1) whether the claimant is presently performing substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals a listed impairment; (4) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work; and (5) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from performing any other substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), 416.920(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. In her brief, Nugent asserts generally that the \"sole issue\u201d before this court is \"[w]hether ... the unfavorable decision of the Administrative Law Judge ... is supported by substantial evidence\u201d without clearly identifying the specific findings she challenges. Because she essentially attacks the district court\u2019s rulings on each of the three issues raised below, however, we address these three issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
