Tarvin, IV, Texas prisoner # 1128659, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as malicious and frivolous. Prior to filing the present action, Tarvin attempted to intervene in an almost identical action filed by a fellow inmate named Man Wade Johnson, and the district court denied his request. The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and as frivolous. It subsequently dismissed Tarvin\u2019s action as malicious because it raised the same claims as Johnson\u2019s action and as frivolous because it was barred by res judicata due to the dismissal of Johnson\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Tarvin argues that the district court\u2019s determinations that his action was barred by res judicata and was malicious were erroneous. He additionally argues the merits of his claims. He has also filed numerous motions in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Tarvin was not a party to Johnson\u2019s action, and the only relationship between Tarvin and Johnson apparent from the record was that they were inmates in the same prison. Therefore, Tarvin and Johnson were not in privity, and the district court\u2019s determination that Tarvin\u2019s action was barred by res judicata was erroneous. <em>See Meza v. General Battery Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1262, 1266-67, 1272-73 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">An action may be dismissed as malicious if it duplicates claims raised by the same plaintiff in previous or pending litigation. <em>Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir.1993). In the present case, however, Tarvin duplicated claims raised by Johnson, not claims that Tarvin had raised in a prior action. Additionally, in denying Tarvin\u2019s motion to intervene in Johnson\u2019s action, the district court explicitly stated that the denial was without prejudice to Tarvin filing his own action. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion by determining that the present action was malicious. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">Although the reasons given by the district court for the dismissal of Tarvin\u2019s action were erroneous, we may affirm on alternative grounds that are apparent from the record. <em>See Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). Johnson\u2019s action was dismissed by the district court for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and as frivolous. In <em>Johnson v. Tex. Bd. of Criminal Justice, </em>No. 07-20036, \u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2008 WL 2337324 (5th Cir.2008), we have affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling in that case. Tarvin raised the same claims as Johnson below and has made essentially the same arguments in support of the merits of his claims in this court as Johnson did in his appeal. For the reasons set forth in our opinion in that case, we affirm the judgment of the district court on the ground that Tarvin\u2019s complaint did not set forth any viable claims. <em>See id. </em>The motions Tarvin has filed in this court are without merit and are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Tarvin\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Patton v. Jefferson Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 464 (5th Cir.1998). Tarvin has previously accumulated two strikes. <em>See Tarvin v. Livingston, </em>No. H-06-2456 (S.D.Tex. Oct. 16, 2006) (unpublished); <em>Tarvin v. Bennett, </em>No. H-05-1858 (S.D. Tex. June 21, 2005) (unpublished). As Tarvin has now accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>mulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">AFFIRMED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED; ALL PENDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
