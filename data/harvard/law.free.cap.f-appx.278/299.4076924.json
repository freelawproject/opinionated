Vela-Ramirez principally argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior Texas drug convictions qualified as \u201cdrug trafficking offenses\u201d warranting an offense level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Vela-Ramirez did not make this specific argument in the district court. Accordingly, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Cusco, </em>447 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 194, 166 L.Ed.2d 158 (2006); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The record demonstrates that Vela-Ramirez twice was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance in violation of Tex. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(a). This court recently concluded that this conviction is indistinguishable from the offense of possession with intent to distribute and therefore constitutes a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a). <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Apr. 16, 2008) (No. 07-10458). This court further stated that the definitions of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 and \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1 are effectively identical for purposes of determining if a prior \u00a7 481.112(a) conviction for possession with intent to deliver justifies a sentencing enhancement based on either section. <em>Id. </em>at 717 n. 2. Thus, in light of <em>Ford, </em>Vela-Ramirez\u2019s prior convictions for possession with intent to deliver constitute \u201cdrug trafficking offenses,\u201d and the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2L1.2 was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Vela-Ramirez additionally contends that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it refused to consider the sentencing disparity between his case and those of defendants in districts that offer \u201cearly disposition\u201d programs. This court has rejected a nearly identical argument and held that \u201cthe refusal to factor in, when sentencing a defendant, the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs does not render a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 3053, 168 L.Ed.2d 766 (2007). Thus, as acknowledged by Vela-Ramirez, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">Furthermore, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Vela-Ramirez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
