The district court rejected Davie\u2019s request for a variance sentence based on the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine under the Sentencing Guidelines, relying on then-binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632-34 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio cannot be the basis of a variance), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2008). Because <em>Eura </em>was vacated by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), we grant the parties\u2019 joint motion to remand in light of that opinion. Accordingly we vacate and remand for re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-21\"> We offer no criticism of the district court which properly applied the relevant law at the time of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
