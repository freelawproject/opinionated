Though Ahmed challenges the denial of asylum, we note that the Board specifically upheld the IJ\u2019s finding that Ahmed\u2019s asylum application was untimely. Ahmed does not challenge the finding of untimeliness, and we note that regardless we are without jurisdiction to consider a such a challenge. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (West 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">With regard to withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and pursuant to the Convention Against Torture, we find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Ahmed was a member of a terrorist organization such that he is barred from that relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(iv) (West 2005); 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)(III) (West 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2) (2007). Finally, we uphold the finding that Ahmed failed to qualify for the relief of deferral of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>removal under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(4) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We accordingly dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
