The presentence report assessed 11 criminal history points for a criminal history category of V. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, Sawyer\u2019s was defined as a career offender and a criminal history category of VI was applied to his offense. As a result, Sawyer was sentenced to 51 months in prison to be followed by 3 years of supervised release. Sawyer argues that his 1998 California second degree robbery conviction is not a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and 4B1.2. Although robbery is an enumerated crime of violence under the Guidelines, Sawyer argues that robbery under CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 does not meet the generic, contemporary definition of robbery because the California statute prohibits a broader range of conduct. He argues that the statute may be violated not only by the use of force but also by threats to property. Sawyer con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>cedes that his failure to object on this point in the district court limits appellate review to the plain-error standard. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 866-67 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as any state or federal offense punishable by more than a year of imprisonment that: \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Pursuant to the commentary to the Guidelines, robbery is an enumerated crime of violence under this section. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l). If a conviction is for an enumerated offense, it is not necessary to examine whether the offense also meets the \u201cuse of force\u201d prong of the crime of violence definition. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir.2002) (discussing cases). However, a state\u2019s labeling of an offense does not determine whether the offense qualifies as an enumerated offense. <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2006). Rather, an enumerated offense is given its \u201cgeneric, contemporary meaning.\u201d Id.; <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.2005) (addressing crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2). This court then determines \u201cwhether the state conviction falls under the generic, contemporary meaning of the enumerated offense.\u201d <em>Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This court recently held that robbery under CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 meets the generic or contemporary definition of robbery in a case involving an offense level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d 813 (5th Cir.2008). This court reasoned that \u201cthe California robbery statute involves the misappropriation of property under circumstances involving danger to the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court concluded that the California robbery statute \u201cfalls within the generic or contemporary meaning of robbery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Although the case subjudice concerns application of the career offender provisions found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 rather than an offense level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the question presented by this appeal \u2014 whether robbery under CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 meets the generic or contemporary definition of robbery and is an enumerated crime of violence-is the same. All of Sawyer\u2019s arguments were addressed and rejected by the reasoning in <em>Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d at 813. Sawyer\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
