When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Chen argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by the record. Chen further argues that he was not provided with a meaningful opportunity to rebut or address the IJ\u2019s credibility concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Contrary to Chen\u2019s assertions, our review of the record establishes that the IJ\u2019s findings that Chen\u2019s testimony is incredible is substantially supported by the record. None of Chen\u2019s arguments compel this court to substitute its judgment for that of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Without credible evidence, the IJ had no grounds to grant Chen asylum or withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 79. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
