Five Star argues the Board\u2019s order should not be enforced, because the ALJ was not fair and impartial, and the ALJ\u2019s findings, as adopted by the Board, are not supported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">To begin, we find no basis for Five Star\u2019s argument the ALJ was not fair and impartial, which is essentially based upon Five Star\u2019s disagreement with the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See Hall v. NLRB, </em>941 F.2d 684, 689 (8th Cir.1991) (rejecting the employer\u2019s argument that the ALJ was biased and impartial where the only supporting evidence was the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations). We further conclude the Board correctly applied the law, and the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See NLRB v. Rockline Indus., Inc., </em>412 F.3d 962, 966, 970 (8th Cir.2005) (stating applicable standards of review). We enforce the Board\u2019s order in its entirety. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
