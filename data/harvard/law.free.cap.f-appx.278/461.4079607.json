One who wishes to proceed IFP on appeal must show that he is impecunious and that he will raise a nonfrivolous appellate issue. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Amir-Sharif argues that the district court erred by dismissing his suit as duplicative without first specifying exactly which claims were duplicative of the claims filed in an earlier suit. He also maintains that his claims, which pertain to cell and body cavity searches, have merit. Amir-Sharif has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his suit as duplicative. <em>See Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir.1988). He likewise has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous claim in his appeal. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
