The 108-month term was at the lowest end of the Guidelines range Roberts faced. On appeal, Roberts contends that the sentence was unreasonable because: (1) the district court failed to consider any of the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing sentence; (2) the court improperly applied a presumption of reasonableness to the advisory guidelines; and (3) the facts of his case supported a downward variance sentence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005), which the Supreme Court has clarified is synonymous with the abuse-of-discretion standard, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our appellate review for reasonableness consists of two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d taking into account the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). In reviewing for substantive reasonableness, we consider the sentence, in its entirety, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-11\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-12\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785-86 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Here, Roberts\u2019s sentence was procedurally sound. The record demonstrates that the district court allowed Roberts to present arguments as to a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>sonable sentence, including why he believed that a downward variance was appropriate. The court also noted that the amended PSI \u201ccontain[ed] the advisory guidelines,\u201d which was an implicit recognition of the effect of <em>Booker </em>on the once mandatory Guidelines. Moreover, the court reasoned that \u201ca sentence at the low end of the sentencing guideline range ... [was] the most reasonable sentence\u201d in light of \u201call the factors contained in the statute [\u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Turning to the substantive reasonableness of Roberts\u2019s sentence, the record shows that the district court imposed the 108-month sentence only after listening to and considering the parties\u2019 evidence and arguments as to a reasonable sentence. Moreover, the district court\u2019s rejection of Roberts\u2019s request for a sentence below the Guidelines range, and finding that a sentence within the range was appropriate, was not unreasonable, or an abuse of discretion. The district court noted that the sentence imposed was appropriate given that the nature of the offense was \u201cvery, very serious,\u201d but Roberts did not have an extensive criminal history and he was remorseful for his actions. Thus, the court explicitly discussed at least two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2014 and these findings are sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review of the chosen sentence and to promote the perception of fan sentencing. The district court was not required to mention every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>Cf. Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363 (noting that \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court\u201d). And we can find no indication in the record to support Roberts\u2019s suggestion that the district judge applied a presumption that a within-Guidelines sentence would reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">On this record, Roberts has not met his burden to establish unreasonableness. Accordingly, we affirm his 108-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. <em>Cf. Rita v.
