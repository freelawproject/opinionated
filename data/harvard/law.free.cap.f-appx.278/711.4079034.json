The court sentenced Salcedo to consecutive prison terms of 87 months on the drag offense and 60 months on the firearm offense, for a total of 147 months. His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Salcedo\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">We conclude that Salcedo\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. Nothing in the record indicates the court overlooked a relevant factor, gave significant weight to an improper factor, or made a clear error of judgment in weighing appropriate factors when it imposed a within-Guidelines-range sentence for Salcedo\u2019s drug offense. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (allowing appellate presumption of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1003-04 (8th Cir.2005) (reasonableness factors). Further, the consecutive 60-month sentence was the statutory minimum for Salcedo\u2019s firearm offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), (D); <em>United States v. Gregg, </em>451 F.3d 930, 937 (8th Cir.2006) (rejecting argument that district court has discretion to determine whether ultimate sentence is reasonable and to impose non-Guidelines sentence even when portion of sentence is result of mandatory minimum sentence; <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cdoes not relate to statutorily-imposed sentences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">. The Honorable Lyle E. Strom, United States District Judge for the District of Nebraska.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
