Grossman, appointed counsel for William Hicks, has filed a motion to withdraw on appeal supported by a brief prepared pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no issues of arguable merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Hicks\u2019s convictions and aggregate sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-22\">Also, while counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw was pending, Hicks filed three motions to compel production of transcripts and other documents. As neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures nor the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorize discovery on appeal, Hicks\u2019s motions are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
