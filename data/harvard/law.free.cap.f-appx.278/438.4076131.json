However, Atkins has not shown that the officials disregarded any inference that there was a substantial risk of serious harm, and his claims amount only to claims of unreasonableness or negligence, neither of which establishes an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Cantu v. Jones, </em>293 F.3d 839, 844 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>74 F.3d 633, 649 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-19\">Atkins also argues that Steven Dozat was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when he delayed sending Atkins to a doctor concerning his May 19, 2006, injury until July 21, 2006. However, Atkins has not shown that the delay in treatment substantially harmed him or exacerbated his injury in any way, and he has not shown that Dozat\u2019s administration of Motrin and Tylenol alone during the delay were attributable to anything more than negligence, which does not establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-20\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Atkins\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Atkins is warned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
