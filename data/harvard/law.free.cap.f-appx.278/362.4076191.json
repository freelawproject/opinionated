Whitehurst, former federal prisoner, appeals the dismissal of his action brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), as time barred. Whitehurst asserts that his claim against Doris Jones for detaining him past an accurately calculated release date and his claim against the Bureau of Prisons officials for preventing him from exhausting his administrative remedies were timely filed because the statute of limitations did not begin to run until he was released from prison on February 3, 2006. He additionally asserts that the statute of limitations was tolled during the time he attempted to exhaust his administrative remedies. Finally, Whitehurst contends that the statute of limitations was tolled until February 3, 2006 because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) prevented him from filing a civil action while he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Whitehurst brought this action pursuant to <em>Bivens. </em>Whitehurst, however, must exhaust his remedies available to him through habeas corpus before pursuing his <em>Bivens </em>claims because he challenges the duration of his confinement. <em>See Cook v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice Transitional Planning Dep\u2019t, </em>37 F.3d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1994)(\u201cThe core issue in determining whether a prisoner must pursue habeas corpus relief rather than a civil rights action is to determine whether the prisoner challenges the \u2018fact or duration\u2019 of his confinement or merely the rules, customs, and procedures affecting \u2018conditions\u2019 of confinement.\u201d); <em>Spina v. Aaron, </em>821 F.2d 1126, 1128 (5th Cir.1987). Whitehurst\u2019s claims that the denial of time credits unlawfully extended his detention directly implicate the duration of his confinement. Although Whitehurst is currently serving an eight-year term of supervised release, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas relief is still available to Whitehurst because the district court may exercise its discretion to modify his term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2) if it determines that he has served excess time in prison. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">According to the rule in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), Whitehurst cannot bring his <em>Bivens </em>action for damages until his conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid ... or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d 512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Accordingly, Whitehurst must exhaust his habeas remedies and obtain relief on his claim concerning his illegal detention prior to filing his <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Because Whitehurst must obtain an order invalidating his illegal detention prior to bringing his <em>Bivens </em>action, his <em>Bivens </em>action does not accrue until he receives such an invalidation. <em>See Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27-28 (5th Cir.1994). Whitehurst\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims are therefore not time barred. Although the district court erred in determining that Whitehurst\u2019s action was time barred, the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the lawsuit can be affirmed on alternative grounds be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>cause <em>Heck </em>bars Whitehurst from bringing his <em>Bivens </em>action prior to obtaining an order invalidating his illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
