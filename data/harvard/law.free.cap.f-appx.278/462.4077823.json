Gobert has appealed his jury conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He contends that the evidence introduced to prove his guilt was insufficient. We review this question for a manifest miscarriage of justice because Gobert failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence. <em>See United States v. Avants, </em>367 F.3d 433, 449 (5th Cir.2004). Under that standard, Gobert must show that the record is \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>void of evidence of guilt\u201d or that the evidence is \u201cso tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>Avants, </em>367 F.3d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Gobert contends only that the Government failed to prove that he was in possession of a firearm. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>406 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2005) (listing elements of offense); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Gobert was observed by an acquaintance in possession of a firearm. Accordingly, there was direct evidence that Gobert possessed a firearm and the record was not \u201cdevoid of evidence\u201d as to that element of the offense. <em>See Avants, </em>367 F.3d at 449; <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 416 (5th Cir.1998). The conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
