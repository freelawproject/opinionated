She contests the summary judgment awarded Academy and its insurer, Zurich Insurance Company. Primarily at issue is whether Mussle showed a genuine issue of material fact regarding the existence of a hazardous condition, creating an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-20\">Mussle maintains she was injured while shopping at Academy\u2019s Slidell, Louisiana, store when her foot or ankle came in contact with something underneath a shelf. She speculates a metal bracket caused the injury, but no evidence was presented supporting this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-21\">The district court awarded summary judgment to Academy, holding Mussle presented \u201cno objective evidence establishing that a metal bracket, or brace, or any other \u2018sharp\u2019 object, was ... under the relevant shelving <em>and </em>positioned so as to injure her ankle\u201d. (Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, the court ruled Mussle failed to show a triable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-22\">A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>E.g. Jenkins v. Methodist Hosps. of Dallas, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir.2007). Such judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-23\">Essentially for the reasons stated by the district court, summary judgment was proper. Mussle produced no evidence establishing the shelf posed an unreasonably dangerous risk of harm. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:2800.6; <em>Ernest v. Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., </em>703 So.2d 1380, 1381-82 (La.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Ct.App.1997). Instead, she asserted only that the shelf should have had a \u201ckick plate\u201d covering the space between the bottom shelf and floor. Additionally, Mussle was unable to determine what caused her injury. Speculation as to the cause of an accident does not supply the factual support required to meet the plaintiffs evidentiary burden. <em>See Reed v. Home Depot USA, Inc., </em>843 So.2d 588, 591 (La.Ct.App.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
