However, in 1999, after a hearing, the Texas Board of Law Examiners (\u201cBLE\u201d) determined that Kastner did not have the requisite moral character to be licensed to practice law in Texas and that he suffered from a chemical dependency. On these grounds, in 2000, the BLE denied Kastner\u2019s application, but allowed him to petition for admission again in July 2001 and further set conditions for Kastner to follow regarding violations of the law, the use of alcohol and drugs, and attendance at rehabilitation. In 2005, more than five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>years after the initial denial, Kastner reapplied for admission to the bar. The BLE made a preliminary determination that Kastner still lacked good moral character and suffered from a chemical dependancy because he had not complied with the \u201ccurative measures\u201d it had delineated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A hearing was scheduled for August 2006. Due to requests for continuances by both parties, the hearing has not yet been conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">In the meantime, Kastner filed a federal lawsuit, <em>Kastner v. Texas Board of Law Examiners, et al., </em>07-CV-086-SS <em>(\u201cKastner I </em>\u201d), which alleged a number of federal and state constitutional claims stemming from his failure to be admitted to the bar. On May 25, 2007, the district court dismissed the complaint in <em>Kastner I </em>as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The court found that Kastner\u2019s claims were nonjusticiable for lack of jurisdiction, based both on the fact that the BLE had yet to issue a final decision on Kastner\u2019s 2005 application and on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">However, on May 21, 2007, prior to the district court\u2019s dismissal of <em>Kastner I, </em>Kastner filed another complaint in federal court predicated on the BLE\u2019s failure to admit him to the bar, <em>Kastner v. Texas Board of Law Examiners, et al., </em>07-CV-397 <em>(\u201cKastner II </em>\u201d). Specifically, in <em>Kastner II, </em>Kastner alleges that the BLE violated his due process rights in making its determination in 2000 and preliminary determination in 2005 that he is morally unfit for admission to the Texas Bar. Further, Kastner alleges that, by considering certain parts of his criminal history in making these determinations, the BLE also deprived him of his rights under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738. He also alleges that the BLE breached its \u201cduty,\u201d pursuant to Texas Government Code \u00a7 82.028, to cite him only for those factors enumerated in \u00a7 82.028 and to properly review materials in a licensure case. The district court dismissed <em>Kastner II </em>on the same basis as <em>Kastner I, </em>finding the suit frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and concluding that Kastner\u2019s claims were not ripe and that the doctrines of <em>Younger </em>and <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>precluded review. Kastner appeals the dismissal of <em>Kastner II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">To the extent that Kastner requests relief related to his current bar application, his claims are not yet ripe for review. The Supreme Court has stated that the \u201cripeness doctrine is drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 43, 57 n. 18, 113 S.Ct. 2485, 125 L.Ed.2d 38 (1993). \u201cA court should dismiss a case for lack of \u2018ripeness\u2019 when the case is abstract or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Monk v. Huston, </em>340 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir.2003). In determining whether a matter is ripe for judicial review we consider \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Orix Credit Alliance, Inc. v. Wolfe, </em>212 F.3d 891, 895 (5th Cir.2000). Here, the hearing scheduled by the BLE regarding Kastner\u2019s application has not been conducted and the BLE has not yet made a final determination as to his application for admission. Because Kastner has not yet been denied admission to the bar, his claims are merely hypothetical, and our review is barred by the ripeness doctrine. <em>See United Transp. Union v. Foster, </em>205 F.3d 851, 857 (5th Cir.2000) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(\u201cRipeness separates those matters that are premature because the injury is speculative and may never occur from those that are appropriate for judicial review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Further, under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), federal courts must refrain from considering requests for injunctive or declaratory relief based upon constitutional challenges to ongoing state civil proceedings. There is a three-prong test for determining whether the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine is applicable: (1) the dispute must involve an \u201congoing state judicial proceeding,\u201d (2) an important state interest in the subject matter of the proceeding must be implicated, and (3) the state proceedings must afford an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges. <em>Wightman v. Tex. Supreme Ct., </em>84 F.3d 188, 189 (5th Cir.1996). Here, the state proceedings are ongoing, the proceedings implicate important state interests relating to the regulation of lawyers, and there is an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings for Kastner to raise his constitutional challenges. Therefore, to the extent that Kastner seeks injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the BLE\u2019s consideration of his current bar application, the district court correctly held that it was proper for it to abstain from hearing these claims under <em>Younger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Finally, we are barred from hearing any claims relating to the 2000 BLE decision under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Rooker v. Fidelity Tr. Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 483, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). Under this doctrine, \u201clower federal courts lack jurisdiction to review state court judgments when the constitutional claims are \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with [a] challenged state court judgment.\u201d <em>Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, Inc., </em>355 F.3d 345, 350 (5th Cir.2003). A state bar\u2019s denial of admission is a state judicial act over which a federal court has no jurisdiction. <em>See Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482-83, 103 S.Ct. 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On appeal, Kastner argues that he is challenging the constitutionality of the BLE rules generally, not only as applied to him. However, an examination of Kastner\u2019s complaint belies this contention. All of his allegations stem from action taken by the BLE upon his application, including the alleged failure of the BLE to comply with Texas Government Code \u00a7 82.028. His complaint does not adequately set forth a general, facial challenge to the constitutionality of the Texas Bar admission rules. Rather, it sets forth a challenge to the BLE\u2019s decision in his ease alleging that the the BLE\u2019s action was unconstitutional. The distiict court lacks jurisdiction to review such a challenge. <em>See Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 486, 103 S.Ct. 1303 (holding that federal district courts lack jurisdiction \u201cover challenges to state-court decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court\u2019s action was unconstitutional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Because the district court lacked jurisdiction over Kastner\u2019s claims, it did not err in dismissing his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, Appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Appellee\u2019s motion to stay the briefing deadline is DISMISSED as MOOT. Kastner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED, and the Court considered his response in granting Appellee\u2019s motion for summax'y affirmance. Kastner\u2019s Motion for Costs and Fees is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. Apparently, in the intervening years, Kastner had been convicted of obstructing a peace officer in Mesa, Colorado, and driving while intoxicated in Harris County, Texas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
