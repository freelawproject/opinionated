The district court granted summary judgment because Honeycutt failed to demonstrate that she was entitled to a three-year statute of limitations period on her claims because her employer willfully violated the FMLA. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and views the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Dawkins v. Witt, </em>318 F.3d 606, 610 (4th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Dawkins, </em>318 F.3d at 610. Summary judgment will be granted unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party on the evidence presented. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Generally, FMLA claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2617(c)(1) (2000). If the alleged FMLA violation is willful, the limitations period is extended to three years. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2617(c)(2) (2000). Because Honeycutt filed her complaint more than two years after her termination, the action is barred unless the record demonstrated a willful violation by the Employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Honeycutt v. Baltimore County, Md., </em>No. 1:06-cv00958-JFM, 2007 WL 1858691 (D. Md. June 18, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
