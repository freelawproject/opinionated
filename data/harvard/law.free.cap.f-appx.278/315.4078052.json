Irby, Mississippi prisoner # 44999, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. He argues that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment when they: misdiagnosed the underlying cause of his leg complaints; provided inadequate and inappropriate medical care; failed to timely send him for outside medical treatment; delayed treating his injuries; and placed him in administrative segregation in retaliation for requesting outside medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">The record suggests that the defendants may have been negligent in their diagnosis and treatment of Irby. However, the defendants\u2019s actions do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>See Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Irby\u2019s conclusory allegations regarding retaliatory mistreatment are an insufficient basis for \u00a7 1983 relief. <em>See Kinash v. Callahan, </em>129 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b342-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
