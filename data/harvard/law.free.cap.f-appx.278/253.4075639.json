This court affirmed Ollivierre\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Ollivierre, </em>378 F.3d 412 (4th Cir.2004). The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Court granted Ollivierre\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Ollivierre v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 1112, 125 S.Ct. 1064, 160 L.Ed.2d 1050 (2005). We, in turn, remanded the case for resentencing. <em>United States v. Ollivierre, </em>155 Fed.Appx. 644 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">On remand, the district court resentenced Ollivierre to 210 months imprisonment. He appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to depart from the advisory guidelines range which took into account the 100:1 crack to powder cocaine ratio. This court affirmed on the reasoning of <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that 100:1 ratio cannot be the basis of a variance), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2008). Ollivierre again filed a petition for writ of certiorari and, again, the Supreme Court vacated his sentence and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (holding that a sentencing judge is free to consider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses in determining whether, \u201cin the particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to serve the objectives of sentencing.\u201d) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that resentencing is warranted. Therefore, we vacate Ollivierre\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
