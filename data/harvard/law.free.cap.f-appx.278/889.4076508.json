When detected, the boat attempted evasive maneuvers. Unable to escape, the five men on the boat \u2014 Salas-Paredes, his three-man crew, and a \u201cdrug representative\u201d \u2014 began to throw bales of cocaine overboard. The Coast Guard recovered approximately 1,746 kilograms of cocaine. The government charged Salas-Paredes with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70503(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>70506(b), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70503(a) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">After Salas-Paredes pleaded not guilty, he indicated a desire to change his plea, and the court scheduled a plea hearing. At that hearing, however, Salas-Paredes refused to sign the necessary papers, asking instead to speak with his attorney. The court stated that there was limited time for discussion because a trial was scheduled to begin soon. Salas-Paredes\u2019 attorney requested a continuance, which was granted, and at a hearing three weeks later Salas-Paredes pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">The probation office prepared a presentence investigation report, which assigned Salas-Paredes a base offense level of thirty-eight because the crime involved more than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine. United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (Nov. 2006). The report enhanced his offense level by two for being the captain of a vessel carrying a controlled substance. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2). Finally, it reduced his offense level by two for acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The net result was an adjusted offense level of thirty-eight. Based on that adjusted offense level and his criminal history category of I, the advisory guidelines range was 235 to 293 months imprisonment. The statutory minimum for his crimes is ten years imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">At sentencing, Salas-Paredes made three objections. First, he argued that he was entitled to the additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) for timely no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>tification of his intention to plead guilty. Second, he argued that he qualified for a two-level reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll), which requires satisfaction of the conditions for the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve provision. Finally, he argued that he was entitled to a two-level \u00a7 3B1.2 minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The court decided that before ruling on Salas-Paredes\u2019 safety valve objection it needed to hear from the Drug Enforcement Agency agent who interviewed him after his arrest. The agent testified that Salas-Paredes recounted an implausible version of events that contradicted information from the other individuals who were arrested with him. The court found that the agent was credible and that Salas-Paredes had not been forthcoming in his interview with the agent. The court concluded that, because full disclosure of information about the criminal enterprise with which the defendant was involved is a requirement of the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve provision, Salas-Paredes was not entitled to it. It also overruled his other two objections to the PSI. After considering the advisory guideline range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Salas-Paredes to 235 months imprisonment and five years supervised released. This is Salas-Paredes\u2019 appeal of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Salas-Paredes first contends that the district court erred by not giving him the \u00a7 3El.l(b) acceptance of responsibility reduction. That provision allows a defendant who accepts responsibility for his offense to receive an additional one-level reduction in his offense level if, among other conditions, the government makes a motion \u201cstating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). We review a district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility reductions only for clear error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The government did not move the court to grant Salas-Paredes the \u00a7 3El.l(b) one-level reduction. We have not yet decided under what circumstances a district court can review the government\u2019s decision not to file a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion. In the related context of government motions for downward departure based on substantial assistance under \u00a7 5K1.1, we have held that the government abuses its broad authority to decide whether or not to move the court for a downward departure only when its decision is unconstitutionally motivated. <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2000). Salas-Paredes has not alleged an unconstitutional motive, so he has not made out a basis for finding that the government should have filed a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by refusing to give SalasParedes the one-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Salas-Paredes next contends that the district court erred by not giving him a two-level reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll) for meeting the conditions of the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve provision. Section 501.2(a)(5) requires that the defendant to provide the government with \u201call information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d Salas-Paredes argues that the information that he withheld from the DEA agent was not relevant to the charges against him, so his lies to the agent cannot be held against him. We review a district court\u2019s safety valve fact-finding only for clear error. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Even if Salas-Paredes\u2019 argument were correct, we may affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to apply a reduction for any reason supported by the record. <em>See Cochran v. U.S. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>291 F.3d 775, 778 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002). A condition of the safety valve provision upon which the district court did not explicitly rely is that \u201cthe defendant was not ... [a] supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(4). In the recitation of offense conduct the PSI stated that Salas-Paredes was the captain of the boat used to carry the cocaine. Salas-Paredes did not object to this statement, and it was adopted as a finding by the district court. When a defendant does not challenge the facts in the PSI, they are deemed admitted. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Having admitted to supervising at least the three members of his crew Salas-Paredes was ineligible for the safety valve provision or the two-level reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Finally Salas-Paredes contends that he was entitled to a minor role reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that he had a minor role in the offense because he was merely a courier, he did not load the drugs, and he did not recruit others to participate. We review a district court\u2019s finding that the defendant was not a minor participant in the offense only for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). In determining whether a defendant is entitled to a minor role reduction, the sentencing court should consider: (1) \u201cthe defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing\u201d; and (2) his \u201crole as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. Of the two prongs, the first is the more important and may be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 945. As to it, we have explained that, \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">At sentencing Salas-Paredes was held accountable only for his own actions \u2014 conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and his possessing with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \u2014 not a larger conspiracy. SalasParedes admitted to captaining the go-fast boat carrying the cocaine, attempting to evade the Coast Guard, and throwing the cocaine overboard before the Coast Guard could search the boat. Further, the quantity of cocaine in this case is so great that it may preclude anyone directly involved from having a minor role. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>870 F.2d 174, 177 (5th Cir.1989) (one kilogram of cocaine found to be a substantial enough quantity to deny a minor-role reduction); <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>868 F.2d 1409, 1410 (5th Cir.1989) (497 grams of cocaine found to be a substantial enough quantity to deny a minor-role reduction). All of these facts strongly support the district court\u2019s finding that Salas-Paredes did not play a minor role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the conduct for which he was held accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">As for relative culpability, the district court is to consider other participants in the offense only to the extent that they \u201care identifiable or discernable from the evidence\u201d and \u201cwere involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. As captain of the boat, Salas-Paredes had a larger role than at least three of the four other men caught with him. He was also, presumably, the one who attempted to evade the Coast Guard. Of the other participants in the offense, only the drag representative was arguably more culpable than SalasParedes. Neither <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>prong supports a finding of a minor role. The district court did not clearly err by denying him a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-5\">. Salas-Paredes also contends that he is entitled to a \u00a7 3B 1.2(a) minimal role reduction. Because he raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review this contention only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>381 F.3d 1070, 1073 (11th Cir.2004). Since we conclude that the district court did not err in denying him the minor role reduction, it certainly did not err in not giving him a minimal role reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
