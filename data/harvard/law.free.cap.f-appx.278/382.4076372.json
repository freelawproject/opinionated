Villarreal-Orozco contends that the district court misapplied the Guidelines and committed reversible error when it characterized his prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance as a drug trafficking offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Because VillarrealOrozco preserved his argument in the district court, we review that court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The record demonstrates that Villarreal-Orozco was previously convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance in violation of Tex. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(a). This court recently held that a \u00a7 481.112(a) conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance is indistinguishable from the offense of possession with intent to distribute and, thus, qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a). <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 (5th Cir.2007). Further, this court noted that the definitions of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 and \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1 are effectively identical for purposes of determining if a prior \u00a7 481.112(a) conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance justifies a sentencing enhancement based on either section. <em>Id. </em>at 717 n. 2. Therefore, in light of <em>Ford, </em>the district court did not err when it characterized VillarrealOrozco\u2019s prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance as a drug trafficking offense for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Villarreal-Orozco challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
