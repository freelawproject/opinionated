The Board of Immigration Appeals and immigration judge denied the applications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>based on a finding that Teame and Tarkegn were not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Adverse credibility findings will be reversed \u201conly if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted)). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods in the applicant\u2019s oral and written statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Substantial evidence supports the decision that Teame and Tarkegn were not credible. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Teame and Tarkegn presented inconsistent and implausible testimonies about their marriage, Teame\u2019s country of birth, where they had lived and worked, their church attendance, and whether they had suffered persecution on account of their religion. The immigration judge and Board provided specific, cogent reasons to support the adverse credibility determination. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. Teame and Tarkegn offer no explanation for their inconsistencies that would \u201c \u2018compel\u2019 a reasonable fact finder\u201d to reverse that credibility finding or to conclude that they established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Teame and Tarkegn\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
