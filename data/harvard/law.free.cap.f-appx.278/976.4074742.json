Saunders argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he alleged in his \u00a7 2255 motion that he was prejudiced by not accepting a plea offer, which led to a \u201csubstantially harsher\u201d sentence, based on his trial counsel\u2019s miscalculation of the potential sentence he faced at trial. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">A jury found Saunders guilty of: (1) possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C); and (2) possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Saunders had a total offense level of 16, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(12). However, because he was classified as a career offender, Saunders\u2019s offense level was 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and (b). Saunders was sentenced to consecutive terms of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment for the cocaine conviction, and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">Saunders claimed in his \u00a7 2255 motion and accompanying memorandum that his attorney failed to discover one of his convictions that led to his career offender classification. Saunders stated that he had been advised by his trial attorney that the drug guidelines were Level 16 at worst and the gun count carried a 60 month consecutive sentence with or without a trial. Saunders argued that his counsel \u201cdenied him the opportunity to knowingly accept or reject an offer by giving him incorrect advice about the sentencing ramifications.\u201d Saunders stated that, \u201c[b]ut for this erroneous advice, [he] would have accepted a plea offer,\u201d and \u201c[t]he erroneous advise of counsel at the plea negotiation stage clearly amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Further, Saunders was prejudiced by not ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>cepting the government\u2019s plea offer because his trial \u201cled to a substantially harsher sentence than would have been available under a plea agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The district court denied Saunders\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The court found that the factual record was sufficiently developed to render judgment and, therefore, no evidentiary hearing on Saunders\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was necessary. The court determined that Saunders\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to discover Saunders\u2019s conviction, and Saunders could not demonstrate prejudice because he failed to present any information regarding what sentence he may have pled guilty to and provided no description of any plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">We granted a COA on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">Whether the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his criminal history and counsel him regarding career criminal status and accepting a government-offered plea deal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">We review the denial of an evidentiary hearing on a \u00a7 2255 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). The scope of review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2255:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-9\">Unless the motion and the files and records of the case <em>conclusively </em>show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court <em>shall </em>cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b) (emphasis added). \u201c[I]f the petitioner alleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 714-15 (citations and internal quotation omitted). \u201cThe law is clear that, in order to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing, a petitioner need only allege-not prove-reasonably specific, non-conclusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715 n. 6 (emphasis in original). \u201cA hearing is not required on patently frivolous claims or those which are based upon unsupported generalizations. Nor is a hearing required where the petitioner\u2019s allegations are affirmatively contradicted in the record.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1553 (11th Cir.1989) (citation omitted) (remanding for evidentiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel claim that counsel failed to inform appellant of statutory parole consequences before entering a guilty plea because record did not conclusively show that appellant was entitled to no relief); <em>see also Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1238-39 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that district court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing based on \u00a7 2255 petitioner\u2019s mere eonclusory allegations in his affidavit); <em>Tejada v. Dugger, </em>941 F.2d 1551, 1559 (11th Cir.1991) (stating that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing if his claims \u201care merely conelusory allegations unsupported by specifics or contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible\u201d) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">The Sixth Amendment gives criminal defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel. U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684-86, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>demonstrate (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>i.e., </em>the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he suffered prejudice as a result of that deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. We need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">To prove prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where a defendant challenges a not-guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Saunders was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he failed to allege facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief. Although in his \u00a7 2255 motion Saunders was not required to provide evidence to support his claims, by failing to disclose the details of his alleged plea offer, he has failed to allege \u201creasonably specific, non-conclusory facts\u201d with respect to his claim such that there was a reasonable probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. Therefore, he failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice. Thus, based on the unsupported generalizations contained in his motion and accompanying brief, the record conclusively shows that Saunders was entitled to no relief, and, therefore, the district court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Saunders\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">In light of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s denial of Saunders\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
