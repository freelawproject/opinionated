He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. This court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) after Rodriguez raised issues as to the retroactivity of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and whether his <em>Crawford </em>claim is procedurally barred. The State has since conceded that <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>retroactivity is not at issue because Rodriguez\u2019s conviction was not final when <em>Crawford </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">Rodriguez contends that the admission of his accomplices\u2019 guilty plea documents violated his Confrontation Clause rights as recognized by <em>Crawford </em>because those pleas were admissions not only against the accomplices\u2019 penal interest but against his own. This <em>Crawford </em>claim was rejected by the state appellate court as procedurally barred because Rodriguez did not make a Confrontation Clause or hearsay objection at trial. Our review of this claim is therefore barred by an independent and adequate state rule of procedural default. <em>See Parr v. Quarterman, </em>472 F.3d 245, 253 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2974, 168 L.Ed.2d 707 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">Rodriguez\u2019s argument that, prior to <em>Crawford, </em>he could not have raised a non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>futile objection to his accomplices\u2019 evidence is meritless. Such objections were recognized long before <em>Crawford. See Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 134, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999); <em>Williamson v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 599, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994); <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 541, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986); <em>see also Bunton v. State, </em>136 S.W.3d 355, 369 (Tex.Ct.App. 2004); <em>Cofield v. State, </em>891 S.W.2d 952, 955 (Tex.Crim.App.1994). Rodriguez also contends that the State\u2019s closing rebuttal argument improperly linked the accomplices\u2019 pleas to Rodriguez\u2019s guilt. Rodriguez did not raise the issue of an improper closing argument in his COA application or anywhere else prior to the instant appeal. Because our review is limited to claims on which a COA was granted, we do not consider this claim. <em>See Larry v. Dretke, </em>361 F.3d 890, 896 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Rodriguez has shown no basis for relief under \u00a7 2254. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
