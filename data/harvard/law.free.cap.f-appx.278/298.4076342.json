Perrin, </em>478 F.3d 672, 674 (5th Cir.2007). The district court determined that Perrin\u2019s guideline sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>tence range was 108-35 months of imprisonment with a statutory minimum of 60 months. <em>Id. </em>at 674-75. The court sentenced Perrin to the statutory minimum, stating four reasons for imposing a sentence below the recommended range. <em>Id. </em>at 675. On direct appeal, this court vacated the sentence, finding that \u201ceach of the four reasons given for the departure was improper\u201d and that \u201cno justification remains for the significant departure from the guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">At resentencing, the district court stated that the decision from this court on direct appeal had held that a sentence within the guideline range must be imposed. The court then imposed a sentence of 108 months, the bottom of the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Court rejected the notion that a district court needs extraordinary circumstances to justify a deviation from the guideline range. In making its sentencing decision, a court should use the range as \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d but should consider all the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. In reviewing a sentence, we first determine whether the decision was procedurally sound. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The government has requested that the sentence be vacated and remanded for re-sentencing because the district court\u2019s statement that this court\u2019s decision on direct appeal mandated a sentence within the guideline range is a procedural error under <em>Gall. </em>The government notes that this reasoning holds even if the district court misinterpreted this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">We agree. The sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with <em>Gall. </em>We note that the district court did not have the benefit of <em>Gall </em>when it imposed the sentence on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
