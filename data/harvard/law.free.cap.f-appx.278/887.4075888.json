The affidavit was false, he alleges, because it represented that Miller had shown the victim of a robbery (purportedly perpetrated by Hunter) a photographic lineup with six photos, whereas he had shown the victim only one photo, a photograph of Hunter. Acting pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b)(ii), the district court dismissed the suit <em>sua sponte, </em>as time-barred. Hunter now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). The standard for reviewing a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) applies to our review of a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997). A complaint should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) unless there is no proof the complainant could present in support of the complaint that would entitle him to relief. <em>Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc). However, \u201c[a] complaint is ... subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when its allegations \u2014 on their face \u2014 show that an affirmative defense bars recovery on the claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">\u201cSection 1983 claims are governed by the forum state\u2019s residual personal injury statute of limitations, which in Florida is four years.\u201d <em>City of Hialeah v. Rojas, </em>311 F.3d 1096, 1103 n. 2 (11th Cir.2002). Although the limitations period in \u00a7 1983 actions is governed by the forum state\u2019s law, the time of accrual of the cause of action is governed by federal law. <em>Kelly v. Serna, </em>87 F.3d 1235, 1238-39 (11th Cir.1996). Section 1983 actions do not accrue until the plaintiff knows or has reason to know both (1) that he has been injured, and (2) who has inflicted the injury. <em>Mullinax v. McElhenney, </em>817 F.2d 711, 716 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">The district court erred in dismissing Hunter\u2019s complaint as time-barred under Florida\u2019s four-year statute of limitations because the evidence in the record did not demonstrate that there was no proof Hunter could present to support his claim that he is entitled to relief. <em>Marsh, </em>268 F.3d at 1022. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand the case for further consideration. In view of this disposition, we need not address the question of whether the limitations period was equitably tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
