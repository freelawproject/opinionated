For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the petition in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Chen arrived in the United States in December 2004 without valid entry documents. The Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), issued a notice to appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Chen applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), alleging that he had been persecuted based on his political opinion after he opposed the government\u2019s seizure of his family\u2019s land without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">After a hearing, the IJ concluded that Chen\u2019s testimony lacked credibility and denied relief from removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chen appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal on August 24, 2006. Chen did not petition this court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">On June 13, 2007, Chen filed a motion to reopen based on changed circumstances. According to Chen, his parents had informed him that the Chinese government was targeting citizens who left China illegally and sought asylum in another country.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen on September 26, 2007, stating that Chen had not shown the new evidence was unavailable earlier or that it would result in a different outcome. On October 24, 2007, Chen filed his petition for review before this court, seeking review of the denial of his motion to reopen and the affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Chen now argues that the IJ erred by finding Chen\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. He does not address the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">An order of removal becomes final upon dismissal of an appeal by the BIA. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). A petition for review must be filed within thirty days of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see also Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). Importantly, the statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Dakane, </em>371 F.3d at 773 n. 3. And, the filing deadline is not suspended or tolled by a motion to reopen. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-1351 (11th Cir.2005) (observing that the filing of a motion to reconsider does not affect the finality of the underlying order or toll the 30-day period for petitioning for review of such order).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">Here, the BIA dismissed Chen\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s order of removal on August 24, 2006. Chen did not petition this court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision, but instead filed a motion to reopen on June 13, 2007. Because Chen\u2019s petition for review was not filed within thirty days after the BIA dismissed the appeal of the underlying removal order, we lack jurisdiction to consider the removal order. Thus, we do not consider Chen\u2019s argument that the IJ improperly found the testimony lacked credibility, and we dismiss the petition in part on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">Chen\u2019s petition for review was timely as to the denial of the motion to reopen. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1254 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 2. Here, however, Chen offers no argument in his brief that the BIA abused its discretion by-denying the motion to reopen. Thus, the issue has been abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we deny the petition in part on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b911-12\">. Because the underlying removal order is not properly before this court, the facts of the asylum claim are not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
