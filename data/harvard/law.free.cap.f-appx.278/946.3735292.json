Slizyk argues that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the debt was not dischargea-ble because she does not have the ability to pay the debt and because the bankruptcy court did not consider how much discharging the debt would harm Smilack. Slizyk also claims that $38,146.16 of the debt should be discharged because, although Smilack was awarded that amount in a divorce decree to pay a debt to his mother, he never actually paid the debt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>After thorough review, we affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">In appeals from bankruptcy proceedings, \u201cwe review determinations of law made by either the district or bankruptcy court de novo, while reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>In re Int\u2019l Pharmacy &amp; Disc. II, Inc., </em>443 F.3d 767, 770 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cEquitable determinations by the Bankruptcy Court are subject to review under an abuse of discretion standard. In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we ... must affirm unless we find that the court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>In re Kingsley, </em>518 F.3d 874, 877 (11th Cir.2008) (citations, quotations and alteration omitted). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s order independently of the district court. <em>Int\u2019l Pharmacy, </em>443 F.3d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">Chapter 7 bankruptcy generally discharges a debtor from all debts that arose before she filed the bankruptcy petition. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b). However, a debt incurred \u201cin connection with a ... divorce decree\u201d is not dischargeable unless (A) \u201cthe debtor does not have the ability to pay such debt from income or property of the debtor not reasonably necessary to be expended for the maintenance or support of the debtor,\u201d or (B) \u201cdischarging such debt would result in a benefit to the debtor that outweighs the detrimental consequences to a ... former spouse ... of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An objecting creditor first bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the debt should be exempted from discharge, and then the burden shifts to the debtor to establish the debt is dischargeable under either subsection (A) or (B). <em>In re Bowers, </em>357 B.R. 663, 667-68 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2006). When determining whether a debt should be discharged under \u00a7 523(a)(15), courts may consider the totality of the circumstances, including the parties\u2019 incomes, assets, liabilities, health, job skills, training, age, education, future earning capabilities, and long-term financial prospects. <em>Id. </em>at 668; <em>In re Daniel, </em>290 B.R. 914, 918 (Bankr.M.D.Ga.2003). Weighing the detrimental consequences to the parties under \u00a7 523(a)(15)(B) \u201crequire[s] the bankruptcy court to reach an equitable conclusion rather than a factual or legal one.\u201d <em>In re Myrvang, </em>232 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.2000); <em>cf. Matter of Crosswhite, </em>148 F.3d 879, 888 (7th Cir.1998) (discussing the \u201cequitable balancing test\u201d of \u00a7 523(a)(15)(B)); <em>In re Henrie, </em>235 B.R. 113, 121 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fla.1999) (\u201cSection 523(a)(15)(B) requires the Court to exercise its pure equitable powers\u201d and \u201cmake a value judgment in deciding which party suffers the most.\u201d) (quotations omitted). \u201c[C]ourts generally construe the statutory exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy liberally in favor of the debtor....\u201d <em>In re Miller, </em>39 F.3d 301, 304 (11th Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">As an initial matter, the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in determining that, based on Slizyk\u2019s future earning potential and employment opportunities, she was able to pay the $62,072.68 debt to Smilack. <em>Int\u2019l Pharmacy, </em>443 F.3d at 770. However, the bankruptcy court nonetheless abused its discretion in holding that the debt was not dischargeable, because there is no indication in the record that the court ever applied the correct legal test to determine whether discharging the debt \u201cwould result in a benefit to the debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>that outweighs the detrimental consequences to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15)(B). Specifically, the bankruptcy court <em>said </em>that it was using this test, but never actually discussed what, if any, harm discharging the debt would do to Smilack. Moreover, during the hearings, the bankruptcy court indicated that it did not understand why Slizyk or Smi-lack\u2019s financial status was relevant. And when Slizyk sought to enforce the bankruptcy court\u2019s order that Smilack disclose various financial records, the court said it did not think it would need those documents to make a decision. This record shows that the bankruptcy court plainly did not assess Smilack\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-3\">We are thus compelled to conclude that because the bankruptcy court did not consider the detriment that discharging the debt would cause Smilack and whether that detriment would outweigh the benefit to Slizyk, it did not apply the correct legal standard, and in so doing, abused its discretion. <em>Kingsley, </em>518 F.3d at 877. Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that the divorce decree debt of $62,072.68 was not dis-chargeable, and instruct the district court to vacate this part of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order and remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">We reject, however, Slizyk\u2019s argument that the portion of the debt awarded to Smilack in the divorce decree to pay a debt to his mother should be discharged. Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the U.S. Supreme Court is the only federal court that Congress has granted jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim seeking review of a state court judgment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257; <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The doctrine applies to claims actually raised in state court and to claims that were not raised in state court but are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment, so long as the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to raise the claim in state proceedings. <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 466-67 (11th Cir.1996). Using this doctrine, the district court correctly concluded that it could not review Slizyk\u2019s challenge to this portion of the divorce decree because it is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment, and Slizyk had a reasonable opportunity to raise it in state court. We likewise decline to address this issue, and affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">. Congress amended the applicable statute to remove subsections (A) and (B) from Section 523(a)(15), but the amendment is inapplicable to cases filed before the effective date of the amendment, and Slizyck\u2019s petition was filed before this date. <em>See </em>Pub.L. 109-8 \u00a7\u00a7 215(c), 1501(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1121-5\"><em>.
