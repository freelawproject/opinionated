On appeal, he argues that the sentence imposed, which was at the lowest end of his sentencing range, is procedurally and substantively unreasonable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in part, because the district court: (1) refused to consider his diminished mental capacity, due to Asperger\u2019s Syndrome; (2) failed to consider the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (3) ignored his uncontested evidence that (a) he posed no risk to recidivism and (b) he is likely to become a victim in a prison setting; and (4) incorrectly concluded that it was prohibited from imposing a variant sentence based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness, <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court recently clarified that this standard is synonymous with the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">In imposing a sentence, a district court first must correctly calculate a defendant\u2019s applicable Guideline range, and then must consider all of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to arrive at an appropriate sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. These factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After deciding on the appropriate sentence, the district court must sufficiently explain the chosen sentence to permit meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing. Gall, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Thus, our review is two-fold. First, we must ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error. Second, we must ensure that the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">A sentencing decision is procedurally sound if the district court correctly calculated the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence that was not based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">A sentencing decision is substantively reasonable if the district court acted within its discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 600. A \u201cdistrict court need only \u2018acknowledge\u2019 that it \u2018considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors!,]\u2019 and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>833 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (citations omitted). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). \u201c <em>\u2018[I]t </em>is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1323 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted) (alteration in original). Thus, we will reverse a proeedurally proper sentence only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Upon review, we conclude that Mandli\u2019s sentence was proeedurally sound. Mandli does not dispute that the district court correctly calculated the guidelines range. And, the court considered Mandli\u2019s arguments and evidence as to a reasonable sentence, acknowledged that the Guidelines were advisory, and reasoned that a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range was appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the advisory Guidelines concerning child sexual offenses, the statements of the parties, the evidence presented. The court\u2019s explanation of its reasons was sufficient. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (finding that a lengthy explanation is not necessarily required when a court decides to follow the Guidelines in a particular case, particularly where the court has listened to parties\u2019 arguments, considered the supporting evidence, and was aware of the defendant\u2019s special conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Furthermore, we conclude that Mandli\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. First, the district court imposed the 78-month sentence only after listening to and considering the parties\u2019 evidence and arguments as to a reasonable sentence. Second, the court noted that it considered the sentence imposed to be appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and specifically listed three of those factors. Although the district court did not explicitly mention every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, it was not required to do so, and \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Third, contrary to Mandli\u2019s arguments on appeal, the district court never explicitly indicated that it was prohibited from considering diminished capacity in determining whether a variance was appropriate, but rather expressly stated that it: (1) understood that Mandli had disorders that need to be dealt with; (2) considered his nature and circumstances, which presumably would have encompassed his diminished mental capacity; and (3) considered the testimony of his psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">Finally, the sentenced imposed, which was at the low end of the guidelines range, was substantially less than the offense\u2019s statutory maximum of 120-months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Mandli\u2019s 72-month sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-11\">. Mandli also argues that the district court erred by not imposing a downward departure for diminished mental capacity, presumably pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. Because the district court recognized its authority to depart downward, but concluded that a departure was not appropriate, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b982-23\">. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(2)(A), in imposing sentence on a defendant convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>of an offense such as Mandli\u2019s, \"the court <em>shall </em>impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4)\u201d unless certain exceptions, not applicable to the instant case, apply. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The PSI, as adopted by the court, suggested at one point it \u201dappear[ed]\u201d that the court was precluded under \u00a7 3553(b)(2)(A) from imposing a variance, but neither the parties nor the district court explicitly mentioned the applicability of \u00a7 3553(b)(2)(A), or this language in the PSI, during sentencing. Nor did the court assert that it believed that it was statutorily barred from imposing a downward variance in this case. Thus, there is nothing in the record to support Mandli\u2019s assertion that the court erroneously believed that it was statutorily barred from imposing a downward variance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-14\">. We note that Mandli (i) never expressly requested a downward variance before the district court, but rather only sought a \"downward Guideline departure sentence,\u201d although he did cite to <em>Booker </em>and to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and (ii) never objected, after the district court imposed sentence, that his 78-month sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. However, we need not decide whether Mandli's failure in either or both of these regards dictates that we apply plain error review because Mandli\u2019s claim fails under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
