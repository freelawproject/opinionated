Benson, a native and citizen of Kenya, has filed a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) order denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). In rejecting Benson\u2019s application, the BIA found that Benson lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, this court reviews the factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994). Under the substantial evidence standard, this court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 8. \u201cThe applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The decision of the BIA to reject Benson\u2019s testimony as incredible is based on a reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, even if Benson\u2019s testimony was deemed credible, the record does not compel a finding that she is eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. Accordingly, Benson\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
