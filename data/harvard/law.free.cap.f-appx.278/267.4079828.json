Mangual has also filed a motion requesting leave to file a pro se supplemental brief, in which he raises additional claims relating to his sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural errors, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cIn assessing a challenge to a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d this court reviews a district court\u2019s \u201cfactual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo\u201d. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Mangual\u2019s first claim challenges the district court\u2019s determination of his base offense level, asserting that the total amount of drugs held attributable to him was \u201cpurely speculative, procedurally improper, and unsupported by the record.\u201d Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) (2005), in determining the proper base offense level to apply to a defendant involved in a drug conspiracy, the defendant is responsible for his own acts, as well as for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts\u201d of his co-conspirators taken in furtherance of the joint criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 210 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1013 (4th Cir.1993). The Guidelines do not require precise calculations of drug quantity, as the district court\u2019s approximation is not clearly erroneous if supported by competent evidence. <em>Randall, </em>171 F.3d at 210. If the district court relies on the drug quantity included in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the information is incorrect, as \u201cmere objections are insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">At sentencing, the Government presented testimony from DEA Agent Charles Hedrick and Officer Thomas \u25a0 Eveler. Hedrick\u2019s testimony related to a ledger recovered from the residence of Luis F. Mangual, Sr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that listed the quantity of drugs received and distributed by Mangual, Sr., including various transfers of cocaine and heroin to his son. According to Agent Hedrick\u2019s analysis of the ledger, between October 2002 and June 2004, a total of 549 kilograms of cocaine, worth approximately $ 11.5 million, was received by Mangual, Sr., from an individual identified as \u201cCucho.\u201d During this period, Mangual, Sr., also received 14.5 kilograms of heroin, worth approximately $1.1 million. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The ledger indicated that Mangual, Sr., provided his son with between 100 to 140 kilograms of cocaine and approximately 5 kilograms of heroin, with the drugs sold to Mangual at a discounted price compared to other buyers. Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), the district court found Mangual was responsible for \u201csubstantially more than 150 kilograms\u201d of cocaine, resulting in a base offense level of 38, as the amount of narcotics attributable to Mangual was not limited solely to the drugs sold to him, but also included the total amount of drags received by his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">At sentencing, Mangual contended the district court should limit its analysis to the amount of drags he actually received. However, in light of Mangual\u2019s close association with his father within the jointly undertaken criminal operation, the district court had sufficient grounds to hold Mangual responsible for the total amount of narcotics received by his father. In the wiretapped telephone conversations, Mangual and his father often spoke to one another about the operation of the drug enterprise, discussing matters such as supply sources, customers, quality of the drugs, transportation of the narcotics, and the activities of other members of the conspiracy. On one occasion, Mangual, Sr., informed his son that he was awaiting a shipment of 200 kilograms of cocaine from a supplier. On another occasion, Mangual was provided with samples of heroin to do a \u201cproduct test\u201d to help his father decide whether to purchase larger amounts from another supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Mangual\u2019s close relationship with his father within the conspiracy was eleai'ly evinced by the fact that Mangual was expected to take over his father\u2019s position in the drug enterprise while Mangual, Sr., was in the hospital. Mangual, Sr., intended for his son to run the entire operation during his absence and had discussed this matter with his suppliers in order to ensure the supply of narcotics would not be interrupted. Though Mangual was arrested before this transition occurred, the fact that he was expected to serve as the head of the distribution operation demonstrated he was well aware of the scope of his father\u2019s criminal activities. Therefore, we find the district court had ample evidence to support its finding that the drug deliveries to Mangual\u2019s father were reasonably foreseeable acts taken in furtherance of them joint criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Mangual also contends the district court erred by failing to make any finding as to whether he and his father intended or were capable of delivering the amount of drags held attributable to them. However, this claim is wholly without merit. The district court is required to exclude an unsuccessfully negotiated amount of narcotics only when a defendant \u201clacked both the intent <em>and </em>the ability to complete the drug transaction.\u201d <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>957 F.2d 1138, 1151 (4th Cir.1992). In this case, not only did Mangual and his father clearly intend to distribute the narcotics for which they were held responsible, but Officer Eveler specifically stated that Mangual, Sr., was capable of distributing at least 200 kilograms of cocaine. While Mangual notes the district court made no finding regarding the drugs he received from another supplier, Edward Barber, such a finding was unnecessary, as the court had already determined Mangual was responsible for substantially more than 150 kilograms of cocaine based solely on his dealings with his father. Accordingly, we conclude the district court did not era in calculating Mangual\u2019s base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Mangual\u2019s next contention is the district court erred by holding him respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>sible for a firearm recovered from the residence of a co-conspirator, Travel Riley,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as there was no evidence Mangual had ever been to the residence or was otherwise aware that Riley possessed a firearm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), a two-level offense level enhancement shall be imposed if a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, was possessed during the narcotics offense. The adjustment is applied \u201cif the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), comment, (n.3). In order to demonstrate that a weapon was present, the Government need show only that \u201cthe weapon was possessed in connection with drug activity that was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 233-34 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 1B1.3 (a)(1)(B), a defendant may be held responsible for a firearm possessed by another member of the conspiracy if possession of the firearm was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant and \u201cin furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>See United States v. Kimberlin, </em>18 F.3d 1156, 1159-60 (4th Cir.1994); <em>Brooks, </em>957 F.2d at 1148-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">As Mangual conceded at sentencing, the Government is not required to prove he possessed or had knowledge of the firearm held by Riley. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>6 F.3d 1049, 1055-56 (4th Cir.1993), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995); <em>see also United States v. White, </em>875 F.2d 427, 433 (4th Cir.1989). While Mangual contends that USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) demands some form of a physical nexus between the defendant and the firearm held by a co-conspirator, the evidence is only required to show that \u201cunder the circumstances of the case, it was fair to say that it was reasonably foreseeable to [defendant] that his co-partieipant was in possession of a firearm.\u201d <em>Kimberlin, </em>18 F.3d at 1160 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Furthermore, this court has held that \u201c[a]bsent evidence of exceptional circumstances, ... it [is] fairly inferable that a codefendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon is foreseeable to a defendant with reason to believe that their collaborative criminal venture includes an exchange of controlled substances for a large amount of cash.\u201d <em>Id.; see also White, </em>875 F.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In this case, the wiretap evidence indicated that Mangual\u2019s relationship with Riley went beyond that of a supplier and a street-level dealer. At the Rule 11 hearing, Mangual conceded he was part of a drug conspiracy involving a number of individuals, including Riley, to whom he sold cocaine for distribution. While Mangual would often call Riley to discuss payment for the drugs he provided, he would also seek Riley\u2019s advice on how to deal with problems he was facing, including a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>seizure of drug proceeds and the resulting issues with his supplier. In light of their close association and the sizeable amount of cocaine Mangual was providing to Riley, it was reasonably foreseeable that Riley would carry a firearm in furtherance of their joint drug distribution efforts. <em>See Kimberlin, </em>18 F.3d at 1160. Accordingly, we find the district court did not err in imposing a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Mangual asserts the district court erred by imposing a three-level enhancement for his role in the conspiracy. A three-level role adjustment is appropriate when \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Such an enhancement requires, at a minimum, that the defendant was the manager or supervisor \u201cof one or more other participants.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Bartley, </em>230 F.3d 667, 673 (4th Cir.2000). Factors distinguishing a \u201cleadership\u201d or \u201corganizational role\u201d from that of a manager or supervisor include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEF\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Mangual contends the role enhancement was erroneous because he was an independent wholesale supplier of drugs and there was no evidence he \u201cever had anyone pick up or deliver drugs on his behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, according to the statement of facts provided by the Government at the Rule 11 hearing, Mangual received drugs from Barber by use of a courier, identified as Milton Boyd. During a wiretapped phone conversation, Mangual directed Boyd as to where the delivery was to be made. Boyd was then seen delivering a package, which included five kilograms of cocaine, to Mangual\u2019s residence. On another occasion, Mangual\u2019s girlfriend brought a bag to him in Baltimore that contained $43,500, which Mangual then provided to his supplier, Barber, in order to pay off an existing debt. Based on this evidence, it is clear Mangual directed others to transport money and drugs as part of the ongoing criminal enterprise. <em>See Bartley, </em>230 F.3d at 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Mangual\u2019s relationship with his purchasers is not comparable to the drug dealers in <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 225 (4th Cir.2002), who were involved in hand-to-hand transactions at the street level and were found to have had no role in planning or organizing the drug trafficking. Mangual had two tiers of buyers; some were \u201ccash-and-carry,\u201d while others were \u201cfronted\u201d the drugs, meaning they would receive the drugs up front and pay for it later. In a number of calls with individuals who were fronted cocaine, Mangual discussed payment for the narcotics and expressed his frustration with lingering debts owed to him by the dealers. As is evidenced by his direct involvement in setting payment terms with his buyers, Mangual exercised some level of control over the dealers to whom he provided co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>caine. <em>See Bartley, </em>230 F.3d at 674; <em>United States v. Howard, </em>923 F.2d 1500, 1503 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Mangual\u2019s critical role within the conspiracy is further illustrated by his close relationship with his father. Described by Officer Eveler as his father\u2019s \u201cright-hand man,\u201d Mangual was provided with samples of heroin by his father to carry out product tests and was expected to take over his father\u2019s position within the drug enterprise while Mangual, Sr., was in the hospital. <em>See Brooks, </em>957 F.2d at 1152. Accordingly, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding that Mangual\u2019s role within the conspiracy justified a three-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3331.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Mangual also contends the district court erred in denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. A two-level reduction in the defendant\u2019s offense level is warranted if he clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense. USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2005). An adjustment for acceptance of responsibility does not result automatically from the entry of a guilty plea; rather, in order to receive such a reduction, \u201cthe defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has clearly recognized and affirmatively accepted personal responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 693 (4th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In determining whether an adjustment is warranted, the district court may consider whether the defendant has \u201ctruthfully admitted] the conduct comprising the off\u00e9nse(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitted] or not falsely den[ied] any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">While a defendant may remain silent with respect to conduct beyond the offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction, \u201ca defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s determination is entitled to \u201cgreat deference\u201d because of the sentencing judge\u2019s \u201cunique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 239 (4th Cir.2007) (citing USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">While the PSR recommended a two-level reduction, the Government opposed any adjustment on the ground that Mangual had failed to fully acknowledge his participation in the conspiracy; specifically, his denial of any involvement in heroin distribution. The district court agreed, concluding that, contrary to Mangual\u2019s assertions, his involvement was not limited to a small amount of heroin, as he had received five kilograms of heroin from his father. Mangual contends there is no evidence he \u201cever denied the conduct alleged or the relevant conduct,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that the district court\u2019s determination he received five kilograms of heroin from his father has \u201conly minimal support in the record.\u201d In spite of Mangual\u2019s assertion that he was not personally involved in heroin, the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing indicated that Mangual\u2019s father provided him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>with a sample of heroin, approximately 1.5 grams, to test in order to determine its quality before distribution. Mangual\u2019s father would ultimately receive a total of 14.5 kilograms of heroin during the relevant time period, and his ledger indicated that a total of five kilograms were delivered to Mangual. Therefore, in light of Mangual\u2019s false denials regarding his relevant conduct, we find the district court did not clearly err in denying an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Having found no procedural errors, we next consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. While this court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, we may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) factors justify imposing a variant sentence and to its determination regarding the extent of any variance. \u201cEven if we would have reached a different sentencing result on our own, this fact alone is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">At sentencing, the district court held that the Guidelines recommendation of a life sentence was appropriate. Mangual contends the district court failed to consider the fact that he had pled guilty to all charges and saved the Government significant time and expense. However, a defendant\u2019s timely guilty plea is not a factor that is required to be considered under \u00a7 3553(a). The district court adequately stated its reasons for imposing a life sentence, including the extremely serious nature of the offense, the harm to society caused by the wide-ranging drug conspiracy, Mangual\u2019s significant criminal history, and the need to afford adequate deterrence and protect the public from further criminal offenses. Accordingly, because Mangual has failed to overcome the presumptive reasonableness of his sentence, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing him to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Mangual also claims the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by holding him responsible for drug amounts higher than those set forth in the indictment, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 232, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, this argument is foreclosed by the remedial portion of <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 246, 125 S.Ct. 738. This court has held that, after <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing court must still calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range by making any necessary factual findings under a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Battle, </em>499 F.3d 315, 322-23 (4th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1121, 169 L.Ed.2d 951 (2008); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Accordingly, this claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Mangual\u2019s final claim is the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the enhanced penalty provisions under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because the Government failed to file the required notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. However, this claim is patently frivolous. The required notice was filed on March 21, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the day of the Rule 11 hearing, and at the beginning of the plea hearing, the Government stated for the record that it had filed a notice of its intent to seek an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence. Furthermore, at the sentencing hearing, Mangual conceded that he had received the notice, that he had been previously incarcerated, and that there was no dispute on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Mangual\u2019s sentence. We deny Mangual\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\">.

Mangual also contends the district court failed to determine: (1) whether Riley's possession of the firearm occurred during the commission of the offense or in furtherance of that offense; and (2) whether it was clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. However, Mangual failed to raise either of these objections before the district court. At sentencing, the district court noted that it was \"undisputed\u201d that the firearm was seized in proximity to drugs and cash that were part of the conspiracy. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(I)(3) (\u201cAt sentencing, the court may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.\u201d).
