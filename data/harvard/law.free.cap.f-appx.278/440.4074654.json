Because the district court erred in holding that Scott\u2019s claims are barred by the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine and <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-26\">A Mississippi jury convicted Scott of a crime in August 2001. After filing a notice of appeal, Scott requested that Fortenberry, the trial court reporter, prepare a transcript of the proceedings. After numerous extensions of her deadline to prepare the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>transcript, Fortenberry was sanctioned by the Mississippi Supreme Court in January 2004 for failing to perform her duties. A replacement court reporter finally completed the transcript in July 2004, almost three years after Scott\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Scott filed a civil suit against Fortenberry and her insurance carrier, alleging that the delay of his criminal appeal caused by Fortenberry\u2019s failure to prepare the trial transcript violated his due process rights. The district court dismissed Scott\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction with prejudice <em>sua sponte, </em>holding that they were barred by both the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine and <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). As Scott argues on appeal, the district court\u2019s ruling was incorrect. Scott\u2019s complaint seeks damages resulting from a court reporter\u2019s failure to prepare a trial transcript; it does not seek review of his criminal conviction or any other state court order. Accordingly, the <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>doctrine, which provides that \u201cfederal district courts, as courts of original jurisdiction, lack appellate jurisdiction to review, modify, or nullify final orders of state courts,\u201d is inapplicable. <em>Weekly v. Morrow, </em>204 F.3d 613, 615 (5th Cir.2000). Likewise, Scott\u2019s complaint does not implicate <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>as a judgment in his favor would not \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d 512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of Scott\u2019s complaint on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Our standard for evaluating Scott\u2019s claims is properly set forth in a case he cites on appeal: \u201c[D]ue process can be denied by any substantial retardation of the appellate process, including an excessive delay in the furnishing of a transcription of testimony necessary for completion of an appellate record.\u201d <em>Rheuark v. Shaw, </em>628 F.2d 297, 302 (5th Cir.1980). To determine whether such a delay violates due process, the court must examine four factors: (1) length of delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 303 n. 8. There are three main types of potential prejudice that may result from appellate delay: (1) extended oppressive incarceration pending appeal; (2) the anxiety and concern of the convicted party awaiting the outcome of the appeal; and (3) impairment of the convicted party\u2019s grounds for appeal or the viability of his defenses in the event of retrial. <em>Id. </em>We express no view on how the district court should evaluate and apply this standard on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. Because the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal was based on the lack of jurisdiction on the face of the complaint, we accept Scott\u2019s factual allegations as true for purposes of our analysis. <em>See Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 412 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
