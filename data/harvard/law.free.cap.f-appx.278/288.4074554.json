On appeal, we determined that the district court improperly enhanced Dugger\u2019s offense level by two levels based on his sale of illegal drugs while in prison. We vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The district court conducted a resentencing hearing and sentenced Dugger to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. He again appeals, contending that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3558(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) factors in determining his sentence. We disagree and therefore affirm Dugger\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Appellate courts review sentences imposed by district courts for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007) (discussing procedure district courts must follow in sentencing defendant). Here, the district court properly calculated the guideline range and correctly treated the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Dugger contends that the court did not consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court \u201cneed not robotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d but should \u201cprovide [this Court] an assurance that the sentencing court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with regard to the particular defendant. ...\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007). Here, the district court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stated that the 97-month sentence \u201creflects the nature and circumstance of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the needs for deterrence.\u201d The court also stated that it found no basis for a departure. We find that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Further, we find that the 97-month sentence, which is the bottom of the advisory guideline range, and well below the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2007), is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (applying presumption of correctness to within-guideline sentence); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness of within-guideline sentence). Accordingly, we affirm Dugger\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
