This argument is meritless \u2014 none of the statutes Voinche cites impose such duties on the Inspector General or members of Congress. Moreover, the doctrines of sovereign immunity, official immunity, and legislative immunity foreclose Voinche\u2019s lawsuit against the Inspector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>General and the Congressmen for their alleged failure to investigate his claims. The district court\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
