In their brief, Petitioners assert that the deadline for filing their motion to reopen should have been equitably tolled because their appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision was dismissed due to ineffective assistance of counsel, and they filed their motion to reopen within 90 days of discovering such ineffective assistance. Petitioners also contend that the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion to reopen violated their right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen proceedings for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). This review is limited to determining whether the BIA has exercised discretion and whether \u201cthe matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-22\">An alien may file a motion to reopen if the motion states new facts that would be proven at a hearing and if those facts are supported by affidavits or other evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). A motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Abdi, </em>we considered whether the alien\u2019s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, filed after the 90-day deadline in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), could be equitably tolled. 430 F.3d at 1148-49. We concluded that the 90-day filing deadline is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Having reviewed the record in this case, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as time-barred; nor did the BIA deny Petitioners due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-23\">.

The regulations provide for four statutory exceptions to the 90-day filing deadline, but these exceptions are not at issue or relevant here. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
