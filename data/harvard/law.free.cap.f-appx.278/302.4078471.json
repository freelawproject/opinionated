Marin-Soto argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, based on the determination that his 1998 Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes a crime of violence. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>As Marin-Soto recognizes, this court has already held that a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), the statute of his previous conviction, is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454 (5th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, Marin-Soto argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1599-1600, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), overrules this circuit\u2019s precedent. In <em>James, </em>the Supreme Court noted in dicta that because the Florida burglary statute at issue criminalizes the mere unlawful entry onto the curtilage of a structure, rather than entry into the structure itself, the statute contemplates conduct beyond \u201cgeneric burglary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1599. This, however, was not the holding of <em>James; </em>the Court was confronted not with the issue of whether burglary in Florida constitutes an enumerated offense under a Guidelines enhancement provision, but rather whether that offense constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1590; <em>see also United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 (5th Cir.) (\u201cThe analysis in <em>James </em>... does not concern enumerated offenses and pertains only to a residual provision in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) ____\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 .U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 156, 169 L.Ed.2d 106 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Even applying the dicta in <em>James, </em>Marin-Soto\u2019s argument fails. Unlike Florida\u2019s burglary statute, \u201chabitation\u201d under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) does not include the curtilage surrounding the habitable structure. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30.01(1); <em>St. Julian v. State, </em>874 S.W.2d 669, 671 (Tex.Crim.App.1994). As such, the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in <em>James </em>does not undermine our conclusion in <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>that a violation of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as that phrase is generieally used.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Marin-Soto challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
