Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b635-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Ralph Chahoc was injured while employed by Hunt Shipyard in its Drydock No. 4 making repairs to Ingram Contractor, Inc.\u2019s Dredge No. 4. He died after bringing suit below and his wife was substituted as plaintiff, individually and for the benefit of two minor children of the couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">Chahoc, with three co-workers was carrying a heavy steel knuckle plate across the dry dock deck to be welded to the dredge when he slipped and fell, receiving severe injuries. The suit seeking recovery in addition to that allowed under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, asserted a \u201cYaka\u201d seaman\u2019s <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim by alleging that Chahoc\u2019s injuries and subsequent death were caused by mud on the deck, resulting from the unseaworthy condition of the dry dock and the employer\u2019s negligence, contending that the dry dock was an employer-owned vessel. The court below granted the motion for summary judgment of Hunt Shipyard and its insurer, Insurance Company of North America, relying upon our decision in Atkins v. Greenville Shipbuilding Corporation, 5 Cir. 1969, 411 F.2d 279, cert. denied 396 U.S. 846, 90 S.Ct. 105, 24 L.Ed.2d 96 (1969), for the proposition that, as a matter of law, a floating dry dock is not a \u201cvessel\u201d when it is moored and in use as a dry dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">We accept as correct appellant\u2019s contention that a floating dry dock may under some circumstances be a vessel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless we conclude that under the circumstances here as under those present in <em>Atkins, </em>supra, the equipment in question was not a vessel while moored to the bank and operated as a dry dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">It therefore becomes unnecessary for us to determine the existence vel non of the other elements requisite to recovery under Reed v. Yaka: (a) whether Chahoc was doing work traditionally performed by seamen and (b) whether there are present here the factors which compelled the Supreme Court to ignore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>literal language of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in <em>Yaka. </em>Further, we are not disposed to reverse <em>Atkins, </em>as appellant suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">We find no error in the granting of summary judgment by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-16\">.
