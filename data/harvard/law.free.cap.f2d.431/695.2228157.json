After jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, appellee was awarded damages of $46,917.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-22\"> There is no basis in law for appellant\u2019s assignment of errors. Substantial performance of the terms of the agreement by the parties, and appellee\u2019s reliance thereon, preclude the defense based on the Statute of Frauds. Damages were properly calculated to recompense appellee for reasonable foreseeable losses. Finally, the issue of representation of authority to extend the line of credit by the bank president was properly left to the jury. The jury verdict in favor of the appellee is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
