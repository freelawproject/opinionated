Kenan, 420 F.2d 55 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">The matter was determined by the district court with the assent of the parties, based upon the respondent\u2019s return to an order to show cause. The return included all the records upon which the district court based its findings and conclusions. The case does not, therefore, involve the usual appellate review where deference must be given to the fact finding process of the trial courts. Costello v. Fazio, 256 F.2d 903 (9th Cir. 1958); Brown v. Cowden Livestock Co., 187 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-14\">The district court determined that the case was factually distinguishable from <em>Beaty. </em>We hold that the distinctions cannot remove this case from <em>Beaty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-15\">The record reveals that on September 4, 1969, after petitioner reported for duty, his father was informed by the Army officer investigating the matter, that he, the officer, thought that the petitioner had made a reasonable effort to let the Army know where he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-16\">The respondent contends that petitioner\u2019s lack of good faith is illustrated because (1) petitioner\u2019s father kept a record of letters and telephone conversations of petitioner\u2019s contacts with the Army, and (2) petitioner reported at the Presidio of San Francisco only two days before his discharge date. In <em>Beaty </em>no such records were kept and Beaty reported five weeks after his original termination date. The distinctions are <em>de minimus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-17\">The order denying the writ is vacated, the writ is granted, and the mandate ordered to be issued forthwith by the clerk.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
