It was charged (1) that he represented National Scholarship Foundation to be an established organization; (2) a non-profit concern; (3) with responsible trustees; (4) that scholarships ranging in value from $250 to $5,000 were to be awarded to \u201cany high school student\u201d from registered high schools; (5) that the $25.00 registration fee was to defray cost of materials to be furnished to each school; (6) that: \u201cBoth private and corporate donors have joined to help educate America. Won\u2019t you help us? Join the National Scholarship Foundation. We urgently need your support.\u201d (See Ex. 5)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-25\">Appellant urges fifteen grounds of error, six relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to convict, or the admissibility of certain evidence; others relating to the conduct, language and participation by the trial judge in the trial; one to allege improper argument of government counsel, and one to the trial court\u2019s denial of probation. A careful consideration of the 42 Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ment exhibits (many containing several pages), the defendant\u2019s 23 exhibits, and the over 1,000 pages of testimony, convinces us that there was sufficient evidence of fraud to require that the case go to the jury; whose verdict is final on disputed factual issues. While there was some technical error in connection with two matters of evidence, we have concluded, in overall consideration, that the error was not so prejudicial as to require reversal. The appellant\u2019s last point (denial of probation) is not a matter with which we can be concerned in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
