The Barge, together with Barge Red Star No. 72 and Barge Red Star No. 73 were being towed by the <em>Tug Catherine. </em>The two first-named barges, loaded, were on the tug\u2019s starboard side, one behind the other, and were held to have been damaged in the collision. The <em>Osmena </em>also suffered damage. No. 73, light, was on the tug\u2019s port side and was not found to have been damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-23\">The owners of the barges filed their libel against the tug and its owners and the <em>Osmena </em>and its operator. The owner and operator of the <em>Osmena </em>in a separate proceeding filed their libel against the tug and its owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-24\">The two proceedings were consolidated below and, after hearing, Judge Bonsai in a careful opinion held that the <em>Tug Catherine </em>was at fault and that her fault was the sole cause of the collision. Damages were awarded against the owners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>of the tug for the loss found to have been suffered by the owners of barges 70 and 72 and an award was made to the owner and operator of the <em>Osmena </em>for the damages occasioned to the <em>Osmena.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The <em>Catherine </em>appeals in each case and the two appeals were consolidated for action in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The barge owners cross-appealed in their case against the <em>Catherine. </em>They maintain that the damage award to them was inadequate, for the district court denied their claims to be recompensed for alleged business losses caused by the detention of the barges following the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">We agree with the results reached by the judge below and we affirm the judgment entered in the district court on Judge Bonsai\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
