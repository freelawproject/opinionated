Jurisdiction is conferred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court not only abstained, but disinissed the complaint on the ground that a remedy was available to the plaintiffs in the Texas courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is not the law. \u201cThe fact that a state remedy is available is not a valid basis for federal court abstention.\u201d Hargrave v. Kirk, M.D.Fla.1970, 313 F.Supp. 944. (Dyer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>J., for the three-judge court). Here, the plaintiff alleges that against a background of prejudice against Mexican-Americans he was deprived of his rights to freedom of speech and petition and association; that he was discharged as a result of proceedings lacking in due process; that the city regulation under which he was discharged for \u201cconduct prejudicial to good order\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is unconstitutional on its face for overbreadth and vagueness. This action is one that is peculiarly appropriate for recognition of a litigant\u2019s right to choose a federal forum in which to litigate denial of federal rights. \u201cCivil rights [cases] are the least likely candidates for abstention.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And as Judge Dyer said in <em>Hargrove, </em>\u201cIn such a case it is the duty of a federal court to exercise its jurisdiction\u201d. Monroe v. Pape, 1961, 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492; McNeese v. Board of Education, 1963, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622; and Zwickler v. Koota, 1967, 389 U.S. 241, 251, 88 S.Ct. 391, 19 L.Ed.2d 444, the three decisions principally relied on in <em>Hargrove, </em>control this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">The City of San Antonio employed Gilbert Moreno October 7, 1968, as a security guard at the HemisFair Plaza, a city-operated World\u2019s Fair. His position entitled him to civil service status under a city ordinance. During the spring of 1969 the guards, many of whom were Mexican-American, became dissatisfied with some of the working conditions at the Plaza. The complaint alleges, and the Civil Service Commission later found, that the City had never informed Moreno of any procedure for redress of grievances. Moreno and another guard therefore went to Erasmo Andrade, a private citizen who is the head of the Federation For the Advancement of Mexican-Americans, for advice on how to make known their grievances to the City. On Andrade\u2019s advice, Moreno circulated two petitions among the twenty-four guards. The first demanded the immediate dismissal of Captain William Martin as head of the Security Guards because, among other reasons, he discriminated against \u201cminority groups when promoting employees into higher paying and responsible positions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>The second petition was similar to the first except that it demanded the dismissal of the Assistant Director of Convention and Municipal Facilities. Moreno alleged that he gave every guard a full opportunity to read the petitions and informed each man that the petitions would be submitted to the City Council; the petitions were addressed \u201cTO THE CITY COUNCIL\u201d. On July 3 Andrade presented the petitions to the Council \u201cin an orderly fashion\u201d, according to the stipulation. On July 9 Moreno received a letter from the Director of Convention and Municipal Facilities informing him that he had been dismissed for \u201cconduct prejudicial to good order\u201d. Specifically the letter charged Moreno with (1) \u201cvoluntarily seeking and securing the outside aid and influence of one Erasmo An-drade who has no official connection with the Government of the City of San Antonio or the administration of its personnel\u201d; (2) having \u201ccirculated among [his] fellow employees a petition or petitions listing alleged grievances and requesting the dismissal of such supervisors\u201d; (3) having \u201cmisrepresented the nature and objective of the petitions by leading [the fellow guards] to believe that the purpose * * * was to secure for them a hearing with the Security Guards Captain\u201d; (4) and having \u201csurrendered possession of the petitions to Erasmo Andrade who thereafter presented them to the City Council\u201d. The letter states that \u201call of [these actions] were contrary to the grievance procedures of the City of San Antonio\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-12\">The letter of dismissal advised Moreno that the Civil Service Committee would give him a hearing if he requested one. On his request, the Commission conducted a hearing<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at the conclusion of which the Commission by a two to nothing vote found \u201cthere is but a mere scintilla of evidence to support the charges against the petition\u201d that he had \u201cmisled his fellow employees into signing something other than as contained in the petition\u201d and, moreover, he had no knowledge of established Grievance Procedures. The Commission concluded that it was unnecessary to base its decision on Moreno\u2019s First Amendment rights. It recommended that he be reinstated to his former classified position as a Security Guard of the HemisFair Grounds. The Commission\u2019s decisions however are advisory only; the decision-making power rests with the City Manager, under Personnel Rules for the City of San Antonio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-13\">On August 15, 1969, Gerald C. Henck-el, City Manager, rejected the Commission\u2019s recommendation and upheld Moreno\u2019s dismissal. Henekel was not present at the Commission\u2019s hearing. His letter to the Civil Service Commission sustaining the action of the Direc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>tor of Municipal Facilities states that he based his decision on the evidence presented at the hearing and \u201cother evidence not submitted at the hearing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">Moreno then filed this action under Section 1983. He named as defendants G. C. Henckel, City Manager and F. W. Vickers, Director of Convention and Municipal Facilities, each individually and in his official capacity; and the City of San Antonio. He asked for an injunction ordering his reinstatement without loss of pay and without loss of seniority and other employment benefits; $50,000 in damages; and a declaratory judgment declaring that the defendants\u2019 actions were unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff and that the City regulations upon which they are premised are unconstitutional on their face. After a hearing, preceded by the parties\u2019 stipulating to the facts, the district court dismissed the complaint. In the order of dismissal the court stated that an \u201cadequate state court review of an administrative order is available to plaintiff\u201d and, \u201cbearing in mind the usual rule of comity, this is a proper case for the application of the abstention doctrine\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">We note, initially, that the district judge failed to take into account the First Amendment. From the bench he stated his understanding that \u201cin this case plaintiff is claiming that his constitutional right of due process was violated\u201d. Again, in his order dismissing the cause, he stated that \u201cthis case involves a claim that plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right of due process was violated\u201d. Procedural due process is involved, for it is undisputed that the City Manager decided Moreno\u2019s case partly on evidence that was not brought forward at the Civil Service Commission hearing. But the main thrust of the plaintiff\u2019s case derives from the First Amendment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The important issue is whether the plaintiff can be compelled to assert First Amendment Rights in state courts before being allowed access to a federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-15\">The district court based its holding on the mistaken theory that the plaintiff cannot choose a federal forum for assertion of federal rights if a state remedy is available. He is not alone in this error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>Section 1983, as it now reads, is substantially unchanged from a provision of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, sometimes called \u201cthe third force bill\u201d. Congress debated the law at length. There is no doubt that the law was aimed at southern states where remedies were nonexistent or inadequate for Negroes or Northerners asserting civil rights under the Civil War Amendments. There is also no doubt Congress fully understood that the statute extended federal authority over matters previously within the exclusive jurisdiction of state courts. In Monroe v. Pape the Supreme Court carefully considered the legislative history of \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court found \u201cthreads of many thoughts running through the debates\u201d, but that \u201cthe section had three main aims\u201d. First, \u201cit might, of course, override certain kinds of state laws\u201d, that is, \u201cinvidious legislation by States against the rights or privileges of citizens of the United States\u201d. Second, \u201cit provided a remedy where state law was inadequate\u201d. \u201cThe <em>third </em>aim was to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\"><em>The significant fact is that Monroe v. Pape does not come within any of the \u201cthree main aims\u201d. </em>In that case Chicago police officers, without a warrant, broke into the plaintiff\u2019s home and subjected him to various abuses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">The Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Douglas, did not say or imply that the state procedures or courts in Illinois were inadequate to afford redress. What the court did say, 365 U.S. at 183, 81 S.Ct. at 482, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-12\">Although the legislation was enacted because of the conditions that existed in the South at that time, it is cast in general language and is as applicable to Illinois as it is to the States whose names were mentioned over and again in the debates. It is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced would give relief. The federal remedy is <em>supplementary </em>to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked. Hence the fact that Illinois by its constitution and laws outlaws searches and seizures is no barrier to the present suit in the federal court. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">This supplementary function of the act is a fourth main aim or perhaps an overriding purpose inherent in the general terms of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-14\">A statute cast in general terms is not limited to effectuating only the specific purposes that brought it into being. The Fourteenth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>itself, on which the Ku Klux Act was based, came into being to protect Negroes<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> against discrimination. Of course, its applicability cannot now be limited to deprivations of rights involving discrimination against Negroes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 1979 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (now \u00a7 1988) was enacted under authority of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, debated within the context of the Fourteenth Amendment, and entitled \u201can Act to Enforce the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d. But there is no doubt that First Amendment rights and other federal constitutional rights incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment come within the ambit of Section 1983.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATip\">Whatever this senator or that senator may have said in the debates, the language of the act is unqualified and provides no basis for a judge-made limitation requiring exhaustion of state remedies. The act was not one artfully phrased so as <em>not </em>to disturb the relationship between the States and the Nation. If there is one thing certain about the legislative history of the Act, it is that Congress, open-eyed, deliberately set out to alter the so-called \u201cdelicate balance\u201d between the state and the federal government so that federal courts could effectively protect federal rights.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">The necessary effect of \u00a7 1983 is to make federal courts accessible for the protection of federal personal rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Without it, one would find it difficult to explain to the Mexican-American plaintiff in this case that rights which come to him in the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment cannot, in the first instance, be protected in the federal courts. It is beside the point to say that federal question jurisdiction did not exist until 1875,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> or that state courts are as competent as federal courts to construe the constitution and to give appropriate relief. Congress, in unqualified terms, has provided a federal forum for civil wrongs of constitutional dimensions and for violations of specific civil rights laws. \u201cIn * * * expanding federal judicial power [after the Civil War], Congress imposed the duty upon all levels of federal judiciary to give due respect to a suitor\u2019s choice of a federal forum for the hearing and decision of his federal constitutional claims.\u201d <em>Zwickler, </em>389 U.S. at 245-249, 88 S.Ct. at 395, 19 L.Ed.2d 444. When Congress has intended to limit federal jurisdiction' by requiring exhaustion of state judicial remedies, it has done so in explicit language. For example, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (habeas corpus for state prisoners) ; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342 (state rate orders); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (state taxes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">In McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622, Negroes in an Illinois school district requested a federal court to order integration according to an approved plan. The Seventh Circuit affirmed a dismissal of the complaint for failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust remedies under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>state education law. The Supreme Court gave short shrift to the notion that relief under \u00a7 1983 may be defeated because of a plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies. Mr. Justice Douglas again wrote for the Court. Significantly, after listing \u201cthe three main aims\u201d referred to in Monroe v. Pape, he added, 372 U.S. 672, 83 S.Ct. 1435:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFC\"><em>and </em>to provide a remedy in the federal courts supplementary to any remedy any State might have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">The opinion continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-5\">We would defeat those purposes if we held that assertion of a federal claim in a federal court must await an attempt to vindicate the same claim in a state court. The First Congress created federal courts as the chief\u2014 though not always the exclusive \u2014 tribunals for enforcement of federal rights. The heads of jurisdiction of the District Court, at the start limited, are now numerous. * * * j[ As the beneficiaries of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments became articulate and the nationalist needs multiplied, the heads of jurisdiction of the District Courts increased, and that increase was a measure of the broadening federal domain in the area of individual rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">373 U.S. at 672, 83 S.Ct. at 1436.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">In Damico v. California, 1967, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed.2d 647, 648, the plaintiffs challenged a rule under the California Aid to Dependent Children program which required a three months waiting period after the father\u2019s desertion before benefits could be received. The plaintiffs sued under the Civil Rights Act (\u00a7 1983) for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages. A three-judge court dismissed the complaint for failure of the plaintiffs to exhaust adequate state administrative remedies. In a one paragraph per curiam opinion the Supreme Court reversed, treating the question as one governed by settled law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-9\">* * * The three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint solely because \u201cit appear [ed] to the Court that all of the plaintiffs [had] failed to exhaust . adequate administrative remedies.\u201d This was error. In McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622, noting that one of the purposes underlying the Civil Rights Act was \u201cto provide a remedy in the federal courts supplementary to any remedy any State might have,\u201d id., at 672, 83 S.Ct. [1433] at 1435 [10 L.Ed.2d at 625], we held that \u201crelief under the Civil Rights Act may not be defeated because relief was not first sought under state law which provided [an administrative] remedy,\u201d id., at 671, 83 S.Ct. [1433] at 1435 [10 L.Ed.2d at 625]. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 180-183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, [501].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1364-11\">389 U.S. 416 at 417, 88 S.Ct. 526 at 527, 19 L.Ed.2d 647, at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-12\">In Houghton v. Shafer, 1968, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319, a state prisoner alleged that prison authorities had violated \u00a7 1983 by depriving him of legal materials which he was using to prepare an appeal. The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that state administrative remedies had not been exhausted. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed. The Court noted that resort to these remedies would be to demand a futile act, because the prison rules were strictly enforced throughout the entire Pennsylvania correctional system. But the Court did not rest its holding on that ground. The Court said: \u201cIn any event, resort to these remedies is unnecessary in light of our decisions in Monroe v. Pape, McNeese v. Board of Education, and Damico v. California.\u201d (citations omitted). 392 U.S. at 640, 88 S.Ct. at 2120.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-13\"><em>McNeese, Damico, </em>and <em>Houghton </em>are strong authority for the appellant\u2019s position, for in these cases the Court applied the <em>Monroe </em>holding to state <em>administrative </em>remedies. There are good reasons in favor of requiring exhaustion of ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>ministrative remedies which are not applicable to exhaustion of state judicial remedies.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, Moreno did all he could do administratively. He knew nothing about grievance procedures. He requested and received a civil service hearing. After his dismissal by the City Manager, he was forced to choose between one court and another court to decide his rights under the Civil Rights Act. He made the natural choice. His case turns upon federal rights of a particularly high order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">There is a strong national interest in preserving rights derived from national citizenship and in adjudicating expeditiously these cases without intervening delays incident to a first testing in state courts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In recognition of this interest, Congress unqualifiedly vested federal courts with jurisdiction to try Moreno\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">The district court dismissed the complaint on the assumption of a necessary relationship between exhaustion of state <em>judicial </em>remedies and the abstention doctrine. But exhaustion of state remedies as a prerequisite to considering a case on the merits is a jurisdictional or a pseudo-jurisdictional requirement. On the other hand, the abstention doctrine assumes that the court has jurisdiction, that is, that there is no general rule forbidding the court to act absent exhaustion of state judicial remedies. If there were such a general rule the Supreme Court would not limit the application of the doctrine to special circumstances. The abstention doctrine is an exception to the litigant\u2019s choice of forum, applied \u201conly in narrowly limited, \u2018special circumstances\u2019.\u201d <em>Zwickler, </em>389 U.S. at 248, 88 S.Ct. at 395, 19 L.Ed.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-15\">In an important study of federal courts, the authors observed that when Congress conferred federal jurisdiction on federal courts under the Act of March 3, 1875,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-16\">Congress gave the federal courts the vast range of power which had lain dormant in the Constitution since 1789. These courts ceased to be restricted tribunals of fair dealing between citizens of different states and became the <em>primary </em>and powerful reli-ances for vindicating every right giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>en by the Constitution, the laws, and treaties of the United States.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-4\">The Supreme Court quoted this statement with approval in Zwickler v. Koota, 1967, 389 U.S. at 247, 88 S.Ct. 391, then referred to \u00a7 1983, and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-5\">The judge-made doctrine of abstention, first fashioned in 1941 in Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971, sanctions such escape only in narrowly limited \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d Propper v. Clark, 337 U.S. 472, 492, 69 S.Ct. 1333, 1344, 93 L.Ed. 1480, [1496]. One of the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d\u2014 that thought by the District Court to be present in this case \u2014 is the susceptibility of a state statute of a construction by the state courts that would avoid or modify the constitutional question. Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152. Compare Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377. But we have here no question of a construction of \u00a7 781-b that would \u201cavoid or modify the constitutional question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">389 U.S. at 250, 88 S.Ct. at 395-396. Here too we have no construction of any statute or ordinance that would modify the first amendment questions and, as in <em>Zwickler, </em>the ordinance is attacked as overbroad. The Court added: \u201cThese principles have particular significance when, as in this case, the attack upon the statute on its face is for repugnancy to the First Amendment, In such case to force the plaintiff who has commenced a federal action to suffer the delay of state court proceedings might itself effect the impermissible chilling of the very constitutional right he seeks to protect.\u201d 389 U.S. at 252, 88 S.Ct. at 397-398.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">In the most recent abstention case in the Supreme Court Mr. Justice Douglas, writing for a unanimous court, declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-9\">* * * Abstention certainly involves duplication of effort and expense and an attendant delay. See England v. Louisiana State Board, 375 U.S. 411, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440. That is why we have said that this judicially created rule which stems from Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971, should be applied only where \u201cthe issue of state law is uncertain.\u201d Har-man v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 534, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 1182, 14 L.Ed.2d 50. Moreover, we said in Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 248, 88 S.Ct. 391, 395, 19 L.Ed.2d 444, that abstention was applicable \u201conly in narrowly limited \u2018special circumstances,\u2019 \u201d, citing Propper v. Clark, 337 U.S. 472, 492, 69 S.Ct. 1333, 1344, 93 L.Ed. 1480. In <em>Zwickler, </em>a state statute was attacked on the ground that on its face it was repugnant to the First Amendment; and it was conceded that state court construction could not render unnecessary a decision of the First Amendment question. 389 U.S., at 250, 88 S.Ct. 391.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1366-12\">Reetz v. Bozanich, 1970, 397 U.S. 82, 90 S.Ct. 788, 25 L.Ed.2d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-13\">The questions in this case are <em>all </em>federal questions. The plaintiff\u2019s primary contention is that he was deprived of his First Amendment rights. His secondary contention is that he was deprived of procedural due process. For good measure, the plaintiff also alleges that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the City regulations upon which the complaint is predicated are over-broad and therefore unconstitutional on their face. In substance, therefore, there are no state issues, no issues more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>appropriately decided by state courts than by federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Mr. Justice Harlan, in a concurring opinion in <em>Zwickler </em>has pointed out that the Supreme Court has approved abstention in situations when \u201cthe federal constitutional issue might be mooted or \u2018presented in a different posture\u2019 by a state court determination of pertinent state law.\u201d Or \u201cin situations in which the exercise of jurisdiction by a federal court would disrupt a state administrative process; interfere with the collection of state taxes, or otherwise create \u2018needless friction\u2019 between the enforcement of state and federal policies\u201d. 389 U.S. at 455, 456, 88 S.Ct. at 400. The present situation is within none of these categories. There are no pending administrative proceedings to disrupt. There are no legal proceedings pending or about to be brought in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">Even when criminal proceedings may be brought or have been brought in state courts, abstention serves no legitimate purpose when the state action has a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on First Amendment rights. Dombrowski v. Pfister, 1965, 380 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22. That case involved protection of the rights of free speech and free association. The court was concerned not only for Dombrowski but for all others who might be intimidated by the irremediable threat of groundless prosecution of Dombrowski for asserting his First Amendment rights. Here a groundless discharge of one of the Mexican-American guards for protesting against discrimination would have a chilling effect upon all city employees and especially upon the twenty-four HemisFair Security Guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">We stand with Chief Judge Murrah of the Tenth Circuit :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1367-8\">We yet like to believe that wherever the Federal courts sit, human rights under the Federal Constitution are always a proper subject for adjudication, and that we have not the right to decline the exercise of that jurisdiction simply because the rights asserted may be adjudicated in some other forum.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">Stapleton v. Mitchell, D.C., 60 F.Supp. 51, 55, app. dismd. per stipulation Mitchell v. McElroy, 326 U.S. 690, 66 S.Ct. 172, 90 L.Ed. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-13\">Under Monroe v. Pape no action for damages will lie against a municipality for acts committed in performance of its governmental functions. The City of San Antonio\u2019s immunity from liability of damages, however, does not affect the declaratory and injunctive relief, nor the possible liability of the individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-14\">We follow <em>Zwickler </em>in holding that the district court has the duty to decide the appropriateness and the merits of the declaratory request irrespective of its conclusion as to the propriety of the issuance of the injunction. Should the appellant\u2019s prayer for declaratory relief prevail, it will be the task of the district court on remand to decide whether an injunction will be necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-15\">We express no view with respect to the appropriateness of declaratory relief in the circumstances of this case and with respect to the constitutionality of the acts alleged to have deprived the plaintiff of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights or of the constitutional validity of the allegedly overbroad ordinance of the City of San Antonio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-16\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1358-14\">.

In the instant case the Court\u2019s order does state that the dismissal is \u201cwithout prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to request that this cause be reinstated in the event the State Courts refuse, upon the filing of a proper petition therein, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>to consider the constitutional questions raised, or delay a decision in connection therewith for an inordinate length of time\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">.

Pullman Co., supra, [312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941)], it is reasonable to conclude that cases involving vital questions of civil rights are the least likely candidates for abstention, e. g.

The danger is unhappily not past. It would be moving in the wrong direction to reduce the jurisdiction in this field \u2014 not because the interest of the state is smaller in such cases, but because its interest is outweighed by other factors of the highest national concern.

The rationale for this distinction is that until the administrative process is complete, it cannot be certain that the party will need judicial relief, but when the case becomes appropriate for judicial determination, he may choose whether he wishes to resort to a state or federal court for such relief. * * * \u201d Wright, Federal Courts (2nd Ed. 1970), p. 187.

To contend that such an approach disregards the proper distributor of responsibility under the federal system is to ignore a trend toward increasing judicial sensitivity to the desirability of providing an expeditious remedy for the protection of federal rights. Furthermore, if the plaintiff is required to proceed first through the state agency, there is a danger that the agency proceedings will terminate in an individual settlement which satisfies the complaint, but neither changes the rule nor subjects it to external scrutiny. Where this happens, others who, because of fear, ignorance, or lack of resources, fail to mount challenges of their own, continue to be governed by a rule of questionable constitutionality.\u201d Note, Exhaustion of State Remedies Under the Civil Rights Act, 68 Colum.L.Rev. 1201, 1208 (1968).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1365-18\">.
