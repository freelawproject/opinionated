Pursley attacks the sentence levied upon him for theft of postage stamps and cash from a post office substation in a department store.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The grand jury indicted and the district court convicted Pursley of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, the general statute for theft of Government property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursley contends that he violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1707, which prohibits theft of \u201cany property used by the Post Office Department\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>nificance of the distinction is that \u00a7 641 permits a maximum of ten years imprisonment \u2014 received by Pursley \u2014 whereas \u00a7 1707 permits a maximum penalty of only three years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Generally in statutory construction, the specific takes precedence over the general. The predecessor of \u00a7 1707 applied to property \u201cin use by or belonging to the Post-Office Department\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, \u00a7 190, 35 Stat. 1124. It was this language that caused the Eighth Circuit in Robinson v. United States, 8 Cir. 1944, 142 F.2d 431, to conclude that the three-year penalty preempted the ten-year penalty for theft of cash. The <em>Robinson </em>court was unwilling to assume that Congress gratuitously enacted the predecessor of \u00a7 1707. It was more logical to believe that the predecessor of \u00a7 641 was a general provision that covered the gaps left by specific statutes such as \u00a7 1707. <em>Robinson </em>quoted the language from United States v. Chase, 1890, 135 U.S. 255, 10 S.Ct. 756, 34 L.Ed. 117, 119, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-5\">[i]t is an old and familiar rule that, \u201cwhere there is, in the same statute, a particular enactment, and also a general one, which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.\u201d This rule applies wherever an Act contains general provisions and also special ones upon a subject, which, standing alone, the general provisions would include.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">But Congress has revised the criminal code since the <em>Robinson </em>decision. In this revision, Congress substituted the language \u201cused by\u201d for the language \u201cin use by or belonging to\u201d in \u00a7 1707. Thus, the statute now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-11\">Whoever steals, purloins, or embezzles any property used by the Post Office Department, or appropriates any such property to his own or any other than its proper use, or conveys away any such property to the hindrance or detriment of the public service, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">According to the Reviser\u2019s Notes, the substitution took place \u201cin order to limit the application of the section [1707] to property <em>used by </em>the Post Office Department. Theft of public property <em>belonging to </em>governmental departments is covered by section 641 of this title\u201d. H.R.Rep.No.304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. A117 (1947) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">Thus, Congress has distinguished ownership from use with regard to these criminal prosecutions. The grand jury here indicted Pursley on charges of theft of postage stamps and cash. We have no doubt that these items <em>belonged to </em>the Post Office, a department of the United States, and were not simply <em>used by </em>it. Therefore, we conclude that the indictment under \u00a7 641 was proper and should stand. <em>See </em>United States v. Leeman, D. Neb.1967, 287 F.Supp. 279, aff\u2019d, 8 Cir. 1968, 398 F.2d 835, cert. denied, 1969, 393 U.S. 1035, 89 S.Ct. 653, 21 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>580; <em>cf. </em>Conerly v. United States, 9 Cir. 1965, 350 F.2d 679, 680-683.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1019-18\">.

We observe also that the Supreme Court in Jolly v. United States, 1898, 170 U.S. 402, 18 S.Ct. 624, 42 L.Ed. 1085, sustained a conviction for theft of postage stamps under the predecessor of \u00a7 641. It does not appear, however, that the Court was there presented with the issue whether the predecessor of \u00a7 1707 should take precedence in such cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
