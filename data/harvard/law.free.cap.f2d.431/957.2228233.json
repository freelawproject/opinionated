Taylor, United States District Judge for the District of Idaho, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1015-19\">MERRILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1015-20\">Local Union 89 brought this suit for declaratory relief under \u00a7 301(a) of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), seeking judgment establishing that the collective bargaining contract to which the Union and appellant Telephone Company are parties includes within its coverage the category of company employees designated as \u201ctraffic supervisors.\u201d Judgment was for the Union and the company has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-21\">The contract was dated July 16, 1966, with a two-year term. \u201cTraffic supervisors\u201d were included within its coverage. In 1967, pursuant to what it designated as its \u201cGroup Chief Operators Plan,\u201d the Telephone Company assigned new duties to its traffic supervisors, including the interviewing of applicants for positions, the making of hiring and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>motion recommendations, the disciplining of employees and the reassignment of work functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The company, taking the position that with the new duties the old category of traffic supervisors ceased to be \u201cemployees\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and became \u201csupervisors\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(H),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sought an agreement from the Union expressly excluding the category from coverage of the contract. The Union refused. The company then petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a unit clarification and secured a Board determination that the traffic supervisors, with their new duties, were \u201csupervisors\u201d within the meaning of the Act and thus were excluded from the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union. The company then ceased deducting Union dues for these supervisors and instituted a new salary schedule for them. The Union unsuccessfully filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board, asserting refusal to bargain. This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The District Court found that notwithstanding the fact that the Act did not require inclusion of the supervisors within the contract coverage, the parties, on reaching their agreement in July, 1966, intended that they be included and that they were included within the agreement. Judgment accordingly was rendered for the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The court\u2019s disposition of the case thus did not reflect upon the Board\u2019s determination. If traffic supervisors, with their new duties assigned, remained within the coverage of the contract it was not by virtue of law; it was not by virtue of the Union\u2019s representational authority. Rather it was because the parties had agreed to this effect. At issue before the court, then, was a dispute as to the interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">Among the affirmative defenses asserted by the company was the following: \u201cThe subject matter of this action is subject to compulsive arbitration under provisions of Article VIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">Article VIII reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-16\">\u201c8.1. There may be differences of opinion as to the interpretation of this Agreement and it is the desire of the parties hereto to have these adjusted as quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end the following rule shall apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-17\">8.1.1. All such disputes not settled by the grievance procedure as provided in Article VII concerning the interpretation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be disposed of by arbitration in the manner and form hereinafter provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">In its complaint the Union anticipated this defense, alleging \u201cIt would be vain for plaintiff to invoke the grievance and arbitration procedure of the contract aforesaid by reason of defendant\u2019s activities in the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">Nothing in the record supports this allegation. The Union directs our attention to the following testimony by the labor relations manager of the company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-20\">\u201cQ Is it the position of the employer that after the National Labor Relations Board ruling, which was finalized in September, 1967, that the grievance and arbitration procedures of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>tract no longer covered the traffic supervisors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEf\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUR0W\">* *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axd-dedup-1\">Q Then it was the employer\u2019s position that any grievance as to the traffic supervisors was not en-tertainable by the employer, in any event, is that correct ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"as6-dedup-0\">A Yes, afterwards, and even prior to that time, it would be arguable that they were not covered if they were supervisors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A852\">This does not serve to establish that the company would reject arbitration of a dispute as to the meaning of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"AETy\">We conclude that upon the issue entertained by the District Court arbitration was, by agreement, the exclusive method of resolution.
