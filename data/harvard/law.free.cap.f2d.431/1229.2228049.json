BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">With almost ironic coincidence this, as the earlier one of <em>Gutierrez,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is a bean-worthy case. Burrage, a Sieracki\u2014 <em>Ryan </em>\u2014 Yaka pseudo seaman, was injured on a New Orleans wharf while working as a longshoreman in the employ of <em>Stevedore</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>during the discharge of Shipowner\u2019s SS Ciudad de Nieva when he slipped on a coffee bean that had come from the ship\u2019s cargo earlier that morning or the day before. The District Court in a judge trial held Shipowner liable for substantial damages and rejected Shipowner\u2019s plea of contributory negligence and its claim against Stevedore for WWLP indemnity under <em>Ryan</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Shipowner attacks each of these actions and, for good measure, throws in a little Louisiana problem by invoking the substitute employer defense under \u00a7 6 of the Louisiana Compensation Act (LRS, 23:1061 and 1032). On these points Shipowner fails, but we hold indemnity should have been allowed and reverse as to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">The facts are neither conflicting nor complex and we accept all as above the Plimsoll line of P.R.Civ.P. 52(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bur-rage was working on the dock, his job being to fasten cargo to the ship\u2019s cargo gear. It seems more or less agreed that the coffee beans on the wharf had come from the discharge of bag coffee the day before. At any rate, cargo other than bagged coffee was being discharged when the injury occurred, and for some time prior to that. When the longshoremen arrived on the dock in the morning to commence work coffee beans were, in the words of Burrage, \u201cscattered all over.\u201d About 20 minutes before his injury he and a working companion asked one of the other longshoremen to bring a broom from Stevedore\u2019s gear shed in order for them to sweep Up the spilled beans in the work area. Neither broom nor sweeper arrived, and Burrage injured his back when he slipped on a coffee bean.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-15\">Of course, maximizing the extent of the spilled beans, Burrage\u2019s awareness of having to work while standing in, on, over, around or against coffee beans plus his acknowledgment that he \u201chad to get rid of [the coffee beans] someway or another if I was going to work there\u201d, put him in the strategic/tactical dilemma faced often by those who pursue a damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-16\">Perhaps it was the Judge\u2019s effort to draw the middle line in the context of Shipowner\u2019s claim of contributory negligence and the indemnity claim against Stevedore that led him to his finding. The Judge first held the cargo unsea-worthy on <em>Gutierrez\u2019 </em>standards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>scribing the Stevedore\u2019s response to the obligations imposed on it the Judge found that if \u201c* * * the leakage was excessive, then the foreman of the longshoreman would stop the work and the work area would be swept so that work could be continued safely.\u201d This was then followed by the finding that it \u201cis conclusive that when this accident occurred there was not an excessive leakage of beans on the wharf, but nonetheless, there were beans on the wharf as a result of leakage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">But we do not think that decision compels a resolution of this enigmatic riddle. The facts more than justify the conclusion that the bags \u201cwere not fit for their intended use and were defective\u201d and this \u201ccaused the coffee beans to be scattered along the wharf\u201d. Whether of fact, or law, or a little bit of both, the Judge was entitled to conclude that \u201ccoffee bags intended to carry coffee beans are defective if they contain holes in them so as to cause leakage on the wharf area while they are being discharged from the vessel.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And so too was the apex maritime law conclusion that \u201cbags * * * that leaked\u201d coffee beans \u201cwere unfit for their intended use\u201d and because of this \u201cmade the vessel * * * unseaworthy\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">These findings and conclusions make it clear with respect to the ship that on the two step analysis implicit in the Trawler Racer<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Judge determined that the bags were not \u201creasonably fit\u201d and in its wake came the unavoidable consequences of the breach of the absolute duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-14\">Thus, Shipowner fails on its basic attack on the decree against it. It fares no better on its contention that the trial Court should have held Burrage guilty of contributory negligence as a complete or substantially partial defense. Whether the conduct of the injured employee met the standard of the ordinarily prudent person is almost invariably a question of fact. In assaying the problem the trier is entitled to take into consideration the realities of the situation, the economic dependence of the worker on continued employment, and the law\u2019s general approach that in fostering industrial safety the burden of noncompliance with standards of care is ordinarily placed directly on the employer, not wholly on the injured victim. Manning v. M/V Searoad, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 603, 1970 A.M.C. 145. It was reasonable under the circumstances for the workmen to continue working.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-15\">But the nature of the obligations wrapped up in the <em>Ryan-WWliP </em>concept called for quite different results in the Shipowner <em>vis-a-vis </em>Stevedore\u2019s indemnity claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The notion of workmanlike performance certainly encompasses an obligation by the contractor to take notice of those deficiencies and hazards likely to give rise to damage to life, limb, or property and then take requisite action depending on the nature of the relationship of the parties and their contractual obligations, express or implied, either to eliminate or minimize the hazard or to stop work until the situation is corrected. T. Smith &amp; Son Inc., v. Skibs A/S Hassel, 5 Cir., 1966, 362 F.2d 745, 1966 A.M.C. 1700; Nicroli v. Den <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Norske Afrika, 2 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 651, 1964 A.M.C. 217; Albanese v. N. V. N.A.S.M., 2 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 763, 1968 A.M.C. 800, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 393 U.S. 995, 89 S.Ct. 482, 21 L.Ed.2d 461. Of course, there can be no question, either on the record or the findings, that Stevedore and that Burrage and others working with him were aware of the existence of the beans on the dock and looked upon this as a sufficient hazard to safe operations as to lead them to request that brooms and sweepers be sent. Such knowledge from injured workmen or fellow workers may be quite enough to set in motion the duties under WWLP without bringing it home directly to a supervisory employee. <em>T. Smith &amp; Son, supra; </em>United States Lines v. Williams, 5 Cir., 1966, 365 F.2d 332, 335, 1966 A.M.C. 2418, 2423.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\"> Stevedore does not really undertake to say that the presence of beans on the wharf was not a hazardous condition. It simply emphasizes the Trial Judge\u2019s notion that this was not \u201cexcessive\u201d. But this really presents\u2014 and we believe it is the explanation for the Trial Judge\u2019s preoccupation with it \u2014notions of negligence, ordinary care and the like. But WWLP is not measured by such restrictive terms. As the brief for Burrage, the injured man, points out that liability against Shipowner rests not upon charge, proof, and finding that the wharf was unwharfworthy. Rather, it rests on the claim, proof and finding that the ship, through defective cargo (coffee bags), was unseaworthy. Whether the spillage onto the dock was \u201cexcessive\u201d enough to warrant a finding of negligence, it and hazards flowing from it were quite enough to compel a conclusion that workmanlike performance called for Stevedore to do something, and it did nothing. And of course, neither on evidence nor on finding could we or the Trial Court conclude that there was any action on the part of Shipowner, its crew or representatives \u201csufficient to preclude recovery\u201d in the Weyerhaeuser<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">As both Shipowner and Stevedore urged the point and it now becomes material as to either one or both, we must face up to the substituted employer bar of \u00a7 6 of the Louisiana Compensation Act. That section provides, in effect, that if the work being done for a principal by a contractor is part of the principal\u2019s \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d the principal is liable to pay compensation to any employee of the contractor. LRS, 23:1061. If that is met, the exclusive remedy provision of the Act, LRS 23:1032, comes into play to cut off any damage suit claim. Although writers, and occasionally this Court, extoll this as a protection to employees who might find themselves remediless if the contractor turns out to be a financially irresponsible fly-by-night, it is in the experience of this Court at least nearly always invoked as a bar to the third party suit, a factor which we recently took into account in Gorsalitz v. Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp., 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 1033; See also, Arnold v. Shell Oil Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 419 F.2d 43; Cole v. Chevron Chem. Co., 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">But our problem here is not that of <em>Gorsalitz </em>and <em>Arnold, supra, </em>to define \u201cthe trade, occupation\u201d issue. Indeed, we may assume without deciding, that since the <em>Sieracki </em>pseudo seaman status rests on the historical fact that some seaman, sometime, on some vessel did the work in question \u2014 which is clearly true as to loading and discharge of cargo \u2014 -the work being done for Shipowner by Stevedore was part of the \u201ctrade, business or occupation\u201d of Shipowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">The unless here is unless the uniformity of admiralty read into Article III of the Constitution makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>state law ineffectual as to injuries within the maritime jurisdiction of the United States as extended.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the injuries here did not result from the operation or defects of some part of the vessel\u2019s equipment, they did come from unseaworthiness of the vessel in the form of unseaworthy cargo and this is sufficient to make it \u201ccaused by a vessel on navigable waters\u201d. 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 740 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">For our purposes we think we may start with <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>whatever might have been the state of the law previous to it. This clearly imposed on the vessel owner the consequences of shore-based injuries resulting from the unseaworthiness of the cargo/ship. But, as with all of these cases, <em>Gutierrez </em>is but a part of a very larger dynamic field. Part of it is the <em>Ryan </em>WWLP concept which the Court fashioned as an incident to the relationship between ship and the contracting service company. The Court has fashioned both the substantive right and remedy to accord to the pseudo seaman and to the shipowner and others in the chain of operational hierarchy. This has been done as an integral part of maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">If \u2014 and there cannot be any real if at all \u2014 the WWLP notion is an integral part of this court-created maritime law, then a state principle, statutory or Judge-made, which is a bar to effectual enforcement of the maritime right cannot constitutionally be applied since it works material prejudice to the characteristic features of general maritime law and interferes with the proper uniformity of that law contrary to Article 3, \u00a7 2 to the Constitution, (see also Article 1, \u00a7 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 1916, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086;</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">Chelentis v. Lukenbach Steamship Company, 1917, 247 U.S. 372, 38 S.Ct. 501, 62 L.Ed. 1171;</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 1919, 253 U.S. 149, 40 S.Ct. 438, 64 L.Ed. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-10\">We therefore conclude that in this situation \u00a7 6 is not an obstacle either by barring the vicarious seaman\u2019s claim against the shipowner or the successive actions over as all \u201cthrow out the lifeline\u201d. Grigsby v. Coastal Marine Service of Texas, Inc., 5 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 1011, 1039, cert. dism\u2019d, 396 U.S. 1033, 90 S.Ct. 612, 24 L.Ed.2d 531. And whatever force and effect remains in <em>Kent,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to the extent that it reaches a different conclusion, must now yield to <em>Gutierrez. </em>This has become all the more critical since this Court has recently held that under the Louisiana Compensation Act and Louisiana principles the employer is not liable for indemnity to the third party who impleads the employer in the workers\u2019 third party suit for non-maritime injuries. General Electric Co. v. Cuban American Nickel Co., 5 Cir., 1968, 396 F.2d 89. By virtue of these Louisiana principles the clearly recognized substantive rights flowing from WWLP are frustrated by \u00a7 6 and it must fall under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-11\">The upshot is that the decree was correct as between Shipowner and Burrage but it must be modified to permit recovery by Shipowner against Stevedore,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-12\">Affirmed in part, modified in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">.
