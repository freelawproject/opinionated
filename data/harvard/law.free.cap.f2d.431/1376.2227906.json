He has submitted a brief, filed-at the time of docketing, and a supplemental pleading since then. Examination of the file and records in this case prompts the conclusion that the questions presented are so unsubstantial as not to warrant further argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed for the reasons stated in its Memorandum and Order, 317 F.Supp. 10 (D.Kan.1970). See also Dearman v. Woodson, 429 F.2d 1288 (10th Cir., 1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
