The Board\u2019s order dismissed the alien\u2019s appeal from a decision of a Special Inquiry Officer (SIO) which had denied his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings so that he could apply for status adjustment under the proviso of \u00a7\u00a7 203(a) (7) and 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a) (7) and 1255). We have jurisdiction of this petition pursuant to \u00a7 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a), which makes the procedure prescribed by, and the provisions of, 28 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2341-2351 (formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1031-1042) the sole and exclusive procedures to be utilized for the purpose of testing the validity of final administrative orders of the character herein sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Petitioner, a native of China and a citizen of the Republic of China on Formosa, entered the country on October 27, 1964, as a non-immigrant crewman and was permitted to remain here as long as his vessel stayed in port but in no event for a longer period of time than twenty-nine days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282. Petitioner, however, deserted his ship and has remained illegally in this country ever since. In May 1968, after the Immigration and Naturalization Service took steps to deport petitioner, petitioner conceded he was deportable but requested the privilege of voluntary departure without expense to the Government. On May 21, 1968 a Special Inquiry Officer granted petitioner the privilege of voluntary departure on or before June 30, 1968 but if he remained beyond that time alternative orders deporting him to Singapore, to the Republic of China on Formosa, or to Hong Kong were to become effective. Petitioner waived his right to appeal this order, it became final, and it is not reviewable by this court. Instead of voluntarily leaving the country as he had promised, petitioner remained here and a warrant of deportation was issued on July 8,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">Before deportation could be effected a private bill to grant petitioner admission to the country was introduced in Congress on his behalf. Out of respect for the Congress the Service stayed deportation pending congressional action. The bill finally failed of passage and the Service took steps to effect petitioner\u2019s deportation. Petitioner then submitted to the Service a motion to reopen the deportation proceedings so as to permit him to apply for adjustment of his status from that of an alien seaman deportee to that of a \u201cseventh preference\u201d alien refugee under \u00a7 203(a) (7). He supported this motion by alleging that he had fled from Communist China in 1959 and that he was unwilling to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">Deportation proceedings having: been initiated against petitioner the jurisdiction to entertain this application vested in the Special Inquiry Officer. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">Petitioner also attached to his motion papers a fully completed INS form, Form I-590A, \u201cApplication for Classification as a Refugee.\u201d By regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.4, the District Director is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>charged with determining the refugee status of an alien present within the United States. So this form was detached from petitioner\u2019s petition to reopen the deportation proceedings and it was forwarded to the District Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">As stated at the outset of our discussion, petitioner seeks to have us review the denial of his petition to reopen his deportation proceedings. We deny the petition to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The District Director did not act upon petitioner\u2019s \u201cApplication for Classification as a Refugee.\u201d Although petitioner concedes he is deportable he alleges that, because of the District Director\u2019s failure to act upon this application, he has been in some way, obscure to us, deprived of due process in the Section 106(a) deportation proceeding that culminated in the final order of the Board denying his petition for a stay of his deportation, the order before us for our consideration. There is no merit whatever to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">When Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965 it devised a statutory pattern designed to preserve procedural due process for the benefit of aliens charged with being illegally in this country and, as such, liable to deportation. This pattern has been examined and considered by the Supreme Court in Cheng Fan Kwok v. I.N.S., 392 U.S. 206, 88 S.Ct. 1970, 20 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1968) and in cases in the Courts of Appeals, as for example, in Tai Mui v. Esperdy, 371 F.2d 772 (2 Cir.1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1017, 87 S.Ct. 1372, 18 L.Ed.2d 454; Wong Pak Yan v. Rinaldi, 429 F.2d 151 (3 Cir. 1970); Cheng Ho Mui v. Rinaldi, 408 F.2d 28, 30 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 963, 89 S.Ct. 2101, 23 L.Ed.2d 748 (1969); Wing Wa Lee v. I. N. S., 375 F.2d 723, 724 (9 Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 856, 88 S.Ct. 72, 19 L.Ed.2d 121 (1967). Moreover, in <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra, </em>and in great detail and with outstanding clarity in <em>Tai Mui, supra, </em>this pattern has been expertly analyzed and explicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need but refer to the discussion in those cases by the learned jurists who wrote those opinions to dispose of petitioner\u2019s desire to have us hold that the limitation of \u00a7 245 which makes an adjustment of status, available to some resident aliens, unavailable to an alien crewman violates the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Indeed, except for the claim that the failure of the District Director to act upon the petition presented to him, a claim not reviewable by us at this time, see 392 U.S. 217, 218, 88 S.Ct. 1970, somehow prejudices petitioner,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>er is in precisely the same position as that which the Chinese crewman, Woo Cheng Hwa, one of the four petitioners in Tai Mui v. I. N. S., <em>supra, </em>sought to convince us deserved relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We denied the petition to review the refusal to stay the deportation of Woo Cheng Hwa, and our action in his case furnishes us a direct precedent for denying a review of the refusal to stay the deportation of Luen Kwan Fu. We quote from Tai Mui v. Esperdy, <em>supra, </em>at 776:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Woo Cheng Hwa entered the United States as a crewman in June 1963 and was ordered in 1965 to be deported to the Republic of China on Taiwan, being given until April 1, 1966 to depart voluntarily. Having been directed to surrender for deportation, he moved to reopen the deportation proceedings to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident, contending that he was entitled to this relief by reason of the proviso to \u00a7 203(a) (7) despite his lack of the refugee classification approved by the District Director required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.-1(d). Denial by a Special Inquiry Officer and dismissal of his appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals followed in short order. He here seeks review under \u00a7 106(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> Nothing in the Act or in the regulations prevents the Special Inquiry Officer from disapproving an alien\u2019s application for status adjustment or from denying an alien\u2019s motion to reopen deportation proceedings in order to obtain time to adjust status, prior to action by the District Director upon an application by that alien for classification as a refugee. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor do we find any constitutional infirmity because this is so. When, regardless of the content of a deserting crewman\u2019s application to the District Director for Refugee Classification, it is perfectly clear that the crewman cannot obtain a \u201cseventh preference\u2019\u2019 status adjustment because, as a deserting alien crewman, he is ineligible for such an adjustment, the Special Inquiry Officer need not delay his disposition of the alien\u2019s application in order to await the District Director\u2019s action, and he may deny the applicant the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">At oral argument petitioner also reiterated the contention we rejected in Tai Mui v. Esperdy, <em>supra </em>at 779-781, that the regulation designating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>countries where applications for \u201cconditional entry\u201d may be brought and processed, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.9(a) is arbitrary, and therefore invalid, because it fails to provide an office in any country in the Orient where applicants may be examined. We do not view the situation as significantly altered from what it was in 1966 to conclude that Chinese refugees are victims of any discrimination by the Attorney General. See Cheng Ho Mui v. Rinaldi, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The petition to review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">. As pointed out by Justice Harlan in <em>Cheng Fan Kwok, supra </em>at 212, 88 S.Ct. at 1974, the Immigration and Nationality Act is \u201c \u2018a statute addressed entirely to specialists.\u2019 \u201d We realize this and therefore do not spell out in text or in footnote the language of the several statutes and regulations which have been spelled out in the cases to which we have just referred. They are well known to counsel for, indeed, petitioner\u2019s counsel was counsel of record in <em>Tai Mui </em>and all the other cases we have cited except the one from the Ninth Circuit and is counsel in 19 other Chinese crewmen cases decided by us this day, see Cheung Chan et al. v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 431 F.2d 77.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. We utterly fail to see what benefit petitioner would derive from an approval of his \u201cApplication for Classification as a Refugee.\u201d Such an application, if approved by a District Director, would satisfy but one of several conditions that must be satisfied before a Special Inquiry Officer may adjust an alien\u2019s status in this country. Among these other conditions is one that the alien who is seeking status adjustment not be a deserting alien seaman who \u201cjumped ship\u201d while his vessel was in a United States port. Although \u00a7 203(a) (7) provides an alternative method by which an alien who is abroad may secure a seventh preference status and thereby gain \u201cconditional entry\u201d into this country from a foreign country, the regulations require that INS officials in certain designated foreign countries pass upon such applications for conditional entry. Approval of the application here presented to the District Director would not stay petitioner\u2019s deportation or relieve petitioner of the requirement of making his application for conditional entry to an INS official in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>of the designated countries. Moreover, whatever the District Director\u2019s disposition of the application, it would not relieve or prevent an INS official abroad from determining whether the applicant is qualified for conditional entry as a refugee.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Petitioner also argues that a determination by the District Director that he is in fact a refugee will make it easier for him to secure a second time the privilege of voluntary departure, the privilege once granted him and which he deliberately forewent in order to stay in the United States illegally. He indicates that, classified as a refugee, he would move the Special Inquiry Officer to reopen his deportation proceedings in order to award him reinstatement of the voluntary departure privilege. Apart from the dubious contention that one who has once been granted the privilege of voluntary departure, and has chosen to renege on his promise to depart, would have a better opportunity to secure a second chance and again be granted the privilege, petitioner has not been foreclosed from demonstrating to the Special Inquiry Officer that he has all the indicia of a refugee; for this purpose, it is immaterial whether he has or has not secured a favorable determination by the District Director of his refugee status. Petitioner thus misconstrues the purpose and effect of the District Director\u2019s role in passing upon an \u201cApplication for Classification as a Refugee.\u201d Such an application is only a prelude to securing status adjustment, not a prelude to securing the privilege of voluntary departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-12\">.
