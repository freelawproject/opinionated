Between them, they assign seven points of error on this appeal: (1) That the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury verdict; (2) that a variation between the indictment and the proof at trial concerning the date of the crime violated their rights to due process of law; (3) that the evidence seized in a se\u00e1rch of appellant Scott\u2019s person was inadmissible because the search was in violation of the fourth amendment; (4) that appellant Ayers was denied the right of cross-examination at the trial; (5) that the government\u2019s offer of a written statement of a witness, to which appellant\u2019s objections were sustained and references to which the jury was instructed to disregard, was a \u201cplain error\u201d and prejudicial to the appellants; (6) that old coins found in the appellant Scott\u2019s possession were inadmissible because not clearly identified; and (7) that the trial judge made a prejudicial remark to defense counsel in the presence of the jury and also admitted evidence prejudicial to appellants over their repeated objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-24\">We have carefully examined each of the appellants\u2019 contentions in the light of the record and have found with respect to the first point that the evidence clearly supports the jury verdict, and with respect to the remaining six, that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-25\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
