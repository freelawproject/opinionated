The case was tried to the district court and at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, both defendants moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for dismissal. At the same time plaintiff moved for summary judgment against both defendants. On the basis of the testimony and facts stipulated by the parties, the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Judgment was entered for defendants and plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-20\">The issues of this appeal are primarily factual and under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>we must accept the district court\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint seeks recovery upon the contract and also on the basis of <em>quantum meruit. </em>We treat these questions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">\n<em>The Contract Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that immediately after the first prize fight between Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson in Chicago on September 25, 1962, Liston hired plaintiff to serve as his personal press representative. At a meeting in December 1962, Liston, as president and part-owner of Intercontinental Promotions, allegedly promised that Intercontinental would pay plaintiff $300 a week and that Liston personally would pay plaintiff an additional $300 a week to handle all of his public relations. As a result plaintiff immediately began working for Liston and in April 1963, went to Las Vegas to prepare for Liston\u2019s rematch with Floyd Patterson on June 22, 1963. During this period plaintiff was not paid by either Liston or Intercontinental although he allegedly sought payment from Liston\u2019s manager, Jack Nil\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-7\">The district court held that \u201cthe evidence introduced in plaintiff\u2019s ease clearly established that Bentley never entered into a binding and certain agreement with Liston.\u201d This conclusion rested upon two bases. First, the court held that neither Liston nor anyone connected with Intercontinental entered into a concrete, enforceable, and specific agreement with plaintiff. Since the district judge was entitled to disbelieve the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada v. Stacks, 187 F.2d 17, 20 (7th Cir. 1951), we do not think this finding was clearly erroneous. The court held in the alternative that, although Liston was president of Intercontinental, he had no authority to act for or on behalf of the corporation in business dealings. We agree. It is clear that plaintiff was well aware that Liston was uneducated in business matters and that the transactions for Intercontinental were always handled by other persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-11\">\n<em>Quantum Meruit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-12\">The absence of a binding contract, of course, does not defeat plaintiff\u2019s recovery under a <em>quantum meruit </em>theory. In the spring of 1963 plaintiff performed substantial services for Liston and Intercontinental. In addition to arranging press appearances in Chicago following the first Liston-Patterson fight, plaintiff set up Liston\u2019s training camp in Las Vegas for the rematch with Patterson. He also handled press relations for Liston during the six-week training period prior to the championship bout.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">We agree with the district court, however, that plaintiff was fully compensated for these services. Thus the evidence shows that after the first Liston-Patterson match, plaintiff met with Liston\u2019s representatives in Philadelphia. At that time, he received a check for $2500. On the face of the check were written the words \u201cpayment in full for services.\u201d Plaintiff argues that this check was merely a bonus but has failed to present credible evidence to support this assertion. In the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, we think this check constitutes full satisfaction of defendants\u2019 obligation to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-14\">Finally, plaintiff asserts that he rendered further services after receiving the check. The only evidence to support this assertion is testimony that plaintiff helped to arrange a press conference in Denver announcing agreement to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>championship match between Liston and Cassius Clay. Although he had some discussion concerning services in connection with that fight, plaintiff severed his relation with Liston before the promotion for that fight had started. We think any services performed by plaintiff subsequent to the second Liston-Patterson fight were of little consequence and performed without a reasonable expectation of additional compensation. Thus, on the basis of the foregoing facts, we are convinced that the district court correctly concluded that the $2500 cheek represented an accord and satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s claim against Liston and Intercontinental.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1161-8\">. Plaintiff\u2019s claim that Liston entered into an oral contract awarding him three closed-circuit television locations in Chicago for the second Liston-Patterson fight is also not supported by the evidence. The fight promoter, Theater Network Television, controlled these rights. Neither Liston nor Intercontinental could award locations to plaintiff and the evidence demonstrates only that Liston promised \u201cto put in a good word for Bentley\u201d with Theater Network Television.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
