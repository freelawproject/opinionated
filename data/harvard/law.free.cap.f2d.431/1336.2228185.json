The briefs are now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-21\">The record shows that the appellant, a selective service registrant, received an induction order and notice before he applied for reclassification. It also appears that the \u201cchange of circumstances\u201d upon which his application for reclassification was based also occurred after receipt of the induction notice and was a voluntary change within the registrant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-22\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court, 315 F.Supp. 228, denying the registrant relief from the induction order will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
