(Tower) the contract for installation of a \u201crigid ra-dome\u201d \u2014 a reinforced plastic dome-shaped structure \u2014 as part of construction of a radar facility at McCook, Illinois. Fen-tress, a Tower employee, was engaged in caulking the seams of the dome\u2019s plastic covering from a ladder placed on a catwalk at the base of the dome. He decided to work from a rope sling, instead of using a ladder, in order to speed up the work. Tower\u2019s foreman Baker and Agency employee Koke approved, and Fentress made the sling by tying a short rope at the base of the tower on top of the dome and tying a larger rope to the short rope and to his safety belt. Later he was using the sling in work when the rubbing of the ropes caused a collapse of the sling and Fentress fell to the catwalk and was injured. He was awarded workmen\u2019s compensation against Tower under Illinois law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and thereafter brought this suit under the Tort Claims Act. The government filed a third-party complaint against Tower claiming indemnity should it be held liable to Fen-tress.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-21\">The district court found, as substantially alleged by the Fentress complaint, that Fentress was working about 95 feet above the ground at the time of the injury and that no \u201csafe and proper scaffold, stay, [or] support\u201d was provided for his protection as required by Section 64 of the Scaffold Act;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **that the \u201crope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>and safety belt\u201d being used was not constructed and operated so as to properly protect Fentress and no safe and suitable scaffolding or net was provided for his proper protection as required by Section 60 of the Act;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the government had the right to stop the work if being done in violation of the Scaffold Act or in an unsafe manner and had the right to order Tower to take necessary safety precautions; and that government engineer Koke had knowledge of the unsafe device used by Fentress and of the failure to comply with the Scaffold Act provisions since no net was being furnished to protect Fentress in the event of his falling, as he did, 40 to 45 feet to the catwalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Substantially upon these findings, the court concluded that the government had \u201ccharge\u201d of the work so as to be liable for wilful violation of the Scaffold Act ;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the government violated the Act by its failure to furnish safe and suitable scaffolding or netting for protection of Fentress; that engineer Koke\u2019s actual knowledge, or knowledge he could reasonably have discovered, rendered his violations of the Act wilful; and that the wilful violations proximately caused Fentress\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">I. The government first contends that the Scaffold Act is an absolute liability statute beyond the purview of the Tort Claims Act, and that the district court accordingly erred in holding it liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">We agree with the government that the Tort Claims Act would preclude recovery if the Scaffold Act imposes absolute liability. Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15, 44, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953); United States v. Page, 350 F.2d 28, 33 (10th Cir. 1965). The Tort Claims Act is to be invoked only on a \u201cnegligent or wrongful act or omission\u201d of- a government employee. <em>Dalehite, supra, </em>346 U.S. at 44, 73 S.Ct. at 972. <em>See also </em>Konsler v. United States, 288 F.Supp. 895 (N.D.Ill.1968). We must determine, therefore, whether the Illinois Scaffold Act imposes absolute liability upon persons who violate its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">The Illinois Scaffold Act was adopted in 1907. In Section 60 the duty of providing safe equipment for hazardous work at high altitudes is imposed, <em>inter alios, </em>upon the owner. In Section 69 a civil remedy<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is provided for victims suffering injury, or for dependents in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>case of death, from wilful violation of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The government relies on Kennerly v. Shell Oil Company, 13 Ill.2d 431, 150 N.E.2d 134 (1958), and Gannon v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. Ry. Co., 22 Ill.2d 305, 175 N.E.2d 785 (1961), in support of its contention that Illinois decisional law has established that the Scaffold Act imposes absolute liability. We think that the reliance is misplaced. The issue presented in <em>Kennerly </em>was whether the Act imposed liability only upon the person \u201cin charge\u201d of the work or whether its scope included both the contractor and the owner of the premises, irrespective of which party was \u201cin charge.\u201d The Illinois Supreme Court, with one judge dissenting, held that liability extended to the owner of the premises, even if he was not in charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">On the same day that the <em>Kennerly </em>case was filed, the Illinois Supreme Court filed its opinion in Gannon v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. Ry. Co., 13 Ill.2d 460, 150 N.E.2d 141 (1958) (Gannon I). There the circuit court had dismissed Gannon\u2019s suit against his employer Marhoefer. Gannon appealed and the Supreme Court affirmed because Section 5(a) of the Illinois Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, superseding the Scaffold Act to the extent of prohibiting an employee\u2019s suit against his employer, barred Gannon\u2019s suit against Marhoefer. Gannon thereafter proceeded successfully against the Railroad, owner of the property where he was injured, and recovered a judgment for $45,000. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed. 25 Ill.App.2d 272, 167 N.E.2d 5. The Illinois Supreme Court, 22 Ill.2d 305, 175 N.E.2d 785 (1961) (Gannon II), allowed leave to appeal to determine \u201cthe nature of the liability\u201d under the Scaffold Act, both parties and the appellate court having cited <em>Kennerly </em>for diametrically opposed positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The court reexamined the eases dealing with this question and found a uniform interpretation that <em>Kennerly </em>imposed \u201cabsolute liability\u201d irrespective of whether control had been given to an independent contractor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court, however, in \u201creconsidering the construction of this act,\u201d rejected the <em>Kennerly </em>approach. The court \u201ccould not perceive\u201d that the legislature in 1907 intended that each person named in the Act would be liable, irrespective of his connection with the work, \u201cwhen, at that time, no such liability was even imposed on the immediate employer\u201d and when \u201cliability without fault was frowned upon.\u201d 22 Ill.2d at 319, 175 N.E.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Among other reasons given for the court\u2019s rejection of absolute liability, the court considered the essential statutory \u201cwilful\u201d violation, construed to mean \u201cknowing,\u201d and said that wilful violations mean those by persons directly connected with the work. The court held an employee has an action against any enumerated person \u201chaving charge\u201d of the work if his injury is caused by that person\u2019s wilful violation of the Act. Thus, <em>Gannon II </em>rejected the view that the Scaffold Act imposed an absolute, non-delegable duty on the persons named in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">This court has reached a similar conclusion in Schmid v. United States, 273 F.2d 172 (7th Cir. 1959). There we affirmed a judgment for plaintiff Schmid in a suit for personal injuries brought under the Scaffold Act against the government as owner of the premises where plaintiff was injured. The court rejected the government\u2019s argument \u2014 raised again here \u2014 that it was not subject to the Act since the Act allegedly imposed absolute liability on a landowner. The court pointed out that a landowner is liable under the Illinois statute only if a \u201cwilful violation\u201d is proved. The <em>Schmid </em>court relied heavily on its earlier decision in American Exchange Bank of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Madison v. United States, 257 F.2d 938 (7th Cir. 1958), for the proposition that the government may be liable under the Tort Claims Act for breach of a duty established by a state statute. There the plaintiff sued the government under the Wisconsin Safe Place Statute, W.S. A. \u00a7 101.06, for injuries received while an invitee on the post office grounds. The court, in reversing judgment for the defendant, stated that although the \u201cduty imposed by the Wisconsin Safe Place Statute upon the owner or employer is greater than that required by the common law,\u201d such owner or employer is not thereby deemed \u201can insurer of the safety of an employee or frequenter.\u201d Rather, the statute \u201clays down a standard of care and if those to whom it applies violate the provisions of the statute, they are guilty of negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The court in <em>Schmid </em>repeated this statement after pointing out the similarity between the two statutes and concluded that the Illinois Scaffold Act \u201cdoes not create absolute liability or render the owner an insurer.\u201d 273 F.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">No definition of the word \u201cabsolute\u201d can be found which accommodates the sense in which the government seeks to apply it to the civil liability imposed by the Scaffold Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The owner of property is not <em>ipso fac-to </em>liable where an employee working on the owner\u2019s property is injured. There must be proof that the owner was <em>in charge </em>of the work and that the injury was proximately caused by the owner\u2019s \u201cwilful violation of\u201d or \u201cwilful failure to comply with\u201d the provisions of the Act. Unless this proof is made, the owner is not liable. We think the government\u2019s contention of absolute liability is strained in view of the benevolent purpose of the Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">We hold therefore that the Scaffold Act as construed by the Illinois Supreme Court does not impose an absolute liability. It follows that we hold that the Tort Claims Act does not preclude the Fentress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">II. The government next argues that the district court erred in finding the government to be \u201cin charge\u201d of the construction work within the meaning of the Scaffold Act. In support of its argument, the government relies on this court\u2019s decision in Cannon v. United States, 328 F.2d 763 (7th Cir. 1964), where we affirmed a judgment for the defendant, under the Scaffold Act, based on a finding that the defendant did not have charge of the work. This court\u2019s affirmance there relied on two factors \u2014that defendant had no control over hiring and firing of the independent contractor\u2019s employees, and had no control over the method of doing the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\"><em>Cannon </em>does not compel us to set aside the district court\u2019s finding of ultimate fact that the government was \u201cin charge\u201d when Fentress was injured. There is evidence in the record before us that Koke, the government engineer, was aware of the use of the dangerous rope sling and approved its use in aid of speeding up the work, and that the government had the contractual right to stop the use of the sling and knowingly failed to exercise that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The Illinois Supreme Court has broadly construed the meaning of the phrase \u201chaving charge\u201d in the Scaffold Act. In Larson v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 33 Ill.2d 316, 211 N.E.2d 247 (1965), the court rejected an argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>terms \u201chaving charge\u201d and \u201csupervision and control\u201d were equivalents: \u201cThe term \u2018having charge of\u2019 is a generic term of broad import, and although it may include supervision and control, it is not confined to it.\u201d 33 Ill.2d at 321, 211 N.E.2d at 251. The court then referred to its earlier decision <em>(Gannon II) </em>and said, \u201cIn <em>Gannon * </em>* * we held that an owner must have some direct connection with the operations, over and above mere ownership * * * and indicated that the question whether the particular * * * activities * * * were such that an owner could be deemed to have charge was a <em>question of fact.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) The court said the Act itself did not limit liability of owners to those retaining \u201ccontrol and supervision\u201d and that further attempt to define \u201chaving charge\u201d would only confuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In light of this recent Illinois interpretation of the broad meaning of \u201chaving charge\u201d and in view of the ample support in the record for the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding, we hold the court\u2019s conclusion that the government was \u201cin charge\u201d of the work within the meaning of the Scaffold Act was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">III. The government finally contends that the district court erred in holding, with respect to the third-party eom-plaint, that the government was not entitled to indemnity from Tower. It asserts that Tower has obligated itself, both under the express provisions of the contract and under an implied warranty of \u201cworkmanlike\u201d performance, to indemnify the government for its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">The government bases its contractual indemnity claim against Tower on the following clause contained in the contract: \u201c* * * [the contractor shall] take precautions necessary to protect persons or property against injury or damage and be responsible for any such injury or damage that occurs as a result of his fault or negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">In a recent opinion filed on March 9, 1970, United States v. Seckinger, 397 U.S. 203, 90 S.Ct. 880, 25 L.Ed.2d 224 (1970), the Supreme Court construed an almost identical government contract clause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There an employee of an independent contractor working on a government project had recovered a judgment against the government based on a common law negligence theory and the government sought indemnity from the contractor. The Supreme Court, in reversing the judgment for the independent contractor, stated that the indemnity clause lent itself to two reasonable opposite interpretations \u2014 that the contractor must bear ultimate responsibility for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>damage done and fully indemnify the government for its losses whether or not caused by the government\u2019s own negligence, or that the government and the contractor should bear a burden proportionate to their negligence. The Court rejected the government\u2019s argument that it was entitled to full indemnity on the ground that a contractual provision should not be construed to permit an in-demnitee to recover for his own negligence in the absence of clear and unambiguous language to the contrary. The Court, however, stated that to construe the clause so as to prohibit any recovery on the part of the government (unless the contractor is the sole tortfeasor) would do violence to the words in the clause that the contractor is responsible for all damage resulting from his negligence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Supreme Court concluded that in agreeing to the clause the intention of the parties was that each was to bear responsibility for its own negligence. The Court remanded the case for determination of each party\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><em>Seckinger\u2019s </em>interpretation of the standard government indemnity clause is controlling in the case before us where there is evidence in the record that Tower supervised the construction of the radome and approved the use of the defective device which caused the injury complained of. We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for proceedings to determine the liability of each party for its own \u201cnegligence or wrongful conduct,\u201d and to apportion costs accordingly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The judgment for plaintiff Fentress is therefore affirmed, and the judgment for Tower is therefore reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680.

A criminal penalty is also imposed under Section 69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b885-10\">. The court incorrectly cited Schmid v. United States, 273 F.2d 172 (7th Cir. 1959), in support of this proposition. As we point out hereinafter, the <em>Schmid, </em>de-cisi\u00f3n held that the Scaffold Act \u201cdoes not create absolute liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. The government\u2019s citation of Konsler v. United States, 288 F.Supp. 895 (N.D.Ill.1968), is inapposite. <em>Konsler </em>held that the Illinois Dramshop Act imposed absolute liability on any shop owner who sells intoxicants to an intoxicated person. But the Illinois courts have settled the point that dramshop liability is imposed without fault. <em>See, e. g., Konsler, supra, </em>at 896. And in the second <em>Gannon </em>case, the Illinois Supreme Court distinguished this greater standard of care from that under the Scaffold Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. The disputed clause in <em>Seckinger </em>provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">The contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, obtain all licenses and permits required for the prosecution of the work. He shall be responsible for all damages to persons or property that-occur as a result of his fault or negligence in connection with the prosecution of the work. He shall also be responsible for all materials delivered and work performed until completion and final acceptance, except for any completed unit thereof which theretofore may have been finally accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMN\">The similar clause in the Tower contract reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-10\">4. RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTRACTOR.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-15\">At his own expense the Contractor shall: (a) obtain all required licenses and permits; (b) provide competent superintendence; (c) take precautions necessary to protect persons or property against injury or damage and be responsible for any such injury or damage that occurs as a result of his fault or negligence ; (d) perform the work without unnecessarily interfering with other contractors\u2019 work or Government activities ; (e) be responsible for all damage to work performed and materials delivered (including Government-furnished items), until completion and final acceptance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">. Since the Tort Claims Act limits governmental tort liability to \u201cnegligent and wrongful acts,\u201d the contract clause would be anomalous if indemnity were denied whenever the government acted negligently or wrongfully.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">. Because we have taken the view that the rights and duties of the parties are governed by contract, we do not reach the government\u2019s alternative theory that Tower breached an implied warranty of workmanlike service.
