He alleged in his petition that upon his arrival at the Atlanta penitentiary on November 4, 1969, he was placed, with no explanation, in segregated confinement where he has since remained. The district court denied relief, stating that the appellant has failed to allege sufficient facts on which to grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">However, the notice of appeal filed by appellant shows on its face that he has been transferred from the Atlanta penitentiary on or about February 24, 1970, and, thus, his plaint of solitary confinement in Atlanta has been rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">For the foregoing reason, the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-17\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s Local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
