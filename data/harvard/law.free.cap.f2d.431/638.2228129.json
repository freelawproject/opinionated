Bussell E. Smith, Chief United States designation. District Judge, District of Montana, sitting by</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b697-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b697-22\">Appellant, who conducted his own defense, and was convicted by a California state jury of two counts of obstructing telephones (Cal.Penal Code, \u00a7 591) and one count of burglary (Cal.Penal Code, \u00a7 459), appeals from an order of the district court denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant claims that he did not intelligently waive counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">Counsel was appointed for appellant and he appeared at the preliminary hearing and at the arraignment. On the day set for trial appellant expressed his dissatisfaction with his attorney. At any time he might have had the services of the attorney originally appointed. The Court however would not appoint a substitute and defendant, against the advice of two judges, deliberately chose to represent himself, although as he stated \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the intelligence to represent myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Now it is asserted that his waiver was not intelligent. Defendant knew that he had a right to a lawyer; he was emphatically warned not to be his own counsel;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******he was aware of the fact that he was charged with three felonies and that a conviction could result in long term imprisonment. He was furnished copies of the information and transcript of the preliminary hearing. Appellant was not legally trained but the record shows that he understood what charges were being made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Under the rule announced in Hodge v. United States, 414 F.2d 1040 (9 Cir. 1969), the waiver was intelligently made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">An evidentiary hearing was not required. The facts here recited appear in the record. No contention is made that the record is not factually accurate. It is contended that the record does not show the facts required before there can be an effective waiver of counsel under the doctrine of Von Moltke v. Gillie, 332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). Were the <em>Von Moltke </em>case controlling a reversal would be required. The rule of that case however, which involved a guilty plea, is not applicable to a ease where there has been a trial on the merits. The undisputed facts in the record do disclose a compliance with the applicable rule which was announced in <em>Hodge, supra. </em>See, Jackson v. California, 336 F.2d 521 (9 Cir. 1964); Yeaman v. United States, 326 F.2d 293 (9 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\"> Appellant contends that an attorney should have been appointed to prosecute his petition for a writ in the district court. An indigent state prisoner applying to a federal court for habeas corpus is not entitled to an appointed attorney unless the particular circumstances indicate that it is necessary to obtain due process. Eskridge v. Rhay, 345 F.2d 778 (9 Cir. 1965), cert. den. 382 U.S. 996, 86 S.Ct. 582, 15 L.Ed.2d 483. No such circumstances appear here.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">The order denying a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-22\">. \u201cThe question before the judge was not whether the defendant was professionally capable of acting as his own lawyer. New defendants are, and the right of self-representation is not so conditioned. The question was simply whether the defendant understood the charges against him and was fully aware of the fact that he would be on his own in a complex area where experience and professional training are greatly to he desired.\u201d Hodge v. United States, 414 F.2d 1040, at p. 1043.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\">. On July 28, 1964 one Judge said to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Salter has been practicing law a good many years and, in my opinion, is a very competent trial lawyer and criminal lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">You will make a mistake by, at this stage of the proceedings, substituting yourself in, and there isn\u2019t anyone that can take this case over at the moment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201cTHE COURT. You are making a serious mistake at this stage of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I will take your advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">THE COURT: You do whatever you want about it. If you want to represent yourself, you are permitted to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">On August 17, 1964 another judge said to the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: However, I suggest to you between now and October 5th that you secure counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you will be well-represented by them, if you take the Public Defender, and you certainly should not attempt to try your own ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-20\">THE DEFENDANT: I realize this, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-21\">THE COURT: You are just sticking your neck out, to use the vernacular,\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
