Tucker appeals from a district court order denying his motion, made under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to vacate the judgment convicting him of armed robbery and to set aside the sentence based thereon. The judgment and sentence of imprisonment for twenty-five years, entered on May 20, 1953, was affirmed by this court in Tucker v. United States, 214 F.2d 713 (9th Cir. 1954). The district court opinion now under review in this section 2255 proceeding is reported in 299 F.Supp. 1376 (N.D.Cal. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-22\">After Tucker had testified in his 1953 trial for the armed robbery, the Government introduced evidence of his three prior felony convictions. This evidence was received for the purpose of impeaching Tucker\u2019s own testimony offering an alibi defense. In addition, after the jury had entered its verdict of guilty, the trial judge called for further information, in the form of a Federal Bureau of Investigation report concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>ing Tucker\u2019s prior convictions, for use in determining the sentence to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"aju-dedup-1\">On June 10, 1966, the Superior Court of Alameda County, California, in case No. 25,174, set aside two of Tucker\u2019s prior convictions on the ground that \u201cthe defendant was neither advised of his rights to legal assistance nor did he intelligently and understandingly waive this right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d The Government concedes that these two prior felony convictions were invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344-345, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"AM9X\">In this section 2255 proceeding Tucker argues that his 1953 conviction is invalid, under the rule of Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 115, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed. 2d 319 (1967), because his prior uncoun-seled convictions were used at his trial to impeach his credibility and to influence the court in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A5PL\">In <em>Burgett, </em>the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alu-dedup-0\">\u201c[t]o permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense * * * is to erode the principle of that case.\u201d 389 U.S. at 115, 88 S.Ct. at 262.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A03T\">This rule is being applied retroactively by this court and other courts of appeals which have had occasion to consider the problem.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Au44\">The <em>Burgett </em>rule against the use of uncounseled convictions to prove guilt or enhance punishment precludes the use of such evidence to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. Gilday v. Scafati, 428 F.2d 1027 (1st Cir.1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABXX\">We are also in agreement with the further ruling in <em>Gilday, </em>for the reasons there stated, that the reception of evidence pertaining to prior convictions, constitutionally erroneous under <em>Burgett </em>may, under the circumstances of a particular case, be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, applying the principle announced in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Under <em>Chapman, </em>an error of constitutional proportions can be disregarded as harmless if the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the error \u201cdid not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVqi\">The nature of defendant\u2019s testimony at the trial, and the overwhelming weight of the testimony to the contrary are fully described in the district court opinion, 299 F.Supp. 1376, at 1377-1378. We agree with the district court that defendant\u2019s testimony was completely discredited by evidence other than that pertaining to the prior convictions. This leads us to conclude that the prosecution firmly proved that the evidence of prior convictions did not contribute to the verdict obtained and that, with respect to the verdict of guilty, the error in receiving such evidence was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>As noted above, the evidence pertaining to Tucker\u2019s prior convictions was submitted not only to affect his credibility as a witness, but also to assist the trial court in fixing the sentence. The twenty-five year prison sentence imposed following Tucker\u2019s conviction for armed robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), was the maximum allowable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">There is a reasonable probability that the defective prior convictions may have led the trial court to impose a heavier prison sentence than it otherwise would have imposed. Therefore, as to the sentencing, we are unable to conclude that the reception of such evidence was. harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed, but the cause is remanded to the district court for resen-tencing without consideration of any prior convictions which are invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AH4\">. <em>See </em>Tucker v. Craven, 421 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1970); Gilday v.

The question of whether <em>Burgett </em>precludes use of a prior conviction, invalid under Gideon v. Wainwright, to impeach a defendant\u2019s testimony in a subsequent trial on another charge, was argued in this court in Shorter v. United States, 412 F.2d 428 (9th Cir. 1969). However, in that case we did not decide the question because it was the defendant, and not the prosecution, who offered the evidence pertaining to a prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A36\">. The <em>Chapman </em>court stated that there is little, if any, difference between this statement of the governing principle, and the statement in Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963) that \u201c[t]he question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>See also, </em>Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1352-7\">THOMPSON, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A1a\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">I respectfully dissent. This Court has not yet held that the rule of Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967), is applicable to constitutionally infirm convictions used for impeachment. This is the case in which it should be declared that a convicted person cannot attack his conviction on the ground that a constitutionally infirm prior conviction was used for impeachment. This Court has not yet held that the rule of Burgett v. Texas, <em>supra, </em>applies to invalidate a sentence where a constitutionally infirm prior conviction was called to the attention of the sentencing judge by presentence report, or otherwise, before sentence was imposed. This is the case in which it should be declared that a convicted defendant cannot attack the sentence imposed by showing that the sentencing judge was informed about a constitutionally infirm prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">This writer cannot believe that the Supreme Court intended such a broad interpretation and application of the <em>Burgett </em>rule. Viewed realistically, it means that the most hoary and ancient of the confirmed, repetitive recidivists may, by applying the \u201cdomino theory\u201d whereby the earliest of the convictions is declared void by application of Gideon,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fell each of the ensuing convictions and establish a clean unsullied record of pro-social conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">It has been a fundamental of our case-made jurisprudence that the principles announced in pertinent precedent should be viewed and interpreted in the light of the facts of the particular case. This is a salutary principle which this writer believes has not been entirely abandoned in contemporary jurisprudence. The principle recognizes the problems inherent in communication and expression, the difficulties of achieving pinpoint accuracy and the non-existence of words expressing exactly the same concept for the writer and the reader, the speaker and the listener. It recognizes the human frailty of inability to conceive, imagine and anticipate the applications which will be sought to be made of an announced principle, howsoever accurately expressed with semantic exactness. The principle also recognizes that judges are human beings and writing in favor of a position taken, however dispassionately, may become somewhat polemic in supporting the soundness of the decision advocated. This writer admires the genius of our system which contemplates a case by case review under differing sets of facts of the principles formulated and articulated in earlier precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-11\">The majority opinion is based upon the following quotation from Burgett v. Texas, <em>supra,:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-12\">\u201cTo permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright to be used against a- person either to support guilt or enhance punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>for another offense (see Greer v. Beto, 384 U.S. 269, 86 S.Ct. 1477, 16 L.Ed.2d 526) is to erode the principle of that case. Worse yet, since the defect in the prior conviction was denial of the right to counsel, the accused in effect suffers anew from the deprivation of that Sixth Amendment right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq5G\">The majority relies upon Gilday v. Scafati, 428 F.2d 1027 (1st Cir.1970), where the First Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1353-5\">\u201cWe conclude that the Burgett rule against use of uncounselled convictions \u2018to prove guilt\u2019 was intended to prohibit their use \u2018to impeach credibility,\u2019 for the obvious purpose and likely effect of impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility is to imply, if not prove, guilt. Even if such prohibition was not originally contemplated, we fail to discern any distinction which would allow such invalid convictions to be used to impeach credibility. The absence of counsel impairs the reliability of such convictions just as much when used to impeach as when used as direct proof of guilt. Moreover, such use compounds the original denial of the constitutional right just as surely as does use \u2018to prove guilt or enhance punishment.\u2019 Finally, defendant\u2019s privilege to testify or not to testify\u2014 Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) \u2014 Is seriously impaired if the price of testifying is the potential admission of invalid and possibly unreliable convictions which could not otherwise be admitted. We therefore hold that <em>Burgett </em>prevents the use of uncounseled convictions for purposes of impeachment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">I think the First Circuit and the majority of this Court rely on a too literal reading of the <em>Burgett </em>opinion in disregard of the principle I have urged that we should look to the facts and to what actually was decided. Narrowly, the holding of the <em>Burgett </em>case is that if void prior convictions are brought to the attention of the jury by the prosecution in a one-stage recidivist trial, the result is a denial of due process. In that situation, inasmuch as the enhancement of punishment is directly dependent upon the validity of the prior conviction, it is the absolute duty of the prosecution to assure itself of that validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">My interpretation of <em>Burgett </em>is that the words \u201csupport guilt\u201d refer to the situation where the prior conviction is an essential element of the crime charged. For examples, under federal law, it is unlawful for a felon to transport a firearm in interstate commerce (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922) and under California law, it is an offense for a felon to come upon the grounds of a reformatory in the nighttime (Cal. Penal Code, \u00a7 171(b)). In such cases, the status or condition of having suffered the prior felony conviction is essential to support the conviction and the prosecution, quite properly, is not permitted to rely upon a void conviction to establish such status. And when the prior conviction is \u201cused against a person * * * to enhance punishment for another offense\u201d, the Supreme Court, in my view, was alluding to recidivist statutes like the one involved in <em>Burgett </em>and like the Narcotics Drug Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174) and like the California Habitual Criminal Statute (Cal.Pen.Code, \u00a7 644). This is as far as I would now go in the application of <em>Burgett, </em>reserving, nevertheless, deference to the policy that it is worthwhile to consider future applications of the principle on a ease-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">In the present case, two prior felony convictions were used to impeach defendant at his federal armed robbery trial. These later turned out to be vulnerable under the <em>Gideon </em>principle. It is my thesis that this fact does not justify or support an attack upon the federal conviction. It seems to me that the position of the majority, \u201c[T]he Bur-gett rule against the use of uncounseled convictions to prove guilt or enhance punishment precludes the use of such evidence to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness\u201d, constitutes an unwarranted extension of the <em>Burgett </em>decision and will involve state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>courts in a morass of fruitless inquiry into the undiscernable prejudicial effect of such impeachment upon the trial as a whole. Further, the majority <em>sub silen-tio </em>overrules two decisions of the Court, Bloch v. United States, 238 F.2d 631 (1956), and Bloch v. United States, 226 F.2d 185 (1955), where the Court, in the first opinion, saw no error in a felony impeachment question asked by a prosecutor who knew the prior conviction was on appeal, and in the second affirmed the ruling despite the fact that the prior conviction had been reversed on appeal. Our Court there recognized that what really was in issue was the good faith of the prosecutor and that his use in good faith of a vulnerable prior conviction to impeach the defendant could not be relied upon to reverse the conviction. The same principle should be followed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-22\">Moreover, I see no federal constitutional problem where the issue is properly analyzed as one of the prosecutor\u2019s good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-23\">On the question of sentence, the factors involved are even more imponderable. The majority thinks the imposition of the maximum sentence shows that the priors were used to enhance sentence. In my experience, so many factors affect the imposition of sentence that I cannot accept the premise. There never will be a case where a post-conviction remedy court will be able to tell whether knowledge of one or more prior convictions affected the sentence unless the sentence given was mandated by statute so that the prior record could have no effect. In the present case, the sentencing judge conducted an extensive colloquy before imposing sentence. A portion is copied in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is more, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>seems to me to be a fair analysis that the sentencing judge was influenced primarily by defendant\u2019s proneness to violence and the number of other outstanding charges than anything else.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not uncommon in my experience for a sentencing judge to take into consideration other charges pending (many times detainers have been placed for them) in enhancement of punishment and for other prosecuting officials to drop charges if a sufficiently substantial sentence is imposed. It is not even unusual for a defendant against whom a number of detainers have been lodged to request a substantial sentence .with the hope that the other charges will be dropped. On the present record, it is pure speculation that the invalidated prior convictions had an effect on the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Finally, I would like to suggest that when we consider the use of prior convictions for impeachment or when they are included in a pre-sentence presentation as part of the defendant\u2019s prior history, it is not the conviction \u2014 the formality of conviction \u2014 that is important. It is the conduct that is represented by the conviction. The witness\u2019 veracity is not impeached by the conviction. The conviction is only shorthand for the impeaching misconduct, and a rule of convenience has been adopted which permits impeachment by the shorthand method but prohibits it by showing other acts of misconduct, else the trial would be led into endless by-ways and side controversies. Invalidating the prior conviction does not erase the conduct on which it was based. This is even clearer in the field of sentencing where a competent presentence report does not simply recite the prior criminal record but describes the circumstances of each charge \u2014 even those that led to an acquittal. It is this history that influences the sentencing judge, not the formal convictions. For example, in a recent case the defendant had been acquitted of the charge of murdering his mother. It, nevertheless, was proper for the sentencing judge to co\u2019nsider that incident where a loaded weapon was involved as bearing on defendant\u2019s proneness to violent activity. And in the present case, the judge took into consideration conduct which had not yet been prosecuted to conviction \u2014 showing that it is the conduct, not the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>tion, which is relevant. Many times the circumstances of a prior conviction will cause a court to discount and disregard it completely in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">These are additional reasons in support of my conclusion that the <em>Burgett </em>rule should be applied only where the formal record of conviction of a felony is essential to support guilt or to enhance punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">In the context of the foregoing, perhaps my earlier statement that the majority relies on a too literal reading of the quotation was incorrect. There the emphasis was on \u201csupport guilt\u201d and \u201cenhance punishment.\u201d But if the statement of principle in <em>Burgett </em>is read with strict literalness and the emphasis is placed on \u201cto permit a <em>conviction </em>* * * to be used\u201d, then my conclusion, that it is the required use of the formal record of conviction to attain the result under attack that is important, is clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">The majority\u2019s treatment of the problems in this appeal is based on the necessary assumption that a federal constitutional issue of fair trial and due process of law is present whenever a jury or court is informed about a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. Yet the decisions of the Supreme Court specifically refute this assumption: Spencer v. Texas,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967), where the procedure of a one-stage recidivist trial was affirmed; Rundle v. Johnson, 386 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 847, 17 L.Ed.2d 695 (1967), where the procedure of admission of prior crimes in a one-stage murder trial to assist the jury in fixing punishment was affirmed. These decisions, viewed in association with <em>Burgett, </em>suggest that the broad application of the <em>Burgett </em>rule to impeachment evidence and sentencing information is not warranted and not intended. Cf. United States ex rel. Smith v. Fay, 409 F.2d 564 (2nd Cir.1969). While reference to dissenting opinions in support of a contention is apt to invoke ridicule, I believe the succinct dissent of three Justices in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109 at 120, 88 S.Ct. 258 at 264, 19 L.Ed.2d 319, to be pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-10\">\u201cThe record in this case shows no prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct. To the extent that the prosecutor contemplated the use of prior convictions in a one-stage recidivist trial, his right to do so is of course established by Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, decided only last Term. The fact that the prior convictions turned out to be inadmissible for other reasons involves at the most a later corrected trial <em>error </em>in the admission of evidence. We do not sit as a court of errors and appeals in state cases, and I would affirm the judgment of the state court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-11\">This approach to the problems reminiscent of the attitude of our Court in the <em>Bloch </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>although it was rejected by the majority of the Supreme Court in a true recidivist trail where the void prior conviction was an essential of the prosecutor\u2019s case, may nevertheless be revived to control judicial review in peripheral applications of the <em>Burgett </em>rule like the uses of it in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\">I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-16\">.

We recognize that the use of prior-crime evidence in a one-stage recidivist trial may be thought to represent a less cogent state interest than does its use for other purposes, in that other procedures for applying en-haneement-of-sentence statutes may be available to the State that are not suited in the other situations in which such evidence is introduced. We do not think that this distinction should lead to a different constitutional result.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
