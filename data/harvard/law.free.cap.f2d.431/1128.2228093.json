The district court struck plaintiffs\u2019 motions pursuant to local Rule 13(b), solely because of the failure of plaintiffs to file briefs in support of their motions. Plaintiffs also appeal from a judgment entered by the district court granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss their complaints. We reverse the judgment entered below on the ground that the district court erred in striking plaintiffs\u2019 request for a three-judge court. We remand for further proceedings and decline to rule upon the grounds offered for dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints until the district court determines whether a three-judge court is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-20\">Plaintiffs are members of the \u201cBlackstone Rangers\u201d street gang, sometimes known as the \u201cBlack P Stone Nation\u201d. Defendant Richard J. Daley is Mayor of Chicago; defendant James Conlisk is Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department; defendant Edward Buckney is a police captain in charge of the Gang Intelligence Unit of the Chicago Police Department; defendant John S. Boyle is Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois; and defendant Edward V. Hanrahan is State\u2019s Attorney of Cook County, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-21\">Plaintiffs, Jeff Fort and Charles Edward Bey, have filed separate but essentially identical class-action complaints. Count I of both complaints alleges that defendants Daley, Conlisk, and Buckney have conspired to suppress and chill plaintiffs\u2019 first amendment rights by prosecuting and threatening to prosecute them under the Illinois Mob Action and Disorderly Conduct Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that prosecutions have been instituted only for the sake of harassment and intimidation, and that the statutes themselves are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Count I seeks an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>injunction against further harassing prosecutions and Count II seeks a declaratory judgment that the statutes are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Count III of the complaints attacks various practices of the Cook County Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Circuit Court of Cook County. Thus plaintiffs charge defendant Hanrahan with abdication of his duty to review and screen complaints filed by the police and defendant Boyle with failure to require at least some evidence against suspects before allowing complaints to be filed. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunc-tive relief against these practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Count IV of the Fort complaint seeks damages against all defendants for deprivation of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. Counts I and IV of the Bey complaint allege further unconstitutional police practices. They assert that plaintiffs were, in effect, held incommunicado for over seven hours because of an inadequate reporting system and the Chicago police practice of moving defendants from one facility to another after they have been arrested and before they are charged. Plaintiffs claim that this practice violated their right to counsel. In addition to damages, they pray for an injunction requiring defendants to establish an adequate reporting system and more rapid procedures for setting bail and to cease the practice of transferring arrestees from facility to facility before they are formally charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">We first consider the correctness of the district court\u2019s action in striking plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a three-judge court and a temporary restraining order. The court relied upon Rule 13(b) of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-10\">Rule 13. Hearing of Contested Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-12\">(b) Failure to file a supporting or answering memorandum shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the motion or a withdrawal of opposition thereto, but the court on its own motion or that of a party may strike the motion or grant the same without further hearing. Failure to file a reply memorandum within the requisite time shall be deemed a waiver of the right to file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">In its opinion the court held that the failure of plaintiffs to file timely briefs in support of their motions was a sufficient reason, standing alone, for striking or denying plaintiffs\u2019 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-14\">We think this view misconceives the purpose of Rule 13(b). The undoubted intent of the drafters was to expedite preliminary proceedings. This purpose is sufficiently accomplished by permitting the court to decide the merits of a preliminary motion without consideration of supporting reasons offered in a brief prepared by the movant. Indeed, if the more drastic sanction of outright denial of the motion were contemplated by Rule 13(b), serious questions would arise concerning the consistency of that rule with the liberal pleading policy of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-15\">Fortunately we need not consider these questions since the clear words of Rule 13(b) demonstrate that motions may only be denied on the merits. Thus, the rule expressly provides that failure to file briefs \u201cis not a waiver of the motion.\u201d Therefore, by striking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 motions without expressly relying upon reasons other than noncompliance with Rule 13(b), we hold the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\"> The defendants argue that we are empowered to correct the district court\u2019s error by independent consideration of whether a three-judge court should be convened in this case. The arguments advanced by defendants to support the denial of a three-judge court, raise difficult questions which have not been carefully briefed in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This consideration alone cautions against deciding questions upon which we are not compelled to rule. Furthermore we think that the provisions of the three-judge statute contemplate that the district judge should in the first instance determine whether a three-judge court is required. Therefore, in accordance with our power to refuse to rule on questions not decided by the district court, we remand this case for consideration of the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 request for a three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">Following its ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary motions, the district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaints on three grounds: (1) that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in all counts were too conclusory( to state a cause of action; (2) that the complaint against defendants Boyle and Hanrahan must be dismissed since those defendants were protected from suit by the doctrine of judicial immunity; and (3) that the doctrine of abstention should be applied to stay plaintiffs\u2019 action \u201cpending the outcome of state court proceedings.\u201d Defendants argue that, regardless of the error committed by the district court in failing to rule on plaintiffs\u2019 application for a three-judge court, we should consider the propriety of the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints and affirm the judgment entered below for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">Subsection 2284(5) of the Judicial Code provides that: \u201cA single judge [in a case in which three judges are required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281] shall not * * * dismiss the action, or enter a summary or final judgment.\u201d On this basis the Supreme Court has fashioned a rule which permits a single judge to determine only the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d question of whether a three-judge court is required and not to decide any questions concerning the \u201cmerits\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Thus in Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713, 715, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 1296, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962), in reversing a determination by a single judge that the court could abstain from hearing plaintiff\u2019s case, the Supreme Court noted: \u201cWhen an application for a statutory three-judge court is addressed to a district court, the court\u2019s inquiry is appropriately limited to determining whether the constitutional question raised is substantial, whether the complaint at least formally alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>a basis for equitable relief, and whether the case presented otherwise comes within the requirements of the three-judge statute.\u201d Although the rule established by the Supreme Court is often difficult to apply, <em>see generally </em>D. Currie, The Three-Judge District Court in Constitutional Litigation, 32 U.Chi.L.Rev. 1, 21-29 (1964), we think the questions raised by the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints are arguably matters which should be decided by a three-judge court if, on remand, the district court determines such court is required by statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If we were to rule on these questions at this time, a three-judge court, if required, might be faced with difficult problems concerning the applicability of the doctrine of res judicata.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In conclusion therefore we think the- interests of judicial economy and efficient judicial administration demand that we decline to rule on the questions raised by the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints until that court determines whether a three-judge court is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1187-12\">. Ill.Rev.Stat. eh. 38, \u00a7 25-1 (a) (1) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-14\">(a) Mob action consists of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-16\">(1) The use of force or violence disturbing the public peace by 2 or more persons acting together and without authority of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-17\">Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, \u00a7 26-1 (a) (1) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-22\">(a) A person commits disorderly conduct when he knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-23\">(1) Does any act in such unreasonable manner as to alarm or disturb another and to provoke a breach of the peace.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1187-24\">. The facts on which the presently pending prosecutions were allegedly based are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-25\">In the Fort complaint it is alleged that members of the plaintiff\u2019s group were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>engaging in a peaceful protest march down tlie parkway in the center of Garfield Boulevard in Chicago, under the supervision and with the permission of the local police, when members of the Gang Intelligence Unit arrived and arrested them. The Bey complaint alleges that plaintiffs were engaged in peaceful discussions with the principal of Forrest-ville I-Iigli School in Chicago, at the latter\u2019s invitation, when members of the Gang Intelligence Unit arrived on the scene, uninvited by school authorities, and arrested plaintiffs. The only incident admitted in the complaint was a minor scuffle in which a student\u2019s glasses were accidentally knocked off and one lens broken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">. Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 attacks on the Illinois Mob Action and Disorderly Conduct Statutes do not require a three-judge court after the recent decisions in Landry v. Daley, 280 F.Supp. 938 (N.D.Ill.1968), and United States v. Woodard, 376 F.2d 136 (7th Cir. 1967). In Ex Parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933), the Supreme Court held that a single judge may dismiss a complaint requesting a three-judge court only if the federal constitutional question is \u201cinsubstantial,\u201d either because it is \u201cobviously without merit,\u201d or because \u201cits unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 54 S.Ct. at 4. The Supreme Court has never decided whether decisions of lower federal courts may also render a constitutional attack \u201cinsubstantial.\u201d <em>See, e. g., </em>Bynum v. Connecticut Commission on Forfeited Rights, 410 F.2d 173, 176 (2d Cir. 1969); Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. R., D.C., 225 F.Supp. 11, 21 aff\u2019d sub nom. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. Certain Carriers, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 331 F.2d 1020 (1964); Williams v. Ball, 294 F.2d 94, 95 (2d Cir. 1961), citing almost exclusively Supreme Court cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">. Defendants argue that only Count II of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints presents a potential three-judge question and that the propriety of the district court\u2019s dismissal as regards the other counts must be considered in this appeal. We disagree. Certain issues which do not themselves require a three-judge court may, nevertheless, be considered by a three-judge court as claims pendent to a valid three-judge question. Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 80 S.Ct. 568, 4 L.Ed.2d 568 (1960). We think that if a three-judge court is required in this case, that court must be permitted to decide in the first instance whether the claims in the other counts can or should be considered as pendent claims. Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 402, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Stratton v. St. Louis S. W. Ry., 282 U.S. 10, 15, 51 S.Ct. 8, 75 L.Ed. 135 (1930), in which it was held that a circuit court is without jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a single judge where it subsequently develops that a three-judge court is required. There the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-18\">[T]o sustain a review upon sueh an appeal would defeat the purpose of the statute by substituting a decree by a single judge and an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for a decree by three judges and a direct appeal to this Court. 282 U.S. at 16, 51 S.Ct. at 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APOy\">This language suggests that any circuit court rulings on questions requiring a three-judge court are without jurisdiction and void. The latter case of Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, <em>supra, </em>modified this rule slightly, by allowing but not requiring the court of appeals to review the decision of a single judge that a three-judge court was not required. But the Court apparently reaffirmed the narrowest holding of <em>Strat-ton, </em>namely, that \u201ca court of appeals was precluded from reviewing on the merits a ease which should have originally been determined by a court of three judges.\u201d 370 U.S. at 715-716, 82 S.Ct. at 1296.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
