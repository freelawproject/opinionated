In 1958, Clarence Dillon assigned 72% of his life estate and contingent remainder in a Trust created by him in May 1932 to another trust created in June 1932 by his daughter, Anne Dillon. In consideration for this transfer, the taxpayer, the June 1932 trust, paid Clarence Dillon $1,232,030.18. In November 1961 taxpayer began amortizing this amount, using a straight line method, over a projected period of 6.21 years, then Clarence Dillon\u2019s life expectancy. During 1962, taxpayer received $526,373.05 as its share of income from the May 1932 trust. Of this amount, $58,291.79 of interest, eleven per cent of the total income, was wholly exempt from income taxes, having been derived from tax exempt sources. The remainder of the income was reported by taxpayer as dividends and as long-term capital gains. At the same time, taxpayer took the previously described amortization deduction in the amount of $198,-394.55. The Commissioner determined that of the amount taken as an amortization deduction the sum of $21,970.06, or 11% of the total taken, was not allowable as a deduction because it was al-locable to the tax-exempt income of $58,291.79, which was 11% of the total income of $526,373.05 the taxpayer, the June 1932 trust, derived from the May 1932 trust. On the basis of this conclusion the Commissioner determined a deficiency in the income tax of taxpayer in the amount of $19,057.44. The Commissioner\u2019s assertion of a deficiency, which taxpayer challenged by its Tax Court pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tition for a redetermination, was based upon the portion of Section 265 of the Internal Revenue Code which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">\u00a7 265. <em>Expenses and interest relating to tax-exempt income.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">No deduction shall be allowed for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">(1) <em>Expenses.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">Any amount otherwise allowable as a deduction which is allocable to one or more classes of income other than interest (whether or not any amount of income of that class or classes is received or accrued) wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by this subtitle, or any amount otherwise allowable under section 212 (relating to expenses for production of income) which is al-locable to interest (whether or not any amount of such interest is received or accrued) wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The Commissioner concedes that if the amortization claimed by taxpayer for the cost of its life estate is not \u201cany amount otherwise allowable under section 212,\u201d Section 265(1) is not effective to disallow the deduction of the portion of the amortization allocable to the tax-exempt income received by taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Section 212 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">\u00a7 212. <em>Expenses for production of income.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">In the ease of an individual, there shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-13\">il) for the production or collection of income;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-14\">(2) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-15\">(3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-16\">The Commissioner contends that, for the purposes of \u00a7 265(1), amortization of the cost of a life estate should be construed as falling within the ambit of \u00a7 212 in order to prevent what the enactment of \u00a7 265(1) sought to proscribe \u2014the equivalent of a \u201cdouble tax deduction\u201d through the acquisition of tax-exempt securities, income from which is not taxable. While we agree that the underlying purpose of \u00a7 265 is to prevent multiple tax benefits, Congress was explicit in limiting the disallowance to expenses covered by \u00a7 212 in the same legislative enactment where for the first time it provided for a deduction for depreciation on property held for the production of income not used in a trade or business. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 167(a) (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It cannot be disputed that an amortization deduction, being so closely analogous to depreciation, is properly allowable under \u00a7 167(a) (2) as \u201cexhaustion * * * of property held for the production of income.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See May T. Hrobon, 41 T.C. 476, 503 (1964); William N. Fry, Jr., 31 T.C. 522 (1958), aff\u2019d, 283 F.2d 869 (6 Cir. 1960), Acq.Rev.Rul. 62-132; Bell v. Harrison, 212 F.2d 253 (7 Cir. 1954), Aeq.Rev.Rul. 62-132; Wolff v. Commissioner, 7 T.C. 717, 721 (1946), Acq. 1947-1 Cum.Bull. 4; Floyd M. Shoe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>maker, 16 B.T.A. 1145, 1150 (1929); Elmer J. Keitel, 15 B.T.A. 903, 906-908 (1929).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Furthermore, it has been traditionally accepted that amortization does not fall within the usual meaning of \u201cexpenses,\u201d but is considered an exhaustion of a capital asset of limited income-producing duration. If amortization is an \u201cexpense,\u201d it follows that depreciation would also fall into that category, yet for a half-century Congress has deemed it necessary to provide for depreciation deductions separately from \u201cexpense\u201d deductions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Against this background the Commissioner\u2019s contention that, for the purpose of cases like the one at bar, \u201camortization\u201d and \u201cexpenses incurred in the production of income\u201d should merge in meaning must find support outside the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\"> The legislative history of the relevant enactments, however, is colorless. It does not indicate one way or the other why Congress chose to impose a limitation on \u00a7 212 expenses but chose not to impose the same limitation with regard to deductions for \u00a7 167(a) depreciation of non-business property. The Commissioner\u2019s argument on this point is at most one of policy. He argues in his brief that \u201cthere appears to be no logical reason why Congress, on one hand, would have intended to prohibit the allowance of non-business expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest, and, yet, on the other, allow non-business amortization deductions allocable to tax-exempt interest income.\u201d In urging us not to \u201cattribute irrationality to the drafters of the provision,\u201d the Commissioner refers us to J. C. Penney Co. v. C. I. R., 312 F.2d 65 (2 Cir. 1962) (Friendly, J.), a case in which our court held that Congress did not mean what it had said by a cross-reference in a section inserted in the 1954 Internal Revenue Code during a late stage of its passage. <em>J. C. Penney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>is clearly inapposite to the case at bar, however, for in that case there was a wealth of legislative history that demonstrated that the drafters could not possibly have meant what they wrote. When a statute is \u201cplain and unambiguous\u201d and there is no evidence of a contrary purpose than the purpose appearing in the precise terms of the statute it \u201ctranscends the judicial function\u201d to rewrite the statute to conform to considerations of policy. See Iselin v. United States, 270 U.S. 245, 250-251, 46 S.Ct. 248, 70 L.Ed. 566 (1926); Hanover Bank v. C. I. R., 369 U.S. 672, 687-688, 82 S.Ct. 1080, 8 L.Ed.2d 187 (1962). If the facts of this case demonstrate a tax loophole Congress, not the courts, should plug it.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-12\">. In 1942, Congress in \u00a7 121 of the then Revenue Act amended \u00a7 <em>23(l) </em>[now \u00a7 167] to provide for the first time a depreciation deduction for property held for the production of income and at the same time and in the same section, \u00a7 121, amended \u00a7 24(a) (5) [now \u00a7 265] to disallow deductions attributable to tax-exempt interest otherwise allowable under \u00a7 23(a) (2) [now \u00a7 212]. It seems unlikely, therefore, that Congress did not have \u00a7 23(1) [now \u00a7 167] in mind when it amended \u00a7 24(a) (5) [now \u00a7 265] ta-asmuch as both sections were amended at the same time in the same statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b724-18\">.

However, the provisions of these sections, among others, are special provisions dealing with narrowly defined expenditures posing unique tax problems. In the absence of the type of capital expenditure described therein, the depreciation or the amortization of a capital expenditure is governed by the general provisions of \u00a7 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">The Commissioner urges that where amortization is measured by the useful life of the taxpayer\u2019s interest in the property rather than measured by the useful life of the property, it should be treated as a \u201cdeferred expense,\u201d and therefore should logically be treated as a deduction falling within the terms of \u00a7 212. We do not agree, for the language of \u00a7 167, see note 2 <em>supra, </em>covers \u201cexhaustion\u201d in either instance, whether the exhaustion be over the property\u2019s useful life to the taxpayer or whether over the total useful life of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
