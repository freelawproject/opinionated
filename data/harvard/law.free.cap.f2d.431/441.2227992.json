To the extent that Glisson v. United States, 406 F.2d 423 (5th Cir. 1969) would find such a search or inspection constitutionally infirm, that decision is expressly overruled by this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>THORNBERRY, Circuit Judge, joined by Chief Judge JOHN R. BROWN, and WISDOM, Circuit Judge, concurring specially:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">We believe the inspection of serial numbers involved in this case were searches subject to the Fourth Amendment, but we concur in the result reached by the majority because we believe the searches were reasonable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-21\">. 413 F.2d 1396.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b500-5\">GODBOLD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"adr-dedup-0\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">I dissent from the conclusion that the \u201cinspections\u201d of the two vehicles were not searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In my view this conclusion is erroneous, and, in addition, was unnecessary to the decision because of the holding that if the \u201cinspections\u201d were searches they were reasonable. I pretermit discussion of reasonableness other than to say that I would remand for further development of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The original panel, and now the majority of the court en banc, seek to create a new doctrine under which the police are given access to the automobile of the citizen for the purpose of \u201cinspecting\u201d it in order to identify it. The means employed to create a right to \u201cfrisk\u201d an automobile is that which the Supreme Court rejected in considering \u201cstop and frisk\u201d of the person, in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), which is to carve out and isolate particular conduct from the reach of the Fourth Amendment by the semantic device of describing it as less than a \u201csearch\u201d or \u201cseizure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-15\">A search is no less a search because called an \u201cinspection\u201d or \u201cchecking.\u201d The mandate of the Constitution is not to be avoided by euphemisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\"><em>Terry </em>pointed the way by which in the encounter between police officer and citizen there can be achieved an appropriate balance giving due recognition to the governmental interest at stake and the citizen\u2019s interest in freedom from intrusion and in the security of his property. In <em>Terry </em>this was achieved by a narrowly drawn authority in the police officer to permit him to make a reasonable search sufficient to protect the governmental interest \u2014 in that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>a search for weapons to the extent necessary to protect the officer \u2014 regardless of whether the officer has probable cause to arrest for a crime. All was done within the standards of the Fourth Amendment. Thus police action of the character authorized remained subject to constitutional scrutiny. There was retained \u201cthe utility of limitations upon the scope, as well as the initiation, of police action as a means of constitutional regulation.\u201d 392 U.S. at 17, 88 S.Ct. at 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d at 903. Rather than follow <em>Terry </em>the majority have adopted the course which it rejected as inappropriate, the creation, by verbal characterization, of an enclave of police activity exempt from the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The per curiam decision of the court en banc tells us only that the decision of the panel was correct. As I understand the decision of the panel of three judges on the \u201cinspection\u201d issue, in the light of the facts, it is this: a police \u201cinspection\u201d of a motor vehicle to determine the doorpost identification number and the secret number (either or both) is not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, if\u2014 (1) the police officer is entitled to be on the premises where the vehicle is located; (2) the \u201cinspection\u201d does not damage the vehicle; (3) the inspecting officer has information sufficient in nature and reliability to give him a \u201clegitimate reason * * * to check the serial number.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Each inspection was made at the place where the vehicle was located. The pickup truck was in the yard of Johnson\u2019s home. The nature of the police custody of the Chevrolet Impala is not revealed by the panel or majority opinion. The briefs tell us that Johnson was arrested almost two weeks after the \u201cinspection\u201d of the pickup, that he brought the Impala to the jail and parked it in the county\u2019s impounded automobile lot, and that the FBI was notified of the arrest and an agent came to the jail and examined the car for the confidential number on the frame. Thus, as I understand it, the decision does not purport to allow an officer to seize a vehicle and remove it elsewhere in order to make his \u201cinspection.\u201d Nor is there involved in this case the constitutional propriety of a \u201cstop\u201d of a vehicle for purposes of \u201cinspecting\u201d it. This kind of investigative detention or seizure of a vehicle by means of either physical force or police authority (the practical effect of which often will be a restraint of liberty, at least temporary, of those in the vehicle), raises independent constitutional issues that are not presented by the \u201cinspection\u201d of Johnson\u2019s two vehicles, in each instance carried out where the police found it, parked and with no one in it. See <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 20, n. 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">On neither vehicle was there forced entry into a locked passenger compartment or motor compartment, by use of a key or otherwise. Thus I presume that the \u201cdamage\u201d limitation allows entry only where entry is otherwise available \u2014 by opening an unlocked door or lifting an unlocked hood \u2014 and does not allow any forcing of entry by physical force, picking locks, use of skeleton keys or similar means even though the means neither dents the metal nor breaks the glass. Obviously the forced entry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>whether by sledgehammer, skeleton key, or bent coat hanger, constitutes a much greater invasion of the citizen\u2019s privacy than the entry which consists only of opening an unlocked door or hood. If my understanding is wrong the majority have driven even a bigger hole in the Fourth Amendment than I think.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">I assume that \u201clegitimate reason * * * to check the serial number\u201d means \u201clegitimate reason to suspect that the car is stolen,\u201d which was the alleged \u201clegitimate reason\u201d in this instance, and not the whole world of police suspicion of people, places and events.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The majority decision does not rest upon the familiar power to search a vehicle incident to arrest of the occupants. It does not rest upon the war-rantless search of a mobile instrumentality for contraband.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It does not stand on the power to search for weapons and fruits of a crime where there is probable cause to do so. Chambers v. Ma-roney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 [June 22, 1970]. Since the decision is not limited to the Impala, it goes beyond the power of the police to identify an impounded vehicle to safeguard both owner and police.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">I return to the Fourth Amendment itself: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_Sq\">All that is necessary to constitute a search is an \u201cactual intrusion\u201d into what is constitutionally protected. The scope of what is protected is no longer analyzed in terms of common law property concepts or in physical or geographical terms, but in terms of the citizen\u2019s right to \u201cthe privacies of life\u201d \u2014 his \u201cright to be let alone.\u201d Texas v. Gonzales, 388 F.2d 145 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">* * * The landmark decision of Boyd v. United States, 1886, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746, first articulated the doctrine that the essence of the fourth amendment was protection against arbitrary intrusions into the privacies of life. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this principle in Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v. Hayden, 1967, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782, and went on to note that the Court has to an increasing extent discarded fictional property concepts in resolving the issues of privacy and public security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoD4\"><em>Id.) </em>at 147-148. In <em>Boyd </em>the Supreme Court phrased it thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-17\">The principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach farther than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions, on the part of the Government and its employees, of the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life. <em>It is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, </em>where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offense; it is the invasion of this sacred right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>which underlies and constitutes the essence of <em>Lord </em>Camden\u2019s judgment. Initial emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">116 U.S. at 630, 6 S.Ct. at 532, 29 L.Ed. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In his dissent in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 at 478, 48 S.Ct. 564, at 572, 72 L.Ed. 944 at 956 (1928), Justice Brand\u00e9is expressed it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">They [the makers of pur Constitution] conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone \u2014 the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">This court expressly recognized the \u201cright to be let alone\u201d in Brock v. United States, 223 F.2d 681 (5th Cir. 1955), holding it an illegal search to stand on a man\u2019s premises and look in his bedroom window hoping to obtain evidence that would give the basis for a search warrant to search the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 153-154, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543, 551-552 (1924), the Supreme Court considered this right in the particular context of the automobile.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">* * * It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor, and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search. Travelers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self-protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in. But those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is known to a competent official authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">This court has recognized that a search ordinarily implies an examination of an individual or of his property to discover contraband or evidence of some violation of the law, to be used in prosecution of a criminal action, United States v. Pennington, [No. 27213, 5th Cir., June 29, 1970]; Marshall v. United States, 422 F.2d 185 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">In a host of cases the movable nature of the automobile has been considered as a factor in determining whether a war-rantless search of an automobile is reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These cases do not suggest that \u201cinspecting\u201d or \u201cchecking\u201d an automobile is less than a search or that the movable character of an automobile causes it to be an \u201ceffect\u201d in which the citizen has no privacies of life and no right to be let alone. Rather they reiterate the applicability of the Fourth Amendment while finding standards of reasonableness less stringent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">The ubiquitous, movable and moving automobile has such overwhelming impact on modern American life that it is all too easy to slip into focusing on the <em>thing </em>subjected to police action, to fall unwittingly into the feeling that, after all, it doesn\u2019t amount to much to open a car door or lift the hood. But the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, 582 (1967). To attempt to decide whether an \u201carea\u201d, in the sense of a tangible place or thing (in <em>Katz, </em>a telephone booth) is constitutionally protected deflects attention from the genuine Fourth Amendment problem, which is protection of the interest of the citizen himself. <em>Id. </em>Paraphrasing <em>Boyd, </em>it is not the opening of the car door or the lifting of the hood that is the essence of the offense but \u201cthe invasion of [the citizen\u2019s] indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">\u201cThis inestimable [Fourth Amendment] right of personal security belongs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>as much to the citizen on the streets of our cities as to the homeowner closeted in his study to dispose of his secret affairs.\u201d <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 8-9, 88 S.Ct. at 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">And, as <em>Terry </em>points out, 392 U.S. at 12, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d at 900, the issue is not the abstract propriety of police conduct but the admissibility of evidence secured by the search. The rule excluding the evidence operates as the principal deterrent to unlawful police conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">However, as Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Katz </em>points out, to say that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not places is not enough. The citizen\u2019s right to privacy is not subjectively absolute for each person but must be viewed in terms of reasonable expectation of being let alone. Thus, Justice Harlan contrasts the privacy of one\u2019s home, or of the telephone booth with the door closed, with objects, activities or statements carried on in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We are not told by either opinion in this case why the lesser \u201clegitimate reason\u201d standard<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applies to invading the citizen\u2019s property for the purpose of making an identification, while other and more stringent standards apply to invading it for other reasons which may be much more compelling. Society has no less interest, perhaps even greater interest, in \u201cinspecting\u201d suspicious cars for guns, stolen money and narcotics than in \u201cinspecting\u201d them for identification numbers. If the emphasis is upon the \u201cthing,\u201d the bank robber with guns and money in his car, or narcotics trafficker with drugs, has no more reasonable expectation of privacy in those items than has the car thief in his door plate, perhaps even less. But the officers in Chambers v. Maroney were not authorized to \u201cinspect\u201d the cars for guns, money, green sweater and trench coat because they had a \u201clegitimate reason.\u201d They could invade the citizen\u2019s right to be let alone, and to have his car let alone, because \u2014 and only because \u2014 there was probable cause to examine the car for guns and weapons, stemming from the same circumstances that constituted probable cause for arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">In his dissenting opinion in <em>Chambers, </em>Justice Harlan suggests that probable cause is never alone sufficient to search without a warrant, but that other and exigent circumstances are required. Thus under all views articulated in <em>Chambers, </em>there has to be at least probable cause for the police officer to override the citizen\u2019s right to have his property free from governmental invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">\u201cProbable cause\u201d is not a mere shibboleth to be cavalierly discarded.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-12\">The requirement of probable cause has roots that are deep in our history. The general warrant, in which the name of the person to be arrested was left blank, and the writs of assistance, against which James Otis inveighed, both perpetuated the oppressive practice of allowing the police to arrest and search on suspicion. Police control took the place of judicial control, since no showing of \u201cprobable cause\u201d before a magistrate was required. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted June 12, 1776, rebelled against that practice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">\u201cThat general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>named, or whose offence is not particularly described and supported by evidence are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Maryland Declaration of Rights (1776), Art. XXIII, was equally emphatic :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cThat all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants \u2014 to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in special \u2014 are illegal, and ought not to be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">And see North Carolina Declaration of Rights (1776), Art XI; Pennsylvania Constitution (1776), Art X; Massachusetts Constitution (1780), Pt I, Art XIV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">That philosophy later was reflected in the Fourth Amendment. And as the early American decisions both before and immediately after its adoption show, common rumor or report, suspicion, or even \u201cstrong reason to suspect\u201d was not adequate to support a warrant for arrest. And that principle has survived to this day. See United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 593-595, [68 S.Ct. 222, 227, 228], 92 L.Ed. 210, 219, 220; Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-15, [68 S.Ct. 367, 368, 369], 92 L.Ed. 436, 439-441; Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480, 486, [78 S.Ct. 1245, 1252], 2 L.Ed.2d 1503, 1509. Its high water was Johnson v. United States (US) supra, where the smell of opium coming from a closed room was not enough to support an arrest and search without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98 at 100-101, 80 S.Ct. 168 at 170, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 at 137-138 (1959). The discard of the requirement of probable cause gives to the police officer <em>greater </em>authority to initiate police action than could be exercised by a dispassionate magistrate requested to issue a search warrant. This police authority is all the more dubious when it is coupled with the absence of constitutional regulation over the scope of what has been initiated (except by the awkward and artificial device of saying that at some point the \u201cinvestigation\u201d has progressed so far that it has become a search.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">An argument can be constructed that there is a difference where the police invasion is to seek identification numbers. <em>I.e., </em>because identification numbers, secret and otherwise, are for identification purposes the citizen can have no reasonable expectation of their remaining private \u2014 they are for identification, <em>ergo, </em>the citizen must expect them to be available to the police for the purpose for which intended. But the function of being an identification device does not exempt the device itself, or the instrumentality it identifies, from the Fourth Amendment. In our increasingly complex world our motor vehicles are not the only things numbered for identification. So are such tangible effects as household appliances, lawn mowers, outboard motors, and even the watches on our wrists. Add to the list such papers and documents kept in home, safe deposit box or on the person, as bank checks, drivers\u2019 licenses, social security cards, credit cards, insurance policies, securities, and deeds and mortgages, and the automobile registration papers often carried in the glove compartment of the car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All of these items have primary or secondary qualities of identification, but this does not subject them, when not in plain view, to being sought out by police action beyond the reach of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>It is revealing to retrace the route which has led from an uncertain and doubt-filled one-sentence remark on a side issue in a dissenting opinion to a new principle of constitutional dimension. Simpson v. United States, 346 F.2d 291 (10th Cir. 1965), held unconstitutional a warrantless search for vehicle identification numbers, for which purpose the FBI agent entered the car. The court held it \u201cha[d] every aspect of the classic but prohibited exploratory search for evidence of crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295. A later obtained cellophane tape impression of the secret number also was held invalid. The case was reheard en banc on the issue of standing. Two dissenters were chiefly concerned with that issue, but also they said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\">* * * Possibly what I am saying is that the obtaining of a serial number from a motor vehicle is not a search at. all. If it is not, we reach the same result as though it were a reasonable search within the meaning of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">It is no answer to say that a rule contrary to that adopted here would permit an indiscreet officer to promiscuously search automobiles with immunity and that the laws must apply equally to the guilty as to those who are not guilty. If a search of an automobile is made without probable cause, one having the right to complain may recover damages and suppress any incriminating evidence which is seized. Such remedies are equally available to a guilty person, provided he has the right to question the search.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Next came Cotton v. United States, 371 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1967), and United States v. Graham, 391 F.2d 439 (6th Cir. 1968). In the present case the panel relied on these two cases but eschewed either discussion or analysis of them. In <em>Cotton </em>the car was in police custody, taken over under circumstances in which the officer would have been derelict in his duty to safeguard it had he left it unattended in the middle of the night in a dark alley. After the suspect was arrested (an arrest not held invalid) and taken to the station, the single, arresting officer waited at the scene for a tow truck and filled out a \u201ctow slip\u201d with a description of the car, including the serial number, which he obtained by opening the door. On the \u201ctow slip\u201d he acknowledged his responsibility for the vehicle and the property in it. As to his examination of the car, the decision rests squarely on his duty to make and keep a record of impounded property. \u201c[T]he mere opening of the door of the car <em>for the purpose of making such a record </em>[is not], under the circumstances, a search, but if it was, the circumstances under which it was done make that search an entirely reasonable one.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 371 F.2d at 392. A second examination of the car was made later the same morning at the police pound by an FBI agent, who also secured the doorpost number by opening the door. The court held, \u201cit is not a search at all, under such circumstances as we have here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\"><em>Cotton </em>is understandable because an accused has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his property, once the police have taken it into custody pursuant to their duty to safeguard it, and must protect .the property and themselves by making a record of that for which they have assumed responsibility. But this has not the slightest application to Johnson\u2019s pickup truck, \u201cinspected\u201d in the yard of his home in his absence. And probably it has nothing to do with the FBI agent\u2019s examination of Johnson\u2019s ear in the lot at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The \u201clegitimate reason\u201d verbiage employed in the present case originated in <em>Cotton </em>in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s discussion of the second examination of the ear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>371 F.2d at 393. But the Ninth Circuit relied upon what the dissenters had said in a single sentence of <em>Simpson, </em>and the Ninth Circuit did not note that the dissenters had recognized that there had to be probable cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Graham </em>is the same type of case as <em>Cotton, </em>on which it relies. The court found there was no search on the ground the cars were at the police station, lawfully in custody for safekeeping, a custody lawfully obtained from a suspect lawfully arrested so that no right of privacy had been breached.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 391 F.2d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In this circuit, in United States v. Greer, 297 F.Supp. 1265 (N.D.Miss.1969), District Judge Keady has given to <em>Cotton </em>and <em>Graham </em>the careful analysis which this court has declined to give. <em>Greer </em>is remarkably similar on the facts to Johnson\u2019s pickup. Officers went to the home of a suspect, without a warrant, to obtain the vehicle identification number of an automobile they suspected was stolen. They were given the keys by the suspect\u2019s wife, unlocked the car and took the doorpost number. The government contended the examination was not a search. Judge Keady held that it was a search. He recognized that <em>Cotton </em>and <em>Graham </em>were limited to the situation in which the automobile is in safekeeping or is already otherwise lawfully available to the policeman. In language which applies precisely to Johnson\u2019s pickup he held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">In short, those decisions cited by the government serve not to foreclose defendant\u2019s contention, but rather to bolster it. The undisputed facts here are that FBI agents entered without warrant upon private, protected property of one in possession of an automobile which they examined in order to confirm a mere suspicion that it had been stolen. The defendant had not been arrested, had in no way consented to any search of his private property and was absent when the examination took place. Their activity clearly constituted a \u201csearch\u201d protected by the Fourth Amendment. That being true, law officers \u201cmust justify their conduct before courts which have always been, and must be, jealous of the individual\u2019s right of privacy within the broad sweep of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 66, 70 S.Ct. 430, 435, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950). Under the totality of the circumstances surrounding the examination of the automobile by Agents Neely and Mearas, the search, made without justification or necessity, was unreasonable, requiring the suppression of any evidence obtained therefrom. Holzhey v. United States, 223 F.2d 823 (5th Cir. 1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">297 F.Supp. at 1269. Mrs. Greer\u2019s consent, by giving the keys, was at least as broad as Mrs. Johnson\u2019s insofar as giving some sort of right to be on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Weaver v. United States, 374 F.2d 878 (5th Cir. 1967), is a slender reed. The accused, under a state arrest not held unlawful, voluntarily gave an FBI agent a copy of his automobile registration, showing the identification number. Subsequently local police opened the car door and the agent observed the doorpost number and saw it to be the same. Later the FBI agents furnished the number to Georgia officials, who arrested the accused when he appeared there, and it developed that the vehicle was stolen. This court held that the identification number, used to initiate the government\u2019s case, was not illegally obtained because voluntarily supplied by the accused from an independent, lawful source. In an elliptical dictum, the court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">Because of our ruling that the evidence sought to be suppressed was obtained from an independent, lawful source, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the visual search by Lou-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>derman was illegal or not. However, the method which Agent Louderman used to obtain the public identification number of the vehicle was nothing more than a routine questioning of a person arrested from out of the state. His subsequent checking of the number of the vehicle was mere routine. In this highly motorized age with millions of vehicles traversing the nation\u2019s highways and the mounting number of automobile thefts and related crimes, it would tax the imagination if we were to consider <em>under these circumstances </em>[emphasis added] that a visual inspection by an FBI agent of a car identification number constituted a search, much less an illegal search. The Fourth Amendment constitutional prohibition is against <em>unreasonable </em>[emphasis in original] searches and seizures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 882. This is hardly a square decision that an \u201cinspection\u201d is not a search. But if the <em>Weaver </em>dictum has any scope, it is far less sweeping than what is articulated in the instant case. Weaver voluntarily gave the FBI agent a copy of his Georgia registration showing the car\u2019s identification number. The agent told Weaver he wanted to make a routine check of the car, and there was no evidence that Weaver objected. <em>Id. </em>at 880. Weaver had little expectation of privacy left.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In United States v. Nikrasch, 367 F.2d 740 (7th Cir. 1966), there was no evidence of police impounding or inventorying. The defendant and his female companion were arrested for disorderly conduct, and he drove his own car to the station, and on the officer\u2019s request gave him his keys. Hours later another officer examined both doorpost and secret numbers. The Seventh Circuit held the warrantless searches were unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">In Massey v. United States, 358 F.2d 782 (10th Cir. 1966) the Tenth Circuit held valid a doorpost search because incident to arrest, but invalidated a search for the secret number conducted the next day at a garage (the government conceded this search was illegal).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The decision that an \u201cinspection\u201d is less than a search is, of course, a rule of convenience. The government commences its brief with recitals of the growing number of stolen car cases and its need to be able to identify them. The argument of the utility of a search (by whatever euphemism styled) as a means to detect offenders by discovering evidence is not something new and relating only to automobiles. It was made to Lord Camden in 1765, and in his memorable opinion in Entick v. Carrington,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> described by our Supreme Court as \u201cone of the landmarks of English liberty,\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">This is not to say that the governmental interest does not require and deserve protection or that it does not represent a sensitive aand important area of police activity. The problem is safeguarding the government\u2019s interest in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution and does the least damage to the citizen\u2019s right to be free from governmental scrutiny, intrusion and examination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">This case peculiarly exemplifies the value of the consideration expressed in <em>Terry, </em>that taking police conduct outside the Fourth Amendment by semantic distinctions \u201csuggest[s] a rigid all-or-nothing model of justification and regulation under the Amendment, it obscures the utility of limitations upon the scope, as well as the initiation, of police action as a means of constitutional regulation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>392 U.S. at 17, 88 S.Ct. at 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d at 903. Without analysis or discrimination the majority progress from the doorplate \u2014 placed there for anyone to see upon the opening of a door which in daily use of the car will be opened many <em>times </em>\u2014 to the confidential number, placed on the vehicle in a location known generally only to law enforcement officers. In this case, as to the blue Corvette of Count One:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">* * * This agent had the serial number and the motor number of Johnson\u2019s blue Corvette, taken from a confidential location on the frame of the vehicle. By the use of gasoline he cleaned off the numbers, rubbed fingerprint ink over them, laid over a piece of scotch tape, picked up the ink, laid it across a white piece of paper, and by that method could read the number. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Any attorney who has tried many Dyer Act cases is familiar with the use of paint removers, grease-dissolving solvents, steam cleaning, lifting the car on a hoist, cellophane tape, and even detection devices<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to find and \u201clift\u201d the secret number.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">As a result of the decision in this case, the allowable limits of the police action are to be measured not by familiar Fourth Amendment standards but by a new body of law which eventually will have to say that at some point the \u201cinspection\u201d for the number will become so invasive and pervasive that \u201cjust identifying\u201d will become \u201csearching.\u201d Similarly, one can foresee \u2014 and the cloud on the horizon is considerably bigger than a man\u2019s hand \u2014 the coming argument over the item observed for the first time in plain view when the door is opened to \u201cinspect\u201d the doorplate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Litigants, even our government, do not direct what and how courts decide. But there need be no misunderstanding about what the government has in mind about automobile searches. Its brief for this case en banc includes these contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">(1) \u201cLegitimate reason\u201d is less than probable cause to assume a vehicle is stolen. It includes \u201csuspicious circumstances of a minimum kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">(2) The power to make the \u201cinspection\u201d for identification carries with it the power to stop the vehicle for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-17\">(3) If the \u201cinspection\u201d discloses that the car is stolen the operator can be arrested, the car impounded and a generalized search of the car carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The camel\u2019s nose has become a large camel very quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The language of <em>Boyd </em>is especially apropos:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">* * * It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A21Y\">116 U.S. at 635, 6 S.Ct. at 535, 29 L.Ed. at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">. \u201c * * * There is some suggestion in the use of such terms as \u2018stop\u2019 and \u2018frisk\u2019 that such police conduct is outside the purview of the Fourth Amendment because neither action rises to the level of a \u2018search\u2019 or \u2018seizure\u2019 within the meaning of the Constitution.12 We emphatically reject this notion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\u201c12.
