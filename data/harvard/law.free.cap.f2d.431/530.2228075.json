The trial court also found that the Commissary was inseparable from retail outlets and was thus entitled to the \u201cretail establishment\u201d exemption under Section 13(a) (2) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 213(a) (2). The court also held that the work performed by employees handling incoming (interstate) shipments was \u201cinconsequential and occasional\u201d as a further basis for denying relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The Secretary of Labor brought the action against Kip for violating both the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Sections 6(b) (1), 7(a) (2) and 15(a) (2), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 206 et seq. While there are some disagreements as to the exact facts, the trial court did not adequately deal with the factual dispute issue because it concluded that \u201cthe first consideration in this case is the definition of \u2018Enterprise,\u2019 that Kip was not an \u2018Enterprise\u2019 \u201d and was, therefore, not covered by the Act. Prior to the 1967 amendment 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203(s) (1) an enterprise as defined by the Act and relevant here had to have (1) one or more retail or service establishments with an annual gross volume of sales not less than $1,000,000 and received or purchased goods for resale that move or have moved across state lines which amount in total amount to $250,000 or more.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was submitted to the district court stipulating that Kip owned nine restaurants, a warehouse and a commissary and that Kip\u2019s gross annual dollar volume of sales was in excess of $1,000,001 in each of the three calendar years in question \u2014 July 19, 1964 through July 19, 1966 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties did not stipulate as to the $250,000 interstate commerce flow requirements but submitted stipulated records denominated \u201cinvoices\u201d representing total direct purchases by Kip\u2019s warehouse or commissary in Dallas, Texas, from places located outside of the State of Texas 7-18-64 through 8-17-66. These documents <em>themselves </em>did not establish the $250,000 requirement for any of the three time periods. The three time periods used by the Secretary were July 18, 1964 through February 28, 1965; March 1, 1965 through February 27, 1966 and February 28, 1966 through August 17, 1966. These dates, or rather the February date, was used because it was the \u201cend-date\u201d of the company\u2019s fiscal year. For the 64-65 period, the stipulated records themselves, proved a $96,622.36 \u201cinflow;\u201d the 1965-66 period records proved a $174,052.95 \u201cinflow\u201d and the 1966-67 period records proved $106,953.-64 of direct purchase from outside the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">Appellee argues that this should be the extent of permissible proof\u2014 the documentary evidence. This limitation is without merit. The statute does not limit the computation of the $250,-000 goods to those purchased directly by the employer from a place or places located outside the State of Texas, but takes into consideration also goods which were purchased <em>indirectly </em>from places outside the State of Texas. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Wirtz v. Melos Construction Corp., (2nd Cir., 1969) 408 F.2d 626, where a purely New York construction corporation purchased its material solely from dealers in New York, which the dealers had purchased from out of state dealers, in another form, i.e., raw stage, the court, in construing similar interstate commerce language, held that \u201cthe legislation was designed to regulate enterprises dealing in articles <em>acquired intrastate </em>after travel in interstate commerce is indicated by the fact that the Senate report also notes that \u2018[t]he constitutional power of Congress under the commerce clause to exercise authority with respect to articles that have completed an interstate shipment and are being held for future sales in purely local or intrastate commerce is also settled. * * * \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Therefore, it appears clear that the only test is that \u201cgoods amounting to $250,000 a year must be purchased or received for resale and have moved across state lines <em>at some stage in the flow of commerce to the retailer.\u201d 2 </em>U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 1961, p. 1645. The issue, therefore, becomes whether the Secretary\u2019s proof on indirect purchases when added to the proven direct sales met the $250,000 \u201cinflow\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Based on all the available information which the Secretary had, he developed a formula which involved the theoretical application of percentiles to the gross sales of the appellee Kip\u2019s Big Boy. In short, the appellants\u2019 expert reconstructed interstate purchases by establishing that during the period from July 18, 1964 to February 28, 1965 direct and indirect inflow represented 7.35 percent of the defendant\u2019s gross sales of approximately $4,000,000. However, the trial court held that these figures did not represent the gross sales for these years. The court found that the gross sales for July 1964 to February 1965 were $3,-225,590.63 and that the gross sales for 1965 was $3,702,269.71 and that \u201cassuming the validity of the percentile method of determining inflow * * * \u201d the annual interstate purchases for these years would be less than the $250,000 requirement. The difficulty with the court\u2019s reasoning is that with a known figure of \u201cinflow\u201d of $317,512 and gross sales of a smaller amount, the percentage would be larger, rather than smaller. Thus, when the percentage was applied to gross sales for subsequent periods to test the proportion of total sales represented by \u201cinflow\u201d it is clear that Secretary\u2019s expert witness properly used a percentage figure of 9.14. The trial court\u2019s opinion reflects the mistake of the court, for the court adjusted the gross sales figure without reflecting an adjustment in the percentage figure as was done at trial by the Secretary\u2019s expert witness. The court does not explain in its opinion why it used 7.35% as opposed to 9.14%. Clearly if the 9.14 figure is accepted and used, the Secretary met his $250,000 inflow test for 1964 and 1965. Moreover, even mathematically the court erred in finding that 7.35% of $3,702,369.79 for 1965 did not exceed $250,000. It is $272,124.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">For the calendar year 1966, a purchase analysis showed direct interstate purchases in the amount of $106,953.64. This figure represents purchase for only February 28, 1966, through August 17, 1966. The court held that \u201cit cannot be presumed that interstate purchases continued at the same rate subsequent to August 17, 1966.\u201d However, Kip\u2019s testified that the interstate purchases were generally consistent from year to year. It appears clear from the court\u2019s opinion that it really rejected the Secretary\u2019s method of proof for in speaking of the 1966 year proof, the court held: \u201cIt cannot be presumed that interstate purchases continued at the same rate subsequent to August 17, 1966, and that the <em>total amount </em>of annual \u2018inflow\u2019 purchases should have been the subject of documentary evidence and such proof has not been made by the plaintiff for the balance of 1966.\u201d We conclude that, on the record, adequate proof was made for the year 1966, both based on the assumed direct rate of interstate purchases for the remaining months of the year 1966 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>on the percentage of sales method of computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">It appears clear that the Secretary\u2019s method of proof should be accepted, for obviously some method other than documentary evidence has to be accepted for indirect purchases. If the Secretary\u2019s method is in fact consistent with approved accounting methods, and this was testified to without contradiction, there is no reason why the court should not recognize it. It also appears that the Secretary did carry out his duty as outlined by this court in Foremost Dairies v. Ivey, (5th Cir., 1953) 204 F.2d 186, that the Secretary based upon the record produced below and the <em>reasonable </em>inferences applicable thereto [i.e., percentile formulas] must establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The trial court in its Supplemental Memorandum Opinion also erred in holding that the activities of Kip\u2019s male commissary employees were \u201ctoo inconsequential and Occasional\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to bring them within the Act\u2019s coverage of employees working in interstate commerce. It is undisputed that the male employees at the commissary worked exclusively in the preparation of food and related activities at least 98% of their time. The court found that four of the male employees placed goods on Kip\u2019s shelves after they had moved in interstate commerce and had been placed on their dock by non-Kip employees. Spices were delivered once a week and took one man less than five minutes to place on the storeroom shelves; paper products were delivered once a month and took two men a half hour to load upon the storeroom shelves; comic books took the time of two men twenty minutes a week; shrimp was delivered once a month and took three men forty-five minutes to store and cracker meal was delivered once a month and required one hour for two men to store. Relish was placed on shelves at the rate of two men for forty-five minutes once a month. In short, Kip\u2019s male employees regularly worked an average of not less than ten hours per month in interstate commerce. Moreover, Kip\u2019s employees reloaded much of the goods to send out to its retail outlets.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In Mitchell v. C &amp; P Shoe Corp., (5th Cir., 1960) 286 F.2d 109, this court held that where shoes were delivered to the store\u2019s shoe company warehouse and loaded on the dock by the driver of the truck and the employees of the company stored them, took inventory and delivered them to local shoe stores, that the employees were engaged in interstate commerce. See Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 317 U.S. 564, 567, 63 S.Ct. 72, 87 L.Ed. 499 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Although the courts, in dealing with the \u201cengaged in interstate commerce\u201d language of the Fair Labor Standards Act have held that the language is not co-extensive with the limits of power of Congress over commerce, Walling v. American Stores Co. (7th Cir., 1943), 133 F.2d 840, nevertheless, the phrase \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d in the chapter, where applicable to employees engaged in commerce, \u201ccovers every employee <em>\u2018in the channels, of interstate commerce\u2019 </em>as distinguished from those who merely affect that commerce.\u201d McLeod v. Threlk-eld, 319 U.S. 491, 63 S.Ct. 1248, 87 L.Ed. 1538 [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Here, appellee concedes that approximately one percent of the total work week of the four male employees was spent in storing \u201cgoods which had moved in commerce.\u201d In spite of the trial court\u2019s statement that this activity was \u201coccasional,\u201d it is undisputed that it was regular and repetitive each week and each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">We conclude that the term \u201csubstantial\u201d here is to be given its connotative meaning; that is to say, substantial is not to be determined by looking at the number of hours work but the regularity of the work. \u201cThe line must be between activities purely local in nature, done on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>an infrequent, isolated, sporadic basis by the employees. * * * \u201d Wirtz v. Ferguson (5th Cir., 1963) 317 F.2d 343, 346. That is to say that the regularity of the employee doing assigned interstate work which is necessary to the normal operation of the purely intrastate business should determine if the employee is substantially engaged in interstate commerce, not the exact number of hours spent, for if Kip\u2019s Big Boy were not able to receive and store its shrimp, etc. when they were regularly received, it would <em>substantially </em>damage the business. Moreover, this court has held in Ivey v. Foremost Dairies, Inc., (5th Cir., 1953) that the provisions of the Act apply to employees who spend one percent of their time in commerce.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">This approach is necessary, because an employer whose business is purely local could avoid the \u201cemployee engaged in commerce\u201d provision of the Act by assigning receipt of goods which have moved in interstate commerce to a hundred different employees where the work would normally take two full time employees regularly receiving goods by contending that each of the one hundred employees only spends one-half hour per week receiving goods and therefore their handling goods which had moved in interstate commerce was \u201cinconsequential and occasional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appellant also argues that the court erred in holding that Kip\u2019s central commissary is a retail establishment whose employees are exempt under Section 13(a) (2) of the Act. Kip argues first that \u201cthe employees who regularly worked in the commissary were not engaged by a separate corporate entity but rather were members of a family of nearly 1,000 employees * * That means nothing, as continuity in ownership is not controlling. We must look to the jobs being performed. Mitchell v. Sunshine Department Stores, Inc., 292 F.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Also, the fact that the work prepared by the employees is termed \u201cunfinished\u201d food items is not controlling. To say that hamburger patties are unfinished just because they were not cooked is applying a unique definition of \u201cunfinished.\u201d What appellant should have stated was that the food items were \u201cunprepared\u201d for particular customers\u2019 consumption. Under any interpretation, \u201cshied cheese,\u201d \u201cprepared beef chili\u201d and \u201cmade salad dressings\u201d are finished food items.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Appellee admits in its brief that \u201cIt is recognized by the appellee that the great bulk of all the case law dealing with exemptions and the applicability of the exemption to central offices, central warehouses or central processing facilities deny the application of the exemption * * * \u201d This is the holding of this court in Mitchell v. Sunshine Department Stores, <em>supra. </em>Appellee has not made a valid distinction between Kip\u2019s and the employers in the cases decided by this and other courts. See Phillips, Inc. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 494-496, 65 S.Ct. 807, 89 L.Ed. 1095. The trial court erred in holding that the retail store exemption applied to this commissary and warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">Therefore, the judgment of the trial court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\">. The $250,000 inflow requirements was eliminated by the 1966 amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b590-14\">. Only Kip\u2019s employees in its central office, warehouse and commissary are alleged to be covered by the Act, not the restaurant employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b593-13\">. While neither the district court\u2019s findings nor the Court of Appeals opinion state the precise percent of time spent by each employee, the employee\u2019s answer to the complaint made the one percent assertion. See, 106 F.Supp. 793 <em>(W.D. </em>La.1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-11\">.
