On this appeal from the conviction, defendant\u2019s principal argument brings into question the instruction the trial court gave with regard to defendant\u2019s insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">Defendant\u2019s trial took place prior to our in banc decision in Wade v. United States, 426 F.2d 64 (9th Cir. 1970), where we adopted, in part, the American Law Institute insanity test as set forth in Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01 (Final Draft 1962). Consequently, the trial court instructed the jury in terms generally analogous to the modified M\u2019Naghten standard that controlled in this circuit prior to <em>Wade. See, e. g., </em>Ramer v. United States, 390 F.2d 564 (9th Cir. 1968); Sauer v. United States, 241 F.2d 640 (9th Cir. 1957). Now, since Porter\u2019s appeal falls within the scope of Wade\u2019s limited retroactivity, he asserts that the trial court\u2019s instructions require a reversal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">Our study of the record convinces us that, even under the <em>Wade </em>standard, defendant would not have made out a viable insanity defense. The four Government psychiatrists who testified all expressed the opinion that defendant\u2019s substantial mental difficulties developed <em>after </em>the commission of the crime. According to these witnesses, defendant\u2019s mental deterioration began to develop with his arrest the next morning when defendant came under the threat of a return to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\">The Government experts stressed defendant\u2019s rational capabilities at the time of the crime, as evidenced by his use of a disguise, his awareness of possible alarm systems, and other factors suggesting mental alertness. These witnesses expressed, most emphatically, the opinion that defendant was sane at the time the crime was committed (e. g., \u201cno reasonable doubt\u201d of his sanity; defendant had \u201cfull control over what he was doing\u201d). Thus the Government\u2019s evidence established, almost conclusively, that defendant would not have been able to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that he lacked \u201csubstantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 4.01 (Final Draft 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Defendant offered no significant evidence to contradict the opinions of the Government psychiatrists as to when his mental illness developed or as to his mental balance at the time of the crime. Accordingly, we believe that the jury could not properly have acquitted him under our new insanity test, or under any other standard for that matter. It follows that the failure to instruct in terms of the new Ninth Circuit insanity test was harmless error. <em>See </em>Maxwell v. United States, 368 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Defendant asserts that an informal observation of the trial court made to the jury at the close of the insanity instruction, quoted in the margin, left the jury free to define insanity \u201caccording to their subjective belief.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">While the quoted observation was neither necessary nor helpful to the jury, we do not believe it was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Defendant also contends that the trial court erred in failing to include, in its insanity instruction, the last paragraph of the <em>Mathes &amp; Devitt </em>pattern instruction on insanity. This paragraph covers the burden of producing evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The trial court in fact gave no specific instruction on the absence of a duty on the part of the defendant to produce witnesses or evidence on insanity or on any other specific issue. However, we believe that the court\u2019s repeated instructions on the Government\u2019s burden to prove every element, including sanity, beyond a reasonable doubt adequately conveyed to the jury the thought that defendant had no burden to produce evidence as to his insanity. <em>See </em>Sullivan v. United States, 414 F.2d 714, 716 et seq. (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-16\">In addition, to giving a general insanity instruction, the trial court gave the following instruction on the intent element of the offense for which defendant was charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-17\">\u201cWith respect to crimes such as charged in this case, specific intent must be proved before there can be a conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-18\">\u201cSpecific intent, as the term itself suggests, requires more than a mere general intent to engage in certain conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-19\">\u201cA person who knowingly does an act which the law forbids, or knowingly fails to do an act which the law requires, intending with bad purpose either to disobey or to disregard the law, may be found to act with specific intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">Defendant argues that the trial court committed plain error when, despite its promise to do so, it failed to instruct the jury further that even if they should find sanity beyond a reasonable doubt, they must also consider all the evidence to determine whether the mind of the accused was capable of forming specific intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, defendant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tends that a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense applies to the charge against him, since a specific intent was required, and that he was entitled to the <em>Mathes &amp; Devitt </em>instruction on that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Defendant was charged and convicted under the first paragraph of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), which requires proof of either force and violence, or intimidation. The first paragraph does not require, as does the second, \u201cintent to commit * * * any felony * *</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Defendant does not assert that the evidence was insufficient as to the necessary elements of the paragraph under which he was charged. Where a person has the mental capacity for criminal responsibility, proof that he took property of another by force or violence, or by intimidation, necessarily establishes the required criminal intent, whether or not characterized as \u201cspecific\u201d intent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here the trial court not only gave a complete instruction dealing with the insanity defense, but also a separate windfall instruction on \u201cspecific\u201d intent. While the court did not instruct on the concept of \u201cdiminished capacity,\u201d this was not required under the decisions of this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the instructions did not, in our opinion, make it seem that the only state of mind required was sanity. When considered together with the insanity defense instructions, the specific intent instruction informed the jury that a mere finding of sanity was not sufficient to warrant a guilty verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Finally, defendant argues that his trial counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance when his total conduct is considered. He cites nine examples of action or inaction on the part of his trial attorney, as demonstrating the inadequacy of his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Defendant did not bring this matter to the attention of the trial court and seek a ruling thereon, either during the course of the trial or on motion for a new trial. Thus he does not complain of any trial court ruling in this regard. Arguments of this kind are ordinarily advanced for the first time in collateral proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>cause they usually require the development of facts outside the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Nevertheless, if it was evident during the trial that defendant\u2019s legal representation was so inadequate as obviously to deny him his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, or to deny him a fair trial in the due process sense, the failure of the trial court to take note sua sponte of the problem might constitute plain error which may be considered on direct appeal. Moreover, even absent a plain-error factor, this court has, on occasion, examined such a contention on the merits in an appeal from a conviction, even where no trial court ruling is complained of. <em>See </em>Bouchard v. United States, 344 F.2d 872, 874-875 (9th Cir. 1965); Reid v. United States, 334 F.2d 915, 919 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We have accordingly elected to examine this contention on the merits and are convinced that defendant\u2019s legal representation at trial was adequate in the constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-14\">. Defendant failed to meet the requirements of Fed.R.ules Crim.P. 30 <em>by </em>objecting to the trial court\u2019s insanity instructions before the jury retired. Ordinarily this would mean that defendant would be entitled to reversal only if plain error could be shown. However, as we stated recently in United States v. Wanger, 426 F.2d 1360 (9th Cir. 1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-21\">\u201cThe appellant did not forfeit his rights under <em>Wade </em>by failing to object to jury instructions which applied the law as it was firmly established prior to <em>Wade x x X\u201d</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b67-10\">. The trial court\u2019s aside to the jury was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">\u201cIn other words, very simply stated\u2014 you know, lawyers and judges have to take words, words, words to explain something. That has come down historically and has become an antiquated thing with lawyers and judges, and I don\u2019t know how we will ever change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\u201cJust put in very simple words, a person who is insane at the time he commits an act is just not held responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-13\">. The paragraph reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">\u201cIn considering the mental state of the accused, the jury will always bear in mind that the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden or duty of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">W. Mathes &amp; E. Devitt, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, \u00a7 10.14 at 112-113 (1968 Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b67-23\">. The promised but omitted instruction was \u00a7 10.15 of <em>Mathes &amp; Devitt, </em>note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-24\">As in the case of the trial court's insanity instruction, defendant failed to make a timely objection on this point. However, we nevertheless reach the merits, since in our opinion, had the trial court failed to instruct the jury correctly on the intent element, plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>would be indicated. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Rybicki, 403 F.2d 599, 602-604 (6th Cir. 1968); Liles v. United States, 129 U.S.App.D.C. 268, 393 F.2d 669, 670 (1967). <em>Cf. </em>Powell v. United States, 347 F.2d 156, 158 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">. Defendant cites three cases for the proposition that specific intent is an element of the offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113 (a). None defines what specific intent means in this context, and two did not even deal with the statutory language under which defendant was indicted. The first, Nagell v. United States, 392 F.2d 934, 938 (5th Cir. 1968), dealt with the second paragraph of section 2113(a), a crime for which defendant was not charged in this case. <em>See also </em>Wright v. United States, 389 F.2d 996, 1000 (8th Cir. 1968). The second interpreted a District of Columbia robbery statute, not the act in question. Byrd v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 342 F.2d 939, 940-941 (1965). And, although the third case makes the assumption that specific intent is an element under the first paragraph of section 2113(a), there is no discussion of the issue. Caples v. United States, 391 F.2d 1018, 1022-1023 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b68-11\">. The Fourth Circuit apparently recognizes such a defense, Rhodes v. United States, 282 F.2d 59, 60-61 and accompanying notes (4th Cir. 1960), as does California. <em>See </em>authorities cited in Bru-baker v. Dickson, 310 F.2d 30, 38 (9th Cir. 1962). <em>Cf. </em>Kane v. United States, 399 F.2d 730, 736 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\">. The trial judge also pointed this out in one of his many colloquies with defense counsel before the jury during the course of the trial. Defense counsel' put the following question to one of the Government\u2019s psychiatrists:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-14\">\u201cDoctor, from what you know about * * * his mental illness subsequent to the alleged offense * * * would you say that if the defendant did rob that bank that he intended a bad purpose?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">At this point the trial judge stated in ruling upon the Government\u2019s objection to the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-18\">\u201cWhat is the purpose of the question, counsel? I don\u2019t understand you. That is the issue for the jury to determine, if they determine he is sane. They then also have to determine what his purpose was.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
