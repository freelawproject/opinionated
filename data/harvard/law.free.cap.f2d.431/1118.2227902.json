Nelms v. United States, 291 F.2d 390 (4th Cir. 1961), on almost identical facts, ruled two offenses had been committed. We regard Nelms as sound law and decline appellant\u2019s invitation to promulgate a contrary rule for this circuit. Moreover, our case of Myers v. Morgan, 224 F. 413 (8th Cir. 1915), supports the judgment and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-22\">Appellant\u2019s complaint about the court\u2019s admonishing the jury to disregard a statement made by the Government's principal witness is patently frivolous. We view the alleged erroneous statement as beneficial to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-23\">There is likewise no merit in the belated claim of failure to fully instruct on all issues. Appellant\u2019s experienced counsel expressly approved every instruction given and failed to request that the jury be given further guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-24\">This case was tried free of error and appellant\u2019s conviction on uncontradicted and conclusive evidence must be and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
