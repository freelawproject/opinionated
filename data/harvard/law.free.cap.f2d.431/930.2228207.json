United States v. Maloney, 1968, 402 F.2d 448, cert. denied 394 U.S. 947, 89 S.Ct. 1283, 22 L.Ed.2d 481. Defendant now brings a second petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the substance of which is that inasmuch as counsel was dilatory with respect to filing the motion, defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and his conviction was accordingly unconstitutional. The district court dismissed his petition, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">We cannot recognize defendant\u2019s easy way of avoiding all rules for the effective conduct of criminal litigation. \u201cIneffective counsel,\u201d in the constitutional sense, means representation \u201csuch as to make the trial a mockery, a sham or a farce.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 10 Cir., 1967, 380 F.2d 810, 812; accord, United States v. Horton, 2 Cir., 1964, 334 F.2d 153, 155, Smith v. United States, D.C.Cir., 1963, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 404, 324 F.2d 436, 440, cert. denied 376 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 978, 11 L.Ed.2d 975; Dodd v. United States, 9 Cir., 1963, 321 F.2d 240, 243. <em>See also </em>McMann v. Richardson, 1970, 397 U.S. 759, 772, 774, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763; Green v. United States, 1 Cir., 1958, 256 F.2d 483, 485, cert. denied 358 U.S. 854, 79 S.Ct. 83, 3 L.Ed.2d 87. Were the rule otherwise every conviction would result in a new trial with, in effect, a substituted defendant, viz., unsuccessful counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">It is true that failure of counsel to file a notice of appeal when instructed to do so is ground for, in effect, a late appeal. Rodriguez v. United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 327, 89 S.Ct. 1715, 23 L.Ed.2d 340. This is a special exception, because of the fundamental nature of the right of appeal, and not a universal rule applicable to all alleged failures of counsel to file motions, or to take other steps, pre-trial or trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
