We conclude that there is nothing in the Act nor in the legislative history thereof to support the position asserted by the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-12\">If the proviso contained in Section 8(a) (3) of the Act is to be rewritten or amended to permit the exaction of a fine from the member in addition to the payment of periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required, this should be done by the legislative and not the judicial branch of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">There is substantial evidence in the record supporting the Board\u2019s order and it will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
