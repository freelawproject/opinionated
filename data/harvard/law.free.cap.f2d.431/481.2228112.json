The record further reflects that Bishop was represented by competent counsel, and at the time he entered his plea had full knowledge and understanding of the essential facts, including the consequences of his guilty plea. The assertion that a specimen of his handwriting was given by appellant prior to the time counsel was appointed for him is without merit. The plea of guilty established his guilt of the offense charged. Williams v. United States, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 217. No proof of defendant\u2019s guilt by use of handwritten specimens or any other evidence was required. Hughes v. United States, 8 Cir., 1967, 371 F.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The judgment of conviction is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
