This court earlier remanded the issue to the Tax Court for a factual determination as to whether the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted losses arising from the sale are deductible. Transport Mfg. &amp; Equip. Co. of Delaware v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 374 F.2d 173 (8 Cir. 1967). Upon remand the Tax Court of the United States, in an opinion written by Judge Forrester, T.C. Memo 1968-190, found that the sale of the trailers was not bona fide. The Tax Court held \u201cthat the difference between TM&amp;E\u2019s basis in the trailers and the $34,500 received from Riss &amp; Company represents a capital contribution to Riss &amp; Company by the shareholders of TM&amp;E.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\"> On appeal the taxpayer urges that the findings of the Tax Court are not based upon the evidence and are clearly erroneous. It is likewise urged that the Tax Court applied the wrong legal standard in making its determination. We think that t\u00e1xpayer misconstrues the Tax Court\u2019s application of the standards involved. On the basis of the findings made by the Tax Court as a trier of fact, we cannot say they are clearly erroneous. Upon review, we are satisfied there exists sufficient evidence and inference therefrom to support the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the trailers were not sold to Riss &amp; Co. at fair market price. We think the Tax Court properly concluded that this sales price would not have been offered to unrelated third parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, as the Tax Court so reasoned, was persuasive indicia of bad faith and of a sale not bona fide.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">On the basis of the evidence presented and the findings made by Judge Forres-ter, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">. Compare Judge Mehaffy\u2019s observation in Investors Diversified Services, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 325 F.2d 341, 349 (8 Cir. 1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that purchase price is not necessarily the proper cost basis in transactions which are not conducted at arm\u2019s length or motivated by other peculiar considerations which influence the taxpayer who gives a price in excess of the fair market value.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
