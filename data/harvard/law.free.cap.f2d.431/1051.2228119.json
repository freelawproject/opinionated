This appeal, which is the latest development in a long history of litigation, arose when appellee filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court, alleging nine violations of his constitutional rights. A stay of execution was immediately granted, and two months later, while his application was pending, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), dealing with the qualifications of jurors necessary for the imposition of a death sentence. The district court on July 22, 1968, remanded the case to the state trial court for compliance with <em>Witherspoon </em>concerning sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *******After a hearing, the state trial court concluded that there had been no violation of the Witherspoon standard, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. Whisman v. State, 224 Ga. 793, 164 S.E.2d 719 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">Appellee renewed his motion for a writ of habeas corpus, and on May 12, 1969, the court below again voided his sentence and remanded to the state trial court for compliance with <em>Witherspoon. </em>The court in the remand ruled that the exclusion of the eight prospective regular jurors was correct and did not void the sentence, but that the exclusion of two of three veniremen in the selection of an alternate juror was erroneous and invalidated the death sentence. From this order of remand, appellant filed a notice of appeal within thirty days, pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-19\">Appellee now contends that (1) during voir dire examination for the regular jury, eight veniremen were excluded although it was never unmistakably clear that they would automatically object to the death penalty, and (2) that three prospective alternate jurors were also improperly excluded in violation of <em>Witherspoon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-20\">I. Selection of the Regular Jury Panel</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-21\">Appellee\u2019s first contention concerns the exclusion of eight veniremen of the regular jury panel who conscientiously objected to the death penalty. We have serious doubts whether appellee, in the absence of an appeal or cross appeal, may now contest the ruling of the district court that the exclusion of these jurors was correct and within the test of <em>Witherspoon.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However this may be, we have examined the record and find ourselves in agreement with the district court that the eight veniremen of the regular jury panel were correctly and properly excluded. The <em>Witherspoon </em>decision narrows the basis for exclusion by emphasizing that a mere reluctance in or an abstract belief against capital punishment is not sufficient grounds for challenging a juror for cause. With-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>erspoon v. Illinois, supra, 391 U.S. at 522, 88 S.Ct. 1770. The trial judge must determine whether the prospective juror only harbors such a belief, or would in reality refuse under any circumstances to inflict the death penalty. The judge or the prosecuting attorney must ask a question, the reply to which will demonstrate unequivocally that the venireman \u201cwould automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment no matter what the trial might reveal, * * <em>\u201d </em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, supra, at 516 n. 9, 88 S.Ct. at 1774, Boulden v. Holman, 394 U.S. 478, 482, 89 S.Ct. 1138, 22 L.Ed. 2d 433 (1969). We have examined the questions propounded to these eight prospective jurors, examples of which are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition to being asked whether or not he was opposed to capital punishment each of the eight jurors was also asked a question that elicited a reply indicating that under no circumstances would he vote in favor of the death sentence. Although the questions put to these jurors were not expressed in the most articulate language, we find that the court and counsel made it unmistakably clear to these prospective jurors that only such jurors who could not or would not impose the death penalty under any circumstances would be excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-20\">II. Selection of an Alternate Juror</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-21\">Appellee contends that the three veniremen subjected to voir dire examination in the selection of an alternate juror were also improperly excluded. The questions propounded to these veniremen were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-22\">\u201cCLERK \u2014 Howell Dalton</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1111-23\">MR.

COOK \u2014 For cause, your Honor, conscientiously opposed to capital punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-11\">COURT \u2014 You may leave the jury box. * *&gt;*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-12\">Obviously, only the first of these (Mr. Dalton) was asked the additional question whether he would never return a verdict to inflict the death penalty under any circumstances. His exclusion, as the lower court ruled, was clearly correct, but the court remanded because the exclusion of the last two veniremen (Mrs. McDaniel and Mr. Morgan) did not comply with the requirements of <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Boulden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">The question we must answer is whether <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Boulden </em>apply to the selection of the alternate jurors in the instant case. To our knowledge, no similar question has ever been raised in a federal appellate court. Appellee asserts that the mere presence and association of this \u201cbiased and prosecution prone alternate juror\u201d with the regular jurors influenced the final verdict. Yet there is no indication of such influence in the case sub judice. The alternate juror did not participate in the deliberations or the verdict and he was properly instructed by the state trial judge not to discuss the case with anyone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">A federal district court faced a problem similar to the one before us in the case of Woodards v. Maxwell, 303 F.Supp. 690 (S.D.Ohio 1969). Out of twenty-seven persons given a voir dire examination, twenty-four were prospective regular jurors, while the remaining three were examined for their qualifications as alternate jurors. The court stated that \u201c[bjeeause none of the alternate jurors participated in the deliberations or verdict at the conclusion of petitioners\u2019 trial, the Court will not consider their examination relevant in the discussion of the <em>Witherspoon </em>issue.\u201d 303 F.Supp. at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-18\">A few courts, mostly at the state level, have faced the question of whether the erroneous exclusion of a single juror, or a few jurors, constitutes reversible error, and they have reached conflicting results. See, e. g., New Jersey v. Mathis, 52 N.J. 238, 245 A.2d 20, 27 (1968); People v. Schader, 71 A.C. 797, 80 Cal. Rptr. 1, 457 P.2d 841 (1969). The Tenth Circuit, however, in Bell v. Patterson, 402 F.2d 394, 399 (10th Cir. 1968) has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-19\">[i]t cannot be said that the exclusion of two prospective jurors whose testimony did not indicate a pre-trial commitment to irrevocably vote against the death penalty resulted in a jury that failed to reflect the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u2019 * * * Hence, viewing the' jury selection process in its entirety by weighing the responses of the excluded jurors, it cannot be said that \u2018the State crossed the line of neutrality\u2019 and entered the domain of the impartial jury proscribed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-21\">In the instant case, there was an effort to select a fair jury, and there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>indication in the record of an attempt to compose a \u201changing jury/</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">We therefore hold that the <em>Wither-spoon </em>and <em>Bovlden </em>exceptions do not void the death sentence as long as the alternate juror selected is not needed, does not sit in on the deliberation or participate in the verdict, and provided that there is no indication that he influenced the regular jurors or prejudiced the rights of defendant. There is no language in either of these cases which suggests an intent that their requirements extend to nonparticipating alternate jurors. On the other hand, the Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>was concerned with the specific verdict as imposed, for it stated: \u201cSpecifically, we hold that a sentence of death cannot be carried out <em>if the jury that imposed or recorri\u00f3 mended it </em>was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.\u201d 391 U.S. at 521-522, 88 S.Ct. at 1776-1777 [emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Finally, we would be more sympathetic to appellee\u2019s contentions if there were suggestions in the record of prejudice to his rights. There was no effort by his attorneys to demonstrate any undue influence exercised by the alternate juror. We will not presume prejudice based on a mere theoretical fear that the alternate juror disobeyed the judge\u2019s instructions and tried to pressure the other jurors. See United States v. Ellenbogen, 365 F.2d 982, 989 (2d Cir. 1966). His presence apart from anything else during a portion of the trial does not vitiate the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The state court verdict and judgment contained no constitutional infirmities under <em>Witherspoon, </em>supra. It was error for the district court to set them aside. Accordingly, while the judgment of the district court is Affirmed regarding its ruling that the eight regular panel jurors were correctly excluded, the ruling regarding the alternate jurors is Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">. Although the effect of Witherspoon was retroactive, the conviction itself was not invalidated, in light of Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-14\">The district court, finding that appel-lee had not exhausted all of his state remedies, retained jurisdiction of the remaining grounds of his application and allowed him 15 days after completion of the state proceedings to renew his application for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1110-23\">. The lower court\u2019s remand was based on a finding that two of three veniremen examined for the selection of an alternate juror were improperly excluded. Appel-lee filed no notice of appeal concerning the unfavorable portion of the court\u2019s ruling dealing with the regular panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">. \u201cCLERK \u2014 Green Penn</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">MR.
