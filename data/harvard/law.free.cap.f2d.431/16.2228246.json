Rogers of Denver, Colorado, as conservator for Frederick W. Pahlow, sought to recover damages in the Nebraska federal district court for bodily injuries which Pahlow sustained as a pedestrian when struck by an automobile on Christmas Eve, 1966, in Alliance, Nebraska. Pahlow resided in Alliance at the time of the accident. All defendants, the minor operating the vehicle at the time of the accident and his parents, also live in Nebraska. The district court, Judge Van Pelt, dismissed the action on jurisdictional grounds for want of diversity. Rogers appeals, urging that the trial court erred in finding that Pahlow permanently resided in the same state as the defendants and in determining, further, that Conservator Rogers\u2019 Colorado citizenship did not effect diversity. Finally, Rogers contends that the substantial interest held by the United States as a subrogee for medical expenses invokes federal jurisdiction and requires reinstatement of the action. We reject these contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">We briefly and chronologically review the pertinent facts. Alliance police investigating the accident arrested and jailed Pahlow for intoxication. While his injuries appeared minor at first, a few days after the accident Pahlow lapsed into a coma. He was then taken to the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital at Hot Springs, South Dakota, for diagnosis and treatment. Approximately one month later, Pahlow was transferred to the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital at Denver, Colorado, where he underwent brain surgery. Following surgery, Pah-low, on March 10, 1967, engaged a Denver attorney to collect for the injuries Pahlow sustained in the accident. Pah-low signed a retainer agreement with the Denver attorney, listing his residence in Colorado. Thereafter, Pahlow was returned to the Hot Springs facility for recuperation. Medical records compiled by the Veteran\u2019s Administration at this time characterized Pahlow as \u201ca little dull mentally\u201d, but competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">On April 5, Pahlow brought action against the present defendants seeking damages for his automobile accident injuries in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. On April 14, the chief medical administrative services officer at the Hot Springs Veteran\u2019s Administration institution advised Denver counsel of a plan to discharge Pah-low and return him to Alliance, Nebraska, within about two weeks. Denver counsel, by letter, responded that such course of action would lead to a dismissal of Palilow\u2019s federal court lawsuit. He requested that Pahlow travel to Denver \u201cfor consultation\u201d. Counsel and the Veteran\u2019s Administration personnel at Hot Springs arranged for Pahlow to fly to Denver for a three-day visit commencing May 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">On May 10, Pahlow\u2019s attorney referred him to a Denver psychiatrist who diagnosed Pahlow as suffering from defective memory and impairment of perception due to chronic brain disease secondary to a sub-dural hemorrhage sustained in the accident. This physician recommended that Pahlow be evaluated by a \u201cCounty Medical Commission\u201d and that \u201ca guardian [be] appointed for his person and property.\u201d Denver counsel immediately initiated action in the Denver County Probate Court, which culminated in its adjudication of Pahlow as a mentally ill person and its committing Pahlow to the care and custody of the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital at Fort Lyons, Colorado. Pahlow remained subject to this commitment until the next year, when on March 12, 1968, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>transferred to the Hot Springs veterans\u2019 facility for \u201cdomiciliary care\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Almost contemporaneously with proceedings leading to Pahlow\u2019s institutionalization in Colorado, Conservator Rogers, represented by Pahlow\u2019s Denver attorney, petitioned the Denver Probate Court to authorize him to act as conservator of Pahlow\u2019s estate and, as such, to continue Pahlow's federal court lawsuit. Armed with that court\u2019s authorization, Rogers filed an amended complaint. The Nebraska district court authorized this amendment as well as a second one adding the United States as a party plaintiff to determine its subrogation rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2651-2653. The United States then filed a claim as a pleading demanding reimbursement for medical costs incurred in providing care for Pahlow.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On March 3, 1969, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for want of diversity. On June 10, 1969, Judge Van Pelt dismissed the claim. The United States, as a party plaintiff, has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We first consider whether Pahlow, through a combination of intention and action, established a domicile of choice in Colorado. This court has explained :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">To acquire a domicil of choice, the law requires the physical presence of a person at the place of the domicil claimed, coupled with the intention of making it his present home. When these two facts concur, the change in domicil is instantaneous. Intention to live permanently at the claimed domi-cil is not required. If a person capable of making his choice honestly regards a place as his present home, the motive prompting him is immaterial. Janzen v. Goos, 302 F.2d 421, 425 (8th Cir. 1962); quoting with approval from Spurgeon v. Mission State Bank, 151 F.2d 702, 705-706 (8th Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 782, 66 S.Ct. 682, 90 L.Ed. 1009 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Prior to and at the time of the accident, Pahlow permanently resided in Alliance. Five days after Pahlow filed his initial complaint, he told Veteran\u2019s Administration personnel at Hot Springs that he wanted to return home to Alliance. When the Denver Probate Court referred him to the Veteran\u2019s Hospital at Fort Lyons, Colorado, for custody and care, Pahlow listed his permanent home as Alliance. In view of these specific facts and in light of the record as a whole, the self-serving and conclusional statement contained in Pahlow\u2019s retainer agreement with his Denver attorney that \u201c[c]lient states that he is a resident and citizen of the State of Colorado\u201d <em>pales into insignificance.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A determination of citizenship for purposes of diversity is a mixed question of law and fact, but mainly fact, which may not be set aside by an appellate court unless clearly erroneous. See Russell v. New Amsterdam Casualty Company, 325 F.2d 996 (8th Cir. 1964); <em>Janzen, supra, </em>302 F.2d 421. The appellant fails to demonstrate that the trial court clearly erred in holding that Pahlow had acquired no citizenship in Colorado and that he remained domiciled in and a citizen of Nebraska at all times material to this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">We next turn to appellant\u2019s contention that Conservator Rogers\u2019 Colorado citizenship requires reversal. The trial court expressly found that Pahlow\u2019s Denver counsel \u201cmanufactured\u201d federal jurisdiction by initiating, controlling and directing Pahlow\u2019s trip to Denver in May, 1967; and by causing Rogers, characterized by the trial court as a \u201cstraw man\u201d, to be named as conservator subject to counsel\u2019s direction. In rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Rogers\u2019 citizenship as a controlling element creating diversity, the trial court relied upon the following mandate of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1359:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">A district court shall not have jurisdiction of a civil action in which any party, by assignment or otherwise, has been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction of such court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We examine this ruling. This court has previously held that the appointment of an administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate or statutory trustee with an eye to establishing diversity of citizenship to permit the bringing of an action for wrongful death in federal district court does not fall within the ambit of \u00a7 1359. <em>Janzen, supra, </em>302 F.2d 421; County of Todd, Minnesota v. Loegering, 297 F.2d 470 (8th Cir. 1961); McCoy v. Blakely, 217 F.2d 227 (8th Cir. 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In <em>Janzen, supra, </em>Judge Blackmun, writing for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">When an action is brought by an administrator or other fiduciary and the governing state law authorizes that fiduciary to bring suit in his own name as the real party in interest, it is the fiduciary\u2019s personal citizenship, not the identity of the statement from which he receives his appointment or the citizenship of the persons for whose benefit the action is brought, which is pertinent in the ascertainment of the existence of diversity. * * * This court has so held on a number of occasions. * * * No question is here raised as to the plaintiff, in her capacity as administratrix, being the real party in interest and the provisions of R.R.S. Nebraska, 1943, \u00a7 25-304, confirm this. In any event, the citizenship of all the beneficiaries coincides with that of the plaintiff. (Citations omitted.) 302 F.2d at 425.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">In <em>McCoy, supra, </em>Judge Vogel noted that motive for the appointment of an administrator to create diversity \u201cwithout more\u201d established no violation of \u00a7 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Appellant relies particularly upon the <em>County of Todd, supra, </em>holding that the substitution of a Montana citizen for a Minnesota trustee of decedent\u2019s heirs in order to obtain diversity jurisdiction in a wrongful death action against a Minnesota defendant was not collusive or improper. The opinion noted that the changing from a resident to a non-resident representative represents \u201cusual expedients employed by counsel and client in matters of this kind.\u201d 297 F.2d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">In Martineau v. City of St. Paul, 172 F.2d 777 (8th Cir. 1949), this court rejected a guardian\u2019s citizenship as a basis for federal jurisdiction, reasoning that under controlling state law, the infant and not his guardian was the real party in interest. Although not discussing \u00a7 1359 or its predecessor, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 80,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Sanborn commented for the panel of this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-15\">Even if this controversy were to be regarded as one between the guardian and the defendants, we would still be of the opinion that diversity of citizenship was lacking, since the guardian is a mere agent of the Probate Court of Ramsey County, Minnesota, appointed for the purpose of enforcing a claim of a ward of that court against citizens of Minnesota. We think that a Probate Court of Minnesota, by appointing a nonresident as a guardian for a Minnesota minor, cannot transmute what is purely a local controversy into one between citizens of different states, or confer jurisdiction of the controversy upon the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. 172 F.2d at 780.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">Rogers, as a conservator, occupies a substantially different status from administrators or trustees of decedents\u2019 estates. The latter undertake perform-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>anee of duties specified by law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These responsibilities are similar to those assumed by a trustee of an active trust whose citizenship we have held to be controlling for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction in Curb and Gutter Dist. No. 37 v. Parrish, 110 F.2d 902 (8th Cir. 1940), and Mathis v. Hemingway, 24 F.2d 951 (8th Cir. 1928). In addition, death itself creates a necessity for someone to represent the decedent\u2019s estate or his survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">A conservator, on the other hand, functions much like a guardian of a minor or an incompetent. See Whitmarsh v. McGair, 90 R.I. 154, 156 A.2d 83, 87 (1959). The beneficiaries, through a guardian ad litem or a next friend, possess the power to sue in their own names. See, e. g., Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(c), cf. Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 25-307 (1964). Presumably, Pahlow, as one adjudicated mentally ill, continues to possess the power to sue in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The records in the probate proceedings disclose no purpose for Rogers\u2019 appointment as a conservator other than the continuance of the lawsuit in the federal district court. Colorado law entitled the conservator to exercise control only over property within the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pahlow owned no such property. The Probate Court ordered the Veteran\u2019s Administration to exercise custody of Pahlow\u2019s person. It thrust no affirmative duties in that regard upon Rogers. At best, Conservator Rogers assumed a naked and dry trust free from responsibility or obligation to the beneficiary, except to attempt to create diversity of parties in the pending federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In <em>Janzen, supra, </em>302 F.2d 421, decedent\u2019s widow, and in <em>County of Todd, supra, </em>297 F.2d 470, decedent\u2019s daughter, each as a plaintiff serving in a representative capacity, possessed a substantial personal stake in the wrongful death claim. In <em>McCoy, supra, </em>217 F.2d 227, plaintiff, an Iowa administrator, exercised supervision over an Iowa decedent\u2019s estate. Rogers, however, possesses no such interest. The record discloses him as an acquaintance who met Pahlow casually at the Denver Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">The legal procedures resulting in Rogers' appointment as a conservator for the purpose of creating diversity jurisdiction seem analogous to the procedure by which a creditor domiciled in his debtor\u2019s state assigns his claim to an assignee in another state for the sole purpose of creating federal jurisdiction. Such an assignment falls within the ban of \u00a7 1359. The Supreme Court, in Kramer v. Caribbean Mills, 394 U.S. 823, 89 S.Ct. 1487, 23 L.Ed.2d 9 (1969), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">If federal jurisdiction could be created by assignments of this kind, which are easy to arrange and involve few disadvantages for the assignor, then a vast quantity of ordinary contract and tort litigation could be channeled into the federal courts at the will of one of the parties. Such \u201cmanufacturer of Federal jurisdiction\u201d was the very thing which Congress intended to prevent when it enacted \u00a7 1359 and its predecessors. 394 U.S. at 829, 89 S.Ct. at 1490.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">The Court, in <em>Caribbean Mills, supra, </em>considered assignments as a means of invoking federal diversity jurisdiction, not the appointment of guardians or admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>istrators to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In McSparran v. Weist, 402 F.2d 867 (1968) (en banc), cert. denied, Fritzinger v. Weist, 395 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1739, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969), however, the Third Circuit applied the policy of \u00a7 1359 to deny a guardian residing in a state different from his ward the privilege of prosecuting an action on behalf of the ward in the federal court. The majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">The appointment of a fictitious guardian or representative selected by counsel for no other purpose than to create diversity jurisdiction in the action which will constitute the only asset in the estate is not substantially different from an assignment to an agent for the purpose of instituting litigation. 402 F.2d at 874.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">See also the companion case, Esposito v. Emery, 402 F.2d 878 (3d Cir. 1968) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The Fourth Circuit applied a similar ban under the policy of \u00a7 1359, prospectively only, to a non-resident appointed as an administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate for the sole purpose of effecting diversity jurisdiction in an action for wrongful death under circumstances in which the administrator possessed \u201cno stake in the litigation.\u201d Lester v. McFaddon, 415 F.2d 1101 (1969). In Dougherty v. Oberg, 297 F.Supp. 635 (D.Minn.1969), Judge Devitt applied the rationale of <em>McSparran, supra, </em>402 F.2d 867, and <em>Esposito, supra, </em>402 F.2d 878, in denying a South Dakota guardian of an injured Minnesota infant access to the federal district court in order to sue Minnesota defendants on the infant\u2019s claim for injuries. Cf. Duffy v. Currier, 291 F.Supp. 810 (D.Minn.1968) (jurisdiction sustained in wrongful death action, opinion of Judge Neville).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Our disposition of this litigation is controlled by the holding, though not necessarily the full rationale, of <em>Martineau, supra, </em>172 F.2d 777. We hold the appointment of a representative of a living person, such as a guardian or conservator who undertakes no duties nor obligations to his ward or beneficiary save those incident to the institution of a lawsuit, falls within the proscription of \u00a7 1359 and is insufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship. In such cases, we look to the citizenship of the ward or beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">We decline to consider appellant\u2019s contention that a subrogation interest on the part of the government saves federal jurisdiction of Rogers\u2019 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345, which confers original jurisdiction upon the federal district courts of all civil actions, suits or proceedings commenced by the United States. Appellant has not presented this contention to the district court. We note that Judge Van Pelt\u2019s dismissal does not expressly encompass the government\u2019s separate amended claim which prayed for judgment against the defendants in an amount sufficient to reimburse the Veteran\u2019s Administration for the cost of hospital, medical and surgical treatment fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>nished Pahlow. The United States has not here appealed. Under these circumstances, appellant\u2019s \u00a7 1345 contention places nothing before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We affirm the dismissal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">. \u201cDomiciliary care\u201d describes a type of medical care and treatment available to eligible veterans.
