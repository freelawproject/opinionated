He charges as error that the jury\u2019s verdicts were inconsistent; that the government split one crime into two counts improperly, that although this appellant was not in custody he was entitled to a <em>Miranda </em>type warning; and that the government failed to comply with local Rule 42, setting up a dead-line for notice to counsel of defendant\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">While we may compliment appellant\u2019s counsel on the able and imaginative manner in which the alleged errors were urged, (a) we find no inconsistency in the two verdicts; (b) the government\u2019s charge of two counts was proper (United States v. Michelson, 165 F.2d 732 (2nd Cir.), aff\u2019d 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948)); (c) a person is entitled to no warning during the commission of a crime (Grier v. United States, 345 F.2d 523, 524 (9th Cir. 1965); Feldstein v. United States, 429 F.2d 1092 (9th Cir. 1970); and (d) Rule 42 expressly provides the trial court may excuse compliance with the rule which it here did.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">We affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
