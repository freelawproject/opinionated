Error in admitting Garcia\u2019s inculpatory statements obtained in violation of Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, compels reversal of her conviction and a remand for a new trial from which those statements will be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">After Garcia was arrested, federal agents repeatedly questioned her. During the course of the interrogation sessions, the agents gave her several different versions of the <em>Miranda </em>bundle of warnings. On no occasion was a warning given fully complying with <em>Miranda. </em>Taken together, the warnings were inconsistent. At one point she was told that she had a right to the presence of counsel \u201cwhen she answered any questions\u201d; on another, she was told that she could \u201chave an attorney appointed to represent you when you first appear before the U. S. Commissioner or the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">The warnings failed adequately to inform Garcia of her right to counsel before she said a word. \u201c[T]he offer of counsel must be clarion and firm, not one of mere impressionism.\u201d Lathers v. United States (5th Cir. 1968) 396 F.2d 524, 535. (Accord, United States v. Vasquez-Lopez (9th Cir. 1968) 400 F.2d 593; Gilpin v. United States (5th Cir. 1969) 415 F.2d 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-19\">Discussion of the remaining contentions is rendered unnecessary by our disposition of the <em>Miranda </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
