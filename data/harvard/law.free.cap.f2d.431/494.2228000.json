(\u201cDVA\u201d) to furnish a list of the names and addresses of its employees eligible to vote in a representation election ordered by the Board, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The background facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"aay-dedup-0\">On August 9, 1968, the International Union of Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, AFL-CIO (\u201cUnion\u201d) filed a petition with the Board\u2019s Regional Office in Philadelphia, Pa., seeking a representation election with respect to DVA\u2019s approximately 300 production and maintenance employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">At the pre-election hearing on the petition, on August 26, 1968, DVA stipulated the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and its denial of Union\u2019s request to represent its production and maintenance workers. It, however, informed the hearing officer that it would not file a list of the names and addresses of all its employees because in its opinion the Board lacked authority to direct such filing. In doing so it specifically challenged the validity of the election eligibility list \u201crequirement\u201d rule laid down in Excelsior Underwear, Inc., 156 N.L.R.B. 1236 (1966),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> commonly referred to as the <em>Excelsior </em>Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">On August 29, 1968, the Board\u2019s Regional Director issued a Decision and Direction of Election. The latter directed DVA to file an election eligibility list containing the names and addresses of all eligible voters within seven days, and further stated that failure to comply with this directive would be grounds for setting aside the election, upon proper objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">On September 5, 1968, DVA filed a list containing names and addresses of only 83 of its employees eligible to vote. In its letter enclosing the list DVA said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">\u201cFor your information, DVA employs mostly women and a great number of these women complained that the union had made threats and harassed them, and DVA was asked by these women not to supply their addresses. Because of this situation, DVA requested of all employees that they specify whether or not they wished their addresses released. As you can see, a vast majority of the employees refused to have their addresses released.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">The letter did not state details of the alleged harassments and threats or identify victims or perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">On September 12, 1968, DVA furnished the Board with an additional list containing the names, but not the addresses, of all eligible DVA employees. The Board took no further action, and at the representation election conducted on December 12, 1968, the Union was defeated by a vote of 220 to 93. Union then filed objections asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>DVA\u2019s failure to file the directed list of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">On January 16, 1969, the Regional Director, after an <em>ex parte </em>investigation, issued a Supplemental Decision on Objections to Election and Direction of Second Election, assigning as a basis DVA\u2019s failure to comply with its directive as to filing a complete list of names and addresses of eligible employees. In the stated Supplemental Decision, DVA was again directed to file the mooted eli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>gibility list within seven days of the ordered second election.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">On January 22, 1969, DVA filed \u201cExceptions and Request for Review to the Second Supplemental Decision.\u201d It therein repeated its prior allegations of union threats and harassment, and charged for the first time that \u201ca number of the Union organizers assigned to the labor campaign had known criminal records.\u201d Again, there was no specification as to the identity of harassed or threatened employees nor specification as to the identity of the concerned Union organizers or the details of their \u201cknown criminal records.\u201d The Exceptions renewed earlier challenges to the validity of the Board\u2019s Order to file the mooted eligibility list. They also requested \u201coral argument\u201d with respect to the contentions made therein, but made no request for a hearing, although they stated that DVA \u201cwishes to indicate its willingness to participate in a hearing in which the facts above, as well as additional facts, would be placed in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">On February 10, 1969, the Board denied the Request for Review for the assigned reason that \u201cit raises no substantial issues warranting review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">On May 6, 1969, DVA wrote to the Board stating that in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on April 23, 1969, in National Labor Relations Board v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709, \u201cit is submitted that the only appropriate way to proceed in the instant matter, is to hold a hearing so that the propriety of such a list [of employees] in the instant case may be \u2018weighed\u2019 in accordance with the demands of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The Board did not grant the suggested hearing, and on May 20, 1969, issued the challenged subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>directing DVA to produce its personnel and payroll records showing the names and addresses of all eligible employees, or, in lieu thereof, to file a list containing this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">On May 29, 1969, DVA filed a \u201cPetition to Revoke\u201d the subpoena which alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the majority of its more than 300 employees were female and most of them had requested DVA not to submit their names and addresses because \u201cthe organizing personnel of the Union\u201d included men \u201cwith known criminal records,\u201d and \u201cunion personnel * * * have harassed, threatened, restrained, coerced and otherwise unlawfully interfered with the employees * * * \u201d. The Petition further alleged that the Board had initially denied DVA\u2019s request for a hearing on the issue as to whether DVA should be required to submit a list of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">On June 9, 1969, the Board, by telegraphic order, denied the \u201cPetition to Revoke\u201d and its request for a hearing, on the ground that \u201cevidence was not shown of special circumstances why the Excelsior list need not be furnished at the time of the representation case hearing and direction of election or in response to the Regional Director\u2019s Supplemental Decision and on objection to election and direction of second election on January 16, 1969, or in petitions to revoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">On July 18, 1969, the Board applied to the District Court for an order requiring obedience to its subpoena <em>duces tec-um.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">DVA filed in the District Court proceedings a \u201cMemorandum of Controlling Facts\u201d in which it named three union representatives with alleged \u201cknown criminal records.\u201d The \u201cMemorandum\u201d cited records of the County Clerk\u2019s Office in Camden County, New Jersey, which revealed that one of the three had been found guilty of bookmaking and fined $1,000.00, and newspaper clippings showing that another had been arrested and charged with inciting to riot in picketing a strike-bound plant some 12 years earlier in 1957, and that the third had invoked the Fifth Amendment in 1957 and 1967 when he was asked by Senate committees whether he was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>active Communist in 1950 and 1956. The Memorandum did not submit follow-up data as to the outcome of the incidents involving the second and third union representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">It may be noted parenthetically that in the affidavits accompanying the \u201cApplication for Intervention,\u201d filed by ten DVA female employees in the District Court, none of the three union organizers were charged with threats or harassment. The burden of these affidavits was that the employees were concerned that \u201ctheir right of privacy\u201d would be violated in that they might be exposed to home phone calls or visits of union organizers.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The District Court, in a \u201cMemorandum\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> accompanying its Order enforcing the Board\u2019s subpoena, held that the Board properly acted within its powers in directing filing of the list of names and addresses of DVA employees eligible to vote in the ordered representation election. It also found that: \u201cThe objection that some of the Union organizers have criminal records is without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On this appeal from the District Court\u2019s Order, DVA contends that it was denied \u201cprocedural due process\u201d when it was not afforded an \u201cadjudicatory hearing\u201d prior to the Board\u2019s entry of its Order directing it to file a list of the name and addresses of all its employees, and again when the Board, without a hearing, denied its \u201cPetition to Revoke\u201d its subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for production of the list of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">DVA urges that its contentions are supported by the \u201cdoctrine\u201d of <em>Wyman-Gordon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The Board, in turn, says that <em>Wy-man-Gordon </em>establishes the validity of the Board\u2019s list requirement order in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">We agree with the Board\u2019s stated contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\"><em>Wyman-Gordon</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided that a direction to an employer to submit a list of the names and addresses of its employees, when incorporated in a Board order to hold a representation election \u201cis unquestionably valid\u201d since it was entered <em>\u201cin an adjudicatory proceeding;\u2019\u2019 </em>that the Board has \u201ca wide discretion to insure the fair and free choice of bargaining representatives\u201d; \u201c[t]he disclosure requirement furthers this objective by encouraging an informed employee electorate and by allowing the right of access to employees that management already possesses;\u201d and \u201c[i]t <em>is for the Board and not for this Court to weigh against this interest the asserted interest of employees in avoiding the problems that union solicitation may present.\" </em>394 U.S. 766-767, 89 S.Ct. 1430 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\"><em>Wyman-Gordon </em>further held that Section 11(1) of the National Labor Relations Act \u201cempowers the Board to issue subpoenas \u2018requiring * * * production of any evidence\u2019 \u201d in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>with any investigation or proceeding incident to the exercise of powers vested in it by the Act, and that in the context of Section 11(1) \u201cevidence\u201d means not only proof at a hearing but also books and records and other papers which will assist the Board in making a particular investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>additionally held that \u201cSection 11(2) gives the district courts jurisdiction, upon application by the Board, to issue an order requiring a person who has refused to obey the Board\u2019s subpoena \u2018to appear before the Board * * * there to produce evidence if so ordered, or there to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question * * * \u2019 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161(1) (2).\u201d 394 U.S. 768, 89 S.Ct. 1431.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">It should be noted that the cited holdings in <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>are from the opinion of Mr. Justice Fortas, in which Chief Justice Warren and Justices Stewart and White, joined, and that Mr. Justice Black in his opinion \u201cconcurring in the result,\u201d in which Justices Brennan and Marshall joined, stated his agreement with respect to them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">The critical essence of <em>WymanGordon </em>is that a representation election proceeding is an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding;\u201d a direction to an employer to furnish a list of its employees when incorporated in a Board order to hold a representation election is \u201cunquestionably valid,\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> since the Board has \u201ca wide discretion\u201d in acting to insure a \u201cfair and free choice of bargaining representatives ;\u201d and that with respect to the exercise of its discretion \u201cit is for the Board,\u201d and not for a court, to weigh the Board\u2019s interest in assuring a fair election against \u201cthe asserted interest of employees in avoiding the problems that union solicitation may present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">In our opinion, <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>is dis-positive of DVA\u2019s contention that it was not afforded an \u201cadjudicatory hearing\u201d with resultant denial of \u201cprocedural due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">Other circuits, in post <em>Wyman-Gordon </em>cases, are in accord. See, e.g., National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Labor Relations Board v. Cone Mills Corporation, 419 F.2d 394 (4 Cir. 1969), cert. den., 397 U.S. 1040, 90 S.Ct. 1360, 25 L.Ed.2d 651 (1970); National Labor Relations Board v. Daniel Construction Company, Inc., 418 F.2d 790, 791 (4 Cir. 1969), cert. den., 397 U.S. 1039, 90 S.Ct. 1358, 25 L.Ed.2d 649 (1970); Chickasha Mobile Home, Inc. v. Meter, 410 F.2d 758 (8 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In the instant case, DVA concedes that the Board proceedings which followed filing of Union\u2019s petition seeking a representation election, were \u201cadjudicatory proceedings,\u201d as was held in <em>Wy-man-Gordon. </em>It complains only that in the course of the adjudicatory proceedings it was \u201centitled to a hearing prior to the promulgation\u201d of the Board\u2019s order to file the employee disclosure list, in accordance with its constitutional due process rights. It makes this contention despite the fact that here, as in <em>Wy-man-Gordon, </em>the Board, at the very outset of the representation proceedings, held a hearing on Union\u2019s petition, in accordance \\with the requirements of Section 9(c)\\l)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the National Labor Relations Act, and the Board\u2019s Regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \\This hearing is the only hearing mandated by the Act in the course and determination of the pre-election adjudication. Further, the Act does not mandate a hearing on objections to an election already held. The Board\u2019s Regulations provide that its regional directors may, in their discretion, hold a hearing in such instance or make final disposition on the basis of an administrative investigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Section 551 (7)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Administrative Procedure Act defines \u201cadjudication\u201d as \u201cagency process for the formulation of <em>an. </em>order,\u201d and Section 554(a)(6) <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> excepts \u201cthe certification of worker representatives\u201d from its requirement that in \u201cAdjudications\u201d federal agencies must grant a hearing on disputed factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">On the score of DVA\u2019s due process contention it has been specifically ruled that constitutional due process is not violated where a hearing is not made mandatory in a federal agency adjudication. Law Motor Freight, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 364 F.2d 139, 143-144 (1 Cir. 1966), cert. den., 387 U.S. 905, 87 S.Ct. 1683, 18 L.Ed.2d 622 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">This, too, must be said with respect to DVA\u2019s complaint that it was not afforded a hearing on the Board\u2019s disclosure order.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-19\">DVA does not dispute that the Board in the course of the election representation proceedings \u201creviewed\u201d its \u201csubmissions\u201d with respect to its objections to issuance of the disclosure requirement founded on its employees\u2019 fears of union harassment at their homes should their addresses be made available to union organizers. Further, DVA does not dispute that in the course of its \u201creview\u201d the Board \u201cmade an investigation\u201d of the \u201csubmissions.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\">It may be observed as to the allegations of employee fears of union harassment, that it is settled, as earlier noted: \u201cIt is for the Board and not for this Court to weigh against this interest [for a fair representation election] the asserted interest of employees in avoiding the problems that union solicitation may present,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and \u201c[t]he mere possibility of such harassment [offensive un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ion solicitation] is surely not a sufficient ground for invalidating\u201d a Board directive to an employer to submit a list of employees\u2019 names and addresses in connection with an ordered representation election.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With respect to fears of employees that \u201cthey will be subject to harassment at their homes in violation of their constitutional right to privacy,\u201d it has been expressly held that \u201c * * * the mere possibility that employees will be inconvenienced by telephone calls or visits to their homes is far outweighed by the public interest in an informed electorate.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Here, the Board, after investigation into, and review of, DVA\u2019s general and non-specific allegations of employee fears of union harassment, found that \u201cevidence was not shown of special circumstances\u201d why the employees\u2019 list \u201cneed not be furnished at the time of the repres\u00e9ntation case hearing.\u201d Thus, as the Board asserts, \u201cthe Company\u2019s contentions were heard, considered, and adjudicated.\u201d The District Court, too, found that the Board had properly weighed and adjudicated DVA\u2019s stated contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">There remains this to be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Remedies are available to DVA and its co-appellants if union harassment or coercion prevents a free representation election, via a petition to the Board to set aside the election for that reason if the union wins the election. Excelsior Underwear, Inc., 156 NLRB 1236 (1966); National Labor Relations Board v. J. P. Stevens &amp; Co., 409 F.2d 1207, 1209 (4 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Moreover, further remedies are available to appellants via the enforcement<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and review<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provisions of the Act in the event of certification of Union as bargaining representative. National Labor Relations Board v. Daniel Construction Co., <em>supra; </em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company v. Samoff, 365 F.2d 625, 627 (3 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">We have noted: \u201cTime is a critical element in election cases\u201d, and, \u201c[t]his factor explains the refusal of Congress to provide for judicial review of representation disputes <em>until they result in an unfair labor practice order.\u201d </em>National Labor Relations Board v. Sun Drug Co., Inc., 359 F.2d 408, 414 (3 Cir. 1966). (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Tyler Pipe and Foundry Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 406 F.2d 1272 (5 Cir. 1969) and National Labor Relations Board v. Howard Johnson Company, 398 F.2d 435 (3 Cir. 1968), cited by DVA in support of its contention that an evidentiary hearing is required \u201cas a matter of procedural due process in a representation election case,\u201d are inapposite here. In <em>Tyler </em>the evidentiary hearing issue was presented on a petition for review, and in <em>Johnson </em>it was raised in an enforcement proceeding. In <em>Sun Drug, </em>too, the evidentiary hearing issue was presented in an enforcement proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">For the reasons stated the District Court\u2019s \u201cOrder Requiring Obedience to Subpoena Duces Tecum\u201d will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-16\">. The Order was issued upon the Board\u2019s application to the District Court for enforcement of its subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>directed to DVA, pursuant to Section 11 (2) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 161(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-30\">.

In <em>Wyman-Gordon, </em>the Board, as here, ordered a representation election to be held, and in doing so further ordered the employer to furnish a list of the names and addresses of employees eligible to vote at the election. The employer refused to comply with the order to furnish the list, contending it was invalid; the unions there concerned lost the election and the Board sustained their objections to the election because the employer had not furnished the list. The employer again refused to obey a Board order to furnish the list or produce its personnel and payroll records showing its employees\u2019 names and addresses, and the Board then issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for the list or records, and thereafter filed an action in the District Court seeking the subpoena\u2019s enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">The District Court held the Board\u2019s order valid and entered an order enforcing the subpoena. 270 F.Supp. 280 (D.C.Mass.1967). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, 397 F.2d 394 (1968), on its holding that the Board\u2019s order to furnish the list was invalid because it was premised on the so-called <em>Excelsior </em>Rule, and the latter had not been promulgated in accordance with the rule-making requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 553.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b556-5\">. In so holding, the Court at 394 U.S. 769, 89 S.Ct. 1426, cited, <em>inter alia, </em>our ruling to the same effect, in National Labor Relations Board v. Q-T Shoe Manufacturing Co., Inc., 3 Cir., 409 F.2d 1247, 1253, decided April 11, 1969, 12 days prior to <em>W yman-Gordon.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">. In his plurality opinion, Mr. Justice For-tas held that the <em>Excelsior </em>rule, announced prospectively, in Excelsior Underwear Inc., 156 NLRB 1236 (1966), was invalid as a \u201crule\u201d because the Board in promulgating it, had not complied with the rule-making requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 553. The <em>requirements </em>of the <em>Excelsior </em>rule as to the furnishing of a list of employees in a representation election ordered by the Board, quoted here in Note 3, were, however, approved <em>per se, </em>and held to be enforceable when their compliance was directed in a Board order to hold a representation election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">. <em>Wyman-Gordon said:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201cIn the present case * * * the respondent itself was specifically directed by the Board to submit a list of the names and addresses of its employees for use by the unions in connection with the election.

The respondent made clear that it would only agree to provide the addresses (as opposed to the names, which were furnished without challenge) of the employees who consented to that disclosure, relying on the invalidity of the <em>Excelsior </em>Rule for the reasons stated in Wyman-Gordon Co. v.

If the Board is to require an <em>Excelsior </em>list under the allegedly particular facts of this case, I believe that it must grant the respondent its requested hearing. Cf. N.L.R.B. v.
