Count one charged receiving, concealing and facilitating the concealment of heroin. Counts two and four charged two separate sales of heroin to a federal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-18\">Fraser admitted doing the acts charged and claims that he was entrapped, as a matter of law. Our examination of the transcript convinces us that the evidence, including Fraser\u2019s own testimony, amply sustains the government\u2019s burden of proving that he was not entrapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-19\">The contention that the so-called presumption embodied in section 174 is unconstitutional is not available here. There was no jury, and there is evidence on the basis of which the court could find that the heroin was imported from Mexico by Fraser. Moreover, even if there were no such evidence, the presumption is valid. Turner v. United States, 1970, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610; United States v. Hampton, 9 Cir., 1970, 422 F.2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
