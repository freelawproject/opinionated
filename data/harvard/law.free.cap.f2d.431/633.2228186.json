Plaintiff sought reimbursement from Karpet Kraft Floor Covering Services, Inc., a lessee, on the basis of its alleged implied contract to secure repairs on the lessor\u2019s behalf for the premises in question. The trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff; however, the trial court, the Honorable Miles W. Lord, presiding, thereafter granted defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Upon review of the record this court is in full accord with Judge Lord\u2019s reasoning that the record is barren of sufficient evidence to prove that the defendant had any implied contractual duty to repair the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-26\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
