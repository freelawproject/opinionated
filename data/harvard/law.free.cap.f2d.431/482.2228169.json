We affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-24\">Appellant was convicted on October 6, 1964 of robbery, and received a ten-year sentence. He was paroled on November 20, 1967. On December 17, 1968, appellant was convicted in Bradenton Municipal Court of drawing a concealed weapon, a misdemeanor, which carries a maximum jail sentence of sixty days and/or a $250.00 fine. Subsequently, on March 10, 1968, appellant\u2019s parole was revoked after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-25\">Appellant now contends that his parole revocation was based on a Constitutionally infirm conviction since he was denied assistance of counsel at his municipal court trial due to his indigency.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-26\">We do not find it necessary to consider the merits of appellant\u2019s contention, since the record before this Court discloses that appellant\u2019s parole was not revoked solely on the basis of the complained-of conviction. The parole revocation order states that appellant violated the conditions of his parole by (1) having been convicted of the misdemeanor; and (2) possessing a weapon, without the consent or knowledge of his supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-27\">Appellant has not challenged the validity of the parole board\u2019s latter finding, which standing alone justifies the revocation of his parole. See Amaya v. Beto, 5th Cir. 1970, 424 F.2d 363; United States v. Clanton, 5th Cir. 1969, 419 F.2d 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-28\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
