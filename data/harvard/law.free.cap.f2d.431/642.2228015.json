We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">The parties do not dispute the facts in this case. On September 27, 1969, at approximately 5:00 a.m., Seckler drove from Mexico to the United States Customs Station in Laredo, Texas. There Customs Inspector Biamonte asked Seck-ler and his passenger, Ludlow, whether either had anything to declare. After both had replied in the negative, Inspector Biamonte searched the car. He discovered a pistol under the driver\u2019s seat. At Biamonte\u2019s request the two men then accompanied him into the customs station. Special Agent Anderson questioned Seckler, who admitted having taken the gun from a drinking companion and having placed it under the driver\u2019s seat of the car in Waco, Texas, several days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">At Seckler\u2019s trial Inspector Biamonte and Agent Anderson testified concerning the events delineated above. Moreover, the Government produced evidence of Seckler\u2019s previous criminal convictions. Taking the stand on his own behalf, Seckler denied that he had placed the pistol in his automobile and claimed ignorance as to how it had become lodged under the driver\u2019s seat. Subsequently he moved that the charges against him be dismissed because of insufficient evidence corroborating his prior admission. The trial court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-18\">Smith v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 147, 151-157, 75 S.Ct. 194, 99 L.Ed. 192, and Opper v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 84, 93, 75 S.Ct. 158, 99 L.Ed. 101, clearly indicate that corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, independent of a confession or admission of an accused, to establish all elements of a crime allegedly committed. Indeed, the Government fulfills its duty when it introduces substantial independent evidence which tends to establish the trustworthiness of an accused\u2019s admissions. Of course, an admission coupled with independent corroborating evidence must ultimately be sufficient to justify a jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Opper v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 93, 75 S.Ct. 158. In other words, all elements of an offense must be established by independent evidence or corroborated admissions. However, one available mode of corroboration is utilized when independent evidence bolsters an admission and thereby proves the offense \u201cthrough\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>accused\u2019s own statements. Smith v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 156, 75 S.Ct. 194.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Here the testimony of Inspector Biamonte and Agent Anderson, as well as the exhibits introduced by the Government, independently buttressed Seekler\u2019s admission that he had knowingly transported the pistol from Texas to Mexico. The trial court correctly denied Seckler\u2019s request for a directed verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-12\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g) (1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">(1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; to ship or transport any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b702-14\">.
