It was discovered missing the following Monday morning, September 29, 1969. Defendant was apprehended driving it in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 1, 1969. He was without motor vehicle registration or driver\u2019s license. At the time of his arrest he falsely represented himself to be the owner of the car. At trial his subsequent alibi was effectively impeached. The evidence is clearly sufficient to sustain the conviction. Cf. Burke v. United States, 388 F.2d 286 (8 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">On appeal error is urged as to the court\u2019s instruction that possession of a recently stolen automobile, if not satisfactorily explained, is a circumstance from which the jury may reasonably draw the inference of knowingly transporting a stolen vehicle in interstate commerce. This standard instruction has drawn continued approval without exception from this court. See Burke v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
