Hall, United States District Judge, Los Angeles, California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b300-16\">HALL, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">From an extremely complicated trial raising perplexing procedural and factual situations which required a 22 page opinion by the Trial Judge, Honorable John F. Kilkenny, two points are urged by appellant :</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">1. Did the appellant insurance company assume and negligently perform the inspection and repairing of the subject ship which went aground at launching before the purchaser, Stanley, accepted it from the boat works ?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-19\">2. Did the risk contract of insurance to the boat builder cover the purchaser\u2019s loss of profits for the delay resulting from the grounding and the ship\u2019s subsequent idleness for repairs?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">The first point raises purely factual matters which were thoroughly tried by a competent and experienced trial judge and decided against appellant. This court will not disturb those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">The second point raises a mixed question of law and fact concerning an interpretation of the contract of insurance. Here again the trial judge decided against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-22\">The question turns on the meaning of the words \u201cconsequential damages\u201d as used in the insurance contract, excepting such damages from coverage. The trial court found as a fact that the damage for loss of profits, while the ship was laid up for repairs after delivery to Stanley, was \u201ccaused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>stresses and strains built into and enhanced by the launching mishap\u201d when the boat was still in the possession of the builder, and further held, as a matter of law, that such is \u201cnot a \u2018consequential damage\u2019 but flows from the original defect at a later period of time. Leyland Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Soc. Ltd., (1918, A.C. 350); Lanasa Fruit S.S. &amp; Importing Co. v. Universal Ins. Co., 302 U.S. 556, [58 S.Ct. 371, 82 L.Ed. 422] (1938). Additionally, the language of an exclusion must be strictly construed against the insurance company. I-L Logging Co. v. Manufacturers &amp; Wholesalers Indemnity Exchange, 202 Or. 277, 273 P.2d 212, 275 P.2d 226 (1954).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b301-6\">KOELSCH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aca\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">As the court\u2019s opinion indicates, the trial judge held Union liable in damages under each of two unrelated theories:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">1. the gratuitous assumption of the repair of the damaged vessel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">2. a contractual obligation arising under the policy of insurance. Stanley v. Onetta Boat Works, Inc., 303 F.Supp. 99 (D.Or.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">This court affirms the judgment on both bases. I have grave doubts that Union\u2019s obligation extended beyond liability for injury to the vessel itself during construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The policy of insurance in terms provides that Union shall not be liable for \u201cany consequential damages or loss through delay.\u201d Even if the meaning of \u201cconsequential damages\u201d is ambiguous, I am not convinced that the same may be said of the succeeding phrase \u201closs through delay.\u201d But I express no views on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The evidence does fully support the findings essential to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that Union was liable as a volunteer wholly aside from the policy of insurance. I therefore concur in affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-24\">. \u201cIt is ancient learning that one who assumes to act, even though gratuitously, may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully, if he acts at all.\u201d Glanzer v. Shepard, 233 N.Y. 236, 135 N.E. 275 (1922).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
