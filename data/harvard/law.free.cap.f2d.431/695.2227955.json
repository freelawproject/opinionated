Pitts, 5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 534 we again delved into the issue of whether the evidence on the defendant\u2019s mental competence at the time of the offense would support a judgment denying a motion for acquittal. Seeing little in this case that would distinguish it from <em>Pitts, </em>we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">As did <em>Pitts, </em>this case centered around a battle of the experts. The defendant stipulated that he had committed the act of forcefully taking money from a bank. Thus the only remaining problem was the defendant\u2019s mental capacity. Under the standards of Blake v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 407 F.2d 908, 916, a defendant is deemed insane if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-15\">\u201c \u2018(1) * * * At the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-16\">\u2018(2) As used in this Article, the terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">The testifying doctors are classifiable in the two distinct categories \u2014 those who thought that O\u2019Neal was a psychotic and those that thought O\u2019Neal was a sociopath.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">As we said in <em>Blake </em>\u201cthe evidence could go either way.\u201d Here the jury found that it went against the defendant. The jury need not be bound by defendant\u2019s expert testimony, especially since there are \u201cmaterial variations between the experts themselves * * Mims v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 135, 143. It was for the jury, not the Court. The jury could and did select among the conflicting inferences. We find nothing to disturb its judgment here.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
