The wife\u2019s action is for personal injury sustained on August 16, 1934, while she was a customer in the defendant\u2019s store, as the result of slipping on some ice cream which had fallen upon the floor. The husband\u2019s action is for consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">The principal question is whether there was any evidence for the jury of the defendant\u2019s negligence with respect to</p>\n<p id=\"ASA\">the presence of the ice cream upon the floor. On this issue the wife\u2019s own testimony was to this effect: It was a rainy afternoon and \u201cvery bad out.\u201d As she entered the store she proceeded from twelve to fifteen feet or a little more toward a stairway leading to the basement. There was \u201ca lot of sawdust\u201d on the floor. There was sawdust completely over \u201cthis general whole floor space.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>all over the floor space. It was scattered, now and t\u00edren, scattered around.\u201d She fell about half way between the brass rail on the stairway and the corner of the ice cream counter. She had to go by \u201ca lot of people\u201d standing at the entrance eating ice cream, and there were more people in the aisle near the stairway. The piece of ice cream on which she slipped \u201cwas like a scoop of ice cream.\u201d It was \u201cround on all sides just as if it had come out of the top of an ice cream cone.\u201d It seemed as though there was a scoopful of ice cream where she fell, and the sawdust was all around, \u201call over the ice cream and all mixed in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 daughter, called by the plaintiffs, testified that the sawdust on the floor was \u201ckind of soggy\u201d; that you could see where her mother stepped in the ice cream with her heel, and there was some ice cream left \u201cwhere the sawdust was covered over\u201d; that it was \u201clike an ice cream cone full\u201d; that sawdust was scattered all around the ice cream counter and where she and her mother had come in at the door, \u201caround the front of it\u201d; that there was \u201csawdust on the ice cream and it was kind of wet\u201d; that the ice cream was \u201cright near the ice cream counter\u201d; that she did not know whether the ice cream was in the shape of a scoop; that it looked \u201cas though it was a half scoop full and was a five cent size\u201d; that \u201cthe sawdust was coming from the door all the way in and about down to the right hand side of the stairway\u201d; that there was quite a lot of it, about an inch, on the floor, thicker in some places than in others; that the floor was damp and people\u2019s shoes were probably wet from the rain \u201cas they walked down.\u201d Some carried umbrellas. When asked whether the ice cream or the sawdust was \u201ccloser to the floor\u201d this witness answered, \u201cWell, the ice cream you could see most, because there wasn\u2019t much sawdust where she scraped it.\u201d Where it was scraped away you could see the ice cream. There was an area perhaps four inches long, \u201cwhere she scraped it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Both witnesses testified to the presence of numbers of-, people about the door, the ice cream counter, and the approach to the stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>We have stated the evidence in considerable detail because of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that it would warrant the jury in finding that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the ice cream on the floor and had used the sawdust to cover it up without removing it. The evidence fails to support that contention. Neither the testimony of Mrs. Beach nor that of her daughter has any tendency to show that the sawdust had been placed upon the floor with reference to the ice cream, whether the sawdust covered the entire floor or was scattered in various places. A finding that the sawdust had been put in one place would be contrary to all of the evidence. The dampness of the floor near an entrance, due to the tramping of many wet feet, would furnish at least as plausible a reason for the spreading of sawdust as would the dropping of one scoopful of ice cream. With sawdust on the floor and customers coming and going, the ice cream would quickly become covered and mixed with sawdust. Moreover, Mrs. Beach had stepped into it before the witnesses saw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The evidence wholly fails to show that the defendant rather than some customer was responsible for the dropping of the ice cream, or that it had been on the floor long enough to charge the defendant with negligence. There is no reason to suppose that the sawdust was a source of danger, and there was no evidence of negligence in the condition of the floor itself. <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>Valley Arena Inc. </em>299 Mass. 351, and cases cited. This case is very similar to <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Hudner, </em>213 Mass. 257, and is to be classed with that case and with <em>Zugbie </em>v. <em>J. R. Whipple Co. </em>230 Mass. 19; <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>248 Mass. 362; <em>Mascary </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>258 Mass. 524; <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>277 Mass. 431; <em>Tariff </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>299 Mass. 129, and <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>299 Mass. 318. It is distinguishable from <em>Anjou </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>208 Mass. 273; <em>Tack </em>v. <em>Ruffo, </em>263 Mass. 487; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>266 Mass. 12; <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>269 Mass. 431; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>F.

Ramps as means of overcoming differences in level are in common use in theatres, railway stations, stores and other public places. If properly constructed (and there was in this case no evidence or offer of proof to the contrary), their presence, like that of steps, must be accepted by patrons, and is not a ground of liability. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Evangelical Baptist Benevolent &amp; Missionary Society of Boston, </em>181 Mass. 285. <em>Chick </em>v. <em>Gilchrist Co. </em>208 Mass. 183. <em>Pastrick </em>v. <em>S.
