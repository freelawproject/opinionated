The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and now comes before us on the defendant's exceptions to the denial of its motions for a directed verdict, and for the entry of a verdict in its favor under the leave reserved by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">The evidence tended to show the following facts: On February 9, 1936, at about 3:30 p.m. the plaintiff, having purchased tickets of admission to the theatre in question for himself and his nephew, proceeded through its main lobby and ascended a flight of stairs leading to a balcony. The defendant's usher, who was stationed about six feet away from the landing at the head of these stairs, informed the plaintiff that no seats were available in that balcony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and the plaintiff then went up a second flight of stairs leading to an upper balcony. Finding no vacant seats he came down those stairs intending to leave the theatre, and proceeded to the landing at the head of the flight of stairs first referred to, where he then noticed that water had collected. He stepped on the water collected on the landing, slipped and fell, sustaining personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">On the day of the accident it had been raining, \u201cwith some snow and sleet and the streets were wet and slushy.\u201d The plaintiff was wearing rubbers, and \u201ctracked water into the theatre as did other patrons.\u201d On the landing where the plaintiff fell there was a wet area about two and one half feet wide by four feet long, and of such a depth that a movement of the foot would cause a \u201csplash.\u201d The defendant\u2019s usher had observed the water collecting there for over an hour and a half before the accident occurred. After the plaintiff fell it was necessary to \u201cbrush\u201d the water from his overcoat. The landing involved was overlaid with hard rubber tiling which was slippery when wet. The water collected there had been tracked in by the patrons of the theatre.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, as an invitee, to exercise ordinary care and diligence to maintain the theatre in a reasonably safe condition, or \u201cat least to warn . . . [him] against any dangers attendant upon the use of the premises which were not known to . . . [him] or obvious to any ordinarily intelligent person and either were known or in the exercise of reasonable care ought to have been known to the defendant.\u201d <em>Rynn </em>v. <em>Fox-New England Theatres, Inc. </em>299 Mass. 258, <em>259. Hale </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>274 Mass. 308, 310. <em>Tovey </em>v. <em>G. E. Lothrop Theatres Co. </em>288 Mass. 346, 347. <em>Stager </em>v. <em>G. E. Lothrop Theatres Co. </em>291 Mass. 464, 465. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corp. </em>301 Mass. 348, 350. The evidence as to the area and depth of the puddle of water on the hard, smooth landing and the evidence that when wet the landing was slippery warranted a finding that it was in a dangerous condition. <em>Judson </em>v. <em>American Railway Express Co. </em>242 Mass. 269, 271.. Compare <em>Rosenthal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>v. <em>Central Garage of Lynn, Inc. </em>279 Mass. 574; <em>Tariff </em>v. S. <em>S. Kresge Co. </em>299 Mass. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">The water was in full view of the defendant\u2019s usher, who saw it collecting on the landing for at least an hour and a half prior to the accident and knew that when wet the landing was slippery. In these circumstances the jury could have found that the defendant had knowledge of the dangerous condition. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>293 Mass. 232, 233-234. <em>Connair </em>v. <em>J. H. Beattie Co. </em>298 Mass. 550, 551. Compare <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co. </em>296 Mass. 489, 490; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>299 Mass. 318, 320; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Circuit Management Corp. </em>301 Mass. 348. Considering the size and location of the \u201cpuddle,\u201d the length of time of its existence to the knowledge of the defendant\u2019s employee, and the comparative ease with which it could have been removed, the jury would have been warranted in finding the defendant negligent in permitting the dangerous condition to continue up to the time that the plaintiff sustained his injuries, or in not warning the plaintiff of the condition. <em>Tack </em>v. <em>Ruffo, </em>263 Mass. 487, 488. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>293 Mass. 232, 234, and cases cited. Compare <em>Kiley </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>301 Mass. 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The fact that the plaintiff first noticed the collection of water \u201cjust before he fell\u201d is not conclusive evidence that he was guilty of contributory negligence. Knowledge of the presence of a condition that is liable to cause a person to slip in attempting to pass over it does not require a ruling that one injured in attempting to pass over the slippery place is precluded from recovery by negligence. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>200 Mass. 445, 448, and cases cited. \u201cOne is not negligent unless he takes greater risks than a man of ordinary prudence would take in a like situation.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Berkshire Street Railway, </em>281 Mass. 47, 50, and cases cited. The questions of the defendant\u2019s negligence and of the plaintiff\u2019s due care were properly submitted to the jury. <em>Winship </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>201 Mass. 273, 275. <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>301 Mass. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
