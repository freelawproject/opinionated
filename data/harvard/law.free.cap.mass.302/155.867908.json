Subsequently the case was tried to a jury, before whom the auditor\u2019s report was introduced in evidence. Further evidence was also presented. Each of the two counts in the declaration alleges ordinary negligence on the part of the defendant. At the close of the evidence the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">There was evidence tending to show the following facts: On the afternoon of February 12, 1934, the intestate, a girl eleven years of age, was coasting \u201cdown hill\u201d with two other children on Sprague Street, in the town of Dedham, on a sled known as a \u201cFlexible Flyer.\u201d When they reached a point near the \u201cbottom of the hill,\u201d the sled collided with the front of a motor vehicle, \u201ca large bus so called,\u201d operated by the defendant and \u201cgoing in the opposite direction on Sprague Street on the right side, at a speed of about thirty miles per horn1.\u201d Immediately after the collision the intestate and one of the other children were under the front part of the vehicle, together with the sled which was \u201ctipped over.\u201d The intestate was at that time \u201cyelling and hollering.\u201d The defendant \u201cgot out of the bus\u201d immediately; looked at the intestate \u201cunder the bus,\u201d and, returning at once to the driver\u2019s seat, backed the \u201cbus\u201d a distance of about seven feet. \u201cWhen the bus backed up\u201d the cries of the intestate ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The auditor found that the intestate was coasting at the time of the accident on a street where coasting was prohibited by law; that this was the determining factor and that it was \u201cunnecessary to consider the degree of negligence in . . . [the] case, nor the accident.\u201d He made no findings of fact touching the events that succeeded the original collision with the \u201cbus.\u201d At the trial before the jury the physician who attended the intestate testified that the cause of her death was a fractured skull and that'the whole left side of her skull had been punctured. He further testified that at the time she received that injury she \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>immediately killed or died \u2014 became unconscious and died right afterward,\u201d and that in his opinion she did not and would not cry out from the time she received the injury resulting in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The plaintiff contends that, when the intestate received the injuries resulting in her death, she was not coasting and was not acting in violation of law; that on all the evidence the jury could find that her death was caused by the negligence of the defendant in backing the \u201cbus\u201d; and that her previous act of coasting was not a contributing cause of the injuries which caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The jury could find that after the collision the \u201cbus\u201d came to a stop; that the defendant alighted and saw the intestate under the front part of the vehicle; that she \u201cwas yelling and hollering\u201d; that when the defendant reentered his vehicle and backed it up for about seven feet the intestate\u2019s cries ceased; and that it was at that point of time that the injuries which caused her death were sustained. In these circumstances we think it cannot be said, as matter of law, that the intestate was acting in violation of law when the vehicle was backed up, nor that her previous illegal act in coasting upon a street where coasting was prohibited was so intimately connected as a proximate cause with the injuries that caused her death that the plaintiff may not recover, if the evidence would warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent in backing the bus, and as a result the intestate suffered the injuries which caused her death. The case of <em>Query </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>273 Mass. 92, is distinguishable in the facts from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The burden of proving that the defendant was negligent was upon the plaintiff. It \u201cwas an affirmative burden and could not be left to surmise, conjecture or imagination,\u201d but the plaintiff was not \u201cbound to exclude every other possibility of cause for . . . [the] injury [and death of the intestate] except that of the negligence of the defendant,\u201d and was only \u201crequired to show by evidence a greater likelihood that . . . [the intestate\u2019s injuries resulting in her death] came from an act of negligence for which the defendant is responsible than from a cause for which . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>[he] is not liable.\u201d <em>Bigwood </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>209 Mass. 345, 348. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>301 Mass. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On all the facts disclosed by the evidence, we are of opinion that the question, whether the injuries sustained by the intestate which resulted in her death were caused by the negligence of the defendant in backing his vehicle, was for the determination of the jury. Accordingly, the entry will be</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
