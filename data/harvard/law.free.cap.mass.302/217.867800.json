The plaintiff, on the other hand, contended that the divorce was part of a plan of the defendant to enable him to marry the plaintiff\u2019s wife, which in fact he did upon the divorce becoming absolute. The witness Stedenfeld was permitted to testify to a conversation between herself and the defendant which resulted from a telephone call she had had from an attorney at the conclusion of the divorce hearing. This conversation was in substance that the witness told the defendant that the attorney had asked the witness to give the defendant a message and to call the attorney as soon as the defendant came; that the attorney said, \u201cI think we won,\u201d and that he and another attorney had \u201ckept his [the defendant\u2019s] name out pretty well\u201d; that the witness asked the defendant not to call the attorney \u201cto show that he was interested in the mess at all\u201d; and that the defendant said that he would not. When asked the question, \u201cWas there anything else Mr. Warren said as the result of what you told him?\u201d the witness replied, \u201cHe said, \u00a3Oh, to hell with it.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We are not ready to say that evidence tending to show that when the woman who was or had been the defendant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e told the defendant that an attorney in a divorce case brought by the plaintiff\u2019s wife against the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>had asked that the defendant call him and had said, \u201cI think we won\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s name had been kept out pretty well, the defendant expressed no surprise, made no denial, and merely agreed that he would not call the attorney \u201cto show that he was interested in the mess at all\u201d and said, \u201cOh, to hell with it,\u201d was wholly without significance as an admission and as bearing, in connection with other evidence, upon the relations of the defendant with the plaintiff\u2019s wife and with the divorce suit. We think such evidence had some probative force.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Evidence was admitted that on July 6, 1935, four days after the defendant was served with the summons in this action, he \u201cpersonally\u201d withdrew all the money in six savings bank accounts, aggregating $17,000, of which there were two in each of three banks, one of each pair of accounts standing in his mother\u2019s name and the other in his mother\u2019s name as trustee for him; that the orders upon which these withdrawals were made were dated June 11, 1935, and bore signatures which purported to be his mother\u2019s, but which expert testimony tended to show were \u201cnot the same signature\u201d signed by his mother on the original deposit cards; that, previous to June 11, the defendant knew that the plaintiff had threatened to sue him; that one of the banks did business with the defendant and did not know his mother, although she had signed the orders for years; that his mother was a widow of advanced age and in ill health; that she died three days after the withdrawals were made; that the defendant was her only heir; and that \u201cno probate of the estate had been undertaken.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">If the bank accounts had stood in the defendant\u2019s name, evidence that he had withdrawn them after suit was threatened or brought would clearly have been competent. <em>Labrie </em>v. <em>Midwood, </em>273 Mass. 578, 580, and cases cited. We think the other circumstances disclosed tended to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sufficient interest or potential interest on his part in these deposits to render his conduct in relation to them of some evidential weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> As to this evidence, the judge charged the jury that \u201con the state of the evidence, I instruct you as a matter of law that these bank deposits were the property of Minnie E. Warren [the defendant\u2019s mother], individually, and that the evidence of the withdrawals was only admissible for the limited purpose of showing consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant.\u201d \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
