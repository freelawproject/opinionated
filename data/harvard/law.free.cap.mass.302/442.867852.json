The writ describes the defendant as a corporation. The defendant\u2019s exceptions are to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict; to the refusal of the trial judge to instruct the jury that, \u201c5. The burden is on the plaintiff to show not only that the contract alleged was within the corporate powers of the defendant, but also that it was either made or ratified by an officer or officers having authority to bind the corporation. 6. The president or other executive officer of a corporation has no authority as such to make a contract that one should remain in the corporate employ for life even under a general power to appoint, remove and fix the compensation of employees, and such authority cannot be implied\u201d; and to the action of the trial judge directing the defendant\u2019s counsel to refrain in final argument from referring to \u201cthe necessity for, and to the lack of authority or ratification, to bind the defendant by such a contract as claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The defendant states in its brief that \u201cThe precise issues raised by this appeal [sic] are these, viz.: 1. The pretrial report did not eliminate the issue of corporate authority or ratification. 2. Defendant was seriously prejudiced by being denied the right to argue the issue of corporate authority or ratification to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The \u201cbody\u201d of a pre-trial report of the case which was \u201con file\u201d is printed in full in the record. It appears therein that both parties were represented by counsel. Under the heading \u201cConcessions or Admissions\u201d appears: \u201cOn July 13, 1932 an agreement for employment was made between the parties. The plaintiff claims that the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ment was entirely oral. The defendant claims that a written memorandum of the full terms of the employment agreement was drawn up and each party kept a copy. This memorandum was not signed by the parties. The compensation provided in this agreement was as set forth in the declaration. The plaintiff claims that the agreement was to employ the plaintiff permanently. The defendant claims that their employment agreement was for an indefinite period and could be terminated at the will of either party. The defendant did terminate the contract on August 31, 1932. Since that date the defendant has declined to employ him. The plaintiff was paid for the period ending August 31st and no payment has been made for any period after that date.\u201d Under the heading \u201cRemarks\u201d appears: \u201cThe defendant further relies on the amendment to the answer that there was just cause for terminating the agreement even though it was a permanent agreement, as the plaintiff claims. On July 11, 1932 the plaintiff assigned to the defendant a then pending application for letters patent on a \u2018paintless golf ball\u2019. The defendant denies that this assignment was in consideration of the employment agreement or that the plaintiff abandoned or agreed to abandon any business of his own in reliance upon the employment agreement.\u201d On the same day that the pre-trial report was made, October 8, 1936, the defendant was allowed to amend its answer, which was one of general denial and a plea of payment, by adding thereto \u201cthat if it should appear that any such contract or arrangement as alleged by the plaintiff was entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant, which the defendant denies, the plaintiff was rightfully discharged by the defendant for incompetence and disobedience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">The defendant does not contend that it is not bound by whatever concession or agreement may have been made by its counsel at the pre-trial call. It concedes that the pre-trial procedure provides for the possible elimination or narrowing of issues by some \u201cstipulation or some admission\u201d regarding them. See <em>Fanciullo </em>v. <em>B. G. &amp; S. Theatre Corp. </em>297 Mass. 44; <em>Capano </em>v. <em>Melchionno, </em>297 Mass. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>14-16; <em>Eckstein </em>v. <em>Scoffi, </em>299 Mass. 573, 576; <em>Finegan </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>300 Mass. 147, 148; <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Cushner, </em>300 Mass. 583, 585; <em>R. Dunkel, Inc. </em>v. <em>V. Barletta Co., ante, </em>7, 9. See now Rule 57A of the Superior Court (1932) adopted April 9, 1938. The precise contention of the defendant, worded somewhat differently, but nevertheless to the same effect, is stated to be that \u201cthe parties did not agree to narrow or eliminate the vital issue of corporate authority or ratification raised by the defendant\u2019s general denial. <em>The claim of the defendant was that another and quite different contract was made </em>[italics ours]. The plaintiff continued to have the burden of proof to show authority to make the contract <em>which he alleges was made, </em>or prove ratification of it. In no sense was there any stipulation or agreement that narrowed or eliminated that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\">It is obvious that the question raised must be answered by a determination of the force and effect of the language contained in that part of the pre-trial report entitled \u201cConcessions or Admissions.\u201d It is proper to consider the circumstances under which the pre-trial report was made. Adversary counsel, representing their clients, were before a judge of the Superior Court for the purpose, if possible, among other things, of providing for the elimination or narrowing of issues by some stipulation or admission regarding them. The defendant\u2019s attorney could not be required to surrender any substantive rights of his client, but if, as such attorney, he made some stipulation or admission as to the existence or nonexistence of facts or as to issues involved or not involved in the case, the client should be bound by these stipulations or admissions made in its behalf or against its interest, unless some reason is disclosed why it should not. <em>Graustein </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>293 Mass. 207, 217. <em>Fanciullo </em>v. <em>B. G. &amp; S. Theatre Corp. </em>297 Mass. 44, 51. Although it is a general principle as to the conduct of jury trials that the presiding judge may alter issues to be submitted to the jury and discharge or modify ordinary stipulations touching the course of the trial, in order to accomplish justice, <em>Capano </em>v. <em>Melchionno, </em>297 Mass. 1, 15, and cases cited, nevertheless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>necessity for the exercise of this authority by the trial judge before a stipulation may be discharged emphasizes the seriousness attendant upon the making of an admission or the entering into stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\">No argument has been addressed to us as to the meaning of the word \u201cagreement\u201d appearing in the \u201cConcessions or Admissions.\u201d The defendant has not suggested that the word was used in any popular sense. In point of fact it concedes that \u201canother and quite different contract\u201d was made from that which the plaintiff relied upon. In the leading case of <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>17 Mass. 122, there is an extended discussion of the meaning of this word \u201cagreement.\u201d It is said that in a popular sense it is frequently used as declaring the engagement of one only, but that it also is used in a technical sense importing a mutual act of two parties. In <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Marcy, </em>9 Allen, 8, it was said, by Chief Justice Bigelow, at page 10, in discussing the meaning of the word \u201cagreement,\u201d in the statute providing that no action shall be brought upon an agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof, that, \u201cIn the absence of any explanatory or qualifying words, it must be interpreted according to the common and approved usage of the language, unless it has some peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law. ... In whichever sense it is understood \u2014 whether it is to be interpreted as signifying a mutual contract, and as intended to include the stipulations of both parties, <em>which is its strict legal meaning, </em>[italics ours] ... or as a promise or undertaking by one party only, of a purely unilateral character,\u201d the requirement of the statute is that it is to be in writing. Compare <em>Cunniff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>196 Mass. <em>7; Marcelle, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sol. &amp; S. Marcus Co. </em>274 Mass. 469; see <em>Sage </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>6 Conn. 81, 85-87; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>3 Vt. 290; <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Warlters, </em>5 East, 10, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In what sense was the word \u201cagreement\u201d used by the parties and by the judge in the case at bar? An \u201cagreement for employment was made between the parties,\u201d and \u201cThe compensation provided in this agreement was as set forth in the declaration.\u201d \u201cThe plaintiff claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>agreement was entirely oral. The defendant claims that a written memorandum of the full terms of the employment agreement was drawn up and each party kept a copy. This memorandum was- not signed by the parties. . . . The plaintiff claims that the agreement was to employ the plaintiff permanently. The defendant claims that their employment agreement was for an indefinite period and could be terminated at the will of either party. The defendant did terminate the <em>contract </em>[italics oursj on August 31, 1932. Since that time the defendant has declined to employ him. The plaintiff was paid for the period ending August 31st and no payment has been made for any period after that date.\u201d Could this mean anything else to the judge and the experienced counsel in the case than that the parties had made a contract for employment of the plaintiff by the defendant at a specified compensation, and that the only issue between the parties on this branch of the case was as to the terms of the contract of employment? It is true that the judge in the report safeguarded a further issue when, under the heading \u201cRemarks,\u201d it is stated that \u201cThe defendant further relies on the amendment to the answer that there was just cause for terminating the agreement even though it was a permanent agreement, as the plaintiff claims.\u201d It is also true that the bill of exceptions recites interviews between the plaintiff and the treasurer, president, and another officer of the defendant, relative to the matter of employment and that the evidence was conflicting as to the terms of the employment, but nowhere is there any suggestion that the officers of the defendant who employed the plaintiff were acting without authority to do so. It is also true, as contended by the defendant, that the burden was on the plaintiff to show that the contract alleged was either made or ratified by an officer or officers having authority to bind the corporation. <em>James F. Monaghan Inc. </em>v. <em>M. Lowenstein &amp; Sons Inc. </em>290 Mass. 331, 333. But this burden was disposed of favorably to the plaintiff by the concession or admission that an agreement for employment was made \u201cbetween the parties.\u201d That this agreement between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>parties amounted to a contract is emphasized by the further statement in the pre-trial report of the admission that the defendant terminated \u201cthe contract\u201d on August 31, 1932. The attorneys must be credited with having had in mind at the time of the pre-trial call that the defendant in making a contract must, of necessity, act through its agents or officers, that if a contract was made between the \u201cparties,\u201d one of which was the defendant, the authority of the latter\u2019s agents or officers to make the contract was an essential factor, and that the question of the existence or lack of existence of authority was foreclosed by a concession or admission that a contract was made \u201cbetween the parties.\u201d Compare <em>Kidney </em>v. <em>Stoddard, 7 </em>Met. 252, 255-256. <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>133 Mass. 276, 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">The attorneys for the defendant at the pre-trial call were not required to concede anything. It is not unreasonable to hope, however, that in the cooperative effort on the part of the Superior Court and bar to simplify and expedite the trial of cases, counsel will be disposed to agree as to matters concerning which there is no real controversy. The primary duty of any court is to see that justice is done, and if it should appear at the trial of any case that justice requires the discharge of stipulations or admissions which appear to have been improvidently made, or for the purpose of accomplishing justice, it is to be expected that the trial court will act in order to accomplish that end. <em>Capano </em>v. <em>Melchionno, </em>297 Mass. 1, 15, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The pre-trial report in the case at bar appears to have been carefully drawn. It was put in writing and signed by the presiding judge. It was \u201con file\u201d in the case. It is a part of the record that is before us. It contains the statement of a concession or admission that the \u201cparties\u201d made an agreement for employment. This agreement is therein referred to as \u201cthe contract.\u201d Nowhere is there a suggestion or intimation of any question of the lack of authority of anyone acting in behalf of the defendant to make the agreement. The terms of the agreement were in dispute, but nowhere in the report is there any qualification of the admitted fact that the parties made an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The only argument of the defendant that its motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed is that the record fails to disclose any evidence of corporate authority to make the agreement that the plaintiff alleges he made with the defendant or of any ratification of it, and that the pre-trial report did not eliminate this issue. This argument is disposed of by what has already been said. It also follows from what has been said that there was no error in the refusal of the trial judge to give the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings and in his refusal to permit the defendant\u2019s counsel to argue the question of lack of authority or ratification. We cannot agree with the contention of the defendant that the trial judge did not consider the pre-trial report as an admission by the defendant, for the reason that he stated that the question of authorization or ratification \u25a0 could not be raised by the defendant because \u201cit was not raised in a pre-trial report on file.\u201d We think it is evident that the trial judge regarded that question as foreclosed by the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
