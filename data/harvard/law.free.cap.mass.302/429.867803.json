At the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict in its favor. The motion was denied, subject to the defendant's exception, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. The writ was in \u201cContract or tort,\u201d and the second count of the declaration is in tort for negligence. The bill of exceptions, however, speaks of the action as one of contract for breach of warranty, and we therefore assume that the count in tort was waived. <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>282 Mass. 548, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff may be summarized as follows: On September 16, 1933, \u201cbetween 3:30 and 3:45 p.m.,\u201d the plaintiff accompanied by her son \u201cwent into the cafeteria of the defendant.\u201d When seated she ordered chop suey. Noodles are customarily served with chop suey, but since the cafeteria was \u201cout of noodles,\u201d the plaintiff received in lieu of the noodles an \u201cextra helping\u201d of chop suey. The order served her consisted of about ten tablespoonfuls of which she ate seven. After eating the chop suey she experienced no ill effects, but on her way home \u201cit felt like grease coming up in her throat,\u201d and at \u201cabout 5:30 she got a terrible headache and cramps, took an alkaseltzer\u201d and reclined for a while. She arose and felt all right except for \u201cgrease coming up in her throat,\u201d until about 11 p.m. when she went to bed. At about 1:45 the next morning she vomited and \u201chad diarrhea.\u201d At 11 a.m. a physician visited her. He made a diagnosis of ptomaine poisoning but testified that in the light of his examination of the plaintiff and the history that he received from her, eating chop suey and becoming sick thereafter would not be adequate cause for the condition found by him. He further testified that overeating would not cause the symptoms that he found to the extent that he found them, that ptomaine poisoning is the result of putrefaction of food, that \u201cdecomposition or putrefaction of food which causes the poisoning invariably has a stench\u201d; that he had received no history from the plaintiff \u201cof her eating any putrefied food\u201d \u201caside from what the plaintiff had told him of eating tea and toast in the morning and chop suey about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d He also testified that \u201cthe period of incubation is the period from the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>you come in contact with the infection until the showing up of the condition which results,\u201d and that this usually occurs within twelve hours; that it is \u201cperfectly possible that perfectly healthy foodstuff may cause food poisoning\u201d; and \u201cthat it was possible for the plaintiff to have received the abdominal infection that he found from food which she had partaken of twenty-four hours previous to the onset of the illness . . . .\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s son, who accompanied her to the cafeteria, testified that she received an extra portion of chop suey, \u201che wouldn\u2019t call it a good generous serving\u201d; that it was served from a galvanized tin container; that he \u201cheard no complaint from his mother\u201d \u201cwhile she was eating\u201d the chop suey; that \u201cthey then went straight home,\u201d but that on the way home he observed that the plaintiff \u201cbelched\u201d occasionally. There was evidence that the plaintiff vomited frequently for about three days after the onset of her illness and was confined to her bed for about two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The burden of proving that her illness was due to unwholesomeness of the chop suey was an affirmative one resting on the plaintiff which could not be left to surmise, conjecture or imagination. While she was not bound to exclude every other possibility of cause for her illness, she was required to show by. the evidence a greater likelihood that her illness resulted from unfitness or unwholesomeness of the food served to her by the defendant, rather than from a cause for which the defendant would not be liable. <em>Rocha </em>v. <em>Alber, ante, </em>155, 157, and cases cited. We are of opinion that the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff did not afford a basis for more than a conjecture that her illness was due to an unfit condition of the chop suey. There was no evidence to show what other food the plaintiff may have partaken of during the period testified to by the physician as the one of probable incubation in cases of ptomaine poisoning, except that the plaintiff\u2019s breakfast on the day involved had consisted of toast and tea. What she may have eaten between that time and the time when she ate the chop suey was left to conjecture. There was no evidence that the food \u201ctasted bad,\u201d or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>it had the appearance of unfitness. <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>282 Mass. 548, 550-551, and cases cited. Nor was there evidence that any bad odor arose therefrom, such as the physician testified invariably accompanies putrefied food. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed.
