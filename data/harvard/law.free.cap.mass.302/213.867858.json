The statement that the plaintiff \u201chas performed all of the obligations imposed upon her by the terms of said contract\u201d is not an allegation of the consideration agreed upon. <em>Newton Rubber Works </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>171 Mass. 352. <em>Wesalo </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>299 Mass. 495, 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">If, as the plaintiff suggests, an oral promise by her not to contest an account \u201cin the estate of Elizabeth Christmas\u201d was the consideration, she should have alleged that fact in order that her declaration might show a valid contract. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>White, </em>8 Gray, 589, 593. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>H. S. &amp; M. W. Snyder, Inc. 252 </em>Mass. 29, 36. <em>Gloucester Mutual Fishing Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>294 Mass. 35, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The rule that the consideration for a written promise may be shown at the trial by parol evidence does not do away with the necessity of a sufficient declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 19, whatever may be its true construction, has no bearing upon the correctness of the order sustaining the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
