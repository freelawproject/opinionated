(2) Was she bound by the admitted negligence of her son who was operating her automobile in which she was riding at the time of her injury on June 2, 1937?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The trial judge found that the registration was legal and that the plaintiff had \u201cturned over all control of the automobile to her son\u201d; and he found for the plaintiff. There was evidence that the plaintiff on January 1, 1937, and for many years prior thereto, lived at 287 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts, and that her mail address was 5 Allen Court, Medford, which was the home of her son. The application dated January 1, 1937, and admittedly signed by the plaintiff, for registration of her automobile was in evidence. In the boxed space at the top of the application is typewritten the following: \u201cGurgy Sanjean 287 Salem St Medford Mass.\u201d Space \u201c11\u201d for \u201cMassachusetts residential address . . .\u201d is blank. In space \u201c11A,\u201d for \u201cMail address, if different . . .\u2019\u2019is typewritten \u201c5 Allen Court, Medford, Massachusetts.\u201d At the top of the certificate of the insurance company, which is a part of the exhibit, and upon which is printed \u201cdo not detach,\u201d appears in typewriting: \u201cPrint Name Gurgy Sanjean Residential Address 287 Salem Street Med-ford City.\u201d Upon the certificate of registration which was issued to the plaintiff by the registry of motor vehicles, the following appears: \u201cowner\u2019s name a\u00ed\u00edd address <em>Name </em>Gurgy Sanjean <em>Street </em>5 Allen Court <em>City </em>Medford, Mass.\u201d and over \u201cGive residential address on this line if it differs from mail address,\u201d appears \u201c287 Salem St., Medford, Mass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, requires that the application and certificate of registration shall contain \u201cthe name, place of residence and address of the applicant.\u201d \u201cOne object of this legislative scheme for registration of automobiles is that there may be upon the public records an easy means of identification of the automobile and its owner.\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>294 Mass. 105, 107. \u201cEach of these documents [the application and certificate] is an essential part of the legislative plan for the registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of motor vehicles. The object of that plan is to insure at all times easy identification of the vehicle and its owner. The application is the basis of the public record which remains open for inspection in the office of the registrar.\" The certificate (except in the case of a dealer) must accompany the vehicle for use on the road.\u201d <em>Brodmerkle </em>v. <em>Gorolsky, </em>293 Mass. 517, 518. The applicant is the source of the information contained in the application and registration. <em>Lappanasse </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>297 Mass. 290, 293. The certificate of registration is issued by the registrar to the applicant. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We are of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was properly registered apart from any consideration of the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1934, c. 361. The application contained a statement of the \u201cResidential address\u201d of the plaintiff. The registrar of motor vehicles appears to have had no difficulty in so reading the application. The certificate issued by him gives the correct residential address upon the line where it is required to be given \u201cif it differs from mail address.\u201d The only real complaint of the defendant is that the residential address does not appear in the proper line provided for it in the application, but we think it is clear that the ordinary person examining the application at the registry would have no difficulty in determining the plaintiff\u2019s residence. The address \u201c5 Allen Court\u201d is unmistakably given in the space that calls for \u201cMail address\u201d if this address is different from the residential address. We think it follows that the ordinary person would, without any difficulty, reasonably conclude from an inspection of the application that the plaintiff\u2019s residential address was 287 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts. In view of the fact that the applicant is the source of the information contained in the application for registration, we think it follows reasonably that she must be considered as having adopted as her own the information contained in it and is entitled to the benefit of whatever appears. \u201cThe purpose of this requirement [as to registration] is to\" identify the owner. A descriptive statement by which he can readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>be found in the community must be given. Variations from the literal terms of the statute not affecting in material particulars this purpose do not invalidate the registration <em>. . . Topf </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>288 Mass. 552, 554. This case upon the point under discussion is distinguishable from <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>299 Mass. 105, and the cases there cited, some of which have been referred to in the defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">It follows that there was no error in the refusal of the trial judge to rule that the plaintiff \u201cillegally registered a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">There was no error in the refusal to rule that the negligence of the operator of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile barred recovery by the plaintiff. The defendant contends that the plaintiff, as matter of law, had the right to control the automobile or the right to exercise control, and that the negligence of her son, the operator, therefore, barred her recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">There was evidence that the plaintiff purchased the automobile in question in June, 1932; that at the time of the injury she was about eighty years of age, partially blind and \u201chad an advanced case of arteriosclerosis\u201d; that she was unable to read or write English, had never had a license to operate a motor vehicle, and had never operated one; that her son was the only operator of the automobile; that he kept the keys and certificate of registration and had paid the garage expenses for the two years preceding; and that the automobile was not garaged at the home of the plaintiff. On the day of the injury the plaintiff\u2019s son had the automobile for some purpose of his own and asked his father and mother if they wished to go for a drive. He had the automobile with the plaintiff\u2019s consent and she and her husband were driven to Stoneham \u201con affairs of the son.\u201d \u201cHe was not in his mother\u2019s employ and he was not her agent during the trip.\u201d On the way home, while the plaintiff was a passenger on the front seat beside the operator, her son, the accident happened. As was pointed out in the case of <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Darmochwat, </em>280 Mass. 553, 558, \u201cThe mere concurrent facts of ownership and of occupancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>of an automobile do not predicate liability for its operation by another without the further fact that the owner retained the right and power to control the manner in which it was to be driven.\u201d In the case of <em>Deyette </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>297 Mass. <em>129, </em>at page <em>132, </em>it was said that \u201cIt is true, as a general rule of law, that the test of the existence of the relationship of master and servant is the right of control and not the actual exercise of control.\u201d The court held, however, that, upon the evidence in that case, the jury could have found that \u201con the day of the accident the plaintiff had surrendered to her son the control of the automobile in which she was riding.\u201d (Page. 133.) We think it was a question of fact whether the plaintiff retained a right to control the automobile. <em>Wheeler v. Darmochwat, </em>280 Mass. 553, 558. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>288 Mass. 354, 356. <em>Guy </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>289 Mass. 225, 230. <em>Deyette </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>297 Mass. 129. <em>Kingsbury </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>300 Mass. 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
