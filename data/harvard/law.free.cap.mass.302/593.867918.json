The case was referred to an auditor, whose findings were not to be final. He found for the defendant, and the case was thereafter tried to a jury, before whom the auditor\u2019s report and other evidence were introduced. At the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict. His motion was denied subject to his exception. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judge, with the assent of the jury, reserved leave to enter a verdict for the defendant. Thereafter the judge allowed the motion of the defendant that a verdict be entered in his favor, and reported the case for the determination of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">The accident, in which the minor, who was then two years and eleven months old., was injured, occurred on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Queensberry Street, in Boston, on September 28, 1936, at \u201cabout 3.00 p.m.\u201d Queensberry Street, which begins at Park Drive and thence runs north, is level, straight and forty feet wide from curb to curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The evidence most favorable to the plaintiff tends to show the following facts: About three minutes before the accident occurred the plaintiff and a boy not quite a year older than he was ran from an alleyway which leads into Queensberry Street. They turned to the right into Queens-berry Street and ran along its easterly sidewalk; then, turning to the left, they started to cross the street, Two automobiles were coming from the direction of Park Drive and were headed north. The first was a small coup\u00e9; the second was the defendant\u2019s vehicle, which was proceeding about two car lengths behind the coup\u00e9. The only evidence as to the speed at which the defendant was operating his vehicle was that he was going \u201cslowly\u201d or \u201cvery slowly\u201d or at a speed of \u201cseven to eight miles an hour.\u201d \u201cThere were some cars parked at the curb on the east side of the street and the two boys left the sidewalk to cross the street at a point quite near the front of one\u201d of these parked cars. The plaintiff\u2019s companion was \u201cahead of the plaintiff\u201d and \u201calmost ran into the\u201d coup\u00e9. \u201cHe ducked and got out of the way and went back to the sidewalk. The plaintiff stood still, then started to run and stopped and the front right wheel of the . . . [defendant\u2019s automobile] struck him.\u201d The defendant stopped his \u201ccar as quickly as he could, and the plaintiff was lying in the street one car length behind the defendant\u2019s car and near the curb on the easterly side.\u201d The plaintiff was struck at a point \u201cabout one half a car length in front of . . . [the] parked cars.\u201d He \u201cwas a good yard from the curb when he was hit.\u201d \u201cA person in the street beyond the parked cars would have had clear vision of the . . . [coup\u00e9] approaching.\u201d The evidence most favorable to the plaintiff would not warrant a finding that any part of the extreme front of the defendant\u2019s automobile struck the plaintiff. There was evidence that the defendant saw the plaintiff\u2019s companion on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">There is nothing in the evidence to support a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>negligence on the part of the defendant. It could not be found that the plaintiff was seen or, in the exercise of proper care on the defendant\u2019s part, could have been seen by the defendant, if at all, for more than an instant before the accident. The case is governed by numerous decisions cited in <em>Rizzittelli </em>v. <em>Vestine, </em>246 Mass. 391, 392, and by such other cases as <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Mutrie, </em>247 Mass. 316, <em>McGrimley </em>v. <em>Jameson, </em>297 Mass. 280, and <em>Conte </em>v. <em>Mizzoni, </em>298 Mass. 463, 465. Compare <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>De Christopher, </em>301 Mass. 241, 243. If it be assumed in favor of the plaintiff that the jury could find that the defendant saw the plaintiff\u2019s companion on the sidewalk before the accident happened, the result we have reached would be the same. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>293 Mass. 280, 283. In view of what has been said it is unnecessary to discuss whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff or his custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
