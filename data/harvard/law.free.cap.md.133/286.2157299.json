And this is the second order here appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">It is quite clear from a.n examination of the Record, that the motion to dismiss this appeal or appeals, must prevail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>because neither of these orders are appealable, and this appeal cannot be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">It is well settled by numerous cases in this Court, that an order sustaining a demurrer to a bill, with leave to file an amended bill, is not in the nature of a final order' and the right of appeal does not exist. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Board of School Commissioners, </em>93 Md. 738; <em>Bannonv. Comegys, </em>69 Md. 411; <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>104 Atl. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In this case the plaintiff did not elect to\u00a1 stand on his bill, and accept an order dismissing the bill, but he availed himself of the leave granted to amend within the time and filed an amended bill, which was not accepted by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The law is also well established, that the action of the Court in refusing to- allow or to accept an amended or supplemental bill, is within the sound discretion of the Court and is not reviewable on appeal to this Court. <em>Calvert </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>18 Md. 73; <em>Snook </em>v. <em>Munday, </em>96 Md. 515; <em>Thompson v. Thomas &amp; Thompson Co., </em>104 Atl. 49; <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>104 Atl. 530; <em>Miller\u2019s Equity, </em>sec. 315, page 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">As to that part of the order, of the 2nd of April, 1918, which rescinded certain temporary restraining orders, which had been secured <em>ex parte </em>by the plaintiff on the original bill, we need only say, that the action of the Court, as to these orders, was merely formal and cannot avail the plaintiff on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The orders were merely ancillary to the original bill, and were practically disposed of, in sustaining the demurrer to the bill. The plaintiff abandoned the action of the Court upon the demurrer to the bill, and elected to stand on the leave to amend and sought thereby to- file an amended and supplemental bill. The order sustaining the demurrer was in effect a refusal to continue the restraining orders, and they were necessarily disposed' of by this order. <em>Spear </em>v. <em>Orendorf, </em>26 Md. 37; <em>Wagoner </em>v. <em>Wagoner, 77 </em>Md. 193; <em>Miller\u2019s Equity, </em>secs. 573 and 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">For the reasons stated, the appeal will be dismissed as to both orders appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, with costs to the appellees.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
