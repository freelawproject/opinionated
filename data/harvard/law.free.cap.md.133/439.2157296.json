Following a formal application to the asociation to procure far them, a loan of $1,500.00, at six per cent, interest, and an offer as security therefor of all moneys paid by them to the association, and No. 2016 St. Paul street, in Baltimore 'City, they agreed to-execute a mortgage to the association as trustee, and to execute coupon bonds in such denominations as might be desired, secured by the mortgage, and payable to- bearer or registered holder thereof at the maturity of the stock, or upon default, not later than ten years after date. After certain statements or representations in regard to the property to be conveyed by (lie mortgage and charges against the same, the applica^ lion contained, among others,, the following additional stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">\u201cWe further agree that said association shall be our agent in the creation of the sinking fund to meet this loan, with no risk or responsibility on the part of the person or persons advancing the money for this loan in any manner, and that we will deposit in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the dues above mentioned on the first Monday of each month, hereafter, the sum of $7.50, as interest on said loan, to be paid by said association each six months to the holders of the securities, and the sum of $16.25 as the expenses on said property' to the parties legally entitled to receive the same, and such other sum as may be necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201cIt is also understood and agreed that said association will invest and keep invested all moneys deposited by ns, and after we have deposited as dues the sum of $104.00, that the association will assume, if invested, the interest on this amount, and the same may be deducted from the monthly payments of the applicants, or added to the dues or in such other manner as may be agreed upon from time to time. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201cIt is also understood and agreed that if we adopt the drop-interest plan, we are not to share any of the profits of the association, and shall get credit for only such payments as we shall make as dues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cIt is 'further understood and agreed that if we should become in arrears in our monthly installments of dues, interest, fines, expenses or any portion of either, or shall fail to pay any expense or public dues or charges on the property when due and payable, or shall fail to keep up the improvements on the property in their present condition, or make a false statement concerning said property herein, then the entire mortgage debt shall be deemed due and payable, and any method may he pursued for the collection of the mortgage debt at the option of the trustee as may he enumerated in the mortgage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On the same day the appellees executed a mortgage of their said property to the association as trustee, and also two bonds, one for $1,000.00 and the other for $500.00, payable to bearer or -registered holder thereof, with interest, at six per cent., payable semi-annually from the 25th day of April, 1912, until the principal of the bonds was paid according to the terms of the application and mortgage, on surrender of the coupons at the office of the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The mortgage, after reciting that the appellees were members of the association;

In any method the attorney conducting the proceedings shall be allowed a fee of $25.00 in addition to usual commissions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The bonds executed by the appellees referred to the application and to the terms of the mortgage, and also contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cIt is also understood and agreed by the mortgagors tun f they will create a sinking fund to meet the series of bonds and the coupons attached thereto, and will deposit with the Eirst Mortgage Bond Homestead Association on the first Monday of each month the sum of sixteen sixty-seven-one hundred ($16.67) as a part of the principal and the sum of seven fifty-one hundred ($7.50) dollars as the accrued interest on this series of bonds and also all other expenses and charges and costs to the trustee as are particularly set forth in the sworn application for this loan and the mortgage or deed of trust which secures this bond.

Belt agent and attorney for the appellees, with power and authority to appear for them and to confess a judgment in favor of the holder of the bonds for the amount due thereon, with interest and cost of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On the 8th of March, 1918, the appellant, the First Mortgage Bond Homestead Association,, trustee, filed in the Baltimore Oity Court its declaration in a suit against the appellees \u201cto the use of Roberta Porter and Rachel E. Robey,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>application, mortgage and bonds executed by the appellees, an affidavit executed by George E. Robinson, attesting witness to the mortgage, that the debt created by the bonds was due to the holders thereof, and that the appellees had made default, and the following order signed by George E. Robinson, attorney for plaintiff, and O. Parker Baker, attorney for defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">\u201cMr. Clerk: Docket this case by consent as of tbe February Rule Day, 1918; enter tbe appearance of O. Parker Baker for tbe defendants, and enter a judgment by confession for tbe plaintiff (to tbe use of Roberta Porter as to $1,000 and to tbe use of Rachel E. Robey as to $500) for the sum of $1,500 and the cost of tbe proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The declaration alleged that the defendants executed the bonds and the mortgage in which they agreed to pay the trustee $40.39 per month with which to pay the interest on said bonds, the expenses on. said property, and to create a sinking fnnd to meet, said obligations as they became due, and that by the terms of the mortgage and application npon default in the payment of said $40.39 per month the whole of said obligations became due; that the defendants, had defaulted, their last payment being on, August. 9th, 1917, and that they had also failed to pay taxes for 1917 and the ground rent due September 1st, 1917, and March 1st, 1918, whereby the attorney for the defendants was authorized by the mortgage to confess, judgment against, them for the use of the holders of the bonds for the face value thereof, with accrued interest and costs,, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The Court below passed an order refusing to enter tbe judgment by confession, and a docket entry shows, that on the same day a judgment was entered for the defendants for costs. This appeal is from the judgment and from the order of Court refusing to enter the judgment by confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">By the termsi of the application, mortgage and bonds the appellees were required to make monthly payments to the association as, trustee, to provide a sinking fnnd for the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>demption of the honds, to cover the interest thereon and the expenses on the property conveyed to the trustee by the mortgage. According to the mortgage the aggregate amount to be paid monthly was $40.30, and according to. the application and bonds $16.67 of that amount was to be applied to the sinking! fund for the payment of the principal of the bonds,, and $7.50 was to be applied to the payment of the interest thereon as it became due. The application, mortgage and bonds were executed on the 25th of April, 1912, and the <em>narr. </em>alleges that the appellees defaulted in the payment of the monthly dues of $40.30, and that the last payment thereof was made by them on the 9th of August, 1917. It would seem therefore from the averments of the <em>narr. </em>that the appellees had complied with the terms of the application, mortgage and bonds until the default complained of, and had during a period of five years from the date of the mortgage, etc., made the monthly payments required thereby, yet there was no account or statement filed with the declaration showing the credits to which the appellees were entitled, and the judgment by confession which the plaintiff sought to have entered was for the full amount of the principal of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The appellant contends that the association in receiving the monthly payments made by the appellees acted as the agent of the appellees and not as the agent of the holders of the bonds, and that the mortgage, as a part of the security for the loan, expressly authorized a judgment by confession in favor of the trustee for the use of the holders of the bonds for the face value of the bonds and accrued interest. Assuming that under the proper construction of the application, mortgage and bonds the association received the monthly payments provided for as the trustee and agent of the appellees, and that these payments, in so far as they were applicable to the payment of the principal of the bonds and interest thereon, were not, strictly speaking, credits on the bonds until so applied by the association under the arrangement and contract between the association, bondholders and appellees, neverthdess, by the express terms of the mortgage the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>mortgage debt became due and demandable upon default, and it is conceded by the appellant that thereupon the association became the trustee or agent of the holders of the bonds \u201cto enforce the security given for their protection.\u201d One of the securities provided for the protection of the bondholders was. the sinking fund to be created by the monthly payment to the association as trastee of the sums of $16.67 and $7.50. Therefore when, upon default, the association became the trustee and agent of the holders of the bonds \u201cto enforce the' security given for their protection,\u201d there is no reason why the appellees should not have been given credit for the amount, in the sinking fund in the hands of the association available for the payment of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In <em>Huston </em>v. <em>Ditto, </em>20 Md. 305, Chief Judge Bowie, said: There were three kinds of judgments recognized by, our courts, viz: interlocutory judgments,, final and effective judgments and judgments which were final but not effective, and he quotes the statement iu <em>Evans\u2019 Pr. </em>339: \u201cA judgment by confession is not, in our practice, considered an interlocutory judgment; * * * the confession is considered, as an admission of the whole claim, unless it is made, as it frequently is, on terms. The terms, whatever they may he, \u2022 are in that case reduced to writing and given to the clerk, who inserts, them in his memorandum.\u201d Mr. Poe states that a final and effective judgment was one where \u201cnothing remained to be done to establish hoth the liability of the defendant and its precise extent,\u201d and he gives as examples of judgments that were final but not effective until the precise amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was ascertained: \u201cA judgment by confession for the plaintiff without specifying the amount; a judgment by confession for the plaintiff \u2018on terms to be filed,\u2019 and a judgment for the plaintiff for so much as A. B. shall say is due.\u201d 2 <em>Poe P. &amp; </em>Psec. 357. But he says in section 357A that since the Act of 1864, Oh. 311 (sec. 18, Art. 26 of the Ctade of 1912), \u201cour common-law judgments are simply of two, kinds: interlocutory and final.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Judgments, like mortgages, may be taken as collateral security for an existing indebtedness, or as security for future advances. Mr. Poe says that when a judgment is \u201centered for either of these purposes an express written agreement should be filed in the case, to show the precise character and object of the judgment and prevent subsequent controversy,\u201d and, we may add, as suggested in <em>Evans' Practice, supra, </em>the substance of the agreement, or at least a reference to it should be inserted by the clerk in his memorandum. 2 <em>Poe's P. &amp; P., </em>sec. 401; <em>Neidig </em>v. <em>Whiteford, </em>29 Md. 183-184; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Con. Real Estate Co., </em>55 Md. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In the case at bar the judgment by confession which the appellant attempted to have entered was a final judgment determining' the extent of the appellees\u2019 liability as of the date thereof to be the amount of the principal of the bonds, whereas the application, mortgage, bonds and declaration indicated that the appellees were entitled to credits not allowed in the judgment. If the judgment was intended merely as collateral security for whatever sum should be found upon a proper accounting to be due the association as the trustee and agent of the holders of the bonds, there should have been an agreement filed and a memorandum in the judgment to be entered to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The appellant contends that the entry of the judgment as proposed would not have exposed the appellees to' the danger of any injustice to them, because if the association had attempted \u201cto collect the whole amount of the judgment without crediting the amounts which had been paid into the association the 'O'ourt of law had adequate and ample powers to prevent that from being, done.\u201d The power of the Court in which a judgement is obtained to compel the entry of proper credits, thereon, whether\u201d the defendant Was entitled to the credits before or after the judgment Was entered, is recognized in <em>Huston </em>v. <em>Ditto, supra, </em>and <em>Gorsuch </em>v. <em>Thomas, 57 </em>Md. 334. But the existence of such power furnishes no ground for entering the judgment by confession referred to in this case. On the contrary, if the Court would have com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>polled the association to credit the amounts paid to it before attempting to collect the judgment, there is greater reason why the Court should have refused to have the judgment entered when it appeared from the declaration and papers in the ease that the plaintiff was not entitled to a j udgment for the amount named in the order of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">It follows from what has been said that the Court below properly refused to enter the judgment by confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In regard to the judgment in favor of the defendants for costs, it is only necessary to say that the application and bonds authorize the association as trustee in case of default to pursue such methods for the collection of the debt as were provided in the mortgage. The mortgage did not authorize the association to maintain a suit, for tlie use of the holders of the bonds, in a Court of law for the amount due on the bonds. The case was on the docket, and as the Court below properly refused to have the judgment by confession entered, in the absence of an order of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to enter the case dismissed, the defendants were entitled to a judgment-for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Order and judgment of the Court below affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
