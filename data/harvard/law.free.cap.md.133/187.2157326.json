The property consists of certain land and improvements known as the Mount Vernon \u00cdB^ewery property, located on Eidgely, Scott and 'Carey streets, Baltimore. The purchase price of the property was $32,935.00 and payable as follows: Twelve thousand five hundred dollars to be represented by a mortgage for 2 years at 5 per cent, interest semi-annually with the privilege of prepayment after one year; nineteen thousand four hundred and thirty-five dollars to he represented by the acceptance of $299,000 in Garranzistas Constitutionalista De Mexico Currency without any obligation on the part of the purchaser to guarantee the value in United States Currency of the said Mexican money and the balance; to wit, one thousand dollars to be paid in cash, making in all $32,935.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The only question at this stage of the proceedings we are called upon to decide is whether the plaintiff mlay prosecute both an action at law and a suit in equity against the defendant at the same time for the relief sought by Mm or whether he should be forced to elect between the remedies sought and proceed with the one or the other whichever he may select.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The doctrine of the election of remedies is too well settled by former decisions of this and other'courts to require any extended discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In 9 R. C. L. 964, it is said, it is a general rule that where a plaintiff is prosecuting an action at law and a suit-in equity against a defendant at the same time for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cause he may be compelled by the Court on' application by the defendant to elect whether he will proceed with the one or the other; but to come within this principle it is required that the two suits must have substantially the same aim and scope and the relief sought mtust be in each case substantially the same. In other words the plaintiff should not be eom7 pelled to elect, unless the remedy in the suit at law is equally complete and adequate with the remedy in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In <em>Way </em>v. <em>Bragaw, </em>16 N. J. Eq. 218, it was held, that the plaintiff will not be put to his election unless the suit at law is not only for the same cause but the effect must be the same. The remedy must be coextensive and equally beneficial to tbe plaintiff with the remedy in equity. 2 <em>Daniel's Ch. Pl. and Pr. </em>721, 961; 7 <em>Ency. of Pl. and Pr. </em>360; 15 <em>Cyc. </em>266.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Judge Phelps, in his work upon <em>Juridical </em>Equity, sec. 120, says, that the maxim that \u201cequity prevents multiplicity of suits,\u201d entitles a defendant in equity who is also sued, at siq Sung mqp emus eqq. jdoj qipurtqd emus eqq. fq \u00bfuq answer to an order requiring the plaintiff to- elect the Court in which he will proceed, but the two suits must be <em>ad idem, </em>that is their object -and purpose must be identical. <em>Alex. Ch. Pr. </em>100; <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>2 Md. Ch. 460; <em>Swan et al. </em>v. <em>Dent et al., </em>2 Md. Ch. 115, note; <em>Bradford et al. </em>v. <em>Williams et al., </em>2 Md. Ch. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">In <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Bitter, </em>34 Md. 653, under a somewhat similar state of facts as are presented in the case at bar this Court held, that the lower Court was right in dismissing a petition and refusing to require the plaintiff to elect. In that case the Court said there' is no rule requiring an election in the case here presented. The proceedings upon the attachment a,t law and the bill in equity in this case are not instituted for the same purpose nor can they attain the same object. The two suits are not <em>ad idem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">In <em>Wilhelm </em>v. <em>Lee et al., </em>2 Md. Ch. 323, the Chancellor held, that the general rule as to the election of remedies applies only to cases where the demjand at law and in equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>are equally personal, and not where the cumulative remedy is <em>m personam., </em>while the other remedy is upon the pledge or <em>in rem. </em>The remedy in a Court- of Equity upon the mortgage was <em>in rem, </em>and that at law was <em>in personam. Dunkley </em>v. <em>Van Buren., </em>3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 330; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Conde, </em>6 Johns. Ch. Rep. 77; 4 <em>Kent, </em>183.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">It is clear we think from an examination of the suit at law and the bill in equity in the instant ease that the remedy in the two suits are not eo-extensive, they were not instituted for the same purpose and the relief sought is not substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The snit at law was instituted to recover the value of the counterfeit Mexican currency which was gi ven as part payment on account of the purchase money for the property sold the appellant by the appellee and the action is one <em>in personam, </em>and the judgment if recovered would be a lien upon the appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The object and purpose of the suit in equity is to have the purchase money declared a lien on the property sold, and is an action <em>in rem </em>against that specific property itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Upon a careful consideration of the case we find no sufficient reason to justify us in disturbing the order appealed from and for the reasons stated it will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
