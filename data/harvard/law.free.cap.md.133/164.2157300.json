The costs of the proceedings as taxed by the clerk of the Court, and paid to him out of the State Treasury, included an. appearance fee of live dollars in each case for the appellant as attorney for the State. The Local Code for Somerset County contains the following provision, enacted by Chapter 280 of the Acts of 1906:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201cThe State\u2019s Attorney of said Somerset County, in lion of the fees received by him, as provided for in any local law for Somerset County, or in any general law of the State, shall receive a salary of one thousand dollars per annum as full compensation for his entire services as required of him by law or which may hereafter he required of him by any law of this State, to he paid to him by the County Commissioners of Somerset County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">In view of this, provision the clerk was, advised that he could not legally pay any appearance fees in the condemnation cases to the appellant, and his demand that they he paid to him was accordingly refused. A petition for mandamus to; compel the payment was then filed, hut it was' dis,missed on demurrer, and the pending appeal has, resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">It, is provided by the Constitution of the State, by section 9 of Artivle I\u201d, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cThe State\u2019s Attorney shall perform such duties and receive such fees and commissions or salary, not exceeding three thousand dollars, as may now or may hereafter he prescribed by law; and if any State\u2019s Attorney shall receive any other fee or reward than such as is or may he allowed by law, he shall, on conviction thereof, he removed from office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The expressed purpose of the local law for Somerset County, which we have quoted, was to provide for the compensation of the State\u2019s Attorney for that county by means of a specified salary in lieu of the fees theretofore received by him for the performance of his official duties. If this change had not been made in the method and measure of his compensation, and the fee system had continued to apply to his office, the appearance fees in question would have had to he reckoned as part of the fees for which he would be accountable and out of wbicb be would be paid for bis 'services to tbe amount limited by the Constitution or by statute. It is made tbe duty of every person bolding office under the Constitution or laws of this State (except justices of the peace, constables and coroners), \u201cwhose pay or compensation is derived from fees or moneys coming into bis Lands for the discharge of his official duties, or in any way growing out of or connected with' his office\u201d to \u201ckeep a book in which shall be entered every sum or sums of money received by him, or ou bis account, as a payment or compensation for bis performance of official duties a copy of which entries,\u201d verified by his oath,'\u201cshall be returned yearly to the Comptroller of the State for his. inspection,\u201d and when the amount so received by such officer for tbe year \u201cshall exceed tbe sum wbicb be is by law entitled to retain as bis salary or compensation for tbe discharge of bis duties, and for the expenses of his office,\u201d he is required to \u201cyearly pay over to the Treasurer of the State the amount of such excess.\u201d \u2022 Constitution, Art. XV, seo. 1. The Code of Public General Laws, by section 24 of Article 10, provides that accounts of State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Attorneys against the County Commissioners of their respective counties \u201cmay include a reasonable trial fee for each case actually tried, to be allowed in the discretion of the Court, as well as the appearance fee provided by law,\u201d and the next succeeding section of the same article of the Code authorizes the Comptroller of the Treasury to adjust and settle the claims of any of the State\u2019s Attorneys \u201cfor appearance fees in civil cases due them, by the State, and for all fees similarly due for services rendered under the opinion of the Attorney General in the matter of cases, removed from said county for trial or otherwise.\u201d It seems perfectly clear from these provisions, that appearance fees received by State\u2019s Attorneys were intended to. be treated, like other fees, as items of compensation for official service, and as such were required to be reported to the Comptroller and the excess over the prescribed salary paid ,\u00a1annually into the State Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The salary of the State\u2019s Attorney for Somerset. County is not payable from, fees, which he is authorized to charge and collect, but by direct payment from the county in equal quarterly installments. There is a provision in the Local Code that in all criminal cases in. the Circuit Court for the county, in which the State\u2019s''Attorney shall appear for the State, an appearance fee as allowed by existing law, shall be taxed as part of tbe costs, and when collected from the party liable therefor shall be paid over by the clerk to the County Commissioners to be applied by them to tbe payment- of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s salary, for which, also, to such extent as may be necessary, they are directed to provide by taxation. It was in \u201cfull compensation for bis, entire services\u201d under existing or future laws, that tbe stated salary was to be paid. It was declared to be \u201cin lieu of the fees heretofore received\u201d by the State\u2019s Attorney \u201cas provided for in any local law\u201d for the county \u201cor in any general law of the State.\u201d There could hardly he a more plain and positive statement of the legislative purpose to limit the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ticm, for all of his official services, to&lt; the amount of the annual salary which the statute substituted for the fees which he had theretofore been accustomed to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The cases in which the State\u2019s Attorney claims to be entitled to appearance fees were instituted by him in the performance of a duty which was imposed upon him in his official capacity by section 960 of Article 72 of the Code of Public General Laws. It was a duty clearly within the purview of the provision which defined the , services for which the prescribed salary was intended to. afford an exclusive compensation. Whether the salary was adequate in view of the nature and number of the oases in which the appearance fees are claimed is a question with which the Legislature has full power to deal, but which we have no authority to consider for the purposes of our decision. The only inquiry we can properly entertain is whether the appellant has a legal right to the appearance fees in dispute and to the writ of mandamus to. enforce their payment. To that question our answer must be in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\">The fact that the amount of the appearance fees was paid to the clerk by the ..State is not a consideration which can affect our conclusion. The fees were doubtless taxed and paid in the usual routine of such transactions, without reference by the State\u2019s financial officers to the limitations as to the source and amount of the compensation of the. State\u2019s Attorney for Somerset County, and we see no reason to hold that their act of paying the fees to the clerk has had the effect of conferring upon the appellant a right to the fees' which the statute has denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The case of <em>Worcester County </em>v. Melvin, 89 Md. 37, upon which the appellant relied to some extent, involved a very different question. It was there held that when a claim against the county for services rendered by counsel duly appointed to defend or prosecute a criminal case had been approved by the judge of the Circuit Court of the county, as provided by a local statute, it was the duty of the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Commissioners, to pay the claim, and the fact that the counsel had received an appearance fee in the same case, as authorized by law (Code, Art. 36, see. 10), was. uot a valid ground for the refusal of the commissioners to pay the fee which the judge had approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">As the question here presented is governed by the special terms of the organic and statutory laws of our own State, to which we have referred, it is not necessary to discuss the cases in other jurisdictions, which a,re cited in the appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">If we could have reached a conclusion that the appellant is entitled to the appearance fees- in controversy, we should nevertheless have concurred in the dismissal of his. petition for the extraordinary writ of mandamus for the reason that his claim could have been adequately enforced by an ordinary suit at law. <em>Goldsborough v. Lloyd, </em>86 Md. 378; <em>Caroline: School Commissioners </em>v. <em>Hinson, </em>126 Md. 472; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bragonier, </em>79 Md. 234; <em>McEvoy </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>126 Md. 124; <em>Hummelshime </em>v. <em>Hirsch, </em>114 Md. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
