Rodman and Leonard F. Hepburn, trading as Rodman &amp; Hepburn, against Max Thalheimer, for 50,000 feet of cedar boards.

J. Daly testified that he was a salesman for the plaintiffs, who resided in New York; about the 18th of January he was in Philadelphia soliciting orders for the plaintiffs for the sale of Spanish cedar to make cigar-boxes. He visited defendant. \u201c I asked him how trade was ; he replied that trade was good; he was making a good many boxes and selling a good deal of cedar; that he was making money, and that he was making cigar-boxes and cedar chests. I told him what cedar I had for sale, and offered it to him at a certain price; he offered me two prices for the two different kinds of wood I had, which prices I was not at liberty to accept, because they were less than the price I was directed by my employers to ask, and less than the price I was directed to accept without communicating with them. I did communicate the defendant\u2019s offer to my employers, by telegraph, that day, asking if they would sell cedar at five and a half cents; they answered \u2018 Yes.\u2019 I waited on the defendant again and told him he might have the cedar at his price. After failing in my efforts to get a better price from him, I accepted his offer on behalf of my employers on the day following his offer; Thalheimer gave me instructions to have the goods forwarded by the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad Co., or cheaper route, if possible; the terms of payment were to be the defendant\u2019s notes at sixty and ninety days; I reported by letter the terms of the sale to New York and the manner of sending the goods here as directed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-11\">\u201c I left Philadelphia and was absent four or five days; on my return to Philadelphia on my way to New York, I again waited on Mr. Thalheimer, and he complained to me of the quality of the wood sent to him, which was then in his hands; I agreed to allow him forty-five dollars for any defects in the wood, and took his notes and gave him a receipt for them; the receipt was:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-12\">\u201c <em>1 </em>Received from M.

Dingee; he said he had; I asked him \u2018 was it paid ? \u2019 he replied, \u2018 who told you that ? \u2019 and seemed astonished that I should have heard it; I asked him, had Dingee other notes of his; he said he had ; I asked him then how much did he owe Dingee altogether; and he replied, about as much as he owed us; he said in answer to my question, that he owed about $5000 in the aggregate; I asked him what were his assets, and he replied \u2018 about $1500,\u2019 of which $300 or $400 were bad, however; I asked him now long he had been in business; he said thirteen years; 1 told him it was a poor exhibit for a man in business so long ; he then said he had pulled through before and he hoped to pull through again; I asked him if he had any property, and he said he had a house, but it was mortgaged for all it was worth ; he said he could not get any money in, and had hardly enough to pay his hands on Saturday night. I then telegraphed the result of my interview to my employers. While at the defendant\u2019s store, I went up stairs to see what stock he had; I saw two or three (not more than three) cedar chests, and some cedar which he was working; I don\u2019t think he had more than $400 or $500 of property in the place; I saw our cedar in a cellar opposite his store; as I said, I telegraphed \u2018situation doubtful, come and see;\u2019 Mr. Rodman came on and saw Mr. Thalheimer the following morning; in my presence, he told Mr. Rodman that he had not a dollar Tn the world and that his house was mortgaged for all it was worth; he said he had ten children, each worth $10,000; Mr. Rodman then asked him to secure him in some way or another ; Thalheimer said \u2018No;\u2019 Rodman then offered to give Thalheimer the cedar in such quantities as he might need, the whole to remain on storage \u2014'all to remain where it was till all was consumed; Thalheimer refused the offer; Rodman then offered Thalheimer $200 to let up the contract; Thalheimer refused and then said, \u2018 I won\u2019t do anything without consulting P. M. Dingee, of New York;\u2019 Rodman then said, \u2018 I understand you won\u2019t do anything ?\u2019 Thalheimer answered, \u2018No \u2014 I won\u2019t do anything.\u2019 We then left. We issued a writ of replevin and seized the goods on same day.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-9\">On cross-examination witness said: \u201c I offered this Wood to the defendant in Callowhill street, in this city. He did not buy them the first time I saw him. I invited him to come to my hotel (the Girard House), and showed him some samples of the wood there. I pressed him to buy, as I usually do. I saw the defendant at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Grirard House on the same day. I said that if he was unable to pay on time, his notes falling due, we might accommodate him then. I saw the wood here. It was to have been delivered here. Rodman asked Thalheimer security on his property for his debt. I had told Rodman my conversation with Thalheimer the day before. In answer to Rodman\u2019s request that Thalheimer should give him back the goods, he said that it would break his credit to do so. His store is in Oallowhill Street. The lumber in dispute was stored under a produce store, opposite to his store. He had all we had sold him except 2000 feet, which he had resold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-6\">Plaintiffs gave in evidence the following letter of Daly, written in pursuance of their answer to the telegram :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Grirard House, Philadelphia 19, 1, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-8\">Messrs.

We had to get it out of our storehouse, and I ordered it to be prepared for shipment. I knew at that time that this wood was in my storehouse, and that it had to come out of my storehouse to fill that order. I had at that time about 250,000 feet in our storehouse. I only know that the wood there came out of the \u2018 Murchie,\u2019 and that the cargo was in that storehouse, and I remember that it was a large cargo of wood. The 50,000 feet were taken out, and were delivered to the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad for shipment, consigned to Thalheimer.

I had a box-maker at the freight depot to see it. He wanted to buy 20,000 feet. I had it offered to him for 5f cents, but he would not have it at no such price. The other stuff is so bad that I really don\u2019t know what to do with it; it is worse than poplar, and there is many a bundle in it which I could not offer to any one at no price. Mr. Brecht said if you had sent such wood to him he would have left it at the depot, and would not received it all. Now, if you wish to make a deduction of at least 4000 feet ofi the 4J cents wood, I will send you your notes with that deducted amount; if not, I cannot accept it, as I would lose too much on it. I cannot sell unless to make allowances on that wood; and there is also a great deal of rotten and faulty wood among the Spanish cedar, which I have to make allowances, which Mr. Daly sold to me as sound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">\u201c Please inform me as soon as possible what you intend to do, and oblige Yours, M.

His whole testimony, including his letter to his employers of the 19th of February 1870, in which he expresses his felicity,\u201d as well as his note of the sale to the defendant, shows that <em>he, </em>as the agent of the plaintiffs, made the sale of the cedar at Philadelphia, and that the defendant was induced to buy at his urgent request. It is true, he asked the defendant about trade, and the latter said it was good ; and asked him/about his business, and the latter said it was good; he was making money \u2014 making cigar-boxes and chests. But this was not said as an inducement to obtain credit, nor is there the slightest evidence of artifice or trick on part of the defendant to obtain the cedar. If the plaintiffs have suffered a loss from the credit given and the insolvency of the defendant, it can mainly be attributed to their mode of business in sending out an anxious agent to \u201c drum up\u201d customers in the expressive terms of trade. It is very evident Daly, the \u201c drummer,\u201d followed up his vocation with assiduity, and without very great concern for the ability of his customer. In his own language the defendant did not buy the first time he saw him; was invited to the Girard Hotel to see the samples, and he <em>\u201cpressed </em>the defendant to buy,\u201d as (he said) \u201c I usually do,\u201d and told him if he was unable to pay on time his notes falling due we might accommodate him then. We see in all these circumstances not the slightest intent on part of the defendant to obtain the goods by a fraudulent concealment of his insolvency. The law in this state is not that insolvency and the mere knowledge of it are such a fraud as to set aside the sale and enable the seller to rescind, and to replevy the goods after they have come fully and fairly into the possession of the purchaser. It requires artifice, trick or false pretence, as a means of obtaining possession, to avoid the purchase. There must be bad faith, \u2014 an intent at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the time to defraud the seller. Insolvency and a knowledge of it at the time of the sale are evidence to go to the jury with other facts to show the intended fraud, but standing alone will not operate to rescind after a possession fully and fairly acquired. The New York doctrine does not hold in this state. See Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, Murphy &amp; Co., 9 Harris 367; Bunn, Raiguel &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Ahl, 5 Casey 387; Backenstoss <em>v. </em>Speicher, 7 Casey 325 ; Harner <em>v. </em>Fisher, 8 P. F. Smith 453; Williams <em>v. </em>Davis, 19 Id. 21. These considerations dispose of the exceptions to the evidence. The place of the contract was Philadelphia, as we have already stated. Daly says he accepted defendant\u2019s offer\u2014 he made the sale \u2014 he reported it and congratulated the plaintiffs upon it. The contract was not to be executed in New York. Of course the cedar came from New York by the designated route, but the delivery was not there by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
