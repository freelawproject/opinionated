The said Mooney stated that he had received the money and that a receipt had been given, which was sufficient. That your petitioner again demanded a bill of items, which was again refused. That your petitioner is informed and believes that the sum charged is greater than is allowed by law; and he respectfully refers to the laws of this Commonwealth in such cases made and provided, as evidence of the same. He, therefore, prays your Honorable Court to grant a rule upon William R. Leeds, sheriff of the city and county of Philadelphia, to show cause why he should not dismiss the said William Harvey Mooney, deputy sheriff, from his office, for taking illegal fees returnable,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">Receipt mentioned in the petition:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">\u201c Charles Perry ) C.

The writ was given to my assistant, J. B. Robinson, who settled the costs and charges. I did not receive the money from the petitioner, nor did I demand it. My assistant informs me that he did charge $25 for his services, and that he made this charge at the suggestion of a former deputy sheriff, under Mr. Lyle, he stating that it was usual. The sum of $246.41 was made as you have stated in your answer, adding the $25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">\u201c I desire to say that as I receive nothing for my services, I have always felt an indulgence to the defendant, which does not harm the plaintiff, entitles me to something; but as the sum in this case is excepted to, I have directed my assistant to pay the same to the execution clerk, to be repaid to the defendant, which he has done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-11\">By \u00a7 12 of Act of March 31st 1860, referred to in respondent\u2019s plea, it is provided:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-12\">\u201cIf any justice, clerk, prothonotary, sheriff, coroner, constable or other officer of this Commonwealth shall wilfully and fraudulently receive or take any reward or fee to execute and do his duty and office, but such as is or shall be allowed by some Act of Assembly, or shall receive or take by color of his office any fee or reward whatever, not, or more than is allowed as aforesaid, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding $500, or to undergo an imprisonment not exceeding one year.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-13\">The Court of Common Pleas (Paxson, J.) made this decree:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-14\">\u201c And now, December 2d 1871, it is ordered, that the pleas filed or presented by the respondent, William R.

The deputy here admits the receipt, which brings him within the law: Deal <em>v. </em>Tower, 1 Phil. R. 268; Miles <em>v. </em>Huber, 3 Penna. L. J. 151; Patton\u2019s Est., 2 Parsons 107; Bussier <em>v. </em>Pray, 7 S. &amp; R. 447.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">The law does not favor repeals by implication, and courts should be scrupulous how they give sanction to them: Haynes <em>v. </em>Jenks, 2 Pick. 176; Brown v. Miller, 4 J. J. Marshall 474. Nor does a statute, repealing all former acts within its purview, repeal the provisions of former laws, as to cases not provided for by the repealing statute: Payne <em>v. </em>Conner, 3 Bibb 180.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The opinion of the court was delivered, January 17th 1874, by</p>\n<author id=\"b80-11\">A&amp;new, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZA\">This is not a criminal proceeding against the sheriff for an offence, but is in the nature \u00f3f a civil remedy to compel the discharge of a deputy who has been guilty of taking unlawful fees. The Act of March 31st 1843, \u00a7 2, is a wise and salutary law to protect the people against official misconduct by purifying the office and requiring the discharge of unworthy assistants. The sheriff being a public officer under the control of law, accepts his office under this and other laws which define his duties and declare his disabilities. He cannot, and ought not to be permitted to keep in his employment persons known to be guilty of illegal practices in the execution of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">The relation between the sheriff and his deputy is civil and. of known legal character, and it does not admit of a doubt that he may discharge a deputy who abuses his position by extortion. The statement of the deputy, annexed to the sheriff\u2019s answer, is an admission of the facts, as well as evidence of the necessity and the propriety of the remedy provided in the Act of 1853. He admits that he is in an employment for which he is to receive no payment from the sheriff, and obtains no compensation, except as he ex tracts it by extortion from the defendants in the execution. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>puts it on the ground that a defendant may purchase an indulgence from the execution of official duty, which does not harm the plaintiff. But if such a practice can be tolerated, it depends only on what price a defendant is willing to pay, whether the plaintiff may be injured or not. The practice leads to all manner of injustice, and wrongs both parties, the plaintiff in some cases being fraudulently postponed through bribery, and the defendant in others being fraudulently fleeced by extortion, as in this case. A bad feature of the practice is, 'that it inculpates the sheriff himself. His deputies cannot live upon air, and yet he employs them; takes all the legal fees, pays them nothing, and leaves them necessarily to prey upon the parties, and maintain themselves by fraudulent and illegal practices. It is the duty of all courts, and all honest men, to set their faces against such public wrongs as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The Act of 1843 is not unconstitutional, but on the contrary, is in furtherance of that clause in the bill of rights which requires justice to be administered without sale, denial or delay. It is incompatible with no subsequent law brought to our attention, and has not been repealed. It is a salutary protection of the citizens against official injustice, and has been righteously administered by the court below. Moreover, there is no appeal given on the merits, which would enable us to reverse on the merits, if they were not as they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The appeal is therefore quashed, and the costs ordered to be paid by the defendant below;.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
