He then testified as to the times when the timber was furnished, the quantity and the price during all the time. Fisher &amp; Son had charge of the yard; he saw the timber Avhich he had furnished in the schooner. Fisher told plaintiff the schooner was for Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co., but plaintiff\u2019s dealings from the beginning to the end were with Fisher &amp; Son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\">Plaintiff gave other evidence of the delivery of the lumber and admissions by Fisher that the lumber in the schooner had been furnished by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-10\">The respondents admitted that the lumber had been ordered by Fisher &amp; Son, but not on the credit of the schooner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-11\">For the respondents, William Fisher testified that his firm built the schooner in the first place for Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co., under a contract Avhich was destroyed before Scull and the other subsequent contractors Avould enter into an agreement with the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-12\">Lathbury testified that, his firm having got into difficulty in the summer of 1869 had asked Fisher \u201cto find other owners;\u201d having found Scull and the others to take the vessel off Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co.\u2019s hands, the contract was rescinded, and at the time \u201c Andrew Scull and others took the vessel and made a payment, Fisher &amp; Son did not release us until Scull and others had taken the vessel.\u201d The building of the schooner had stopped some five or six weeks; the rescission was by mutual consent; \u201c Scull and others were to step into our shoes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-13\">William Fisher, called again, testified that they did not finish for Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co. They undertook to finish for Scull and others, who took the vessel in September 1869; and Fisher &amp; Son then released Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co. Scull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>and others paid Eisher &amp; Son $6000 at the execution of their contract and the release of Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co. Fisher &amp; Son, besides the $6000, received from Scull $7218.62 on the schooner, which was in full to December 17th 1869, and they delivered the vessel on that day or the next to Scull; she had not then been attached; she went to another yard close by Fisher &amp; Son\u2019s to get her masts; she did not come back to Fisher &amp; Son\u2019s; she was finished at another wharf; witness was broken and could not finish her; he never purchased timber from plaintiff on. the credit of any vessel; he did not purchase timber differently from any other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-6\">Other witnesses testified that Fisher <em>k </em>Son had no interest in the schooner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-7\">The sixth point of the respondent was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-8\">\u201c The Act of 13th June 1836, upon which this attachment is issued, is invalid, and your verdict must therefore be for the defendants.\u201d This point was reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">The eighth point was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">\u201c I instruct you, as matter of law, that as between the builders of a vessel and those for whom the vessel is built, the title to said vessel can pass without delivery, where it can be designated and ascertained, and is separated from other property.\u201d This point was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-11\">The court charged: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-12\">\u201c The question in this cause, full of nicety, is the question of ownership. There is no doubt, under our Act of 1836, that a party who sells material must show that the contract was made with the master or owners of the vessel. These words have a technical signification. The owner is the man who gets a certificate and is registered as owner. Contracts for voyages are usually made by the master or owners. This, the defendants contend, is the meaning of the word \u2018 owner \u2019 within the meaning of this act. As far as the question of law is concerned, I reserve it. [Without regard to my individual opinion I charge you that a person who contracts to build a vessel for others, at a price stated, whether payable by instalments or otherwise, and does build her at his own yard, is the owner within the meaning of the Act of 13th June 1836, upon which this proceeding is founded. Therefore, you will have no difficulty in finding your general verdict.] I shall ask you to find specially whether William Fisher <em>k </em>Son had, at the time they contracted for the lumber in question, any other possession, control or ownership of the vessel \u2018Maggie Cain,\u2019 than as builders of or contractors to build her for Lathbury, Wickersham <em>k </em>Co., and for Scull and others. If Lathbury, Wickersham <em>k </em>Co. abandoned to Scull and others, and not to William Fisher &amp; Son, then they were still contractors. During the construction for Scull and others their position cannot be doubted. The evidence under this special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>finding that yon are requested to make,centres in the question of abandonment. To whom did Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co. abandon the vessel ? * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">\u201c If there was a moment or a day of time after the abandonment before Scull came in, Fisher &amp; Son were the owners. * * * As to the general verdict, if the timber was not furnished to William Fisher &amp; Son on their right as OAvners, then your verdict should be for respondent. If on the credit of the vessel, Avas it used in the building of the vessel ? If not, your verdict must be for the defendant. It is not contended that a great deal of this timber did not go into the vessel. It is only for the value of what did go in that you can find for the plaintiff. Go on and find your general verdict, leaving out the question of ownership, then consider separately the special finding.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">The verdict was for plaintiff, for $3373.01. \u201c The jury find no ownership by William Fisher &amp; Son in the schooner \u2018 Maggie Cain \u2019 at the time the lumber was contracted for with William M. Shakespear, but we do find an ownership by them in said vessel during the interval that ensued between the abandonment of ownership by Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co., and the sale to Andrew Scull and George Fisher and others.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-9\">On motion of the plaintiff, the court amended the special finding so as to read:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-10\">\u201c The jury find no ownership other than as builders, by William Fisher &amp; Son in the schooner \u2018Maggie Cain,\u2019 at the time the lumber was contracted for with William M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aly\">The lien given by the Act of 13fch of June 1836, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>for work done and materials furnished in the building of ships and vessels of all kinds, is expressly confined to certain classes of tradesmen and mechanics, to wit, carpenters, blacksmiths, mast-makers, boat-builders, blockmakers, ropemakers, sailmakers, riggers, joiners, carders, plumbers, painters, ship-chandlers and others named, concluding with lumber merchants. These are the individuals who actually do the work and furnish the materials for building and equipping the vessel, and evidently are not the general contractor who agrees to build the vessel for another. As to him, no lien is necessary, for he can always provide for his own security by his contract, and is not bound to deliver the vessel until paid for her, unless he choose by his agreement to do so. This is the very ground of the decision in Walker <em>v. </em>Anshutz, 6 W. &amp; S. 519, a case directly in point. In the case before us, William Fisher &amp; Son were the owners of the schooner to whom the libellant furnished the materials for her. The contract with Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Oo. having fallen through, they were left with the unfinished hull on their hands, and in this condition they made their contract with Andrew Scull and others to build and finish the hull of a three-masted schooner, then in frame, for the sum of $18,000, payable in instalments as the work progressed, the last $2000 being payable when the schooner was finished. In no part of this contract is there any agreement to deliver her before completion, nor is such an intent discoverable. Clearly the persons thus contracting for a finished vessel were not entitled to possession until payment in full; so that title did not vest in them until the finishing of the vessel and delivery of possession. Fisher &amp; Son were therefore the owners when Shakespear furnished the materials, for which he claimed his lien. The period of time between the abandonment of Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co. and the new contract with Scull and others, was wholly immaterial in the case, for neither by the contract with Lathbury, Wickersham &amp; Co. nor with Scull and others, did title or possession pass out of William Fisher <em>&amp; </em>Son \u2014 by neither were they bound to deliver the vessel before final payment. ' Hence, the general finding of the jury was all that was necessary, and the special finding directed by th\u00e9 court was wholly immaterial, and did neither good nor harm so far as the final result was necessarily involved. The errors complained of in regard to the special verdict are therefore without injury and need no correction. William Fisher <em>&amp; </em>Son being the owners of the vessel, this fact disposes of all the errors specified, except that of jurisdiction. It is contended that a lien such as this, incurred in the building of a vessel, is not within the jurisdiction of a state court, but falls within the Federal jurisdiction, under the Constitution of the United States and must be enforced in an Admiralty Court. We do not think so. A contract to build a vessel is a contract to be performed on land, falling within ordinary common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>law, and belongs to the state jurisdiction. It differs not from a contract to build a wagon or a railroad car, made between citizens of the same state, and cannot be drawn into the Federal courts, because the vessel is intended to become a subject of maritime law. Whatever question may arise as to those liens, which the Act of 1836 seeks to enforce against a finished vessel, after she has entered her appropriate element, certainly there can be none as to liens upon a vessel for work and materials entering into her construction, before she has passed within the dominion of maritime law. Some dicta and District Court decisions to the contrary were overruled in People\u2019s Ferry Co. <em>v. </em>Beers, 20 Howard 393; Roach <em>v. </em>Chapman, 22 Id. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
