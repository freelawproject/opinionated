The cause of action alleged was the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants, by which the plaintiff, a hoy of about thirteen years of age, fell from one of their cars and was seriously hurt. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The case was tried May 5th 1871, before Thayer, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">The evidence was as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">The plaintiff testified: <em>\u201c </em>On the afternoon of November 6th 1870, another boy, named John Stewart, and myself stood at Thirteenth and Vine streets waiting. One of defendants\u2019 cars came along and we signalled the driver. He slacked up to receive us, and we got on the front platform. We stood on the front platform, by the side of the driver, all the way out to Eorty-first street and Lancaster Avenue. I then said to John Stewart, who stood next to the driver, \u2018 I\u2019m going to get off here.\u2019 I spoke loud enough for the driver to hear. The horses were going at a slow trot, and I stepped off. I took hold of the dasher with one hand and the iron on the car with the other. As I stepped off my foot slipped, and I held on as long as I could. I dragged two or three yards holding on, and the front wheel ran over my foot before the car stopped, and I was holding on trying to save myself. \u2022 The conductor was on the back platform. While we were going out he came to me and collected my fare. Neither he nor the driver offered us a seat, nor told us to go inside. They did not tell us that we- ought not to stand on the front platform, or that it was dangerous there. I was then thirteen years old. There were no fenders or gates on the front platform ; nothing to prevent us from getting on or off the front platform. My foot gave me much pain, and I was prevented from work for eleven weeks.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">On cross-examination: \u201c When I said to John Stewart, <em>\u2018 </em>I\u2019m going to get off here,\u2019 I meant at that spot, not at the depot. We were then two or three times the length of this room from the depot. John Stewart stood between the driver and me. I did not ride on the step. I did not ask the driver to let me off\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-10\">John Stewart testified : \u201c I was the companion of Edwin at the time of the accident. We both rode out on the front platform. At Forty-first and Lancaster Avenue he said to me, \u2018 I\u2019m going to get off here.\u2019 I stood by the side of the driver and heard what h\u00e9 said. He spoke loud enough for the driver to hear. The car slacked up. There was a crossing where we wanted to get off. The depot was about 100 yards off I saw Edwin step off He fell, and held on to the iron thing, and the wheel ran over his foot. Nothing had been said to us about getting off the front platform, or standing on it. No one asked us to take a seat. We rode all the way outside. I am thirteen years old.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-11\">The plaintiff submitted a number of points, which were refused. The court charged : u That there was not sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants to entitle the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>recover, and that there was evidence of contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, and that upon the evidence the verdict should be for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">The verdict was for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">The plaintiff took a writ of error, and assigned for error the refusal of the points and the charge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-8\"><em>W.

All the other assignments are to the charge of the court, and will be considered together. As a general rule a question of negligence must be submitted to the jury. It should be where there is any substantial doubt as to the facts, or to the inferences to be drawn from them: Pennsylvania R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Barnett, 9 P. F. Smith 259; Johnson v. Bruner, 11 Id. 58; McKee v. Bidwell, 24 Id. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes negligence. It is dependent upon the particular circumstances of the case. Where the measure of duty is not unvarying; where a higher degree of care is demanded under some circumstances than under others; \u25a0where both the duty and the extent of its performance are to be ascertained as facts, a jury alone can determine what is negligence, and whether it has been proven: McCully v. Clarke <em>et al., </em>4 Wright 406; Pennsylvania Canal Co. v. Bentley, 16 P. F. Smith 30. Where the measure of duty is ordinary and reasonable care, it is always a question for the jury : West Chester &amp; Philadelphia R. R. Co. v. McElwee, 17 P. F. Smith 311. Where negligence is concurrent, a child will not be held to the exercise of the same degree of care and discretion as an adult: Rauch v. Lloyd <em>et al., </em>7 Casey 358; Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Kelly, Id. 372; Smith <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 12 Wright 218; Oakland Railway Co v. Fielding, Id. 320; Glassey v. H., M. &amp; F. Passenger R. R. Co., 7 P. F. Smith 172; Kay v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 15 Id. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Now let us apply the law to the facts in this ease. The plaintiff was a child of the age of thirteen years. He and his companion, a boy of the same age, signalled the driver as the defendants\u2019 car crossed Thirteenth street. The car was slackened to receive them ; they stood there by the side of the driver all the way out to Eorty-first street and Lancaster Avenue. No objection was made by either the driver or conductor to their riding there; neither of them requested the plaintiff to step inside of the car ; the conductor came to him and collected his fare; at Eorty-first street and Lancaster Avenue, the plaintiff said to his companion in a voice sufficiently loud for the driver to hear, \u201cI am going to get off here.\u201d The speed of the car was thereupon slackened; the plaintiff took hold of the dasher with one hand, and the iron on the car with the other, and stepped off; the car continued in motion; the plaintiff\u2019s foot slipped; he retained his hold to save himself; he was dragged two or three yards, and until the front wheel ran over his foot, causing the injury of which he complains. There was a crossing in the street where he desired to get off.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">In view of the plaintiff\u2019s age, we think this evidence should have been submitted to the jury ; the jury should have determined whether the plaintiff had been guilty of negligence. He should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>held to tbe exercise of that degree of care and discretion ordinarily to be expected of a child of his age, neither more nor less: Smith <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, <em>supra. </em>So in regard to the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence. As the plaintiff was suffered to stand upon and get off from the front platform, it should have been submitted to the jury to find whether the defendants, under all the facts, exercised proper care in not sooner stopping the car. It is the duty of a railway company to cause its cars to come to a full stop, to permit a passenger to get off. Whether the defendants properly discharged this duty with a due regard to the age of the plaintiff, and of the notice of plaintiff\u2019s desire to leave the car, should have been left to the jury. We think the learned judge erred in directing that the verdict should be for the defendants. The errors are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
