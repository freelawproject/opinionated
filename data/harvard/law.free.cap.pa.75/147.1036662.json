Zimmerman, who is the defendant and the husband of Anna Maria Zimmerman, in whose favor said endorsements on said bond are made, as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">\u201c \u2018 Whitemarsh, May 12th 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">\u201c \u2018 My friend Lorenzo Zimmerman <em>i </em>have five hundred dollars to spare and if you stand in need of it you can have it, <em>i </em>have received more money than <em>i </em>expected to receive, if you do not want it may be some of your friends would want it, you can have it on a plain bond <em>i </em>shant want it very soon again.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">Youi\u2019s, most respectfully,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">George Streeper.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-11\">\u201c The testator frequently expressed to defendant that the bond was to be a gift through defendant to his wife Maria, for her kind attentions during life. He was taken sick prior to July 22d 1864, and never recovered. Maria Zimmerman, who is named in said- endorsement on the bond in question, is the wife of the defendant, and is the granddaughter of the testator, George Streeper, the obligee in the bond, and is a legatee under his will, and had with her mother resided with the testator for a long time and until her marriage with the said defendant. No claim was made for payment of the money due on the said bond until the year 1871, after the death of the said testator\u2019s widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-12\">\u201c If, upon the foregoing facts, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered in their favor for the amount of the' principal of said bond, with interest thereon, according to law, from April 1st 1864, to date of entry of judgment. If of a contrary opinion, then judgment for defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-13\">The court (Ross, P. J.), after referring to the facts, delivered the following opinion: * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-14\">\u201c Under these facts can a recovery be had upon the bond ? It must be remembered that the endorsement is not intended to release the defendant, the obligor, from his liability upon the bond. If it has any effect whatever it is to make a gift of the bond to Mrs. Zimmerman. This fact must not be overlooked or disregarded, for it underlies the case and determines the law which governs the facts in the case stated. To constitute a valid gift <em>inter vivos </em>certain essentials are requisite, and the first inquiry that presents itself is whether the endorsement on the bond, undelivered to Mrs. Zimmerman, constituted a valid gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-15\"><em>\u201c </em>To determine the validity of a gift, its subject-matter must be considered. If capable of manucaptiou it must be actually or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>structively delivered. If it be not, then it is still executory, and being without consideration, is bad either as a gift <em>inter vivos </em>or a <em>donatio causa mortis: </em>Yard <em>v. </em>Patton, 1 Harris 278; Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, 1 Barr 445 ; Whitehall <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 Penna. 405 ; Jones <em>v. </em>Drake, 6 Phila. R. 416; Painter\u2019s Estate, 6 Wright 156, in note; Cressman\u2019s Appeal, 6 Id. 147. A chose in action may, however, pass by assignment, for the debt itself cannot be delivered, and the only delivery that can be had must be of this character. A gift must be executed, for if it remains executory, and there be no consideration, it is void: Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, <em>supra. </em>In order to execute a gift of a chose in action, there must be a delivery of the evidence of the debt, or an assignment of it. \u2018 A gift/ says C. J. Gibson, in re Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr 101, \u2018is a contract executed, and as the act of execution is the delivery of possession, it is of the essence of the title. It is the consummation of the contract, which without it would be no more than a contract to give, and without efficacy for the want of consideration. If made on a sufficient consideration, it would be a binding agreement; but then the nature of the contract would be changed, and there still would be no gift. The gift of a bond, note, or any other chattel, therefore, cannot be made'by words <em>in futuro, </em>or by words <em>in prcesenti, </em>unaccompanied by such delivery of possession as makes the disposal of the thing irrevocable.\u2019 This doctrine is cited and approved in Painter\u2019s Estate, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">\u201c So strictly is the validity of a gift made dependent upon its execution that it was ruled in Pennington <em>v. </em>Gitting, 2 Gill and Johns. 209, that an intended gift by a parent to a child of certain bank stock, of which the certificate was handed to the contemplated donee, but no transfer of it was made on the books of the bank, which was the recognised mode of passing an interest in the shares, was executory, and could not be enforced. To the same purport are the eases of Duffield <em>v. </em>Elwes, 1 Bligh R. 529; Fortes <em>v. </em>Barret, 3 Mylne &amp; Keen 36; Lonsdale <em>v. </em>Lonsdale, 5 Casey 407; Adams\u2019s Eq. 234, note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">\u201c It is clear from these authorities that unless there be a delivery, either of the chose in action or the assignment of it, to the donee, the gift is not executed, and the donee acquires no right under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">\u201c But it is said that while the undelivered bond, with its endorsement, may not constitute a gift to the donee; yet it is in effect a declaration of trust which converts the executors into trustees of this fund for her benefit. It is said that an equitable assignment of a chose in action is a declaration of trust, with an agreement to permit the assignee to sue in the assignor\u2019s name: Butler\u2019s Coke Litt. 232, b. note 1. But how can this undelivered endorsement be termed an assignment ? It never passed out of the control of the testator. It never conferred a complete and present right upon the assignee. It would unquestionably have been competent for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the testator at any time after he made these endorsements to have, cancelled them. His power over the endorsements, up to the hour of his death, was complete and ample; and up to that hour the donee had acquired no rights. Yet the converse of all this'is essential to constitute an assignment. <em>Vide </em>3 Lead. Eq. Cases, H. &amp; W.\u2019s notes 361, where it is said, It is necessary, in order to constitute an assignment either legal or equitable, that there should be such an actual or constructive appropriation of the subject-matter assigned as to confer a complete and present right in the assignee, even when the circumstances do not admit of its immediate exercise.' * * * The characteristic of an assignment is the relinquishment of all legal or equitable interest by the assignor, and the creation of a new and independent right in the assignee Rogers <em>v. </em>Horsach, 18 Wendell 319; Cowperthwaite <em>v. </em>Sheffield, 3 Comstock 243. \u2018 If the donor has perfected his gift in the way in which he intended, so that there is nothing left for him to do, <em>and nothing whieh he has authority to countermand, </em>the donee\u2019s right is enforced as a trust, and the consideration is immaterial \u2019: Adams\u2019 Eq. 233. A delivery, then, of the bond, with the endorsement, was essential to vest rights in the donee. Until that was effected the testator had done nothing to relinquish his legal or equitable interest. The whole matter was yet in his power and subject to his control. He could have cancelled the endorsements without prejudice to any legal or equitable right of his intended beneficiary. It is well settled that nothing can take effect as an assignment which does not manifest an intention to relinquish the right of dominion on the one hand and create it on the other : 3 Leading Eq. Ca. 363; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Phillips, 1 Barb. 454; Rogers <em>v. </em>Horsach, supra; Hall <em>v. </em>Jackson, 20 Pick. 194. This doctrine is thoroughly sustained by our own authorities. In Lonsdale <em>v. </em>Lonsdale, 5 Casey 407, it was ruled that an assignment of choses in action <em>under seal, </em>without valuable consideration, designed to take effect at the death of the assignor, where such choses in action were not delivered until after the assignor had become insane, passed no title to the assignee. This would seem to rule the point now under consideration. The same question was ruled by Judge Chapman in Jones <em>v. </em>Drake, 6 Phila. R. 417, in an able and elaborate opinion. <em>Vide </em>also Grant <em>v. </em>Levan, 4 Barr 324; Critchfield <em>v. </em>Critchfield, 12 Harris; Plumstead\u2019s App., 4 S. &amp; R. 545.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">\u201cIf then this endorsement was without consideration, not having been delivered, it passes no title to the donee. In order to avail herself of it she must show it to have been made upon a sufficient consideration. The next inquiry, therefore, is, was the endorsement made upon a sufficient consideration ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-8\">\u201c It is said that the seal imports a consideration, and that, from the sealing of the endorsement, the law presumes it to have been made upon sufficient consideration. \u2018It is not now to be doubted,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>says Bell, J., in Yard <em>v. </em>Patton, 1 Harris 285, \u2018 that though a parol unexecuted promise to make a gift <em>inter vivos </em>without consideration, is void, an agreement under seal to do so may be enforced as a legal obligation.\u2019 <em>Vide </em>Campbell\u2019s Estate, 7 Barr 100 ; Mack\u2019s App., 18 P. F. Smith 283; Shink <em>v. </em>Endress, 3 W. &amp; S. 256; 1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 329.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">\u201c But in all these cases it will be found that the sealed instrument <em>was </em>delivered to the donees. If delivery had been proved in this case, I should, in consequence of the endorsement being under seal, have no difficulty in concluding that the seal imported a sufficient consideration. But as there was no delivery, the fact that it is under seal does not establish the existence of a consideration. This is squarely ruled in Lonsdale <em>v. </em>Lonsdale, and that authority renders further elaboration on this point superfluous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">\u201c But failing the import of consideration derived from the attachment of the seal, how or by what means do the facts in the case establish it ? The endorsement by its own terms purports to be made \u2018for her grate kindness that she shown to me and her grandmother.\u2019 This expression excludes the idea that any valuable consideration was the moving cause for the endorsement. Kindness and filial devotion are not the subjects of a <em>quantum meruit. </em>The natural love and affection of a grandparent for his grandchild, when that grandchild had been attentive and affectionate to him and his wife in their declining years, would seem to have induced the testator to make the endorsement upon the bond. But these are not sufficient considerations upon which to enforce a gift <em>inter vivos. </em>Eor this there is abundant authority : Yard <em>v. </em>Patton, Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, Whitehill <em>v. </em>Wilson, <em>supra; </em>Short <em>v. </em>Shultz, 7 Watts 207; Mack\u2019s Appeal, supra; Lyon <em>v. </em>Marclay, 1 Watts 271; Campbell\u2019s Est., <em>supra; </em>18 Johns. 145.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">\u201c The only adjudicated case in Pennsylvania, which intimated a contrary doctrine, was Wentz <em>v. </em>De Haven, 1 S. &amp; R. 312, but that was upon a dictum of Lord Mansfield. But upon that point it is distinctly overruled in Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware and Campbell\u2019s Est., supra, and can be regarded as no authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">\u201c But it is said that there was a moral obligation which will support the endorsement by affording a sufficient consideration. A moral obligation which will support a promise to pay or to give has a distinct legal character. A moral obligation is not a vague or undefined claim arising from nearness of relationship, but it is an imperative duty which would be enforced at law, or in equity, were it not for some positive rule, which, with a view to a general benefit, exempts the party in that particular instance from legal liability : Kennedy <em>v. </em>Ware, <em>supra. </em>Its nature is well illustrated in the case of a contract debt barred by the Statute of Limitations, the collection of which cannot be enforced by legal remedies, but which will support a subsequent promise to pay the debt thus tolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>by the statute. Where does the ease stated show any imperative duty on the part of the testator to Mrs. Zimmerman ? She must show, in order to enforce the endorsement, that there was a consideration or its equivalent in moral obligation; but nothing is established by the ease stated except the executory gift. It is simply a case of an unexecuted intention to give at a future period, and is, therefore, under the authorities cited, void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">\u201c It was not seriously contended upon the argument that the endorsements should be considered in the light of testamentary disposition, nor could that view be maintained. A testator can execute but one will which will speak after his decease, and this testator made his will sometime after the endorsement had been executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">\u201c The fact that two of the executors are willing to surrender the bond is not material; they cannot release assets of the estate, as executors ; after the fund comes into their hands as legatees, they may in that character act as they believe justice and equity require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">\u201cIt is apparent from what has been said that the plaintiffs can recover upon these grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">\u201cIt may be questionable whether the defendant could have availed himself of the defence upon which the recovery of the bond was resisted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">\u201c The bond was never cancelled, nor is it pretended that the testator made a gift of it to him. He unquestionably owes the sum secured by it, and the question is not as to his liability.to pay, but as to whom the payment is to be made. I have, however, decided the main question in order that future litigation may be avoided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-11\">\u201c The whole case is well summed up by C. J. Gibson in Campbell\u2019s Estate, <em>supra: </em>\u201c All agree that the possession was not parted with, and it cannot be disputed that his intentions might be abandoned and his directions countermanded. It was his property while he lived, and as the direction was a testamentary one, it became inoperative at his death. It was a mere authority which expired with him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-12\">\u201cAnd now, February 1st 1873, judgment is directed to bo entered upon the case stated in favor of the plaintiffs for the principal of the said bond, with interest thereon at five per cent, from its date to the date of the institution of this action, and at six per cent, after that date.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-13\">The defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error that the court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiffs on the case stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-14\"><em>Gr. </em>IY.

The endorsement of the bond cannot operate as a release as in Wentz <em>v. </em>De Haven, for there, the creditor actually delivered the bond to-the, debtor himself.
