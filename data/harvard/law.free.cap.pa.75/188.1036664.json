And that after six months, if defendant did not wish to retain the said right to sell in said township, the plaintiff agreed to receive back the said territory from said defendant, free of charge to said defendant for the same, and that said plaintiff agreed to send to said defendant one dozen of the said machines, as part of the consideration of the said note, in addition to the said right to sell in the said territory. And the defendant swears that the profits from the sale aforesaid of the said machines have not amounted to the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, nor to any sum at all. Plaintiff never having sent the one dozen machines aforesaid, and defendant, according to the terms of the contract, requires plaintiff to take back the said territory free of charge to said defendant. More than six months having expired since the execution of the said contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">The case was tried February 22d 1870, before Woods, P.

He alleges that the paper originally was some two and a half inches longer than it is, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that there was written on this end, that this note was only to he due and payable on certain terms. A forgery may be committed in other ways than by writing the name of another to a note. Any alteration after the note is signed, in a material part, without the consent of the drawer, is a forgery. Any addition or erasure, or any material change, will be a forgery. The first impression on our mind was, that even if this whole allegation of the defendant were true, it would not amount to a forgery. The giving of a note, as in this ease, and intrusting it in the hands of the drawee in such a way that he could alter it without it being possible to detect it, should not be available against an innocent holder without notice; but this point appears to be a difficulty ruled in Worrall <em>v. </em>G-heen, 3 Wright 388. In obedience to the principle there ruled, we instruct you that if the part described as written on the margin of this note was made by the parties to it, at the time it was executed, and it was to be a substantive part of the note, and wa,s intended at the time to he such part and parcel of the note ; then the cutting or tearing off this part would be such an alteration as would amount to a forgery and would destroy the note. <em>But to </em>have this effect you must be satisfied that when it was put there, it was to be a part of the note and not merely a memorandum of the terms on which the note was given. If you find this point in favor of the defendant he would be entitled to your verdict. If you are not so satisfied the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover the amount of the note with interest from the time it fell due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">The verdict was for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">The plaintiffs took a writ of error, and with others, assigned for error the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-8\"><em>J.

Miller, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAj\">That a note was obtained by fraud, &amp;c., is no defence against a bon\u00e1 fide holder for value without notice: Chitty on Bills 70; Harrisburg Bank <em>v. </em>Meyer, 6 S. &amp; R. 537; Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 2 Dallas 398; Bullock <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 7 Watts 328.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-9\"><em>J.

F. Smith 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">We there held that the waiver of appeal, valuation and appraise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ment, stay of execution, and exemption, contained in the note does not destroy its negotiability: 17 P. F. Smith 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The other question as to the alleged forgery or mutilation of the note by cutting off a separate agreement written at one end of the paper on which the note is written, is also settled by the ease of Phelan <em>v. </em>Moss, 17 P. F. Smith 59, in which it was held that the note in the hands of a bonfi fide holder without notice of the fraud and for a valuable consideration, is not affected by the separation of the written agreement, there being nothing on the face of the note to indicate that the writing had ever constituted a part of the note. The same principle is recognised in Garrard <em>v. </em>Hadden, 17 P. F. Smith 82. It is the duty of the maker of the note to guard not only himself but the public against frauds and alterations, by refusing to sign negotiable paper made in such a form as to admit of fraudulent practices upon them, with ease and without ready detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
