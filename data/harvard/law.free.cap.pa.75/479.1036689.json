Such a decree it was competent for the court to make, leaving the parties to their remedies for any future failure of performance. In Pennsylvania an action of ejectment brought to enforce the specific performance of an agreement is a substitute for a bill in equity and the plaintiff recovers a verdict corresponding with the equities of the parties at the time of trial, not only the instalments due at the time of suit brought, but all that is due when the verdict is rendered: Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 S. &amp; R. 484; Lauer <em>v. </em>Lee, 6 Wright 171; Markley <em>v. </em>Swartzlander, 8 W. &amp; S. 172 ; Shaw <em>v. </em>Bayard, 4 Barr 257 ; Reed <em>v. </em>Reed, 2 Jones 121; Aycinena <em>v. </em>Peries, 6 W. &amp; S. 243; Church <em>v. </em>Ruland, 14 P.

The bill in equity was filed by the defendant in the present action ; it cannot be said that the plaintiff has resorted to inconsistent remedies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-10\">There was no error in vacating the judgment and allowing the plaintiff to change the form of the action from debt to covenant: Bunce <em>v. </em>Wightman, 5 Casey 335; White <em>v. </em>Leeds, 1 P.

It is in the power of the court to set aside a judgment in default of a plea or of an affidavit, at the instance of the plaintiff, who finds he has been proceeding in mistake. When the judgment was taken off, the action stood as before judgment was entered, and the. right of' amendment attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The effect of the affidavit depends on the meaning of the word \u201c due,\u201d where it says, \u201cthe balance of purchase-money and interest <em>due.\u201d </em>Connecting this sentence with what immediately follows, decreeing this balance ($6204.53) to be paid on or before the 1st day of April 1871, it is obvious the word \u201c'due\u201d refers to and means the balance or sum falling due or payable on and before the 1st of April 1871, and not the whole sum owing upon the entire contract. This excludes the subsequent instalments falling due after April 1871. The action of covenant then, being for the instalment of April 1st 1872, it is obvfous the decree does not include it, and is therefore no bar to the action. Herdic, who was the plaintiff in the bill for specific performance, not having complied with the decree in his favor, by giving his bonds and mortgage for the instalments falling due after April 1st 1871, and taking the deed Woodward filed under the decree, and the decree having made no other provision for these instalments, it is evident Herdic stands in no position to contest the plaintiff\u2019s action of covenant, this being the only means left to him to enforce payment of these instalments.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
