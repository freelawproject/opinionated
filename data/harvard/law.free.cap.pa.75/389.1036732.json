Thompson, assignee of Eve Ann Miller, against James Glenn and Charles Glenn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">It commenced April 7th 1873, before Morgan Reed, a justice of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-8\">After reciting the preliminary proceedings of complaint, summons, &amp;c., the justice\u2019s record is as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-9\">\u201cThat on the 13th April 1873, plaintiff and defendants appear both in person and by their attorneys. That after hearing the proofs and allegations of the parties the said justice found that the said Eve Anna Miller was on the 1st April 1872, possessed of said premises ; that after making the demise aforesaid, to wit: on the 24th September 1872, she conveyed the same to said Lewis C. Thompson, as aforesaid. That on the same day and year last aforesaid, she demised the said premises to the said James Glenn and Charles A. Glenn for the term of one year \u2014 and until notice given to quit \u2014 then next ensuing at the yearly rent of $500 payable quarterly. That the said\u2019 Glenns entered into possession and held the same during said term and were still possessed of the same; that the said term for which the said premises were demised was fully ended; that the said Eve Anna Miller being desirous upon the said determination of the said term to have again and repossess said premises, for that purpose did, on 31st December 1872, demand of and require the said Glenns to remove from and leave the same; that the said Glenns had theretofore refused to comply, and the said justice did further find the complaint of the landlord so, as aforesaid made, just and true in every particular (except that the rent should be $500, instead of $550), and that said notice was given more than three months before the end of the term, and did award the possession of the premises aforesaid to the said Lewis 0. Thompson, assignee of Eve Anna Miller, and assess the sum of $16.66 for his damages occasioned by the unjust detention of said premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">The notice demanding possession was dated and served December 31st 1872, and was signed B. M. Miller for E. A. Miller, directed to James Glenn &amp; Son, notifying them that E. A. Miller desired \u201c to have and repossess \u201d the premises on the 1st day of April then next: the notice was served on James Glenn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">The tenants removed the proceedings into the'Court of Common Pleas by certiorari, and filed the following exceptions and \u201c additional exceptions\u201d:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\">1. The record shows that L. C. Thompson became the owner of the premises on the twenty-fourth day of September, A. 3). 1872, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>and also shows that no notice was ever given by said Thompson, or anybody in his behalf or as his agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">2. No such notice as is required by law was ever given to the defendants, and the justice has no jurisdiction without notice has first been given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">Additional exceptions:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">1. The demise set forth in the information and record in this case is from Eve Anna Miller to James Glenn and Charles A. Glenn. The notice to quit was not directed to Charles A. Glenn, but to James Glenn &amp; Son, and served only on James Glenn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">2. There was no demise to James Glenn &amp; Son, as stated in the notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">3. The record shows that Eve Anna Miller had no right to give notice to any one to quit on the 31st December 1872, as she had parted with her title and right to possession, on the 24th September 1872, and the defendants were not bound to regard the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-11\">4. The vendee of Eve Anna Miller and the plaintiff in this proceeding does not allege or claim that Eve Anna Miller acted as his agent or by his authority in giving the notice, nor that he ratified her act as in his behalf, but alleges that she desired to obtain possession so as to hand it over to him, the vendee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-12\">The court (Green, J.) overruled the exceptions and affirmed the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-13\">The tenants removed the record into the Supreme Court and assigned for error the overruling their proceedings and affirming the proceedings of the justice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-14\"><em>G.

L. 187, which provides a remedy for the recovery of possession in case of non-payment of rent, an act <em>in pari materia </em>with that of December 14th 1863, Pamph. L. of 1864, Appendix 1125, in both which the proceeding is granted to the lessor without the addition of the words \u201c heirs or assigns,\u201d it has been held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>by </em>this court in Clark <em>v. </em>Everly, 8 W. &amp; S. 226, that the heir could avail himself of the remedy, and in McKeon <em>v. </em>King, 9 Barr 213, that the sheriff\u2019s vendee of the lessor\u2019s title was within the act. <em>\u201c </em>As to the fact that the lease was not made directly by this complainant, it is entirely clear that- an assignee is entitled to the remedyPer Gibson, C. J. The titles of each of the acts is,' \u201c an act relative to landlord and tenant.\u201d There is good reason therefore for holding that by lessor the legislature meant landlords ; not only the original lessor, but whoever may have succeeded to his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">It is contended here, however, that after the lessor had parted with her title, she had no longer any interest, and the lessee could disregard her notice to quit as the act of a mere stranger. But if, as the inquisition expressly finds, the notice was given with the desire of delivering the possession to the alienee, and the proceeding is in the name and for the benefit of the alienee, the lessor was no such stranger. Every presumption is in favor of the regularity of the proceeding; and applying this principle, we agree with the court below that the record sufficiently shows that the lessor still retained an interest in the property after the date of her deed of conveyance to entitle her to give the necessary notice to quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">A notice to one of two joint lessors is undoubtedly a good notice to both, and the verbal mistake in the recital of the names of the lessees was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"AgJ\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
