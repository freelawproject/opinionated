There were not very many people in the car when they got in, but about Broad street it began to fill up and was very full after that; there .were several persons standing in the aisle and persons standing on the platform; where plaintiff was, he'could not see his brother and sister, because the car was so crowded by persons both sitting and standing. When the car got to Twenty-first street, he glanced out of the window and saw his brother and sister getting out of the ear from the rear platform, he tried to get out at that platform but could not; the car was crowded; he went to the front platform on which were five or six persons on the side on which he was to get off; he told the driver to stop; the driver said \u201cAll right,\u201d and slackened up but did not stop; he slackened up with the reins, not with the brake: plaintiff found that they were going too far and jumped off, he slipped on a pile of bricks and the car wheel went over his an\u00edde; there was no fender or guard around the front platform. There was other evidence in corroboration of the substantial statements of the plaintiff; also, that these children were in the habit of going to school in West Philadelphia in the cars of the defendants without being in the charge of any one ; also, that when the boy found his brother and sister were out of the car he manifested great eagerness to leave the car in the quickest way possible, and avoid any obstructions that might be in his way; also that there was no notice about the ca,r that passengers were not allowed to get on or off at the front platform and that the door to the front platform was open.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">The defendants gave evidence that the car made a full stop at Twenty-first street, a short distance from the place of the accident; it stopped so long that a lady and gentleman and the younger children got off in safety ; that there always had been notices on the outside of each end of their cars and on the side, that passengers were not permitted to get on or off from the front platform; also, that the driver, as to stopping, acts by the ringing of the bell by the conductor ; that the plaintiff was not prevented from getting off at the rear platform by reason of the crowd on it and in the car, but that he got off from the front platform by reason of his eagerness to leave the ear in the quickest way when he found that his brother and sister had left it. There was other evidence in contradiction of the statements of the plaintiff and generally in answer to his case. They gave evidence also that the driver slacked up because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>he was going down grade, and that he did not hear the plaintiff ask him to stop.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">There was also much evidence on both sides as to the different railway passenger cars having fenders on the front platform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-6\">Points were submitted by both parties, which with their answers are hereafter stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-7\">The court charged * * * \u201c Your duty is carefully to analyze the testimony; to extract from it what is called evidence. The evidence is the facts to be gleaned from the testimony, and after you shall ascertain the facts, then apply the principles of law as I have laid them down to you. I will, in order that there be no misunderstanding, repeat them. Negligence is the essence of this action, and before the company can be held responsible, the plaintiff must show that the company so negligently carried him that he was thrown from the car and run over. But where contributory negligence is proved, negligence on the part of the defendants alone, is not sufficient to warrant a verdict. He who asks a verdict of another must come into court with his hands clean of negligence on his own part; and, therefore, it must be made apparent to you that there was negligence on the part of the company, and no negligence whatever on the part of the plaintiff. But with regard to a child of his years, the rule of law as established by the supreme tribunal of this Commonwealth, is just that degree or standard of care which would actuate a boy of his years and. intelligence under similar circumstances. The law does not require of a boy that degree of care that is exacted of a grown-up person. It does require of him just that degree of care, prudence and discretion that his years have given him, and nothing more; and when this company received this boy upon their car, they took him as he was, they took him with his youthful indiscretion, if he had youthful indiscretion; they took him with his caution and his prudence, if he had them; whatever was known to be in other boys of his age of ordinary care, they were bound to notice; and if greater prudence and discretion than that exercised by this boy upon this occasion, would characterize the conduct of other boys of his age under similar circumstances, then the company is not to be held responsible, because of the rashness and impulsiveness of this boy in springing from his seat, rushing by the driver and jumping from the car whilst it was in motion. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-8\">\u201c Did this company act with ordinary care ? The rules of the company, as you have them before you in evidence, are that the driver obeys the signal-bell of the conductor. Indeed, we .all know in this community that his duty is to watch his horses in order to prevent colliding with passing vehicles at street intersections, or to prevent running down pedestrians or foot-passengers; he has no charge of the passengers in the car; his duty is to obey the conductor. The passengers are under the control of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ductor. The duty of the conductor is to obey the signal of those on the sidewalk who desire him to stop his car to get in ; to stop it a sufficient length of time to permit passengers to enter and to be comfortably seated; to stop it when a passenger inside shall give a signal for that purpose, a sufficient length of time to enable the passenger to make his exit to the pavement free, so that the car when it starts will not touch him, or disturb or trip him or throw him. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-6\">\u201cSome of the witnesses say that the boy also obtained a seat, and afterwards removed to the upper end of the car. They remained comfortably and securely protected within the car until they reached the intersection of Twenty-first and Walnut streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-7\">\u201c There is no evidence, it seems to me, to warrant the conclusion that the employees of the road did not, up to this point, act with ordinary, nay, more, with commendable care. The signal is given at Twenty-first and Walnut streets to the conductor to stop; he does stop; one lady, if not more, alights; the two younger children also alight; that being the terminus of their route or trip upon that day, so far as the car was concerned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-8\">\u201c Now I draw your attention to this fact, because it seems to me that it has some bearing upon this question. Two younger children in company with this boy, and as between the three it would seem he should stand protector and guardian to these children. The two younger children leave the car at Twenty-first and Walnut streets (they having been securely protected and carried to that point in a proper way); by means of the rear platform reach the pavement in perfect safety. It is some evidence to show that the company carefully carried them to that point, and carried also this boy to that point. It is some evidence for your consideration to show that as these children of younger years were discreet enough to deport themselves properly, and properly find their exit by means of the rear platform, where danger is least to be apprehended, whether this lad, that is the plaintiff-suitor before you, should not have done so also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-9\">\u201c One of the witnesses tells us that the conductor stopped until no other person desired to alight. He rang the bell and started. Another witness says the car had got under headway, but no more than under headway, when this boy started, looked to the rear end and then to the front, as if trying to discern which way he could make the quickest exit, or from which end he could make the quickest exit, and rushed by the driver and jumped from the platform.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-10\">The judge then referred to other evidence in the case, and proceeded:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b372-11\">\u201c Now these are the facts and the principal facts, as it seems to me, in the case. It is necessary for me to review so much of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>testimony as to give point to the legal propositions that I have laid down.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-5\">\u201c Now, then, you will consider, in view of these younger children being safely carried, and this elder brother being safely carried to that point, and these younger children being safely deposited upon the pavement, whether the company, so far as the driver and the conductor were concerned, was guilty of any negligence. If negligence there was, it seems to me it lies in not knowing what was the exact standard of intelligence and discretion of this young boy; and it seems to me it must, after all, turn upon that one question. If he had arrived at such an age that he ought to have known better, as ascertained from the action and conduct of boys of his age of ordinary care, there was no actual negligence upon the part of the company under such circumstances. But if from his age he was not required to exercise a greater degree of care and prudence than he did, then the company were bound to notice that, and to guard this boy from the perils that inhere in tender years; then it was their duty to close the front door, or to put some one with him, whereby in his youthful impulse he could have been prevented from doing that which resulted in so terrible an accident to him. Therefore I say it seems to me that the question turns almost exclusively upon that question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\">\u201c Much has been said about fenders. That question with all others will come before you \u2014 but I will not say to you- as a matter of law that it is necessary for a street car, where the common custom is to enter from the rear and to depart from the rear, to have a fender around the front platform; and you may consider this testimony with other testimony, whether it was required as an act of prudence to protect passengers. I am bound to say to you, however, as a matter of law, that the best known practical improvement in use the company are bound to adopt, in order to insure and protect the lives and limbs of their passengers. This applies with peculiar force to carriers of passengers. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">\u201c I have sufficiently referred to what I consider the material points of the case as disclosed by the testimony, in order to enable you to understand the legal propositions as I have laid them down; and if from them you are of the opinion, that in view of this boy\u2019s age, this company has been guilty of negligence, then he is entitled to recover. If you are of opinion in view of his age, and what other boys of his age would have done, that the company were not guilty of negligence, but that the boy himself was guilty of negligence, then in that event this company should have the verdict. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">\u201c I am asked by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to say to you:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">\u201c 5. If you believe the injury in question was caused by the negligence of the defendants or their employees, in not having the improvements aforesaid, or otherwise, and the injured child had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>not capacity to appreciate the danger and avoid it, so far as any act on his part contributed to the injury, that incapacity shields him from responsibility for any act of his contributing to the injury, although such act would have been contributory negligence in an adult, defeating his recovery, and your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">\u201c Answer. I will affirm that point. If this boy had not capacity enough, as ascertained by the test that I have given you, namely, that degree of intelligence, discretion, and prudence that should characterize boys of his age of ordinary caution, then the boy is not to be held responsible for this absence or the want of it. The law does not exact of the child impossibilities, any more than it exacts of this company impossibilities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">\u201c 7. If you believe the injured boy in leaving the car at the time of the injury in question, acted according to the habitual impulse of a child of his age, under all the circumstances, and the defendants were guilty of negligence in any of the modes aforesaid, or otherwise, and the injury resulted therefrom, your verdict must be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">\u201cI affirm that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">\u201c The defendants have asked me to charge:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">\u201c1. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff by negligence on his part contributed to the accident, the verdict should be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-11\"><em>\u201c </em>That is so, provided the boy had reached those years of discretion that should have taught him better. If under the -charge I have given you, you find that he ought not to have done so, the doing it under these circumstances defeats his right of recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-12\">\u201c2. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff attempted to get off the car while it was in motion, and in consequence of such act on his part the accident occurred, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-13\"><em>\u201c </em>I answer this point exactly as I answered the preceding one. That if the boy\u2019s age and discretion was such as to teach him that he should not do so, then he ought not to have done so, and in doing so he contributes to the accident, and that contributory act of his defeats his right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-14\"><em>\u201c </em>3. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the accident occurred from a mere act of thoughtlesness of the plaintiff in attempting to jump from the ear while it was moving, the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-15\">\u201c My answer to this is substantially what it has been to the preceding. If his years were such as to warrant this degree of thoughtlessness that characterized his conduct, he is not responsible, because the law does not exact more from a child of his age than the common action of children of his age leads us to believe he was possessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201c 4. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the defendants were using their car in the usual and ordinary way, and the accident happened solely by the plaintiff attempting to get off the car from the front platform while the car was in motion, the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThat is to receive the same qualification. If the little fellow knew better; if he should have known better ; if he did otherwise than boys of his age would have done of ordinary care, then this proposition is right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-7\">\u201c <em>5. </em>That if the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff was a passenger on the car, then the law of the contract between him and the defendants bound him to observe all the reasonable regulations of the company as to the mode of leaving the cars; and if the jury find from the evidence that a rule of the company requires all passengers to get off the car at the back platform, and that by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s neglect to observe that rule the accident occurred, the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\">\u201c An adult making a contract with a minor, especially if the child contracts with him according to his standard of intelligence, there cannot be entire mutuality, and the only degree of fulfilment that can be exacted of the child is the best possible prudence, knowledge and discretion that the child has, as ascertained by that prudence, discretion and intelligence characterizing the conduct of boys of such age of ordinary care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-9\">\u201c 6. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was not seen by the driver or conductor when he jumped off the front platform, and that neither of them could have prevented the accident, then the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-10\">\u201c Yes; unless this boy\u2019s age should have told them that it was un- \u2019 safe to leave him with the front door open without some one to take care of him; unless his age, his discretion was such as to convince them that he ought to have found his exit as his brother and sister did, by the rear platform^ I have already referred to his younger brother and sister leaving the car from the rear platform. It is some evidence to my mind that he ought to have done likewise, but that is entirely for you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-11\">\u201c 7. That the defendants were not guilty of negligence by reason of having the front platform open or unenclosed at its sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-12\">\u201c As that is stated briefly, and for the purpose of having the thing settled by the court in banc, I will affirm that proposition absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-13\">\u201c 8. That if the jury believe, that from the evidence that the plaintiff was of sufficient discretion to understand the dangerous character of the act which resulted in the accident, then if by such act he contributed to the accident, he cannot recover, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-14\"><em>\u201c </em>I affirm that absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201c 9. That if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff was possessed of sufficient discretion to understand the dangerous character of the act he was doing, in attempting to get off the front platform of the car while it was in motion, and that by so attempting to get off the car he contributed to his own misfortune, then the rule of law which precludes an adult from recovering, where by his negligence he has contributed to his own injury, is applicable to this plaintiff, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">\u201c I affirm that proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">\u201c 10. That there is no sufficient evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants to entitle the plaintiff to recover in this suit, and the verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">\u201c I decline to affirm that, and leave the question for your determination under the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-9\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $3000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">The defendants took out a writ of error and assigned for error : 1-2.

The plaintiff below, a boy of. ten years of age, was a passenger on the defendants\u2019 car, and, in getting off, jumped from the front platform while the car was in motion, and received an injury which resulted in the loss of a leg. At the time of the accident there were more passengers in the car than could be seated. Some were standing on the front and rear platforms, and others inside the ear, in the passage-way, between the seats. The plaintiff got into the car in company with his younger brother and sister, at or near the intersection of Walnut and Broad streets. The latter, upon entering the car, got seats near the door at the rear platform. The plaintiff, after standing awhile, obtained a seat at the upper end of the car near the front door, which was open. The car stopped at Twenty-first street, and the younger children, without the knowledge of the plaintiff, got off with other passengers. But as the car started he saw them on the sidewalk, and tried to get out to the rear platform, but the passageway was so crowded that he turned and rushed out of the front door, and, as he says, told the driver to stop, who answered \u201c all right,\u201d and slacked up with the reins. While the car was in motion, the plaintiff jumped off upon a pile of loose bricks, and slipped under the car. The hind wheel passed over his leg, crushing the bone above the ankle, and opening the ankle-joint. The driver testified that he slacked up because it was down grade; that he did not hear the boy ask him to stop, and that the first he saw of him he was falling, or jumping off the front platform. He could not say whether he jumped off or fell off; that he checked his horses, put his break to the car and did his best to stop it. The conductor was on the rear platform making change for a passenger who was paying his fare, and did not see the plaintiff until he felt the bouncing of the ear as it passed over his leg, and then he saw him crawl over to the sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The court instructed the jury, in substance, that if the plaintiff\u2019s injury was occasioned by the negligence of the defendants, without any fault on his own part, then he was entitled to maintain the action. But if it was not occasioned by the defendants\u2019 negligence, or if his own negligence contributed to produce it, he was not entitled to recover. But in determining whether he acted with ordinary care, or was guilty of negligence, the jury must consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>his conduct and action in view of his age. All that the law exacted of him, was such prudence and discretion as is usually exercised by boys of his own age; and if he acted with as much care and prudence under the circumstances, as children of his own age generally exercise, then he was not chargeable with negligence. No complaint is made in regard to these instructions, but it is alleged that there was error in the answers of the court to the plaintiff\u2019s fifth and seventh points, and to the defendants\u2019 first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and tenth points; all of which, .as it seems to us, were answered in substantial conformity with the instructions contained in the general charge. The assignments of error embracing the answers to these points, virtually raise but two questions:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">1. Whether, under the facts disclosed by the evidence, the court should have charged that no negligence was imputable to the defendants ?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">2. Whether the court should have charged that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was occasioned by his own negligence or misconduct ?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">It was the duty of the defendants to carry the plaintiff and set him down safely, if they could do it by the exercise of reasonable care and vigilance. If the plaintiff, on account of his age and inexperience, was incapable of taking proper care of himself, then the defendants were bound to exercise the highest care and vigilance necessary and proper to secure his safety. Whether the carrier, in the case of an injury to a passenger, has exercised reasonable and proper care to prevent it, or has been guilty of negligence, is, as. a general rule, a question of fact for the jury. But there may be such an obvious disregard of duty and safety, as to make it incumbent on the court to declare it negligence as a matter of law : Penna. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Ogier, 11 Casey 60; Pittsburg &amp; Connellsville R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>McClurg, 6 P. F. Smith 295; and so the evidence may show such care and vigilance, and such an absence of any fact from which negligence can be inferred, as to make it the duty of the court to declare that no negligence is imputable : Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Hummell, 8 Wright 375. But such cases are exceptions to the general rule, that what is \"negligence is a question for the jury, when the measure of duty is ordinary and reasonable care: McCully <em>v. </em>Clark &amp; Thaw, 4 Wright 399; Glassey <em>v. </em>Hestonville, &amp;c., Passenger Railway Co., 7 P. F. Smith 172; Kay <em>v. </em>Penna. Railroad, 15 Id. 269; Penna. Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Bentley, 16 Id. 34; West Chester &amp; Phila. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>McElwee, 17 Id. 311. Is then the case before us within the exception, or does it clearly come within the general rule ?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">It was undoubtedly the duty of the defendants to prevent children from getting on or off the front platform, or from riding in a place of so much danger: Pittsburg, Allegheny and Manchester Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 24 P. F. Smith 421; and if negligence is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>imputable to them as a matter of law, because they did not enclose the front platform with a screen or fender, the fact that it was not so enclosed is a matter proper to be considered, in connection with the other facts of the case, in determining whether, or not, the defendants were guilty of negligence in allowing the front door to remain open, when the car was filled with passengers, some of whom were children, unattended by their parents or guardians, and who, from their youth and inexperience, may not have known that there was greater danger in getting off the front, than there was in getting off the rear platform. If the ear was filled with passengers \u2014 if some were standing on the platforms, and others in the passageway, blocking it up so as to make it difficult for the plaintiff to get to the rear platform, and impossible for the conductor to see him, how, under these circumstances, could the court say, as matter of law, that it was not the defendants\u2019 duty to keep the front door closed, and that they were guilty of no negligence in allowing it to remain open ? If the plaintiff did not know that it was more dangerous to get off the front than to get off the rear platform, was not the crowded passageAvay and the open front door an invitation to him to go through it and get off the front platform ? If the latter had been enclosed with a screen or fender, the door might have been allowed to remain open with safety. But there was nothing in the construction of the front platform, showing that it was not to be used by passengers in getting on and off the car ; and the evidence shows that the plaintiff was not told or informed that he must not get on or off the front platform. It is clear, under all the circumstances, that the court could not have instructed the jury as matter of law, that it was not the duty of the defendants to keep the door closed, and if so, the question of negligence was properly submitted to their determination. Where both the duty and the extent of its performance are to be ascertained as facts, a jury alone can determine what is negligence and whether it has been proved: McOully <em>v. </em>Clarke &amp; Thaw, <em>supra. </em>The court below was, therefore, right in refusing to charge that no negligence was imputable to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">II. Was there error in not charging that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was occasioned by his own negligence or misconduct ?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">It may be conceded that if the plaintiff had been an adult of ordinary discretion and intelligence, he would have been chargeable with negligence in jumping from the front platform, while the car was in motion, and the court might properly have instructed the jury that his injury was occasioned by his own folly and imprudence. But the plaintiff was a mere boy, and the law, because of his tender age and inexperience, does not exact of him the same degree of care and prudence that it does of a person of mature years. A boy\u2019s capacity is the measure of his responsibility; and if he has not the ability to foresee and avoid danger to which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>may be exposed, negligence will not be imputed to him, if he unwittingly exposes himself to it. Whether, then, the plaintiff had sufficient discretion and intelligence to know that he was exposing himself to great bodily harm in jumping, from the platform as he did, was not a matter of law but a question of fact, and was properly submitted to the jury, with the instruction that the law exacted of the plaintiff just that degree of care, prudence and discretion that his years had given him and no more; and if greater prudence and discretion than that exercised by the plaintiff, upon this occasion, would characterize the conduct of other boys of his age under similar circumstances, then the company is not to be held responsible, because of the rashness and impulsiveness of this boy in springing from his seat, rushing by the driver, and jumping from the car whilst it was in motion. The law governing tibe plaintiff\u2019s responsibility for the act which resulted in his injury, is clearly and accurately stated in the defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth points, which were affirmed by the court without qualification, and by their affirmance the question of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was submitted to the jury with just such instructions as they asked. If the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s remedy was a motion for a new trial, the granting or refusal of which was a matter within the sound discretion of the court below, and is not reviewable here.
