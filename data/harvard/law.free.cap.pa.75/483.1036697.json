May had a contract for land with Mackey; Fessler agreed to pay the purchase-money due at times named, the title to be made to Fessler to be by him held until the purchase-money should' be repaid him by May in logs, according to a contract made at the same time, and upon repayment to convey to May. <em>Held, </em>to be a mortgage of May\u2019s equitable title to Fessler.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b485-12\">2. Mackey, had contracted in writing to convey the land to May upon certain payments to be made by a given time. This was an agreement of bargain and sale, time being of the essence of the payment; until the time had expired the agreement was binding.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b485-13\">3.

May filed a bill against P. G. Fessler, N. C. Harri% A. H. Spaulding, C. Hunsicker, George Perry, David McOraney and Samuel McOraney. The bill set out:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-13\">1. Plaintiff on September 11th 1863 owned a tract of timber land on Loshbaugh run, in Cameron county, being part of a tracl; warranted to William Willink, containing about 600 acres, which tract he owned under an agreement with L. A. Mackey and D. Carskaddon, and on the contract he owed to his vendors $1100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-14\">2. Fessler, the defendant, wishing to purchase logs to be cut from the land, plaintiff\u2019entered into a written contract with him on the 11th of September 1863, Fessler to pay plaintiff $500 in twelve days and $600 more in eighty days, to be applied to the payment of the amount due to Mackey and Carskaddon for the purchase-money of the land; and when this money should be fully paid the.deed to be made to Fessler, who was to hold the title as collateral security until the $1100 should be repaid in logs to be cut from the land by the plaintiff and delivered to Fessler, who agreed upon-such repayment to reconvey the land to the plaintiff. This agreement, \u201cA,\u201d was made part of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-15\">3. On the same day plaintiff made another agreement with Fessler, in which the first agreement is referred to, and by which plaintiff agreed to sell to Fessler from the land 1,000,000 feet or more of logs, and deliver them on Loshbaugh run, Fessler to pay at the rate of $5.25 per thousand feet, to be paid, $500 in twelve days, and $1.50 per thousand feet as fast as the logs were delivered, $1 per thousand feet to be paid monthly, from the 1st day of January 1864, 75 cents per thousand feet when the drive of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>logs should start, and for the balance, after deducting the amount to be paid to Mackay and Carskaddon, Fessler to give plaintiff his note, payable in four months from the time the drive should start. This agreement, \u201cB,\u201d was made part of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">4. Shortly afterwards Fessler paid Mackey and Carskaddon $500, and then, for the purpose of^garrying out agreement \u201cA,\u201d the contract between plaintiff and Mackey and Carskaddon was, by the consent of all parties in interest, destroyed, and a new contract was made between Fessler and plaintiff for the purpose still of carrying out agreement \u201cA,\u201d whereby Mackey and Carskaddon agreed, on the payment of the remaining $600 due on their contract with' plaintiff, to convey the land to Fessler; he after-wards paid the $600; the land was conveyed to him and he held the legal title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">5. Plaintiff had always been ready to&gt; perform his part of agreement \u201cB \u201d on being paid for the logs according to its terms, and in the performance the agreement to repay to Fessler the $1100 paid by him to Mackay and Carskaddon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">6. Fessler, shortly after contract \u201cB \u201d was made, paid $250 on account of it, and although often requested, paid no more until April 1864, when he paid $250 more; but the plaintiff, notwithstanding, being anxious and ready to carry out his part of the contract, continued until January 1864 to. cut and get the logs into the creek, to his great inconvenience and damage, on account of Fessler\u2019s failure to comply with his agreement; up to that time he had delivered 61,800 feet of logs, when he demanded payment for them, and was refused by Fessler; plaintiff then offered to pay Fessler all the money advanced for plaintiff if he would let plaintiff have the title to the land and logs; -this, also, Fessler refused; plaintiff then resumed work in getting the logs at great disadvantage and loss, on account of Fessler\u2019s refusal to pay him, and continued-so to work until March 1st 1864, .when he had delivered 180,950 feet of logs in the run, all which Fessler claimed and received, but had refused to comply with the terms of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">7. Fessler claimed the land and logs as his own, and denied that the plaintiff had any right, title, interest or claim in the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-10\">8. By reason of Fessler\u2019s refusal to make his payments, the plaintiff was compelled to discontinue getting the logs into the creek for want of means to carry on so expensive a work, but was still willing and ready to complete the work on the performance by Fessler of his agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\">9.

He had no knowledge of plaintiff having been owner of the land, but believed that he never had been.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-13\">2. He had no knowledge of agreement \u201c A\u201d and denied that plaintiff had any interest in the land on the 11th of September 1863 ; Mackey and Carskaddon had the title and they were under no obligation to convey to plaintiff, who had never bound himself to pay any of the purchase-money; nor had he paid any of it: on the 4th of January 1865, Mackey and Carskaddon conveyed the land to Fessler and Fessler sold it to Harris, by articles dated September 14th 1866, for $2000 of which $1000 were then paid; $1000 being still unpaid.

Harris denied knowledge of the recording of agreement \u201c A;\u201d \u2014 he denied having any notice of the agreements. After he purchased from Fessler, he entered on the land and employed others to 'cut timber for him and take it to\u2019 market; the Craneys, defendants, worked for him but neither they nor Hunsicker who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>superintended the cutting, had any interest in the land or the timber; Perry and Spaulding had no interest in the land or timber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-6\">Agreement \u201cE.\u201d was as set out in the answer of Harris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-7\">By a supplementary answer, Harris averred that he had employed George Perry to make inquiry as to the title, &amp;c., and was informed by him that Fessler owned the land and upon that inforformation he purchased from Fessler and then knew of no claim from any other person; \u2014 after he had taken possession and commenced cutting timber, plaintiff forbade his cutting and notified him of his claim, in March or April 1867, a short time before filing the bill; Harris upon inquiry from Perry, Fessler and Carskaddon was informed by them, that plaintiff never had any title or claim to the land, that he had not paid Mackey and Carskaddon for the land nor was he indebted to them for it. Harris had taken logs from this land and another tract adjoining together about 1,098,000 feet and about one-half of this amount was taken from the lot claimed by plaintiff, amounting to about 500,000 and 600,000 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\">An examiner was appointed who took a large amount of testimony in the case.

Fessler, and also agreed to pay him $1000 more within one year from the date of the contract. He also paid to George Perry $500 for his services in the sale and purchase of the property, between P. G. Fessler and N. C. Harris, making $2500 paid and agreed to be paid by N. C. Harris for the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">\u201cVIII. Prior to the purchase by N. C. Harris, he had employed George Perry to make inquiry as to the title and price of the land. George Perry did make inquiries. He knew that May was cutting logs on the land. He saw the agreement between P. G. Fessler and Henry W. May. He had- conversation with Carskaddon in relation to May\u2019s interest in the land, but did not go to May to make inquiries of him. After the payment of $1000 by N. C. Harris on his contract, notice was given to George Perry, while he and others were at work on the land cutting'logs for N. C. Harris, by Henry W. May, that the logs they were cutting would be held by him when they reached the boom. Before N. C. Harris paid the last $1000 to P. G. Fessler, on his contract, the plaintiff\u2019s bill had been served on him, giving him full notice of plaintiff\u2019s claim. The allegation that personal notice was given by Henry W. May to N. C. Harris, in the fall of 1866, while Harris was negotiating with Fessler, is denied by N. C. Harris, and the allegation is not sustained. The parol evidence of the recording of the contract is insufficient to raise the question of notice, as it is not shown that the contract was acknowledged, or that it was properly recorded, and P. G. Fessler makes oath that it never was acknowledged by him, and there were no subscribing witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">IX. Warrant 4940, mentioned in the first paragraph of plaintiff\u2019s bill, was divided east and west by the Potter and Cameron county line. The part thereof purchased by the said N. C. Harris, and claimed by the plaintiff, is in the county of Cameron, and south of the said line. N. C. Harris also purchased the part of said warrant lying in Potter county, of other parties. The part lying in Cameron county contained a larger number of acres, and had- more timber growing upon it than the part in Potter county. N. C. Harris sold, and by deed bearing date the 22d day of September 1868, after service of plaintiff\u2019s bill on him, conveyed the undivided half of the warrant to F. N. Page, for a house and lot situate in Athens, Bradford county, Pennsylvania, valued by the parties at $15,000, which I find to be the fair value thereof. He sold the other undivided half of the said warrant to F. L. Wells, 'for the consideration of $15,000 as mentioned in the deed from N. C. Harris to F. L. Wells, bearing date the 24th day of April 1869, and that there is no evidence of the said Harris having expended any money in making improvements before the sales on said lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u201cX.

The agreement of Mackey and Carskaddon to sell, and upon payment of the purchase-money, to convey the land to Henry W. May, as contained in the first finding of fact, was a valid agreement, and binding upon them, and under it the plaintiff had an equitable interest in the land on the 11th day of September 1863, that he could sell, mortgage or otherwise dispose of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">\u201cIII. The arrangement and agreement between Henry W. May and P. Gr. Eessler, entered into on the \u2019 11th day of September 1863, was either a sale of plaintiff\u2019s interest in the land, or a mortgage, security or pledge thereof, for the performance of some act. That it was not 'intended as an absolute sale is evident from the terms of the agreement and the situation of the parties. Nor was it a <em>conditional </em>sale. P. Gr. Fessler had no interest in the land that he agreed to part with to Henry W. May, upon certain conditions to be performed by him. In a conditional sale the estate <em>reverts </em>to the vendor, upon non-performance of conditions. This was not the case between Eessler and May. May was the equitable owner of the land. To complete the title, and save his equitable estate, the purchase-money must be paid. May had not the money to pay, but as is frequently the ease, he was willing to put the land in pledge to secure an advancement of the purchase-money. He entered into an agreement with P. Gr. Eessler to advance the money, and to take and hold the title until he should be reimbursed the money he should have advanced. It is true that May agreed to pay in saw-logs, at a particular price, and he also agreed to get out a much larger quantity at a particular price, and to be delivered within a specified time, than was necessary to repay Fessler the money he was to advance upon the lands. Whether he was to get his pay in saw-logs, or in some other way, is immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">\u201c There is more in <em>substance </em>than in a <em>name. </em>The arrangement of the parties as contained in their agreements of September 11th 1863, I hold to be in the nature of an imperfect or equitable mortgage, security or pledge. We may call it what we please\u2014 its character remains the same; it was a security coupled with a trust. Eessler was to advance the money and take the title in his own name, and to hold in trust for May, until May should reimburse him, and then to convey to him in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\">\u201c It is claimed, however, on the part of the defendants, that admitting it to be a security, mortgage or pledge, it was a pledge for the performance of the entire contract on the part of May, and that he could have no claim in equity without showing an entire performance. I do not assent to this; I think the security was only for advancements to be made by P. Gr. Fessler. That at any time, without the delivery of a single saw-log, upon paying to Eessler the money he had advanced in pursuance of the agreement, and interest, May would have been entitled to a conveyance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the land from Fessler, and a court of equity would have decreed such conveyance, leaving to the parties their common-law remedies for other breaches of the agreement. The transaction being, then, in the nature of a mortgage or security, there could be no forfeiture of estate, and no change' in the relation of the parties, <em>except by agreement of parties, </em>or by proceedings in equity and decree of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">\u201c IV. That even if there be error in the foregoing conclusion, it would not relieve the defendants. I construe the agreements of September 11th 1863, that Fessler shall not only pay to Mackey and Oarskaddon $500 on the land, within twelve days, but that he shall also pay $500 towards the logs, within twelve days, and that he shall also pay $1.50 per thousand feet so fast as May shall deliver the logs in the stream. This, he did not do, and as a consequence thereof May could not and was not under obligations to go on with the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-7\">\u201c V. That the contract obtained by P. G. Fessler from Mackey and Oarskaddon, on the 19th day of September 1863, was obtained in pursuance of the agreement of September 11th 1863, and was held in trust by P. G. Fessler for Henry W. May.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-8\"><em>\u201c </em>VI. That P. G. Fessler was bound to accept the offer made by May, and others on his behalf, and to take the money he had advanced on land and logs, and to assign the contract he held from' Mackey and Oarskaddon for the land, and to vacate or annul the contract he had made with May (he, Fessler, having failed*to perform his part); and having refused to accept the offer, and claiming the land as his, it was not necessary for May to make a tender of the balance that might be due to Fessler after deducting what logs he had received, before filing his bill. The refusal to do anything about it obviated the necessity of a tender as regards the plaintiff\u2019s right to support his bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-9\">\u201c VII. That George Perry was the agent of N. O. Harris in looking up the title to the land. That George Perry had notice, prior to the purchase of the land by the said N. C. Harris, and while he was acting for him in relation to the purchase thereof, sufficient to put him upon inquiry of May; and that N. C. Harris, as principal, was affected by such notice to Perry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-10\">\u201c VIII. That N. C. Harris, having purchased the land of Fessler, after notice to George Perry, his agent in the transaction, stood in no better situation than did P. G. Fessler himself, and would hold the land in trust for May, upon the same conditions that Fessler held it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-11\"><em>\u201c IX. </em>That in case there be error in the 7th conclusion of law, it could have no effect except as to the $1000, for before anything farther was paid by the said N. C. Harris, the plaintiff\u2019s bill was served on him, which was full and direct notice to him of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The bill having been served on him November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>2Sd 1867, he could have protected Himself against any farther payment to Fessler, and he would have teen protected as to the $1000 paid, provided he had been a bon\u00e1 fide purchaser, without notice. But the result will show that he is protected in either case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Au3k\">\u201cX. That if P. G. Fessler held the land in security, as herein-before stated, he could convey no better title to any other person with notice, than he held himself. He could at any time have brought his bill against May, and procured a decree for the sale of the land, and thus have cut off May\u2019s equity. This he was bound to do unless by agreement with May \u2014 \u2018 Once a mortgage, always a mortgage.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-7\">\u201c XI. That the sale and conveyance of the land by N. C. Harris, while the case was pending, and after service of plaintiff\u2019s bill upon him, for a house and lot valued at $15,000, enures to the benefit of the plaintiff, and the said N. C. Harris can take no advantage thereby. It was <em>mala fides </em>in him after service of bill upon him to put it out of his power to comply with the decree for specific performance prayed for, and he must therefore respond in damages under plaintiff\u2019s general prayer for relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-8\"># * * * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-9\">\u201c XIV. That P. G. Fessler is bound to account to the plaintiff for $853.75, being the amount received by him beyond the amount advanced by him, with interest thereon from September 14th 1866, the day of sale of the lands to N.

He slept upon his rights for three years. He made no tender to P. G. Fessler, before filing his bill, of the money that had been advanced by him. From these facts, and other evidence in the case, I deem it equitable that he should not recover costs, and that he should pay the one-half thereof, and that P. G. Fessler and N. O.

We decree compensation, but the bill made no case against Harris, except for an injunction and account. As no conveyance from him is asked, none can be decreed. No facts are alleged in the bill which could sustain such a prayer for relief, if made, and for that reason the prayer for general relief will not justify the decree recommended, so far as it relates to Harris. From this view it follows that we sustain such of the exceptions to the master\u2019s report as relate to the decree against Harris, and such as relate to the decree against Fessler are overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-8\">A decree was entered in accordance with this conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-9\">Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court, assigning for error respectively the parts of the decree against them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-10\"><em>H.

This is a perfect estoppel from his setting up title to the land for himself: Adam\u2019s Eq. 151; 1 Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7 391; Hill <em>v. </em>Epley, 7 Casey 331; Nerhooth <em>v. </em>Althouse, 8 Watts 427; Hipple <em>v. </em>Rice, 4 Casey 406; Meason <em>v. </em>Kaine, 17 P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYa\">The clear and methodical report of the master saves us the necessity of discussing many of the questions raised by the numerous assignments of error. These appeals are from the same decree, and we shall notice a few leading points which will govern the decision. The principal question arises upon the agreement between Henry W. May and Philip G. Eessler, dated September 11th 1863. That this paper is a mortgage of May\u2019s equitable interest in the land is very clear. Its terms are express. After- reciting that May held the land by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>agreement, Fessler agreed to advance for May two sums of $500 and $600 to pay the purchase-money due by May to L. A. Mackey and D. Carskaddon; and then agreed \u201c that the title of said land shall be made to the said Fessler, and be by him held until the $1100 shall be paid by the said May to the said Fessler, in saw-logs, as per terms stated in a contract for logs this day made between thep'arties.\u201d This language is sufficient in itself, for it distinctly exhibits the relation of debtor and creditor, and not that of vendor and vendee. This is not all, for the writing contains this express covenant: \u201c Then (viz., on payment) the said Fessler agrees by himself, his heirs and assigns, to <em>convey </em>to the said May, his heirs or assigns, the said tract of land, free of encumbrance.\u201d Thus, by express terms, the interest of May, whatever it was, passed to Fessler as a pledge or security for money to be advanced by Fessler for May, in order to secure May\u2019s purchase of the land. Fessler was a lender of money, not a purchaser of land: Sweetzer\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264; Danzeisin\u2019s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">What interest did pass ? This is equally clear. It would be sufficient on this point to rely on the report of the master confirmed by the court, the testimony being uncontradicted. But let us turn to the evidence and examine it. That Mackey and Carskaddon had a good title is not questioned. The legal title was in William Fearon, in trust for them, but he executed this trust by his conveyance of the 4th of January 1865. Mackey testifies that he gave Carskaddon full authority to treat for the sale of the land with May, and that he transacted the business. Carskaddon testifies that Mackey and he had a contract in <em>writing </em>with H. W. May for the <em>sale </em>of this tract of land, that the nature of their contract was that they agreed to <em>convey </em>the land in question to May, upon certain payments, to be made by a given time or times, the purchase-money, he thinks, was $1100. Then the legal character of the writing was perfectly clear. It was an agreement of bargain and sale, making time of essence in the payment. But making time of essence in the performance of the contract does not change the nature of the agreement itself. So long as the time had not expired the agreement to convey was legally and fully binding. Therefore, calling it a refusal, or an option, cannot change its true character. May had a right to call for a conveyance on payment according to its terms. But even if it were an option contract it was binding and enforceable, if the option be exercised according to its terms: Kerr <em>v. </em>Day, 2 Harris 112; Corson <em>v. </em>Mulvany, 13 Wright 88; Siter, James &amp; Co.\u2019s Appeal, 2 Casey 180 ; Shollenberger <em>v. </em>Brinton, 2 P. F. Smith 98 ; Lowry <em>v. </em>Mehaffy, 10 Watts 389; McFarson\u2019s Appeal, 1 Jones 503. But the case does not rest on the character of the writing alone ; for the parties carried it into actual execution. Carskaddon testifi\u00e9s: \u201cWe considered the land as May\u2019s if he complied with the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tract. When we met at the office of Mr. Hirst it was for the purpose of carrying out this arrangement, as I .understood it.\u201d May and Eessler were both present. \u201c Our object in meeting there was for the purpose of receiving the first payment, and for the purpose of closing up the transaction.\u201d \u201cWhat we were doing at the meeting in Hirst\u2019s office was in furtherance pf the contract with May, as I understood it. I went there at the instance of Mr. May, for the. purpose of closing up the transaction for the sale of this land.\u201d \u201cWe were all together. No one left the office until the matter was entirely closed up. I required the, $100 to be paid before the contract was signed by Mr. Eessler and Mr. Mackey. I got Mr. Mackey\u2019s price for his interest, and I wanted a little more.\u201d It is further in evidence that May paid the $100. It further appears by theagreementandreeeiptsthatEesslerpaid only $957.75. Thus the facts prove beyond a question that Eessler took May\u2019s place under the contract between May and Mackey and Carskaddon, and advanced the money for May by virtue of the agreement of September 11th 1863. He is estopped from denying May\u2019s title, both by his acts and by the recital in his agreement, which opens thus: \u201c That whereas, the said H. W. May holds an agreement with L. A. Mackey and D. Carskaddon for a tract of land on Lonsbaugh run, in Cameron county.\u201d On every ground it is apparent that Eessler held the equitable title derived from Mackey and Carskaddon as a security for the money advanced by him for May. Hence, when he obtained the legal title from Eearon, the trustee of Mackey and Carskaddon, in execution of their contract, he held the land as a trustee for May under a covenant to convey to him upon the repayment of the sums advanced by him for May, according to the express terms of the agreement of September 11th 1863. This being the true relation of these parties, it puts an end to several controversies. A mortgagee is not the owner of the land, and is entitled only to his money and interest. No question of delay in filing the bill can arise. It is not a case of specific performance to which the doctrine of abandonment by laches can apply. It is not a parol trust, and is not affected by the limitation in the sixth section of the Act of 22d April 1856. Delay will be compensated by interest; and if the mortgagee be in possession, and has incurred expenses, they will be settled in his account for profits he has derived : Harper\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The next matter to be noticed is the saw-log contract between May and Fessler of even date, viz.: September 11th 1863, set up by Eessler in his defence. By it May agreed to cut, sell and deliver to Eessler one million or more feet (board measure) of white pine saw-logs, at $5.25 per thousand feet, in the time and manner set forth in it, and Eessler agreed to pay to May, in consideration of this $500, within twelve days from the date, and the remainder in certain instalments. The defence turns upon the interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of this agreement as to the $500 to be paid in twelve days. Fessler paid but $250 of this sum. May was a poor man, according to Fessler\u2019s own showing, and without this money, according to all the evidence, was unable to prepare for the execution of the log contract, and to carry it out. It is in clear proof that May repeatedly demanded money from Fessler to go on with the contract, and offered to refund what he had received if Fessler would release the contract; but Fessler refused all offers, and both neglected and refused to pay the money. It is beyond controversy that, if Fessler was bound to pay this sum of $500 in twelve days from September 11th 1868, he was in fault, and not May, in the execution of the log contract, and therefore cannot interpose that contract as a defence to the land contract or mortgage. To avoid this he contends that this sum of $500 in the log contract is the identical sum mentioned in the land or mortgage contract which was paid, and to make good this position insists that the two agreements of September 11th 1863 are one in effect. But it is immaterial whether we call the two papers one agreement or two; they contain intrinsic evidence, corroborated also by surrounding circumstances, and cotemporaneous acts, showing that the two sums are not identical. The very reason why the parties made two distinct writings was that the purpose of each was different. The mortgage contract was to enable May to secure the land by providing for the payment of the purchase-money to Mackey and Carskaddon. The purpose of the log contract was to supply Fessler with logs and enable May to refund the money advanced. By the express terms of the mortgage agreement, Fessler agreed to make the payment of $500 <em>to apply on the land </em>in twelve days. This money was not for May himself, but for Mackey and Carskaddon to save the land upon which the logging was to be done, and so the parties mutually treated it, the money being paid in the presence of both parties. On the other hand the $500 to be paid in twelve days on the log contract, was expressed in the agreement to be in consideration of the logs to be cut and delivered by May, and was also expressed to be the first instalment of the $5.25 to be paid per thousand feet. The proof does hot rest oh the expressed consideration alone, but the agreement further provides that the payments on the land shall come out of the last two instalments. The payment of $500 being the first instalment, it is impossible, without violating the express language of the agreements, to say that it is one of the land payments. <em>JExpressio unius est exclusio alterius. </em>This interpretation is supported also by the reason and necessity of the thing as shown in the evidence. Logging contracts such as this are prosecuted in the fall, winter and early spring, and a large outlay of money is necessary in the beginning to provide .a cabin or shelter for the hands and for the team, to make roads, lay in provisions and supplies of grain, hay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>&amp;c. The testimony is, that for such a contract this sum of $500 was not more than adequate; and afterwards money is required to pay wages and other current expenses. To conclude the proof, Fessler so interpreted his own contract, for in ten days, September 21st 1863, he paid one-half of this sum of $500, having already paid $475 on the land contract on the 19th of September 1863. It is very clear, therefore, that Fessler was in default on the log contract, and having repeatedly refused May\u2019s demands for money to carry on the work, Fessler cannot now set up the log contract as a defence against the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The next matter to be noticed is the relation of Harris to the case. On this point it is sufficient to take Harris\u2019s own answer and his testimony, without entering into the disputed question of Perry\u2019s agency and of actual notice. According to these, when the plaintiff\u2019s bill was served on Harris, he had no title except an unexecuted bargain on which he had paid one instalment of $1000. The remaining one thousand dollars he did not pay until long afterward. The bill was filed May 6th 1867, and served on Harris November 23d 1867, while the second thousand dollars was not paid until October-1869. Harris relied wholly on his agreement of September 14th 1866, and set up no deed either in his answer or his testimony. Indeed, the deed is not referred to in any part of the case. He was, therefore, not such a bond fide purchaser without notice as would be protected, except to the extent of the $1000 paid before service of the bill: Youst <em>v. </em>Martin, 3 S. &amp; R. 423 ; Union Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Young, 1 Wharton 410; Beck <em>v. </em>Ulrich, 1 Harris 636 ; Juvenal <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 Id. 524; Coxe <em>v. </em>Sartwell, 9 Id. 488; Henry <em>v. </em>Raiman, 1 Casey 360; 2 Sugden\u2019s Yen. &amp; Pow., 8 Am. ed. 523. This being the <em>status </em>of Harris when the bill was filed, the legal title being still in Fessler, it was unnecessary to pray for a conveyance from Harris to May. The prayer for an injunction against Harris and his servants to stay waste by cutting timber was the only prayer then necessary. Had Harris set up a deed by supplemental answer, May might have amended under the Act of 4th May 1864, 1 Bright. Dig. 601, pi. 72 ; Danzeisin\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra. </em>It was therefore an error to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s bill wholly as to Harris. The learned judge had probably not noticed the state of the case when the bill was filed, and Harris\u2019s omission to set forth any title in himself. But in view of the report of the master, for compensation only against Harris, a prayer for a conveyance is immaterial. In strictness a reconveyance might have been decreed by making Harris\u2019s grantees, Wells and Page, parties. A bill in equity is <em>Us pendens, </em>of which every one is bound to take notice. This is settled in the well-considered case of Diamond <em>v. </em>Lawrence County, 1 Wright 353, in which the doctrine is fully discussed and the authorities cited by Woodward, J. Page and Wells were, therefore, not innocent pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>chasers without notice. But a court of equity will look to the effect of a decree, and give it such shape as will do equity, and prevent injustice. In view of the relations of Wells and Page to the case, they not being brought in as parties, and to save Harris harmless from damages at their suit, we think the decree for compensation only against Harris is the most equitable and should be approved. The master seems to have weighed the case well and arrived at a judicious conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Upon the whole case the appeal of Philip Gr. Fessler is dismissed, with costs of appeal to Henry W. May; and in the appeal of Henry W. May, we reverse the decree of the court below dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill as to N. 0. Harris, and adopt the report of the master and the decree reported by him, which is hereby confirmed, except as to the time of payment, which, in the case of Philip Gr. Fessler, is fixed at sixty days, and in the case of N. C. Harris at four months from the time of filing this decree. The costs of this appeal to be paid by the defendant P. Gr. Fessler, the costs in the court below to be paid as reported by the master.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-7\">SharswooD' and Mercur, <em>JJ., </em>dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
