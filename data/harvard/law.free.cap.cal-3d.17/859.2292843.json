As will appear, we conclude that he is not entitled to the relief sought and hence that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The principal factual allegations of plaintiff\u2019s petition for writ of mandate are as follows: on July 22, 1972, plaintiff attacked San Diego Police Officer Gosnell as the latter was beating plaintiff\u2019s wife with a nightstick. Plaintiff was arrested for battery, obstructing a police officer, and disturbing the peace, and a criminal complaint was filed charging him with these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Officer Gosnell was thereafter reported for the incident and temporarily suspended from duty. The city attorney decided not to press the charges against plaintiff, and on November 22, 1972, the criminal complaint was dismissed by the municipal court for lack of prosecution. Concurrently therewith plaintiff executed a covenant not to sue, agreeing in consideration of the dismissal not to pursue any claim for damages against Officer Gosnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">At the time of the dismissal plaintiff moved for an order \u201cby way of mandamus\u201d directing all police agencies to erase all records of his arrest. The municipal court denied the\" motion, finding no statutory authority for such an order. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the appellate department of the superior court was dismissed on the ground the ruling was nonappealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Plaintiff then wrote directly to the chief of police and the records custodian of the San Diego Police Department, requesting them to erase his arrest record and refrain from sending it to federal law enforcement agencies. When no action was taken in response, plaintiff filed the present action for writ of mandate in the superior court. He named as respondents the presiding judge of the municipal court and the San Diego Chief of Police and records custodian, and prayed that they be compelled (1) to erase all record of the arrest of July 22, 1972, and (2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>notify all agencies which received a copy of that record that it has been erased, and request them to do likewise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">After a hearing the court found that respondents will not disseminate the record of plaintiff\u2019s arrest to the public in general, and concluded in reliance on <em>Sterling </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 1 [24 Cal.Rptr. 696], that respondents are under no duty to erase or return the record to plaintiff. The court therefore denied the writ, and plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">A writ of mandate will lie only \u201cto compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station; . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.) More particularly, \u201cTwo basic requirements are essential to the issuance of the writ: (I) A clear, present and usually ministerial duty upon the part of the respondent [citations]; and (2).a clear, present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty [citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>County of El Dorado </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 480, 491 [96 Cal.Rptr. 553, 487 P.2d 1193].)  Inasmuch as plaintiff fails to satisfy the first of these requirements, we need not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Plaintiff points to no statute or ordinance\u2014and we have found none\u2014which imposes on respondent presiding judge of the municipal court or on either of respondent police officials \u201ca duty resulting from [his] office\u201d to comply with plaintiff\u2019s demand for erasure or return of the record of his arrest. On the contrary, such an act appears to be forbidden by Government Code section 6200, which provides in pertinent part that \u201cEvery officer having the custody of any record ... or of any paper or proceeding of any court, filed or deposited in any public office, or placed in his hands for any purpose, who is guilty of... wilfully destroying, mutilating, defacing, altering or falsifying, removing or secreting the whole or any part of such record,. . . paper, or proceeding, or who permits any other person to do so,\u201d is punishable by a prison term of up to 14 years. An arrest record is clearly a document which may properly be kept by a public officer in the discharge of his duties, and hence is within the scope of the statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1952) 111 Cal.App.2d 9, 31 [244 P.2d 35].) And inasmuch as no showing of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>intent is required by the statute, an officer who knowingly removes or destroys such a document is punishable even though he acts without a criminal purpose. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 18; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1892) 96 Cal. 171, 175-179 [31 P. 45]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomalty </em>(1910) 14 Cal.App. 224, 229-230 [111 P.513].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Lacking legislative authority, plaintiff turns to two broad constitutional provisions. He asserts that official retention and dissemination of his arrest record violates his right of privacy (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1) and deprives him of due process of law (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a); U.S. Const., 5th &amp; 14th Amends.). He notes that each of the respondents took an oath to uphold the federal and state Constitutions, and he concludes that each therefore has a clear and present duty resulting from his office to prevent the claimed violations. As will appear, the constitutional premises of the argument are faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The right of privacy added to the California Constitution by a 1972 amendment of article I, section 1, is not absolute. In <em>White </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 757, 775 [120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 533 P.2d 222], we observed that \u201cthe amendment does not purport to prohibit all incursion into individual privacy but rather that any such intervention must be justified by a compelling interest.\u201d For example, in <em>County of Nevada </em>v. <em>MacMillen </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 662, 672 [114 Cal.Rptr. 345, 522 P.2d 1345], we held that the right of privacy does not prevail over \u201cthe right of the public to an honest and impartial government,\u201d as implemented by legislation requiring \u00e1 variety of public officials and candidates to disclose their financial interests. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3600 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In the case at bar respondents assert a similar compelling interest in limited retention and dissemination of arrest records. The interest may be characterized generally as the promotion of more efficient law enforcement and criminal justice; more specifically, the state\u2019s purpose is to protect the public from recidivist offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">This interest is manifested at a number of stages of the criminal process. First, at the time of arrest the suspect\u2019s right of privacy is obviously outweighed by the necessity of identifying him correctly, and does not give him the right to refuse to disclose his name and address to the arresting officer. Not only may such information be taken down, it may be immediately put to use: the officer may transmit the data to his headquarters in order to determine whether the arrestee is wanted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>any other charge or is a fugitive, or whether he presents a threat to the officer\u2019s safety. If the arrestee is thereafter transported to the police station and booked, the identification process may lawfully extend to taking his fingerprints and photograph, and recording his vital statistics. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 7, subd. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">In addition, the suspect\u2019s right of privacy is not violated by prompt and accurate public reporting of the facts and circumstances of his arrest: \u201cIt is also generally in the social interest to identify adults currently charged with the commission of a crime. While such an identification may not presume guilt, it may legitimately put others on notice that the named individual is suspected of having committed a crime. Naming the suspect may also persuade eyewitnesses and character witnesses to testify. For these reasons, while the suspect or offender obviously does not consent to public exposure, his right to privacy must give way to the overriding social interest.\u201d <em>(Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 529, 536 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34, 57 A.L.R.3d 1]; see also <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 20, 38 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360,459 P.2d 912].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Next, the information derived from the arrest may be used by the police in several ways for the important purpose of investigating and solving similar crimes in the future. We have held, for example, that a photograph taken pursuant to even an illegal arrest may be included among those shown to a witness who is asked to identify the perpetrator of a subsequent crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McInnis </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 821, 825-826 [100 Cal.Rptr. 618, 494 P.2d 690].) This is a fortiori permissible in the case of a lawful arrest; and the same identification function is served, of course, by the arrestee\u2019s fingerprints and other recorded physical description.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Even if no such direct connection with the later offense can be made, an arrest record may under appropriate conditions be a valuable investigative tool for the discovery of further evidence. Often the prior arrest is not an isolated event but one of a series of arrests of the same individual on the same or related charges. This is especially true when the crime in question is typically subject to recidivism, such as the use of addictive drugs, child molesting, indecent exposure, gambling, bookmaking, passing bad checks, confidence frauds, petty theft, receiving stolen goods, and even some forms of burglary and robbery. In these circumstances a pattern may emerge\u2014for example, a distinctive modus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>operandi\u2014which has independent significance as a basis for suspecting the arrestee if the crime is committed again.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">At the very least, the suspicion thus focussed will justify additional investigation. If it is coupled with independent evidence of criminal involvement, it may amount to probable cause to arrest: \u201cAlthough previous arrests of a suspect in connection with illicit drug transactions will certainly not suffice to constitute probable cause for search or arrest, and while, indeed, arrests without convictions may be of little probative value, still a suspect\u2019s reputation as being involved in illicit drug traffic based on prior arrests may be considered.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buchanan </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 274, 292 [103 Cal.Rptr. 66], and cases cited.) When the investigating officer knows of such a pattern, \u201cthat knowledge can be used, in connection with other information, to support a finding of probable cause for arrest.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 687, 692, fn. 5 [108 Cal.Rptr. 809, 511 P.2d 1161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">While a record of arrests not resulting in conviction is generally inadmissible at trial, it may serve significant functions in both pretrial and post-trial proceedings. First, among the circumstances often taken into account in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is the arrest record of the defendant. For example, prosecutors have considered that record, or information developed therefrom, in deciding whether to file a formal charge against the defendant, or whether to prosecute as a felony or as a misdemeanor a crime which can be either class of offense, or whether to agree to a bargain for a specified penalty or a plea to a lesser offense. In particular, when the defendant is charged with a crime involving possession of narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs, the district attorney is vested with statutory authority to decide whether he is eligible to be \u201cdiverted\u201d into an alternate program of treatment and rehabilitation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1000.) The code requires a determination of ineligibility if the district attorney finds, inter alia, \u201cevidence\u201d that the defendant has a history of narcotics offenses other than simple possession. In <em>Sledge </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 70, 75, footnote 4 [113 Cal.Rptr. 28, 520 P.2d 412], we recognized that such \u201cevidence\u201d may include prior narcotics arrests of the defendant not resulting in a conviction, listed on his rap sheet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>After the defendant has been appropriately charged, the court is usually called upon to determine the question of pretrial release. Again arrest records may be relevant. The form by which the defendant applies to be released on his own recognizance or on bail often provides for him to list his prior arrests and their dispositions. (See, e.g., 1 Cal. Criminal Law Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1964) \u00a7 2.24.) These matters may then be considered by the court in conjunction with all other relevant information, in deciding whether to release the defendant on recognizance or in fixing the appropriate amount of bail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Upon conviction, the case of each eligible felony defendant is referred to the probation officer. That officer must investigate the circumstances of the crime and \u201cthe prior history and record of the person,\u201d and report his findings and recommendations to the court. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203, subd. (a).) Any prior arrest record of the defendant is routinely obtained and included in the report as part of his criminal history. (2 Cal. Criminal Law Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1969) \u00a7\u00a7 18.63, 18.80.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 717, 725-726 [108 Cal.Rptr. 835, 511 P.2d 1187], we reaffirmed the principle that upon conviction, evidence which would be inadmissible on the issue of guilt may be received for the purpose of determining whether and upon what conditions to grant probation, provided the proceedings remain fundamentally fair. For this purpose it has been held that the court may properly consider not only current arrests of the defendant giving rise to charges still pending <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number><em>Escobar </em>(1953) 122 Cal.App.2d 15, 18 [264 P.2d 571]), but also prior arrests which did not result in conviction <em>(People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 296, 298 [240 P.2d 728], and cases cited; but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Calloway </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 905, 908-909 [112 Cal.Rptr. 745] (dictum)). And it has also been held that if the defendant is sentenced to prison, the Adult Authority may take his arrest record into account in determining when to release him on parole. <em>(Azeria </em>v. <em>California Adult Authority </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 1, 5 [13 Cal.Rptr. 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Taken together, the multiple purposes for which police, prosecutors, courts, and probation and parole authorities may consult records of arrests not resulting in conviction thus constitute a substantial governmental interest. (See also Pen. Code, \u00a7 13100, eff. July 1, 1978.) Against this, we must weigh the arrestee\u2019s legitimate concern to protect himself from improper uses of his record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the extensive literature on the topic, the principal dangers are inaccurate or incomplete arrest records, dissemination of arrest records outside the criminal justice system, and reliance on such records as a basis for denying the former arrestee business or professional licensing, employment, or similar opportunities for personal advancement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>We do not underestimate the adverse effects on an individual\u2019s later life if these dangers materialize. But we are convinced that in California the risks have been greatly diminished in recent years by significant legislative and executive action. We shall summarize the principal features of that response.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><em>First. </em>The Legislature has provided in effect that a substantial proportion of arrests not resulting in conviction shall not be recorded as arrests but simply as \u201cdetentions.\u201d Penal Code section 849.5 states that \u201cIn any case in which a person is arrested and released and no accusatory pleading is filed charging him with an offense, . . . the arrest shall not be deemed an arrest, but a detention only.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (See also \u00a7 849, subd. (c).) This directive is implemented by section 851.6, subdivision (b), which declares that in every such instance \u201cthe person shall be issued a certificate by the law enforcement agency which arrested him describing the action as a detention,\u201d and subdivision (d) of the same section, which mandates that \u201cAny reference to the action as an arrest shall be deleted from the arrest records of the arresting agency and of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation of the Department of Justice. Thereafter, any such record of the action shall refer to it as a detention.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"><em>Second. </em>The Legislature has taken a number of steps to insure that a record of arrest or detention be complete, i.e., that it also show the final disposition of the charge. To begin with, the record of any arrest deemed to be a detention must include \u201ca record of release.\u201d (\u00a7 849.5.) More specifically, each law enforcement agency which makes an arrest and reports it to the Department of Justice or the Federal Bureau of Investigation must \u201cfurnish a disposition report to such agencies\u201d whenever the person is transferred to another agency or is released without charges being filed. (\u00a711115.) If the arrest is thus deemed to be a detention only, the disposition report must state \u201cthe specific reason\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>the release, e.g., exoneration of the person detained, withdrawal of the complaint, or insufficient evidence to proceed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">In cases in which formal charges are filed, section 11116 requires the clerk of the court to furnish a disposition report to the law enforcement agency primarily-responsible for investigating the offense. The statute lists no less than 18 possible dispositions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and directs that the report specify as many as are appropriate or \u201cAny other disposition by which the case was terminated.\u201d In addition, the statute provides that when the case is dismissed on any of several general grounds (e.g., pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 995 or 1385) the court shall state not only the disposition label but also \u201cthe particular reasons\u201d for the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Such disposition reports must be forwarded to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation within 30 days after the release of the person arrested or detained or the termination of court proceedings. (\u00a7 11117.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In turn, the Department of Justice must add such reports to \u201call appropriate criminal records\u201d <em>(ibid.; </em>see also \u00a7 11116.6). And each law enforcement agency receiving such a report is required to transmit a copy thereof \u201cto all the bureaus to which arrest data has been furnished.\u201d (\u00a7 11115, last par.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">In addition, a person who is the subject of a disposition report is guaranteed access thereto. In any case in which the offense charged was punishable by imprisonment for more than 90 days, the court upon request must furnish the person with a certificate setting forth the particular ground of disposition. (\u00a7\u00a7 11116.7-11116.9.) And in all cases, the person is granted the right to use the disposition label on his record \u201cas an answer to any question regarding his arrest or detention history or any question regarding the outcome of a criminal proceeding against him.\u201d (\u00a7 11116.5.) We shall see other examples of statutes expressly authorizing a former arrestee to answer \u201cquestions\u201d about his criminal history by reference to the final version of his record.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number><em>Third. </em>The Legislature has created a detailed mechanism whereby the person may inspect all criminal records pertaining to him and maintained by the Department of Justice. (\u00a7\u00a7 11120-11125.) As the individual most directly concerned, he evidently has the most incentive to insure that the record is correct. If he believes any record is inaccurate or incomplete he may request the department to correct it, and the department must forward the request to the agency which originated the information; if that agency agrees the record is inaccurate or incomplete, it must correct it and notify the department to do likewise; if the agency disagrees, the person is entitled to have the dispute resolved by administrative adjudication, followed by judicial review. (\u00a7 11126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><em>Fourth. </em>In a growing number of contexts the Legislature has mandated that at a certain stage of the proceedings arrest records are to be physically sealed. The first group of statutes to authorize this procedure dealt with juvenile offenders. Thus section 851.7 provides that any minor arrested for a misdemeanor is entitled upon request to \u201can order sealing the records in the case, including any records of arrest and detention,\u201d if he was released without formal charge, or the proceedings were subsequently dismissed, or he was acquitted. In that event \u201cthe arrest, detention, and any further proceedings in the case shall be deemed not to have occurred, and the petitioner may answer accordingly any question relating to their occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The same relief is available to any minor convicted of a misdemeanor who has successfully served his sentence or fulfilled the conditions of his parole (\u00a7 1203.45),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or, upon a showing of rehabilitation, to any minor five years after termination of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction over him, or on reaching the age of 18 (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 781).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Recent legislation has extended the remedy of sealing to certain adult defendants. Thus, arrest records and all other documents in the case may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>now be sealed upon request whenever a person charged with any offense has been acquitted and it appears to the judge that he was \u201cfactually innocent\u201d; and in that event, the court must \u201cinform the defendant that he may thereafter state that he was not arrested for such charge and that he was found innocent of such charge by the court.\u201d (\u00a7 851.8.) The clerk of the court is required to report the order of sealing to the Department of Justice (\u00a7 11116, last par.); and upon receipt of that report, the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation must send notice of the sealing to all officers and agencies it had previously advised of the arrest (\u00a7 11105.5).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><em>Fifth. </em>The Legislature has established multiple safeguards against the improper dissemination of arrest records. Section 11076 declares generally the principle that \u201cCriminal offender record information shall be disseminated, whether directly or through any intermedi\u00e1ry, only to such agencies as are, or may subsequently be, authorized access to such records by statute.\u201d (See also \u00a7 11081.) Section 11105 then sets forth two categories of agencies and persons authorized by law to receive criminal record information compiled at the state level by the Attorney General.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The first category is comprised of agencies and persons to whom the Attorney General is required to furnish this information \u201cwhen needed in the course of their duties.\u201d (\u00a7 11105, subd. (b).) It includes the courts, certain classes of peace officers performing traditional law enforcement functions, district attorneys, probation and parole officers, defense attorneys when so authorized, and state or local agencies or officers in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>strictly limited circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The second category is composed of other agencies or officers to whom the Attorney General \u201cmay\u201d furnish this information, but he is permitted to do so only \u201cupon a showing of a compelling need.\u201d (Subd. (c).)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">To enforce these restrictions the Legislature has decreed criminal penalties for unauthorized dissemination of records. It is a misdemeanor for an employee of the Department of Justice (\u00a7 11141) or \u201cAny person authorized by law to receive a record\u201d or information therefrom (\u00a7 11142) to knowingly furnish that record or information to an unauthorized person. Indeed, such materials are virtually treated as contraband, as it is further declared that any unauthorized person who knowingly \u201cbuys, receives, or possesses\u201d such a record or information is also guilty of a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 11143.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, a statutory civil penalty is provided: in all cases in which criminal record information is unlawfully disseminated in violation of sections 11141 to 11143, the injured party may sue to recover his actual damages or $200, whichever is greater, together with costs and attorney\u2019s fees. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 432.7, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">For further implementation the Legislature called upon the expertise of the executive branch. Section 11077 makes the Attorney General \u201cresponsible for the security\u201d of criminal record information, and mandates that he (1) establish regulations to assure that such information shall not be disclosed to unauthorized persons or without a demonstration of necessity, (2) coordinate the California record security program with interstate systems for the exchange of such information, and (3) undertake a continuing educational program of all authorized personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>in the proper use and control of such information. In response the Attorney General created the Criminal Records Security Unit of the Department of Justice, which has promulgated regulations implementing Penal Code sections 11075-11081 (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 11, ch. 1, subch. 7) and conducts repeated training sessions in records security for both state and local agencies. In addition, the Department of Justice has prepared a preliminary plan for compliance with recent federal regulations governing the collection, storage, and dissemination of criminal record information. (28 C.F.R. ch. 1, pt. 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><em>Sixth. </em>The Legislature has moved vigorously to prevent criminal record information from being improperly used as a basis for denying the former arrestee opportunities for personal advancement. These efforts are variously phrased. Among the statutes we have discussed herein, for example, Penal Code section 1000.5 prescribes that the record of a narcotics arrest resulting in successful completion of a diversion program shall not, without the divertee\u2019s consent, \u201cbe used in any way which could result in the denial of any employment, benefit, license, or certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Simultaneously with these particularized enactments, the Legislature has mounted a broader attack on the problem on two fronts. First, it has prohibited the prior practice whereby state and local agencies denied or revoked a business or professional license on the ground that a record of arrest or conviction demonstrated a lack of \u201cgood moral character.\u201d Chapter 1321 of the Statutes of 1974 substantially rewrote the provisions of law governing denial, suspension, and revocation of such licenses. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, div. 1.5.) A license cannot now be denied or revoked because of a lack of \u201cgood moral character\u201d or on any similar ground relating to the applicant\u2019s reputation. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 475, subd. (c).) Indeed, even a conviction can no longer support a denial or revocation of a license unless the crime is \u201csubstantially related to the qualifications, functions or duties of the business or profession\u201d in question. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 480, subd. (a), &amp; 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">To implement the prohibition against denial of license because of an arrest record, the Legislature thereafter decreed that no public agency may \u201cask ... or require\u201d on an initial application form that the applicant reveal any record of arrest not resulting in conviction. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 461.) The section governs applications for \u201cany license, certificate or registration provided for by any law of this state or local government,\u201d and a violation of its command is punishable as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Next, in Labor Code section 432.7 the Legislature extended this technique of prohibiting any inquiry into an applicant\u2019s arrest record from the field of public licensing to the even wider field of public <em>and private </em>employment. Substantially rewritten in 1975, section 432.7 now declares that \u201cNo employer whether a public agency or private individual or corporation shall ask an applicant for employment to disclose, through any written form or verbally, information concerning an arrest or detention which did not result in conviction . . . .\u201d Supplementing this rule, the statute further forbids any employer (1) to \u201cseek\u201d any such record of arrest \u201cfrom any source whatsoever,\u201d and (2) to \u201cutilize\u201d such a record \u201cas a factor in determining any condition of employment including hiring, promotion, termination, or any apprenticeship training program or any other training program leading to employment....\u201d (Subd. (a).)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Various penalties are provided for violation of section 432.7. If an employer unintentionally contravenes its terms, the applicant may bring a civil action against him to recover his actual damages or $200, whichever is greater, together with costs and attorney\u2019s fees; an intentional violation entitles the applicant to treble damages or $500, whichever is greater, plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees. (Subd. (b).) In the latter event the employer is also guilty of a misdemeanor. <em>(Ibid.) </em>And it is again declared illegal to knowingly disclose such information to unauthorized persons \u201cwith intent to affect a person\u2019s employment,\u201d and for unauthorized persons to \u201creceive or possess\u201d such information. (Subd. (f).)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Fourteen years ago, in the only prior reported California decision directly in point, the Court of Appeal rejected an arrestee\u2019s demand for return or destruction of booking photographs and fingerprints after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>misdemeanor charge against her had been dismissed without conviction. <em>(Sterling </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1962) <em>supra, </em>208 Cal.App.2d I.) The court reasoned that regulation of the use and abuse of arrest records was primarily a matter for the Legislature, and found no statute authorizing the relief requested. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 6-7.) The court\u2019s view of the primacy of the legislative branch in this respect has been reiterated in a number of our sister jurisdictions,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and we adopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Plaintiff emphasizes that since the date of <em>Sterling </em>the right <em>of </em>privacy has been accorded increasing recognition, a process culminating in its adoption into our Constitution in 1972. But the Legislature has kept pace with this development. Statutes governing arrest records were scarce at the time of <em>Sterling </em>as the court pointed out; yet in recent years, as we have seen, that scarcity has been remedied by an elaborate structure of complementary and interlocking enactments on the topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We are mindful that some gaps in the structure may still appear. Thus plaintiff contends that the absence of a provision for expungement in his case is just such an oversight. But legislative history strongly suggests the omission was deliberate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In these circumstances we should defer to the implied determination of the lawmakers that the compelling state interests identified hereinabove outweigh the speculative significance of a dismissal \u201cfor lack of prosecution,\u201d a disposition which may be predicated on many grounds other than factual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Indeed, even if the absence of an expungement provision in this connection were unintentional, we should nevertheless allow the Legislature to address in the first instance the difficult task of striking the proper balance between these competing concerns. There is no reason to believe that task will long go unfilled, as the Legislature has demonstrated a continuing desire and ability to fashion statutoiy responses to legitimate demands for privacy of the arrestee. In either event, therefore, judicial intervention is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>We need not lengthen this opinion by discussing each of the authorities relied on by plaintiff. Some are distinguishable because they arise in jurisdictions which lack a body of protective legislation such as California now enjoys,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> while others additionally involve wholesale arrests of unpopular groups for purposes of harassment\u2014clearly not a lawful state interest.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On the other hand, since the date of <em>Sterling </em>numerous state and federal courts have reaffirmed the rule that limited retention and dissemination of arrest records does not violate the right of privacy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, we join those jurisdictions and hold that the trial court properly denied the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Sullivan, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The remainder of the prayer is ambiguous. It states, \u201cor in the alternative return to petitioner all evidence of said arrest record and henceforth desist from dissemination of any information in its regard . . . .\u201d It is unclear whether this alternative is directed to respondents or to the agencies which received a copy of plaintiff\u2019s arrest record. In view of our disposition herein, the question is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Even a juvenile arrest or detention record, declared by statute to be confidential and immune from disclosure to prospective employers and other third parties, may serve an important function in evidencing a pattern of suspicious behavior in appropriate cases. In <em>T. N. G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 767 [94 Cal.Rptr. 813, 484 P.2d 981], two juveniles were taken into custody for loitering near a school in violation of Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>section 653g, but were released in a few hours without charges being filed. We sustained the trial court\u2019s denial of a petition to seal the records of the detention without waiting the statutory five years (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 781), holding that their confidentiality was sufficiently protected in the interim by numerous provisions of the Juvenile Court Law. We recognized that if the petitioners had been similarly released after being charged as adults, they would have been entitled to immediate sealing (Pen. Code, \u00a7 851.7); but we rejected their claim of violation of equal protection, reasoning that \u201cA legitimate and substantial interest supports the policy of permitting juvenile court personnel to retain information about a juvenile\u2019s detention, even when such detention does not result in a wardship proceeding. In such a case the retention of the record of detention still rests upon a rehabilitative purpose. As the juvenile court'in the instant matter pointed out, the detention record will assist the court\u2019s personnel in assessing any later conduct by the juvenile. A single incident may not reveal a pattern of behavior which would require action by the juvenile court. But the past record of the juvenile with the juvenile court may enable a probation officer to recognize a development which requires informal probation, a petition for wardship, or other appropriate treatment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 783.) We summed up the point by stating that \u201cthe retention of the records of <em>even the innocent </em>juvenile serves certain salutaiy purposes.\u201d (Italics added; <em>id., </em>at p. 771.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b881-6\">In fixing the amount of bail the court is directed by statute to take into account \u201cthe previous criminal record of the defendant.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1275.) And Penal Code section 1204.5 prohibits the court, prior to a plea or finding of guilty, from considering \u201cany information reflecting the arrest or conviction record of a defendant\u201d <em>except </em>in connection with \u201cany application for an order fixing or changing bail____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b882-5\">This concern appears to be the nub of plaintiff\u2019s vaguely worded claim of a potential denial of due process of law.

G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) <em>supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 767, 779.) But the stigma may be measurably less when the person is an adult; and in any event, we cite the above sections of the Penal Code as only one of several legislative efforts to minimize the possible adverse consequences of an arrest record on a person\u2019s later life. Other statutory developments discussed hereinafter may well be more effective in achieving this goal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">On various grounds these dispositions include compromise, suspension of proceedings, dismissal, discharge, acquittal, conviction, mistrial, and arrest of judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b884-8\">As of July 1, 1978, all court dispositions will be required to be reported to the Department of Justice by the appropriate agency within 10 days.
