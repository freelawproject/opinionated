Petitioner was admitted to practice law in California in 1943 and has no prior discipline record.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Petitioner is charged with three counts of misconduct: misappropriating clients\u2019 funds and commingling them with his own;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> writing to a judge on the merits of a pending case without furnishing a copy of the letters to opposing counsel;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and engaging in offensive personality, coupled with a lack of respect for a judicial officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The charges arose out of two separate incidents. In the first, petitioner negotiated a $5,600 personal injury damage settlement on behalf of three clients, and deposited the money in a trust account. He deducted his fee and paid his clients from the settlement fund, but withheld $353.65 in order to satisfy a claim by a doctor for treatment of one of petitioner\u2019s clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Petitioner issued a check to the doctor, but because of a misplacement in the mails the physician did not receive the check for almost a year. During the period prior to the doctor\u2019s receipt of the check, the balance in petitioner\u2019s trust account fell below $353.65 several times. Indeed, on 13 different occasions the account was overdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">In addition, petitioner admitted that from time to time he used funds from the trust account to pay personal business expenses. He replenished the account not only with personal funds, but also with proceeds of settlement funds belonging to other clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The other matter revolved around petitioner\u2019s representation of a plaintiff in a wrongful death action. While the case was proceeding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>trial, attorneys for the defendants submitted a single interrogatory. Following prolonged failure by petitioner\u2019s client to answer the interrogatory, even after being ordered to do so by the court, Judge Ira A. Brown of the superior court dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Shortly thereafter, petitioner, on behalf of his client, filed the one-word answer \u201cno\u201d to the interrogatory, and moved to vacate the dismissal. Judge Brown ordered the dismissal vacated on condition that petitioner personally pay to the defendants $600 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Petitioner thereupon embarked on a letter-writing campaign to convince Judge Brown to annul the $600 penalty. In all, petitioner sent the judge four letters asking for relief. In no instance did he send a copy of the letters to opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">While the first communication was worded cautiously, petitioner\u2019s remarks became more intemperate in succeeding letters. In the third letter, for example, he labeled the judge\u2019s ruling a \u201csavage reprisal,\u201d and impliedly threatened to campaign against him in the next election. The final letter began with the salutation \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d and stated in part, \u201cI have explained to you in careful detail that this penalty involves taking food from the mouths of my little children. I am unable to comply with your edict. Your intransigence in this matter strongly suggests the valor common to draft dodgers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In addition to the private letters to Judge Brown, petitioner also wrote to a state senator, sending a copy of the letter to the judge. In that letter he declared he would be unable to contribute to the senator\u2019s political campaign because of the judge\u2019s ruling, and referred to the \u201crude insulting, hostile manner of Judge Brown at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The court rejected all of petitioner\u2019s entreaties, and two motions to vacate the order assessing the penalties\u2014on the ground of personal financial hardship to petitioner\u2014were denied. According to a finding of the local administrative committee, petitioner\u2019s client suffered no harm from petitioner\u2019s refusal to pay the $600 as a condition to vacating the dismissal, because a companion case involving the same accident resulted in a jury verdict which was \u201cres judicata as far as the subject case [is concerned].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>We turn now to a review of the board\u2019s recommendations, noting initially that the burden is on the petitioner to show that the board\u2019s recomrnendation is erroneous or unlawful. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 424, 429 [113 Cal.Rptr. 478]; <em>Sevin </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 641, 645 [105 Cal.Rptr. 513, 504 P.2d 449].)  Petitioner\u2019s only defense to the commingling charge is that no client has ever lost money because of petitioner\u2019s improper use of the trust fund. In making this argument, however, he misconstrues the nature of the present proceeding. Actual financial detriment to a client is not the crucial element in a disciplinary proceeding, which seeks to determine not the extent of the damage caused by the attorney but whether his conduct was unprofessional. <em>(Zitny </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 787, 792-793 [51 Cal.Rptr. 825, 415 P.2d 521]; see also <em>Sodikoff v. State Bar </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 422, 431 [121 Cal.Rptr. 467, 535 P.2d 311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">This point is particularly significant with regard to a violation of rule 9. As we have stated before, the prohibition against commingling was adopted \u201cto provide against the probability in some cases, the possibility in many cases, and the danger in all cases that such commingling will result in the loss of clients\u2019 money.\u201d <em>(Peck </em>v. <em>The State Bar </em>(1932) 217 Cal. 47, 51 [17 P.2d 112].) That no harm may result from commingling in a particular case is mere fortuity. An attorney who, like petitioner, spends trust fund money for his personal use, runs the risk that an unexpected contingency\u2014such as a sudden illness\u2014will prevent him from replenishing the fund. And, \u201cas far as the client is concerned the result is the same whether his money is deliberately misappropriated by an attorney or is unintentionally lost by circumstances beyond the control of the attorney.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, neither good faith nor restitution is a defense to a commingling charge. <em>(Silver </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 134, 145 [117 Cal.Rptr. 821, 528 P.2d 1157]; <em>Sevin </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1973) <em>supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 641, 646.) The board properly found that petitioner\u2019s activities constituted a violation of former rule 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We also agree with the board that petitioner is culpable for failing to send to opposing counsel copies of the letters written to Judge Brown. Petitioner asserts that former rule 16 did not require him to do so because the messages did not concern \u201cthe merits of a contested matter.\u201d He claims the letters \u201ccontained no reference to the issues involved in the case,\u201d and, as the suit had been dismissed by the court, there was no longer a contested matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Petitioner misconstrues both the status of the subject case and the rationale behind former rule 16. At the time he wrote the letters to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>judge, the issues in the case involved not only questions of liability for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband, but also the validity of a dismissal ordered because of petitioner\u2019s failure to respond to the defendants\u2019 single interrogatory. Thus, petitioner\u2019s letters arguing that the dismissal should be unconditionally vacated clearly concerned the merits of the case, which were still being contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Equally important, petitioner violated the spirit as well as the text of rule 16. Like rule 12, which prohibited an attorney from communicating with an opposing party in the absence of the party\u2019s counsel, rule 16 \u201cwas designed to permit an attorney to function adequately in his proper role and to prevent the opposing attorney from impeding his performance in such role.\u201d <em>(Mitton </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 525, 534 [78 Cal.Rptr. 649, 455 P.2d 753].) It is, in essence, a rule of fairness meant to insure that all interested sides will be heard on an issue. When petitioner wrote his first letter to the judge, he knew or should have known that the defendants and their counsel would be interested in any request to vacate a dismissal and an order requiring payment to them of $600. Any doubt he may have had should have been resolved when Judge Brown wrote back to him, \u201cSince your letter does not indicate that a copy was sent to opposing counsel, I am sending them a copy of your letter together with this one.\u201d In reply to petitioner\u2019s second letter, the judge reiterated that \u201call requests for such action should be by written notice of motion with a copy to the other parties involved.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s refusal, after two unmistakable warnings, to send copies of his correspondence to opposing counsel demonstrates a brazen disregard of his professional duties. The board\u2019s findings on this issue are fully supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The issue is somewhat closer on whether the board is correct in concluding that petitioner should be disciplined pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6068 for the particular language he used in his letters to Judge Brown. On this point we note that five members of the board disagreed with the board\u2019s findings, four of them on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We need not decide the validity of petitioner\u2019s constitutional contentions. The vice of petitioner\u2019s letters to the judge was not so much in the gross tastelessness of their prose, but in their apparent intent to improperly induce the annulment of an order properly made. The appropriate means for seeking to persuade a judge to change a decision is by a motion to be heard in open court, with an opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>opposing counsel to air his views. Petitioner\u2019s wilful failure to comply with such an elementary principle of fairness is already dealt with, however, in the board\u2019s finding that he violated former rule 16. Therefore, little would be added by further discussion of petitioner\u2019s letters, particularly because the board was adequately justified in recommending discipline solely on the basis of the violations of rules 9 and 16. Under these circumstances the violation of Business and Professions Code section 6068 is redundant to the rule 16 charge, and we do not find petitioner to have been guilty thereof. In disposing of the issue in this manner, however, we by no means condone petitioner\u2019s offensive and totally unwarranted attack against a member of the bench; rather, we condemn such unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">We turn now to the question of the severity of the discipline that should be imposed. The local administrative committee recommended that petitioner be suspended from the practice of law for two years, on conditions of probation and with thirty days actual suspension. The disciplinary board recommended a one-year suspension, also on conditions of probation but with no actual suspension. Four members dissented, two because they believed the recommended discipline too lenient and two because they felt it was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We attach great weight to the recommendation of the disciplinary board, but it is not binding on us. We may impose more severe discipline when it is warranted. <em>(Greenbaum </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 893, 904 [126 Cal.Rptr. 785, 544 P.2d 921]; <em>Sodikoff </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1975) <em>supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 422, 432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We are not unmindful of the mitigating facts in the present case. Petitioner for more than 30 years has sustained no disciplinary record, and has been active in community affairs. Moreover, none of his offenses appears to involve intentional dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Yet he has committed two serious violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, each of which by itself would merit discipline. While petitioner, after the administrative committee hearing, apologized to Judge Brown for the intemperate nature of his letters to him, there is little indication that petitioner yet realizes the gravity of his violations of former rules 9 and 16. In view of the seriousness of these offenses we have concluded that the board\u2019s recommended discipline is inadequate, and adopt instead the recommendation of the local administrative committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>It is ordered that petitioner be suspended from the practice of law for two years; that execution of the order of suspension be stayed, and that he be placed on probation for said period of two years upon condition that he be actually suspended for the first thirty days. During the remaining period of probation he shall comply with the conditions recommended by the disciplinary board, except that petitioner will not be required to certify in his first quarterly report to the State Bar that he has read the State Bar Act and the Rules of Professional Conduct; in lieu of that requirement, we further order as a condition of probation that within one year after the effective date of this order petitioner pass the Professional Responsibility Examination. (See <em>Segretti </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 878, 891, fn. 8 [126 Cal.Rptr. 793, 544 P.2d 929].) This order is effective 30 days after the filing of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">At the time of petitioner\u2019s alleged misconduct, rule 9 of the Rules of Professional Conduct provided, in relevant part, \u201cA member of the State Bar shall not commingle the money or other property of a client with his own; and he shall promptly report to the client the receipt by him of all money and other property belonging to such client.
