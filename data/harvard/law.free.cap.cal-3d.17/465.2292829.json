(See, e.g., <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 541 [116 Cal.Rptr. 245, 526 P.2d 253]; <em>Ascherman </em>v. <em>San Francisco Medical Society </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 623 [114 Cal.Rptr. 681].) In the instant case we must decide, in the light of these recent decisions, what procedural requisites, if any, a doctor who has been deprived of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>hospital privileges must fulfill before he may institute a tort action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude initially that before a doctor may initiate litigation challenging the propriety of a hospital\u2019s denial or withdrawal of privileges, he must exhaust the available internal remedies afforded by the hospital. As we explain, this exhaustion of remedies principle has long been applied in suits attacking the actions of comparable \u201cprivate associations,\u201d and we conclude that the doctrine applies when a doctor sues in tort for monetary damages as well as when he seeks a judicial order compelling reinstatement or admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We further conclude that whenever a hospital, pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding, reaches. a decision to deny staff privileges, an aggrieved doctor must first succeed in setting aside the quasi-judicial decision in a mandamus action before he may institute a tort action for damages. As we point out, mandate has been the traditional means for reviewing analogous quasi-judicial determinations, and we believe that before hospital board or committee members are subjected to potential personal liability for actions taken in a quasi-judicial setting, an aggrieved doctor should be required to overturn the challenged quasi-judicial decision directly in a mandamus action. At the same time, however, we reject defendants\u2019 broad contention that a hospital and its board or committee members enjoy an absolute immunity from tort liability whenever by a quasi-judicial proceeding they deny hospital privileges; once the hospital\u2019s quasi-judicial decision has been found improper in a mandate action, an excluded doctor may proceed in tort against the hospital, its board or committee members or any others legally responsible for the denial of staff privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">1. <em>The facts of the instant case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In September 1974, plaintiff, Dr. Sarah Kaiman, instituted the underlying action against two private hospitals, Westlake Community Hospital (Westlake) and Los Robles Hospital (Los Robles), as well as numerous individual members of the hospitals\u2019 boards and committees. Dr. Kaiman\u2019s complaint alleged that she is a qualified doctor \u201cwhose professional ethics and qualifications are of the highest calibre,\u201d that she has been engaged in the private practice of medicine for <em>2516 </em>years, that she is licensed to practice medicine in 4 states and has been licensed to practice medicine in California since March 1971. The complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>further alleged that Dr. Kalman had been accorded staff privileges at Westlake in December 1972 but that on November 28, 1973, the hospital revoked all of her staff privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">According to the complaint, Dr. Kaiman\u2019s revocation from Westlake was the result of a malicious conspiracy, engineered by all of the named defendants in order to destroy Dr. Kaiman\u2019s medical practice and to restrain competition in order to benefit each member of the conspiracy; the complaint alleged that in furtherance of the conspiracy defendants deliberately concealed the truth as to her qualifications to practice her profession. The complaint additionally alleged that the revocation of her privileges at Westlake \u201cwas pursued and perfected in a manner contrary to established principles of fairness and justice,\u201d and contrary to Westlake\u2019s own bylaws and constitution. Finally, the complaint alleged that Westlake and its board and committee members had maliciously conspired with Los Robles and certain of its board and committee members, and that, pursuant to such conspiracy, Los Robles had improperly denied Dr. Kaiman\u2019s application for staff membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On the basis of the foregoing allegations, the complaint asserted that plaintiff was entitled to substantial general and exemplary damages on a number of distinct theories: (1) intentional and unlawful interference with the right to pursue and practice a lawful calling and trade; (2) conspiracy to restrain competition; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (4) fraud and deceit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint did not seek either reinstatement to staff privileges at Westlake or the admission to staff privileges at Los Robles.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Several months thereafter, Westlake and the individual defendants associated with Westlake filed the motion for summary judgment which is at issue in the instant proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of the motion, defendants submitted numerous affidavits, some pertaining to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>revocation of plaintiff\u2019s staff privileges at Westlake (\u201cWestlake affidavits\u201d) and others relating to the denial of plaintiff\u2019s application for membership at Los Robles (\u201cLos Robles affidavits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">In brief, the Westlake affidavits declared that between October 31, 1973, and November 20, 1973, an ad hoc committee composed of the chief of staff and two other doctors reviewed the hospital medical records and treatments of Dr. Kaiman and prepared a report for the hospital\u2019s credentials committee recommending the revocation of all of Dr. Kaiman\u2019s medical staff privileges; on November 20, the credentials committee considered the report, approved the recommendation and forwarded it to Westlake\u2019s board of directors, which subsequently approved the recommendation of revocation on November 28, 1973. The following day, the hospital notified Dr. Kaiman of its decision to revoke her privileges, informed her of her right under the hospital bylaws to request a quasi-judicial hearing before a judicial review committee, and advised her that she could continue to treat patients currently hospitalized until their discharge but that written consultation by another member of the hospital staff would be required as to treatment of new patients admitted to the hospital pending her hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Westlake affidavits further stated that a week later, Dr. Kaiman requested a hearing pursuant to the hospital\u2019s bylaws and that on January 31, 1974, a hearing took place before the hospital\u2019s judicial review committee. At the hearing, counsel appeared and represented both the executive committee of the hospital and Dr. Kaiman, both parties called witnesses and introduced documentary evidence, and the entire proceedings were transcribed by certified reporters; the hearing lasted approximately five hours. On March 20, 1974, the hospital informed Dr. Kaiman that the judicial review committee had determined that her staff privileges should be revoked, advising her of her right to appeal the decision to the hospital\u2019s board of directors at a meeting scheduled for that purpose on March 27, 1974. Dr. Kaiman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>appeared before the board of directors on March 27 and presented her objections to the decision of the judicial review committee; the board of directors affirmed the decision of the judicial review committee and so notified Dr. Kaiman.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In addition to setting forth the foregoing chronology of events, the Westlake affidavits quoted a provision of the Westlake bylaws which reads in relavant part: \u201cEach member of, or applicant to the Medical and Dental Staff, waives any right of personal redress against the Medical and Dental Staff, the Judicial Review Committee, the Governing Board, or any member thereof, for disciplinary action taken under this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The Los Robles affidavits related an entirely distinct chronology of events. According to these affidavits, Dr. Kaiman had been admitted to membership on the \u201ccourtesy staff\u201d of Los Robles in December 1972, but had resigned from such membership in June 1973. On March 1, 1974, Dr. Kaiman filed a new application for admission to the Los Robles staff. From March 13, 1974, to May 10, 1974, the Los Robles staff contacted the references included in Dr. Kaiman\u2019s application and discovered information which contradicted some of the statements which Dr. Kaiman had made in her application concerning positions which she had previously held at other hospitals. The affidavits also disclosed that the hospital received additional information from a local physician with whom Dr. Kaiman had previously practiced which raised doubts as to Dr. Kaiman\u2019s professional competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">On May 10, 1974, the Los Robles medical committee formally considered Dr. Kaiman\u2019s application and, according to the affidavits, determined that regardless of the outcome of Dr. Kaiman\u2019s dispute with Westlake, her application for membership at Los Robles should be denied because of the information disclosed by Los Robles\u2019 own investigation of her qualifications. Subsequently both the medical executive committee and the Los Robles board of trustees concurred in this decision, and on June 24, 1974, the hospital informed Dr. Kaiman that her application for membership had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Although the Los Robles affidavits do not indicate that the hospital ever informed Dr. Kaiman of the reason for her rejection or that she had any right to obtain a quasi-judicial review of the decision within the hospital hierarchy, one affidavit quotes a provision of the Los Robles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>\u201cConstitution and By Laws\u201d which assertedly afforded her such a right. The section provides in full: \u201cA member failing of appointment shall have the right of appeal to the Medical Executive Committee.\u201d According to this affidavit, Dr. Kaiman never appealed the denial of her application to the medical executive committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In moving for summary judgment, defendants asserted that the foregoing affidavits conclusively established the invalidity of plaintiff\u2019s suit with respect to the events at both hospitals. Insofar as Dr. Kaiman\u2019s action rested on the impropriety of her exclusion from Los Robles, defendants claimed that the affidavits demonstrated that she had failed to exhaust an available \u201cprivate administrative\u201d remedy and thus could not presently challenge the Los Robles exclusion in a judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">With respect to the Westlake revocation, defendants contended that plaintiff\u2019s action was barred on three separate grounds. First, defendants claimed that the \u201cwaiver of redress\u201d provision of the Westlake bylaws quoted above was effective to bar any recovery by plaintiff arising from the termination of staff privileges at the hospital. Second, they claimed that because the affidavits demonstrated that the revocation at Westlake was undertaken pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding, the actions of both the hospital and the individual members of its boards with respect to such revocation fell within the absolute privilege afforded by Civil Code section 47, subdivision 2. Third and finally, defendants asserted that even if either the hospital or its board members could be held liable for damages arising from the revocation under some circumstances, plaintiff could not \u201ccollaterally attack\u201d the hospital\u2019s revocation decision by a tort action, but could only seek damages after she had succeeded in a \u201cdirect attack\u201d on the quasi-judicial hospital decision in a mandamus proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Although plaintiff filed two counteraffidavits in response to the summary judgment motion, neither affidavit contested any of the factual assertions in the defendants\u2019 affidavits. Instead, the counteraffidavits simply reiterated plaintiff\u2019s allegations that the denial of staff privileges at both hospitals emanated from defendants\u2019 malicious conspiracy to interfere with plaintiff\u2019s practice of her profession, and that the Westlake and Los Robles procedures did not comply with general principles of fairness. Plaintiff resisted summary judgment on the ground that the competing affidavits revealed a disputed question of fact, namely, whether defendants had acted maliciously in denying plaintiff staff privileges at the two hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>After reviewing the parties\u2019 affidavits and briefs, the trial court denied by minute order defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Thereupon, defendants filed the instant proceeding, seeking a writ of prohibition to restrain the court from proceeding with the civil action. (See <em>American Society of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 207 Cal.App.2d 676, 679 [24 Cal.Rptr. 772].) As noted above, we granted a hearing to determine what procedural prerequisites, if any, a doctor who has been denied hospital staff privileges must pursue before he may maintain an action for damages resulting from such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">2. <em>Although a plaintiff is required to exhaust all available internal remedies provided by an association before he may seek damages arising from expulsion or exclusion, defendants\u2019 affidavits do not establish either that the Los Robles bylaws afforded plaintiff such a remedy or that the hospital informed plaintiff of the availability of a review procedure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We turn initially to the defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff may not seek recovery for damages resulting from her exclusion from Los Robles because she failed to exhaust the available internal administrative remedies afforded-by the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">As we explained in our second <em>Pinsker </em>decision, recent cases sanctioning judicial review of admission and exclusion practices of various professional associations and hospitals reflect the contemporary application of common law principles embodied in California decisions for almost a century. (See <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 541, 550-554.) From the earliest decisions reviewing actions of voluntary private associations, in which judicial review typically focused on the actions of fraternal or benevolent societies, our courts have recognized the applicability of the exhaustion of remedies doctrine in this context. (See, e.g., <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Lodge, I.O.O.F. </em>(1895) 110 Cal. 297, 307-308 [42 P. 887]; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Templar Lodge, I.O.O.F. </em>(1897) 117 Cal. 370, 375-376 [49 P. 170]; <em>Neto </em>v. <em>Conselho Amor, etc. </em>(1912) 18 Cal.App. 234, 238 [122 P. 973].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">In <em>Holderby </em>v. <em>Internat. Union etc. Engrs. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 843, 846 [291 P.2d 463], a plaintiff, without pursuing the internal appellate remedies of a labor union, sought reinstatement and damages after an alleged unlawful exclusion. This court explained: \u201cIt is the general and well established jurisdictional rule that a plaintiff who seeks judicial relief against an organization of which he is a member must first invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>and exhaust the remedies provided by that organization applicable to his grievance. [Citations.] This rule is analogous to the rule requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a condition precedent to resorting to the courts [citation] and to the rule requiring the parties to a contract for arbitration of disputes to exhaust those remedies before seeking judicial relief. [Citations.] Such rules . . * make possible the settlement of such matters by simple, expeditious and inexpensive procedures, and by persons who, generally, are familiar therewith. Such internal remedies are designed not only to promote the settlement of grievances but also to promote more harmonious relationships, and the courts look with favor upon them.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Although plaintiff acknowledges that the exhaustion of remedies doctrine has frequently been applied in matters relating to the actions of private associations, she contends that the doctrine is only applicable when an individual seeks reinstatement or admission<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to an organization and should not be applied to bar her tort action for damages. While early decisions in other jurisdictions frequently declined to apply the exhaustion doctrine to damage actions on the grounds that a private organization\u2019s internal review procedures generally did not provide a damage remedy (see, e.g., <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen </em>v. <em>Barnhill </em>(1926) 214 Ala. 565 [108 So. 456, 462]; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Samson Lodge, K.P. </em>(1885) 102 Ind. 262 [1 N.E. 571, 575-576]), contemporary out-of-state authorities have generally rejected this analysis and have refused to recognize an exception to the exhaustion requirement in the case of damage actions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>(See, e.g., <em>Kopke </em>v. <em>Ranney </em>(1962) 16 Wis.2d 369 [114 N.W.2d 485, 487-489]; <em>Falsetti </em>v. <em>Local Union etc. </em>(1960) 400 Pa. 145 [161 A.2d 882, 890].)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Although no prior California case has explicitly analyzed this issue, our court in <em>Holderby </em>v. <em>Internat. Union etc. Engrs., supra, </em>45 Cal.2d 843, implicitly endorsed the position adopted by the more recent out-of-state cases by dismissing, for failure to exhaust internal remedies, an action which sought both reinstatement <em>and damages. </em>(See also <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>The Salvation Army </em>(1942) 49 Cal.App.2d 371 [121 P.2d 847]; cf. <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Screwman\u2019s Ben. Ass\u2019n </em>(1893) 2 Tex.Civ.App. 66 [21 S.W. 562].) The <em>Holderby </em>majority reached this result in the face of the dissenting opinion\u2019s explicit argument that, at a minimum, the exhaustion doctrine should not constitute a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s damage claim. (See 45 Cal.2d at pp. 850-851 (Carter, J. dissenting).)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Plaintiff accurately notes that in the instant case, unlike <em>Holderby, </em>she seeks only damages, not reinstatement and damages. Nevertheless, the policy considerations which support the imposition of a general exhaustion requirement remain compelling in this context. In the first place, even if a plaintiff no longer wishes to be either reinstated or admitted to the organization, an exhaustion of remedies requirement serves the salutary function of eliminating or mitigating damages. If an organization is given the opportunity quickly to determine through the operation of its internal procedures that it has committed error, it may be able to minimize, and sometimes eliminate, any monetary injury to the plaintiff by immediately reversing its initial decision and affording the aggrieved party all membership rights; an individual should not be permitted to increase damages by foregoing available internal remedies. (See Summers, <em>Legal Limitations on Union Discipline </em>(1951) 64 Harv.L.Rev. 1049, 1089.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Moreover, by insisting upon exhaustion even in these circumstances, courts accord recognition to the \u201cexpertise\u201d of the organization\u2019s quasi-judicial tribunal, permitting it to adjudicate the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the first instance. (See <em>id.) </em>Finally, even if the absence of an internal damage remedy makes ultimate resort to the courts inevitable (see <em>Developments in the Law-Private Associations </em>(1963) 76 Harv.L.Rev. 983, 1075), the prior administrative proceeding will still promote judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence and by providing a record which the court may review.  Accordingly, we conclude that the exhaustion of remedies doctrine fully applies to actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>seeking damages for an allegedly wrongful termination of or exclusion from membership in a private association. (See <em>Kopke </em>v. <em>Ranney, supra, </em>16 Wis.2d 369 [114 N.W.2d 485].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Having reached this conclusion, we must determine if defendants\u2019 affidavits in fact establish that Dr. Kaiman\u2019s action arising out of the events at Los Robles is barred under the exhaustion doctrine so as to entitle defendants to summary judgment. (See <em>Zepeda </em>v. <em>Internal. Hodcarriers\u2019 etc. Union </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 609, 614 [300 P.2d 251].) As noted above, in contending that Dr. Kaiman failed to exhaust an available administrative remedy, defendants rely solely on one provision. of the Los Robles bylaws which provides in full: \u201cA <em>member </em>failing of <em>appointment </em>shall have the right to appeal to the Medical Executive Committee.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Although defendants assert that this provision affords <em>an applicant who is denied membership </em>a right of appeal, at the very least the language of the provision (affording a right of appeal only to \u201cmembers\u201d) is ambiguous. Defendants\u2019 affidavits fail to clarify this point; defendants cite no provision of the bylaws defining either the term \u201cmember\u201d or \u201cappointment.\u201d On this state of the record, we cannot say that defendants have demonstrated as a matter of law that plaintiff failed to exhaust an internal remedy which was available to her (cf. <em>Petermann </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 184, 191-192 [344 P.2d 25]); accordingly, they were not entitled to summary judgment on this ground. (See <em>American Society of Composers, Authors &amp; Publishers </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.2d 676, 690-691.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Moreover, defendants\u2019 affidavits fail in another respect. Although the relevant affidavit states that Dr. Kaiman had not appealed her rejection to the Los Robles medical executive committee, it does not indicate that the hospital ever informed Dr. Kaiman that she had any such right under the hospital\u2019s bylaws. In our recent <em>Pinsker </em>decision we explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u201cit is permissible for an association to initially reject an applicant Without explanation, so long as the association clearly indicates to the applicant that, if he desires, the association will inform him of the reason for the rejection and will afford him an opportunity to respond.\u201d (12 Cal.3d at p. 555, fn. 13.) Inasmuch as the present affidavits do not indicate that Los Robles ever informed Dr. Kaiman that she had any right to contest the denial of membership privileges within the hospital\u2019s own hierarchy, defendants cannot rely on plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to exhaust such remedies to bar her action. (See <em>Detroy </em>v. <em>American Guild of Variety Artists </em>(2d Cir. 1961) 286 F.2d 75, 80-81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Defendants contend, alternatively, that even if the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies does not bar plaintiff\u2019s tort action with respect to the events at Los Robles, the trial court should still have granted their motion for summary judgment as to Los Robles because plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy is to challenge the Los Robles exclusion by a writ of mandate, rather than in a tort action for damages. As we discuss, <em>infra, </em>we do conclude that when a hospital excludes or dismisses a doctor from staff privileges pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding, the aggrieved doctor must initially succeed in a mandamus action before pursuing a tort remedy. Plaintiff\u2019s exclusion at Los Robles however, was not undertaken pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding; the hospital did not inform plaintiff of the reason for her exclusion nor did it notify her of a right to respond to the charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Under similar circumstances in <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Santa Ana etc. Hospital Assn., supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 806, our court upheld an aggrieved doctor\u2019s right directly to institute a tort action for damages resulting from the exclusion; we reaffirm the <em>Willis </em>holding today. When a hospital denies staff privileges to a doctor without affording him the basic procedural protection to which he is legally entitled, the hospital and parties acting in concert with the hospital can offer no convincing reason or justification why they should be insulated from an immediate tort suit for damages. (See also <em>Ascherman </em>v. <em>San Francisco Medical Society, supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 623, 650-651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to tne events at Los Robles Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">3. <em>Although the Westlake defendants do not enjoy an absolute immunity from liability, either by virtue of the hospital\u2019s bylaws or Civil Code </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>section 47, subdivision 2, plaintiff cannot maintain a damage action against the hospital or individual board members who participated in the quasi-judicial revocation proceedings until she has succeeded in setting aside the revocation in a mandamus proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">We turn now to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the events at Westlake hospital. Defendants\u2019 own affidavits reveal, of course, that plaintiff did fully exhaust all available internal remedies at Westlake and defendants make no claim that they are entitled to summary judgment with respect to the Westlake matter on the basis of the exhaustion doctrine discussed above. Defendants do contend, however, that summary judgment should have been granted with respect to the events at Westlake on the basis of three separate theories. We discuss each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">(a) <em>The Westlake bylaws.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">First, defendants rely upon one provision of the Westlake \u201cConstitution and Bylaws\u201d which they assert precludes plaintiff from seeking any recovery for losses occasioned by the termination of her staff privileges at the hospital. As noted above, the relevant section provides in part: \u201cEach member of, or applicant to, the Medical and Dental Staff, waives any right of personal redress against the Medical and Dental Staff, the Judicial Review Committee, the Governing Board or any member thereof, for disciplinary action taken under this Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Although some early California decisions indicated that comparable bylaws could be effective to preclude any judicial action by an aggrieved member against a private association (see <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Lodge, I.O.O.F., supra, </em>110 Cal. 297, 309-310; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Templar Lodge, I.O.O.F., supra, </em>117 Cal. 370, 374-375), more recent decisions of this court clearly demonstrate that an exculpatory clause of this nature transgresses public policy and cannot bar a plaintiff\u2019s access to the courts. Initially, insofar as the provision in question purports to bar a plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the <em>intentional </em>wrongdoing of the hospital or its staff, as is alleged in the instant case, Civil Code section 1668 leaves no doubt that the provision is invalid, for the section provides in relevant part: \u201cAll contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another... are against the policy of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Moreover, even as applied to nonwillful injuries inflicted by the hospital, we think the clause is invalid in light of the reasoning of <em>Tunkl </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1963) 60 Cal.2d 92 [32 Cal.Rptr. 33, 383 P.2d 441, 6 A.L.R.3d 693]. In <em>Tunkl, </em>after canvassing the earlier California decisions dealing with contract clauses which purported to exculpate one party from liability resulting from negligence or other nonwillful misconduct, we set out \u201ca rough outline\u201d of the type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions are invalid. We stated: \u201c[T]he attempted but invalid exemption involves a transaction which exhibits some or all of the following characteristics. It concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation. The party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public, which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public. The party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it, or at least for any member coming within certain established standards. As a result of the essential nature of the service, in the economic setting of the transaction, the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services. In exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation, and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence. Finally, as a result of the transaction, the person or property of the purchaser is placed undpr the control of the seller, subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.\u201d (Fns. omitted.) (60 Cal.2d at pp. 98-101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Under these guidelines, we do not doubt that the instant exculpatory clause cannot stand. Hospitals, both public and private, are of course subject to extensive public regulation and provide a service of great importance to both the public and to doctors seeking to use their facilities. Moreover, hospitals are required to establish reasonable, nonarbitrary membership standards. (Cf., e.g., <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Soc. of Orthodontists </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 160, 166 [81 Cal.Rptr. 623, 460 P.2d 495].) Such institutions certainly occupy a \u201csuperior bargaining position\u201d to an individual physician with respect to the granting or withholding of their own membership privileges. Finally, the exculpatory clause in question, incorporated into the hospital\u2019s bylaws, constitutes the epitome of an adhesive provision, offered to affected doctors strictly on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that this provision of the Westlake bylaws does not bar plaintiff\u2019s action. To the extent that the decisions in <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Lodge, I.O.O.F., supra, </em>110 Cal. 297, 309-310 and <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Templar Lodge, I.O.O.F., supra, </em>117 Cal. 370, 374-375, are inconsistent with this conclusion, they are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">(b) <em>Civil Code section 47, subdivision 2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Defendants additionally contend that even without regard to the Westlake bylaw plaintiff\u2019s action must fail because both the hospital and its board and committee members are shielded from liability by an <em>absolute </em>privilege. Although defendants recognize that section 43.7 of the Civil Code explicitly establishes only a <em>conditional </em>privilege for individual members of a hospital board and provides no privilege at all for the hospital itself,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendants contend that because the hospital\u2019s decision to revoke plaintiff\u2019s staff privileges emanated from a quasi-judicial proceeding, all actions of the hospital and its boards are clothed with the absolute privilege embodied in section 47, subdivision 2 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Section 47, subdivision 2, affords an absolute privilege (see, e.g., <em>Albertson </em>v. <em>Raboff </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 375,. 379 [295 P.2d 405]) to any \u201cpublication or broadcast\u201d made in connection with any legislative, judicial, or \u201cother official proceeding authorized by law,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Court of Appeal decisions have construed this provision to protect statements made in connection with quasi-judicial proceedings conducted by hospital boards. (See <em>Goodley </em>v. <em>Sullivant </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 619 [108 Cal.Rptr. 451]; <em>Ascherman </em>v. <em>Natanson </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 861 [100 Cal.Rptr. 656].) To the extent that plaintiff\u2019s present action rests upon an injury resulting from specific statements or testimony given by individual defendants during the Westlake proceedings, the action would be precluded under these authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As we read Dr. Kaiman\u2019s complaint and affidavits, however, the gist of her claim is not that her injury has been occasioned simply by defendants\u2019 malicious <em>statements </em>at the proceedings, but rather that she has been injured by the malicious <em>actions </em>of the hospital and its committee members in revoking her staff privileges. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in <em>Goodley </em>v. Sullivant, <em>supra, </em>32 Cal.App.3d 619, 624-625, it is section 43.7, and not section 47, subdivision 2, which \u201cis concerned with the <em>actions </em>taken by a medical committee (i.e., refusing, suspending or revoking hospital privileges to any doctor)\u201d; under section 43.7 such actions enjoy only a conditional privilege. Although, as plaintiff contends, section 47, subdivision 2, has on occasion been applied in contexts other than a defamation action (see, e.g., <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Solomon </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 289, 300-302 [113 Cal.Rptr. 113]), its absolute privilege has always attached only to <em>statements </em>or <em>publications </em>made in connection with the applicable proceeding. Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that the section provided no absolute shield for defendants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">(c) <em>Failure to have revocation set aside in mandamus action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Finally, defendants contend that even if they do not enjoy total immunity from liability under either the hospital bylaw or section 47, subdivision 2, plaintiff\u2019s damage action is at least premature. Defendants assert that before plaintiff may maintain a tort action against either the hospital or its board or committee members on the ground that the revocation of her hospital privileges was maliciously motivated, she must first successfully attack the quasi-judicial revocation decision in a mandamus proceeding. As far as we are aware, no prior decision in this state has addressed the narrow issue of whether an individual who has been expelled or excluded from membership in an association after being afforded a quasi-judicial proceeding may bring an immediate tort action for damages or must first succeed in setting aside the association\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>decision in a separate mandamus action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we explain, we have determined that under the present circumstances, plaintiff should be required to proceed initially through a mandamus action; accordingly we conclude that, in this respect, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">In contending that the present action for damages is premature, defendants assert that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is analogous to a malicious prosecution action which can only be maintained after the allegedly maliciously initiated proceeding has terminated in favor of the person against whom it was brought. (See, e.g., <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 146, 149 [114 P.2d 335, 135 A.L.R. 775].) In <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Vial </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 577 [311 P.2d 494], this court explicitly held that the elements of a traditional malicious prosecution action apply to an action seeking damages resulting from a maliciously initiated administrative proceeding. Defendants argue that because the \u201cprivate\u201d administrative proceeding conducted by the hospital in the instant case parallels an ordinary \u201cpublic\u201d administrative proceeding, plaintiff ought to be barred from proceeding with her damage action until the administrative proceeding has been \u201cterminated in her favor,\u201d i.e., until the hospital\u2019s revocation decision has been overturned in a judicial mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We recognize, of course, that the plaintiff\u2019s present action is not precisely analogous to the malicious prosecution action at issue in <em>Hardy. </em>In <em>Hardy, </em>as in malicious prosecution cases generally, the plaintiff sought recovery against the parties who had initiated the charges against him; in the instant case, plaintiff seeks recovery against those who actually rendered the revocation decision against her. Moreover, the parallel between public and private administrative proceedings is not complete, for in the public sector those who render decisions in a quasi-judicial capacity enjoy an absolute immunity for their actions (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 820.2; <em>Downer </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1856) 6 Cal. 94, 95-96), whereas in the hospital or professional association setting, the Legislature has afforded individual decisionmakers only a conditional privilege. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 43.7, quoted at fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Despite these distinctions, however, we believe that the general policy underlying the \u201cfavorable termination\u201d requirement in malicious prose-</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>cution actions applies in the present context. As in a malicious prosecution action, plaintiff\u2019s position rests on a contention that defendants intentionally and maliciously misused a quasi-judicial procedure in order to injure her; such a claim is necessarily premised on an assertion that the hospital\u2019s decision to revoke plaintiff\u2019s privileges was itself erroneous and unjustified. Although a quasi-judicial decision reached by a tribunal of a private association may not be entitled to exactly the same measure of respect as a similar decision of a duly constituted public agency (see Summers, <em>Legal Limitations in Union Discipline </em>(1951) 64 Harv.L.Rev. 1049, 1086), we believe that so long as such a quasi-judicial decision is not set aside through appropriate review procedures the decision has the effect of establishing the propriety of the hospital\u2019s action. (Cf. <em>Hollywood Circle, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 728, 731-733 [13 Cal.Rptr. 104, 361 P.2d 712].) Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiff must first succeed in overturning the quasi-judicial action before pursuing her .tort claim against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In our view, the above requirement accords a proper respect to an association\u2019s quasi-judicial procedure, precluding an aggrieved party from circumventing the established avenue of mandamus review. In addition, this result will simplify court procedures by providing a uniform practice of judicial, rather than jury, review of quasi-judicial administrative decisions. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; <em>Boren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 634, 637 [234 P.2d 981].)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Finally, this procedure affords a justified measure of protection to the individuals who take on, often without remuneration, the difficult, time-consuming and socially important task of policing medical personnel. Because such individuals remain ultimately subject to suit, the procedure outlined above does not conflict with the legislative decision to afford only a conditional privilege to these decisionmakers (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 43.7); once a court determines in a mandamus proceeding that an association\u2019s quasi-judicial decision cannot stand, either because of a substantive or procedural defect, the prevailing party is entitled to initiate a tort action against the hospital and its board or committee members or staff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>In the present case, although the hospital revoked plaintiff\u2019s staff privileges at Westlake pursuant to a quasi-judicial proceeding, plaintiff did not challenge the revocation through a mandamus proceeding but instead immediately instituted the instant action. For the reasons discussed above, we believe that the tort action is premature insofar as it rests on the Westlake revocation and thus that the trial court should have granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to the Westlake revocation. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, 6th par.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">4. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We summarize our conclusions as to events at Los Robles Hospital. First, we have determined that although a doctor who has been denied hospital staff privileges must exhaust all available internal remedies before instituting any judicial action, including an action seeking only damages, the affidavits in the instant case do not establish that Los Robles provided an available remedy which plaintiff failed to exhaust. Second, we have concluded that because Los Robles undertook the exclusion without notice or hearing, plaintiff is not precluded from immediately instituting a tort action for damages sustained as a result of such exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We sum up our conclusions as to the revocation of privileges at Westlake Community Hospital. We have explained that the exculpatory clause contained in Westlake\u2019s by-laws does not bar plaintiff\u2019s action and that Civil Code section 47, subdivision 2, does not provide an absolute privilege to either Westlake or its board or committee members in regard to the revocation of plaintiff\u2019s staff privileges. Finally, we have decided that because plaintiff has not yet succeeded in setting aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>quasi-judicial revocation at Westlake, she may not maintain a tort action for damages arising from such revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In compelling the exhaustion of available hospital remedies and in requiring that a hospital\u2019s quasi-judicial denial of staff privileges, if wrongful, be first set aside, we seek to accommodate the divergent interests involved here. Our court has long recognized, of course, that the existence of unrestrained authority in hospital boards or professional associations has at times enveloped an arbitrary selectivity that threatened to convert the operating room into the province of an elite clique. Our past decisions demonstrate that this court has been adamant in its endeavor to eradicate monopolistic control of professional opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">At the same time, however, we must realistically acknowledge that nonmedical hospital board members and doctors who undertake the hard task of selecting those who are to be accorded the use of the hospital must labor under a heavy burden. Their function is both to attempt to protect the hospital from malpractice suits that may arise from inadequate performance and to insure, so far as possible, that the hospital renders that high quality health care that is more and more the imperative of governmental beneficences. Such board members and doctors frequently donate their time and talents on a volunteer basis. When such individuals pursue their tasks under procedures which accord an aggrieved doctor an opportunity to rebut the charges against him, we believe they are entitled to the modicum of protection provided by the procedural requirements discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Accordingly, the alternative writ is discharged and a peremptory writ of mandate shall issue, directing the trial court to vacate the challenged order insofar as such ord^r denies defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to the revocation of plaintiff\u2019s staff privileges at Westlake Community Hospital. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, 6th par.) In all other respects, the requested relief is denied. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Mosk, J., Sullivan, J., Clark, J\u201e and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The petition of the real party in interest for a rehearing was denied September 3, 1976.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The complaint was framed in four separate \u201ccauses of action.\u201d The first \u201ccause of action,\u201d alleging unlawful interference with the right to pursue a lawful calling or occupation, related only to the revocation of staff privileges at Westlake. The second, third and fourth \u201ccauses of action,\u201d resting, respectively, on theories of conspiracy to restrain competition, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud and deceit, related both to the revocation of privileges at Westlake and to the denial of staff privileges at Los Robles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Neither Los Robles nor the named individual defendants associated with Los Robles joined in the motion and, indeed, these defendants have not appeared in the action to date at all; at oral argument we learned that the \u201cLos Robles defendants\u201d had not yet been served. Accordingly, hereinafter we shall use the terms \u201cdefendants\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\"Westlake defendants\u201d interchangeably, to refer to Westlake and the individual defendants associated with Westlake.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Although the \u201cLos Robles defendants\u201d are not parties to the present proceeding, the events at Los Robles remain relevant, for the complaint alleges that the \u201cWestlake defendants\u201d were engaged, inter alia, in a conspiracy to exclude plaintiff from Los Robles and are thus liable for damages resulting from Dr. Kaiman\u2019s allegedly improper exclusion from that hospital. Accordingly, in the case at bar we must determine whether the trial court properly refused to grant the Westlake defendants summary judgment with respect to both the discharge from staff privileges at Westlake and the denial of staff privileges at Los Robles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Writing in the context of labor union disputes. Professor Summers has analyzed the policy considerations for requiring exhaustion of remedies as follows: \u201cThe doctrinal declaration that courts will not intervene in internal union disputes until all appeals within the union have been exhausted has, in theory, three underlying policies. First, union appellate tribunals may take corrective action, thus reducing the burden on the courts. Second, the benefit of the expert judgment of these tribunals might aid courts in making more responsible decisions. Third, the deep and pervading principle of preserving the autonomy of unions constrains courts to give the union full responsibility and opportunity to correct its own mistakes. Against these policies is balanced the policy of providing reasonably prompt and effective judicial protection to important legal rights.\u201d (Summers, <em>The Law of Union Discipline: What the Courts Do in Fact </em>(1960) 70 Yale L.J. 175. 207.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Although the <em>Holderbv </em>decision describes the exhaustion doctrine as applicable to a \u201cplaintiff who seeks judicial relief against an organization of which he is a member\u201d (45 Cal.2d at p. 846), the policy considerations underlying the rule (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>make it clear that the exhaustion doctrine is equally applicable to an <em>applicant </em>for membership who has been denied admission to the organization. Plaintiff does not suggest that any distinction should be drawn between applicants who seek membership and those individuals whose membership has been revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Santa Ana etc. Hospital Assn. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 806, 810 [26 Cal.Rptr. 640. 376 P.2d 568], we held that a doctor's complaint, containing allegations very similar to the instant complaint, stated a common law cause of action for intentional and unjustifiable interference with the right to pursue a lawful business, calling, trade or occupation. In Willis, however, we did not address the exhaustion of remedies issue discussed herein, for the complaint alleged simply that plaintiff's staff membership had been terminated \u201cwithout any hearing or assigned reason\" <em>(id, </em>at p. 808) and there was no indication that any internal remedy was available under the hospital\u2019s bylaws.

(See <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 557. fn. 17: cf. <em>Rosner </em>v. <em>Eden Township Hospital Dist. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 592, 599 [25 Cal.Rptr. 551, 375 P.2d 431].)
