The trial court conducted a two-stage trial, the initial stage occurring in June 1972 and the second in May 1973; at the latter session a number of experts, appointed by the court to review the school district\u2019s current desegregation plan, testified as to their findings. In September 1973, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, ordering the school district to desegregate its schools by the fall semester \u00f3f 1974: The school district appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that segregation exists within the San Bernardino school district and that the district bears a constitutional obligation to take reasonable and feasible steps to alleviate such segregation. As we have explained in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Board of Education, ante, </em>page 280 [130 Cal.Rptr. 724, 551 P.2d 28], decided this day, school districts in this state bear a constitutional obligation to alleviate segregation in their districts, regardless of the cause of such segregation. The trial court properly refused to relieve the defendant school district of this obligation on the basis of its claim that the segregation in the district was \u201cde facto\u201d rather than \u201cde jure\u201d in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">As we also explain, however, while the trial court properly found that the district bears an obligation to take reasonable and feasible steps to desegregate its schools, the court\u2014relying upon statutory and administrative provisions that have since been repealed\u2014utilized an improper \u201cracial balance\u201d standard in determining which schools within the district are unconstitutionally segregated; as in <em>Crawford, </em>on remand the trial court must revise its definition of segregation to accord with the guidelines set forth in that case. In addition, because the San Bernardino school board, unlike the Los Angeles school board in <em>Crawford, </em>had adopted and implemented a plan for the desegregation of its schools, on remand the court should evaluate the adequacy of such plan in light of the <em>Crawford </em>decision before requiring the district to implement an alternative desegregation plan. If, however, the court finds that the district\u2019s current desegregation plan is inadequate under <em>Crawford, </em>it should order the district to implement a reasonable and feasible plan that promises meaningful progress in the alleviation of segregation in the San Bernardino school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We begin our analysis with a brief review of the statistical findings of the trial court relating to the demography of the San Bernardino school district. In the fall of 1972, minority students comprised 37.1 percent of the defendant district\u2019s total student population of 34,228; the court found that the racial composition of the district\u2019s students was 20.8 percent Spanish surname; 15.5 percent black; 0.6 percent Oriental; 0.2 percent American Indian and 62.9 percent Caucasian. The statistical findings indicate that, unlike the situation described in <em>Crawford, </em>over the six-year period from 1966-1972 the number of segregated schools in the San Bernardino school district had substantially declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The trial court specifically found that, as of November 1972, there was no racial or ethnic segregation in the district\u2019s six senior high schools. At the junior high school level, the findings reveal that whereas in 1966, four of the eight junior highs had either minority or \u201cwhite\u201d student populations of 95 percent or greater, by 1972 only one of ten junior highs was so severely segregated and all but one of the remaining schools contained between 20 percent and 55 percent minority students.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the elementary school level, similar progress had been made; in 1966, 33 of the district\u2019s 42 elementary schools had populations of 85 percent or more minority or white, while in 1972 only 9 of the 42 elementary schools contained such severe racial or ethnic isolation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Although the parties disagree as to the extent to which the reduction in the number of segregated schools is properly attributable to the efforts of the defendant school board,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the record does indicate that over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>1966-1972 period the San Bernardino school board did undertake a number of steps aimed at alleviating segregation in the district\u2019s schools. The principal element of the district\u2019s desegregation program over these years was the adoption of a voluntary \u201ccontrolled open enrollment\u201d transfer option, which afforded minority students who wished to transfer to other schools an opportunity to do so, so long as such transfer improved the racial or ethnic \u201cbalance\u201d of either the receiving or sending school;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unlike the Los Angeles transfer option discussed in <em>Crawford, ante, </em>at pages 288-289, the San Bernardino \u201ccontrolled open e\u00f1rollment\u201d plan only permitted transfers which promoted desegregation, precluding all transfers which would lead to resegregation. In addition, unlike the Los Angeles program, the San Bernardino school district provided transportation for students who chose to exercise this option. By virtue of this program several thousand minority students, approximately one-fourth of the minority students assigned to \u201cminority imbalanced\u201d schools, transferred to desegregated schools.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The record also reveals that during this period the district selected the sites of some new schools and closed at least one older school with an eye toward alleviating school segregation. Finally, during these years the district also introduced into its curriculum compensatory programs aimed at alleviating some of the academic disparity traditionally associated with school segregation and added \u201cminority studies\u201d classes designed to promote improved intergroup relations and to facilitate the desegregation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Although, as noted above, the statistical data does demonstrate that progress had been made in alleviating school segregation between 1966 and 1972, the findings also reveal that the district\u2019s efforts had failed to alleviate segregation in a number of junior high and elementary schools located in minority neighborhoods; indeed, in some cases, the degree of racial isolation in such schools increased between 1966 and 1972.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This result was perhaps a predictable consequence of the district\u2019s desegregation strategy, for while the \u201ccontrolled open enrollment\u201d program permitted many minority students to transfer out of these heavily segregated schools, such transfers did nothing to alleviate segregation in the nearly all-minority schools which such students left. Throughout the period in question, the school board did not attempt to redraw the geographic boundary zones of the remaining segregated schools, nor did it implement any program under which majority students who lived outside of the minority neighborhoods were assigned to the predominantly minority schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Recognizing that its initial desegregation efforts had not eliminated all of the segregation in the district, the San Bernardino school board in June 1971 adopted a resolution directing the superintendent of schools to develop an equitable desegregation plan to end \u201cracial isolation\u201d in the school district; this plan was to be prepared by November 1971, and implementation of the plan was to begin by September 1972 and to be completed by September 1974.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the district had not previously utilized the \u201cmandatory busing\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of students in its desegregation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>program, the school board instructed the superintendent that the new plan could include the \u201ccross-busing\u201d of students if necessary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The board\u2019s tentative decision to approve a desegregation program which might utilize the mandatory busing of students to eliminate segregation and racial or ethnic imbalance engendered considerable opposition and hostility among many members of the community. Although the task force of school board employees responsible for preparing the details of the full desegregation plan met extensively with community groups in an attempt to enlist their suggestions and their support, community opposition to the mandatory busing aspect of all of the proposed plans continued to be substantial. In the fall of 1971, the board postponed the date for the superintendent\u2019s presentation of a proposed desegregation plan until March 16, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On March 2, 1972, the school board adopted a resolution reaffirming its commitment to \u201cthe principles and the ideals of integration,\u201d mandating the continuance of all of its programs designed to achieve integration and the promulgation of new educationally oriented programs to facilitate the provision of equal educational opportunities, but specifically declaring that \u201cbecause of financial limitations it is impossible to support a large scale transportation program necessary to racially balance schools at this time.\u201d The resolution directed the superintendent \u201cto limit his integration plan [to be submitted later that month] to those steps which may be taken at this time excluding any proposal for mandatory busing.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Pursuant to this resolution, the superintendent submitted a proposed desegregation plan which did not include the mandatory busing of children. The proposal, subsequently adopted and implemented by the school board, involved the decentralization of the school district\u2019s operations into 10 \u201cplanning units.\u201d The planning units consisted of groups of elementaiy schools which would feed into identified junior high schools and then ultimately to a specific high school. The grouping of schools was to be carried out in such a manner that each unit would be composed of approximately the same ethnic and economic distribution as the district as a whole.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">While the plan established racially, ethnically and economically diverse planning units, it did not provide that the individual schools within each unit would be immediately desegregated. Rather, th\u00e9 plan called for the creation of \u201cadvisoiy councils\u201d in each of the planning units, composed of school administrators, teachers, and parents, which would \u201cdetermine priorities and examine programs to voluntarily involve students, staffs and parents in integrated learning experiences.\u201d As the trial court found: \u201cThe plan envisions voluntary exchanges between students during a limited portion of classroom hours and encourages voluntary participation in extra-curricular activities, and attempts to engage voluntary participation between parents, staff and students, both in planning these activities and setting forth plans for voluntary integration within the planning unit group. It envisages that each planning unit council, composed of parents, teachers and staff, will set reasonable goals for voluntary integration [of each school in the planning unit] within a period of one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In April 1972, after the school board had ruled out the implementation of any desegregation plan requiring mandatory busing and had adopted instead the \u201cplanning unit\u201d proposal described briefly above, the NAACP, representing minority students attending schools in the defendant district, filed the instant action contending that the school board had failed to meet its constitutional obligation under our <em>Jackson </em>decision and had failed to comply with various statutory and administrative regulations relating to the elimination of \u201cracial imbalance\u201d in public schools. The petition for writ of mandate asserted that \u201cit is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>power, skill and resources of [the school district] to present an affirmative and effective alleviation or elimination of all racial segregation or imbalance in the schools of said district, but [the district] refuse[s] to do so and will continue to refuse to do so unless ordered otherwise by this Court.\u201d The NAACP sought an order requiring the board to formulate and adopt a plan for the complete elimination of racial segregation and racial imbalance in the district\u2019s schools which would be put into effect no later than September 1, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">As just noted, the petition for writ of mandate maintained that the school district was obligated not only to alleviate racial segregation in the <em>schools but also to </em>alleviate \u201cracial imbalance.\u201d In support <em>of </em>this latter contention, the NAACP relied heavily upon two statutory provisions, Education Code sections 5002 and 5003, which had recently been enacted into law, and upon administrative regulations which had been promulgated by the State Board of Education to implement the statutoiy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Prior to the enactment of sections 5002 and 5003 in 1971, regulations adopted by the State Board of Education announced as \u201cthe declared policy of the State Board of Education\u201d that all persons responsible for the establishment of school attendance zones or the assignment of pupils to schools \u201cshall exert all efforts to avoid and eliminate <em>segregation </em>on account of race or color.\u201d (Italics added.) (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, <em>former \u00a7\u00a7 </em>2010, 2011.) Section 5002 replaced this administrative policy statement with a legislative declaration of policy directing responsible public officials to \u201cprevent and eliminate <em>racial and ethnic imbalance </em>in pupil enrollment\u201d (italics added) and declaring that \u201c[t]he prevention and elimination of such imbalance shall be given high priority in all decisions relating to school sites, school attendance areas, and school attendance practices.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 5003, in turn, provided, inter alia, that \u201ca racial or ethnic imbalance is indicated in a school if the percentage of pupils of one or more racial or ethnic groups differs significantly from the districtwide percentage.\u201d (Ed. Code, \u00a7 5003, subd. (c).) Finally, an administrative regulation promulgated under the authority of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>5003, subdivision (e) defined a racially or ethnically imbalanced school more specifically as one in which \u201cthe percentage of pupils of one or more racial or ethnic groups differs by more than 15 percentage points from that in all the schools in the district.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, former \u00a7 14021, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In its return to the petition for writ of mandate, the school district conceded that some of the schools in its district were racially or ethnically imbalanced under the foregoing statutory and administrative provisions, but asserted that any such imbalance was purely de facto in nature and that the district had at all times taken \u201call measures possible within the limits of the financial resources available to the district\u201d to remedy such imbalance. Under these circumstances, the district claimed that it had complied with all of its constitutional or statutory obligations. The return further alleged that the State Board of Education \u201cis presently drafting rules and regulations for the implementation of [Education Code sections 5002 and 5003]\u201d and that the district \u201cwill conform in all respects to the requirements of said sections and of the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d Finally, the return maintained that plaintiffs should be required to exhaust administrative remedies allegedly available from the State Department of Education and suggested that the court deny relief prior to such exhaustion of remedies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The initial stage of the trial in this proceeding commenced on June 7, 1972. Plaintiffs introduced evidence relating to the segregated and racially imbalanced nature of a number of the district\u2019s schools and to the feasibility of eliminating such segregation and imbalance; several experts also testified to the harm inflicted on minority children by segregated schools. In response, the district\u2019s administrators testified to the actions the district had taken over the years to attempt to alleviate segregation and imbalance and to overcome the harmful consequences traditionally associated with school segregation; these administrators also testified to the paucity of financial resources available to the district and to the great expense that would be entailed in a busing program that would achieve racial and ethnic balance in all of the district\u2019s schools. Finally, the district administrators defended the \u201cplanning unit\u201d concept as an approach aimed at ultimately achieving the elimination of racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>imbalance in the district; the staff explained that they hoped that the communications between parents and students of diverse backgrounds fostered by the integrated activities of the planning unit would break down hostilities and fears among all groups and would ultimately result in the voluntary integration of the individual schools within each unit under the direction of the locally controlled advisory councils.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">After hearing this testimony, the trial court entered an initial, interim minute order on June 27^ 1972. In its order, the court found that \u201cracial and ethnic imbalance,\u201d as defined by the administrative regulation then in effect (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 5, former \u00a7 14021, subd. (c)), existed in several of the district\u2019s schools,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that the district had a duty to give high priority to eliminating such imbalance. In light of the expertise of the State Board of Education in interpreting and applying the statutoiy and administrative requirements in this area, the court determined that the appropriate means to proceed was to order the district \u201cto proceed promptly to prepare and submit to the State Board of Education a plan for the elimination of. . . racial imbalance ... in the schools of [the] district with a proposed timetable for the implementation of such plan\u201d; the order specified that the plan was to be submitted \u201cas soon as possible . . . and in any event not later than the 1st of September, 1972,\u201d and that copies of the plan, and interim progress reports were to be filed with the court. The order envisioned that the State Board of Education would aid the court in determining whether the district\u2019s plan complied with the mandate of the governing statutory and administrative provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">After obtaining an extension of time for the filing of the desegregation plan from the trial court, the district submitted a desegregation plan to the State Board of Education on October 27, 1972. The plan, as submitted, incorporated the \u201cplanning unit\u201d concept described above; while the plan was more detailed than the initial proposal, the principal elements of the plan remained unchanged. Thus, although each planning unit, as a whole, was racially, ethnically and economically balanced, the composition of the student body within each individual school remained unchanged. The plan called for the advisory council of each unit to plan and implement \u201cintegrated learning experiences\u201d for the children within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the unit; such activities were to be offered solely on a voluntaiy basis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plan also provided that by March 15, 1973, each advisory council would identify what factors would attract parents in their area voluntarily to enroll their children outside of their neighborhood, and by March 15, 1974, each council would identify acceptable criteria for assigning pupils within planning units; the plan did not, however, establish any date by which concrete proposals were to be put into effect in each planning unit and did not specify a deadline by which the alleviation of racial segregation or racial imbalance in individual schools was actually to be achieved. The report submitted to the State Board of Education on October 27, 1972, indicated that the district had already begun to implement the \u201cplanning unit\u201d program described therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">On November 4, 1972, just one week after the district had submitted its plan to the State Board of Education,the voters of this state passed an initiative measure, designated \u201cProposition 21,\u201d which, inter alia, repealed sections 5002 and 5003 of the Education Code along with all of the implementing administrative regulations. This enactment, of course, raised considerable questions as to the status of the trial court\u2019s interim order; the uncertainty was exacerbated by the fact that the constitutionality of Proposition 21 was immediately challenged in a number of pending court actions. In December 1972, the NAACP moved to strike the desegregation plan which had been filed by the school district on October 27, claiming that such plan did not comply with the court\u2019s minute order of June 27, 1972. In January 1973, the trial court postponed a ruling on the NAACP motion and appointed four educational experts to review the district\u2019s current desegregation plan, to evaluate its effectiveness and to make recommendations as to the future desegregation of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In May 1973, the second stage of the trial in these proceedings took place. A majority of the court-appointed experts testified that the \u201cplanning unit\u201d concept was an innovative approach which, in providing a variety of integrated learning experiences and in attempting to involve teachers and parents in the desegregation process, embodied educationally sound principles; the experts all agreed, however, that there were substantial deficiencies in the district\u2019s current implementation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cplanning unit\u201d concept. The most fundamental defect that the experts identified was the absence from the district\u2019s plan of any definite deadline for the implementation of concrete desegregation measures in each planning unit or for the achievement of actual desegregation in the individual schools of each unit. All the experts expressed serious doubts that the planning unit program, operating on an entirely open-ended voluntary basis, would ever achieve the alleviation of racial imbalance in individual schools within each unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In addition, the experts criticized the district for not providing adequate financial support for the planning unit program and for failing to establish an administrative framework to advise and coordinate the activities of the individual planning units; the experts testified that there had been a great disparity in both the quantity and quality of \u201cintegrated learning experiences\u201d which had occurred in the various planning units during the initial year of the plan\u2019s implementation. Several of the experts reported that numerous members of the planning unit advisoiy councils had expressed concern that the school board\u2019s failure to provide financial support for the planning unit program belied the board\u2019s asserted commitment to ensuring the program\u2019s success.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">One of the expert witnesses also presented an alternative desegregation plan, which did not utilize the \u201cplanning unit\u201d approach, but which instead proposed to alleviate the existing segregation and racial and ethnic imbalance in the district by redrawing attendance boundary lines at the junior high school and elementary school levels and by altering the grade structure of various schools. This expert testified that the proposed plan was both reasonable and feasible and would entail significantly less transportation expense than would be incurred in the \u201cplanning unit\u201d program.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">After receiving this evidence as well as updated statistical data and additional testimony from the district\u2019s staff, the trial court rendered its final decision in this matter on September 13, 1973. Although the court made no finding that the district had engaged in de jure segregation or that the facilities or staff in minority schools were unequal to the facilities and staff at other schools, the court did find that a number of the schools in the district were in fact segregated, that the district had placed a \u201clow financial priority at any efforts to achieve integration\u201d and that the district\u2019s current, totally voluntary planning unit program \u201ccannot and will not achieve ultimate desegregation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>On the basis of these findings, the court ordered the district to prepare and implement a \u201creasonable, effective and feasible\u201d desegregation plan. The court did not, however, require the district immediately to reshuffle its pupil assignments for the 1973-1974 school year, but rather permitted the district to continue with its current planning unit approach for another year, so long as the programs were modified to require each student to spend \u201ca sufficient period of time in the other schools within the planning unit group to provide . .. contact with . .. students of other races and ethnic backgrounds ... [so as to] pave the way for ultimate desegregation in 1974 without the psychological problems arising from an immediate desegregation order.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The order specified that starting from the commencement of the 1974 fall semester, any attendance scheme adopted for the assignment of pupils \u201cshall be as free as possible from any segregation....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">On appeal, the district primarily contends that in the absence of a finding of either de jfire segregation or of \u201cseparate but unequal\u201d schools, the trial court erred in concluding that the district bears a constitutional duty to take affirmative action to alleviate the segregation which may exist in its schools. As we explain at some length in <em>Crawford, ante, </em>the district\u2019s contention is incorrect; <em>Jackson </em>and its progeny establish that in this state all school boards are constitutionally obligated to take reasonable and feasible steps to alleviate segregation in their districts, regardless of the cause of such segregation. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the San Bernardino school district is constitutionally obligated to undertake reasonable and feasible measures to alleviate the school segregation remaining in the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Although we sustain the trial court\u2019s basic holding, we must also point out, as we have in <em>Crawford, </em>that the definition of \u201csegregation\u201d. utilized by the trial court is improper and should be modified on remand. In the case at bar, the trial court used a number of alternative formulas in defining \u201csegregation,\u201d but all of the formulas identified a \u201csegregated school\u201d on the basis of the school\u2019s deviation from a \u201cracial balance\u201d norm;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> after the trial court\u2019s order was filed, our court upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the constitutionality of the portion of Proposition 21 that repealed the \u201cracial balance\u201d provisions upon which the trial court had relied. (See <em>Santa Barbara Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 315, 328-332 [118 Cal.Rptr. 637, 530 P.2d 605].) In light of this repeal, California school districts bear no statutory obligation to achieve racially balanced schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Moreover, as we explain in <em>Crawford: </em>\u201c[T]he constitutional mandate articulated in <em>Jackson </em>and reaffirmed today is not a constitutional command that each school in a district must reflect the racial composition of the district as a whole .... Our decisions, instead, require only that school districts take reasonable and feasible steps to eliminate <em>segregated </em>schools, i.e., schools in which the minority student enrollment is so disproportionate as realistically to isolate minority students from other students and thus deprive minority students of an integrated educational experience. ... It is such segregated schools which traditionally have resulted in the inherently unequal educational opportunities condemned in <em>Brown.\" (Ante, </em>at pp. 302-303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Although the definition of \u201csegregation\u201d utilized by the trial court is no longer valid, it is evident from the court\u2019s specific statistical findings that, as of September 1972, a number of schools in the San Bernardino school district were \u201csegregated\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Crawford </em>decision. Thus, in a district whose student population is 62.9 percent Caucasian and 37.1 percent minority, a number of schools had minority enrollments of close to 100 percent. (Cf. <em>Keyes </em>v. <em>School Dist. No. 1, Denver, Colo. </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 189, 206 [37 L.Ed.2d 548, 562, 93 S.Ct. 2686].) Under <em>Crawford, </em>there can be no question but that the district bears a constitutional obligation to take reasonable and feasible steps which promise meaningful progress in the alleviation of segregation in such schools. On remand, the trial court, applying the <em>Crawford </em>criteria, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>should identify all the schools in the district to which the board\u2019s constitutional duty relates.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In addition, on remand the trial court should also evaluate the adequacy of the district\u2019s current desegregation plan in light of the guidelines set out in <em>Crawford. </em> As we explain in that decision, \u201cso long as a local school board initiates and implements reasonably feasible steps to alleviate school segregation in its district, and so long as such steps produce meaningful progress in the alleviation of such segregation, and its harmful consequences, we do not believe the judiciary should intervene in the desegregation process.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>pp. 305-306.) Moreover, a desegregation plan is not inadequate simply because alternative desegregation techniques may produce more rapid desegregation in the school district. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In the instant case, of course, the trial court did find that the \u201cplanning unit\u201d plan as implemented by the respondent district \u201ccannot and will not achieve ultimate desegregation . . this finding, however, rested in part on a definition of \u201cdesegregation\u201d framed in terms of the elimination of racial imbalance. Although from the present record the trial court may well conclude that the district\u2019s desegregation plan is similarly inadequate under <em>Crawford </em>because it does not promise meaningful progress in the alleviation of <em>segregated </em>schools, we believe that the trial court should explicitly resolve this question on remand, with full knowledge of the <em>Crawford </em>decision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In evaluating the adequacy of the current desegregation plan under <em>Crawford, </em>the trial court may, of course, consider what progress, if any, has been made under the desegregation plan during the pendency of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Accordingly, except insofar as it defines \u201cdesegregation\u201d with reference to a racial balance concept, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In San Bernardino, as in all school districts, no child is actually required to ride a bus to school; a student is free to use any form of transportation he or his parents choose to take him to and from his assigned school. The terminology has come to mean, however, a policy of assigning students to schools beyond walking distance for the purpose of alleviating racial segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">As recent statistics of the United States Commission on Civil Rights reveal, the percentage of students who are bused for the purpose of desegregation is a very small portion of the students who ride buses to school for reasons unrelated to desegregation. The figures show that 43.5 percent of the country\u2019s school children ride buses to school, but that only 2 to 4 percent of school children are bused for desegregation purposes.
