Sullivan, and restrained, forbade and prevented defendant from proceeding further under said executions until said stay was dissolved, which did not occur until August 9, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">It is, therefore, very evident that the sheriff had not sixty days free from said stay during which he could exercise his official duties, and consequently this action was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Therefore, the trial justice was right in dismissing the complaint herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Ehrlich, Ch.
