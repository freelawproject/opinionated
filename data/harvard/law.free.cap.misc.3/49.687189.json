Plaintiff proved that for several years, in the leading cities of the country, and especially in Brooklyn, closed-back steps Avere in common use on horse cars, and were and still are in use on part of the cars of defendant. <em>Held, </em>that whether or not defendant exercised ordinary care in having an open-back step on this car was a question for the jury; that the fact that the other kind of steps were in common use, and for the purpose of preventing just such an accident, would justify a finding of the jury that defendant was negligent in respect to this step.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">Appeal by plaintiff from a judgment in favor of defendant, entered upon the verdict of a jury, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial. The opinion states the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-12\"><em>Edgar Bergen (A. Ii.

Whether or not the defendant exercised ordinary care in having an open-backed step on this car, under such circumstances, was, in our opinion, a question for the jury. The fact that the other kind of step was in common use, and for the purp ose of preventing just such accidents, would justify a finding of the jury that defendant was negligent in respect to this step, and we think it was error for the court to take the question <em>.from </em>them. <em>Hegeman </em>v. <em>West.
