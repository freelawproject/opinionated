It was in favor of the plaintiff, and payable to her. The defendant refused to adjust the demand, putting its refusal on _ the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s husband had understated his age and had thereby defrauded the defendant iri respect to the risk and amount of premium charged. The officers of the defendant told the plaintiff that they had positive evidence as to the true age, and offered her $4,000 by way of compromise. She accepted the money and executed a release under seal. The present suit is an effort to set aside the release and recover the remaining $1,000 on the ground that the representation that the defendant had <em>\u2018 </em>positive \u2019 proof as to the husband\u2019s age was untrue, as the only thing resembling evidence the defendant had was a record of enlistment in the army, which was not competent to establish the disputed fact. The subject of age was one about which the defendant could have no knowledge superior to that possessed by the plaintiff, and no one can furnish 1 positive \u2019 proof of the time of birth except persons present at the occasion, and no one assumed that the defendant had such witnesses. The fact that the defendant overrated the degree or value of the army enlistment record as evidence of the age does not rise to the dignity of fraud adequate to set aside the release. It probably created a doubt which might have led to better proof. It is sufficient, however, as matter of defense that there was a <em>\u2018 </em>disputed \u2019 liability, which the parties adjusted at $4,000. The payment and acceptance of the money constituted a good accord and satisfaction without any writing. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Nussbaum, 2 </em>Duer, 302; <em>People ex rel. McDonough </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Managers, <em>etc., </em>96 N. Y. 640.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">\u201cAnd even if the plaintiff had received it under protest it would not have destroyed this effect. Looby v. <em>West Troy, </em>24 Hun, 78. That the liability was disputed and compromised is recited in the release itself, and this controlling circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>appears prominently all through the case. The plaintiff has failed to establish any claim to equitable relief, and the complaint must be dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-5\"><em>A. II.
