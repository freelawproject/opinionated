The action was to restrain the operation and maintenance of a branch of the elevated railroad running in front of plaintiff\u2019s premises, Eo. 306 East Thirty-fourth street, between First and Second avenues, in the city of Eew York, and for damages. The judgment granted the relief prayed for unless within ninety days the defendants paid $2,500, assessed as damages to the fee value of the premises caused by the railroad. Damages for loss of rents were allowed, $2,168, from October, 1882, to March 10, 1892.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-5\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjA\">The referee was requested by the defendants to find as a fact, that the easements pertaining to the plaintiff\u2019s lands taken for the uses of the railway, aside from any damage to the land from the said taking, have in themselves only a nominal value. This was refused, and the defendants excepted. It was error to refuse to find as requested as fact, and the error requires the reversal of the judgment. <em>Bookman </em>v. <em>Manhattan Ry. Co., </em>33 N. E. Rep. 333; <em>Sutro </em>v. <em>Met. El. Ry. Co., </em>Id. 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The respondent\u2019s contention that the refusal to find as requested is immaterial, has been discussed in the case of Cook against the same defendants, <em>a/rite, </em>page 248, and the conclusion there reached applies to this case. We assume, in so deciding, that the printed case shall be taken to be amended in respect of the request to find under consideration, by the substitution of the word <em>\u201c </em>easement \u201d for <em>\u201c </em>assessment,\u201d as there is no disagreement between counsel as to the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">If it be proper to express an opinion upon the facts of this case, and we think fit is, because in the <em>Cooh </em>case above mentioned, we have reversed upon the facts as well as the law, we feel justified in saying that there seems to be evidence upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>which to base a finding of damage to the fee and rental value of the plaintiff\u2019s property. We assume that the finding of $2,168, loss of rentals from October 20, 1888, was intended to be a finding of loss of rentals from October 20, 1882, there being a manifest error in the printed book in respect of the dates, and, as we so understand the finding, the evidence appears to justify it. The referee evidently made due allowance for all the causes which, apart from the injurious effect of the elevated railroad, were claimed to have contributed to prevent that recovery of rents and values in Thirty-fourth street, east of Third avenue, which may be found in other localities. Among such causes was the opening up of eligible-residential neighborhood in the upper part of the. city, due to-the rapid transit system. But there remains the fact that the maintenance and operation of the road in front of these premises, without benefiting them in the slightest degree, made them undesirable for tenants and so affected their rental value and their fee value, as indicated by the depreciation of rents. In this case the plaintiff furnishes evidence-(which is wanting in the <em>Goolc </em>case) of the rents received before the construction of the road. The difference between the rental obtained before the road was built and that obtained afterwards is between $200 and $300 per annum, and while it is not certain as to which year prior to <em>1879 </em>the highest rental was received, still the fact is proved, which enables a competent conclusion as to actual loss of values to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Judgment reversed, new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"AMf\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
