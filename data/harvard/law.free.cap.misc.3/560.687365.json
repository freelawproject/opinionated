But beyond this, the order made below was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The defendant did not have a family depending on him for support, within the meaning of the statutory provision exempting earnings of a judgment debtor, and that ferture of the case requires no serious consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">There was nothing in the case warranting a higher fine than the sixty dollars wrongfully parted with to the prejudice of the judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The provision requiring the debtor to obtain a reassignment of the rights transferred to his son was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The transfer had been made prior to the recovery of the judgment, and could be attacked by a creditor\u2019s bill only.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">It follows that the order appealed from must be modified ' by reducing the fine to sixty dollars, and by eliminating the part in respect to the reassignment, and, as modified, the order must be affirmed, without costs.
