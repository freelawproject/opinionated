If the evidence be insufficient as to any fact indispensable in the constitution of a gift <em>causa mortis, </em>the judgment cannot stand, and we must so decide, however repugnant the conclusion to the inclination of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Assuming what, however, is extremely questionable, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the donor never resumed possession of the bank books after their delivery to the respondent, the fact is uncontroverted that she subsequently appropriated to her own use a part of the very fund which is claimed to have been transferred to the donee by the alleged gift <em>causa mortis. </em>By the instrumentality of those books, .in the presence and with the concurrence of the respondent, she drew \u00a7600 from the bank, and applied it to her own personal use. The alternative is inevitable that the donor never meant to part with the present possession and dominion of the thing given; or else that, in the exercise of her unquestionable right, she revoked the intended gift; and either inference is fatal to the validity of the donation. By collecting and appropriating a portion of the fund which the delivery of the books is supposed to have destined to the donee, the donor unequivocally asserted possession and dominion of the thing given ; asserted and exercised the <em>jus disponendi </em>in its utmost plenitude. \u201c There can be no gift in law, if one exercises dominion over the subject of the gift.\u201d <em>Dougherty v. </em>Moore, 18 Atl. Rep. 35. \u201cRedelivery of the subject of the gift to the donor revokes the gift.\u201d <em>Wigle </em>v. <em>Wigle, </em>6 Watts, 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The donor\u2019s act of reclamation, in itself, would operate to nullify her original intention, if such there was, to pass possession and property <em>\u2022 </em>but, indeed, it is not clear that she ever meant to relinquish dominion of the subject of the contemplated gift. The paper executed at the time of the transaction, otherwise unimportant, contains the most authentic exposition of her purpose, and by that she says, \u201c <em>if anything happens, </em>I leave all the money I have in the bank to Bridget McCusker.\u201d Here, beyond question, is not a gift <em>in praesenti, </em>defeasible upon a contingency, <em>i. e., </em>the recovery of the donor, but an inchoate gift suspended in operation and effect upon a future event, <em>i. e., </em>\u201c if anything happens.\u201d In <em>donatio ccvusa mortis </em>the condition is subsequent, and operates to defeat a title already vested; while here the condition is precedent, and intercepted the transfer of title until the something \u201chappens.\u201d With this construction of the paper, the conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of both donor and donee was in harmony. The donee, mindful of the wants of the donor, urged her to retain one of the books so that she might draw money for probable exigencies; and the donor did draw from the fund she intended as a gift, to the donee.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">If it be argued that as the money appropriated by the donor was drawn by two books and from two banks, the deposit in the other bank is unaffected, we answer, that the gift was by one act, and if an integral fund, not by several acts and in distinct parcels, that the same intention actuated and characterized the delivery of all the books, and that, by- necessary consequence, if dominion was reserved as to the deposits in two banks it was reserved as to all; or, if there was a revocation as to two, there was a revocation as to all the deposits.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">But, for another and independent reason, this pretended gift is manifestly void.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">As its name imports, a gift <em>causa mortis </em>is made in contemplation of the death of the donor, and that it be so made is an indispensable condition of its validity. A gift upon any other contingency is not a <em>donatio causa mortis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Now, the evidence utterly fails to show that it was an apprehension of death by the donor that prompted the delivery of the bank books to the defendant. True, Margaret Kirk was of infirm health ; and true, also, it is that on the occasion of the delivery of the books, she said the doctor had told her she \u201c was liable to go off at any time.\u201d But not for that did she deliver the books to the defendant. By the uncontroverted testimony \u2014 the testimony of defendant\u2019s own witnesses \u2014 another motive than the fear of death actuated the delivery of the books. Detailing the circumstances of the alleged donation, Peter Hughes testified : <em>\u201c </em>As soon as I came in she says, \u2018Well, Bridgie\u2019s employers have sent for her to go home; now you know about that letter that my sister sent me saying Thomas Kirk would come on here and carry out his intention to burn the house; now, if Bridgie goes home and he comes and burns the house <em>I </em>want her to have her share. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>* * * If lie comes on, why, Bridgie, you have got this money, he cannot touch it, you have got it.\u2019 * * * She said that if anything happened to her while Miss McCusker was away she would have something anyhow, if Thomas Kirk, her brother, should come here and do any damage. * * * She said that Miss McCusker would have this if he would come on and do any damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Kate Gaughran testified: \u201c She said, \u00a3 I want to leave all the money in bank to Miss McCusker in case anything should happen ; \"x\" * * well, if I don\u2019t see Bridget any more, I am glad I got her to take the bank books home with her.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">What, then, is the inference from these repeated expressions of Margaret Kirk ? That she delivered the bank books upon the contingency of her death, or in apprehension of the threat of Thomas Kirk to burn or tear down the house ? That the latter was the event and the only event she had in mind and intended to provide against, is manifest beyond the possibility of rational dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Indeed, that Margaret Kirk was under no apprehension of imminent death is apparent, not only from the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, but by the fact that after the so-called gift <em>causa </em>mortis, she busied herself about the details of domestic economy and in making improvements and additions to her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Mindful that the law regards gifts <em>causa mortis </em>with distrust and exacts for their support clear and convincing proof, we are unable to find in the record sufficient evidence to uphold the judgment. Whatever our reprobation of the plaintiff and sympathy with the defendant, our decision must still be in conformity with the rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Bischoff, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b327-11\">Daly, Ch. J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"ATa\">The judgment appealed from will have to be reversed for error in the admission of testimony of the defendant concerning a transaction with the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>intestate. The issue in the case was whether the deceased had personally delivered her bank books to the defendant, with the intention of making a gift to the latter of the money in the banks, and whether, thereafter, the donor had recovered possession of any of the books, and revoked the gift of the money, or any part of it. The defendant\u2019s witness, Peter Hughes, had testified to a transaction of February 12, 1892, between the deceased (Miss Kirk), and the defendant, in which the bank books were given to the latter ; but he also testified that one of the books was handed back to Miss Kirk by defendant, who subsequently, after the death of Miss Kirk, took the book from the room of deceased. The defendant was then sworn on her own behalf, and was asked how long the three bank books had been in her possession. This was objected to by plaintiff as within the prohibition of section 829 of the Code, but the objection was overruled and the plaintiffs excepted. The defendant then answered: \u201c Since the evening of February 12th of this year.\u201d A motion by plaintiff to strike out the answer as relating to a transaction with a deceased person was denied, and exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The materiality of this testimony of the defendant\u2019s was that the personal transaction and communication between deceased and herself (as testified to by Hughes) might be inferred from it; and she thus testified indirectly to both such transaction and communication. The fact she spoke of was in no just sense independent of and extrinsic to the personal transaction and communication, but derived its chief significance from its dependence upon and intrinsic connection with both.\u201d <em>Viall </em>v. Leavens, 39 Hun, 291. The case cited resembles the present closely, and is an authority directly in point; for there the witness testified to the possession of a deed the delivery of which was in question. Iii <em>Spicer </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>54 N. Y. Super. Ct. 280, a defendant Avas asked how long a deed, alleged to have been obtained from the deceased by fraud and undue influence, had been in his possession. The evidence was admitted on the ground that <em>\u201c </em>it may well have been that the deed was not delivered to the witness by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>grantor personally.\u201d In the present case the proof of such personal delivery is the basis of the witness\u2019 claim to the possession of the books.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">With respect to the merits of the' case, it may be said that the decision of the trial judge might have been sustained in part, if not wholly, but for the error pointed out above. If the redelivery of the Bleecker Street Bank pass book could be construed as a rescission of the gift, and its retention by the donor as a revocation, then it should be deemed a rescission, or revocation of the gift of the money deposited in that bank, and not of the moneys deposited in the other banks, the books of which were never delivered back to the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">But I do not think that the redelivery of the Bleecker Street Bank book affected the gift of the money in that bank in any particular. For the deceased never drew any of the money, and the book was reluctantly received by her at the urgent solicitation of the donor, and as a provision for possible contingent needs only. Nothing in this transaction indicates the slightest desire or intention on the part of the deceased to take back what had been so freely given.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">With respect to the subsequent withdrawal of money from the Emigrant Savings Bank, which Hughes says the defendant told him \u201c she got Mag to draw to send to her sister in Ireland,\u201d that money could only have been drawn on presentation of the book in defendant\u2019s possession, and it was so drawn in defendant\u2019s presence, both parties going to the bank together; and this withdrawal of the sum in question did not affect the ownership of the balance in the bank, the book being still retained by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">As to the original gift, all the constituants of the <em>donato causa mortis </em>are found in the detailed transaction. The illness or ailment of the donor, from which she never recovered before her death, which took place within six weeks; the gift <em>in preesenti </em>of the bank books to the defendant, which is a delivery of the sums credited therein <em>(Ridden </em>v. Thrall, 125 N. Y. 572; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Bowery Savings </em>Bank, 15 Daly, 403; <em>Penfield </em>v. Thayer, 2 E. D. Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>305); the words which accompanied' the gift, \u201c there is your fortune for you,\u201d together with the whole conversation, make out a case heyond even a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The written paper, which, at the time of the gift, the deceased caused to be drawn up and which she signed, \u201c I, Margaret Kirk, if anything happens, I leave all the money I have in the bank to Bridget McCusker,\u201d confirms the gift. The contingency therein expressed referred to her death. She told them that the doctor told her that the sickness would take her off at any time. If she had apprehensions about her brother coming from Ireland, they must have related to his coming after her death, for his coming during her lifetime would not affect defendant\u2019s prospects of getting <em>\u201c </em>her share.\u201d Nor does the contingency mentioned in the paper indicate that the gift was not to take effect immediately. The paper tersely expressed what the law implied in a gift <em>causa mortis. \u201c </em>Such gifts are inchoate and not perfected until the death of donor.\u201d <em>Parker </em>v. Marston, 27 Me. 196, 203. \u201c Such a gift does not become perfect until the death of the donor.\u201d <em>Parish </em>v. Stone, 14 Pick. 198, 203. \u201c A <em>donatio mortis causa </em>does not pass a title immediately, but it is only to take effect on the death of the donor.\u201d <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>24 Pick. 261, 266. The very terms of the paper signed by the deceased are singularly like the declaration of the donor in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Guile, </em>117 N. Y. 343, 346, \u201c if anything happened to him he should give or hand it (the policy and assignment) to her, Mrs. Guile,\u201d and upon these words the gift <em>causa mortis </em>was upheld. What Mrs. Kirk understood by the paper is plain enough. The witness Hughes said to her, \u201c If you want to leave the money why don\u2019t you go down to the bank and give it to Bridget ? \u201d and she said, <em>\u201c </em>that would do just as well,\u201d referring to the paper. This expression, with the delivery of the bank books,\u00abindicated that the witness understood that the disposition she had made was equivalent to drawing the money out of the bank and giving it to her niece. What room is there for doubt as to her intention ?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">There was evidence that Mrs. Kirk was entirely solvent at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the t\u00fane of the gift and retained sufficient property to pay her debts, and the gift cannot be attacked on the ground suggested by appellants and claimed to be supported by <em>Fox </em>v. Moyer, 54 N. Y. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The judgment, however, must be reversed for error in the admission of the testimony of defendant, as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
