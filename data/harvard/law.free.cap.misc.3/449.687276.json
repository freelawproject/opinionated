The charter provided : \u201cIn case two ports are used in discharging, charterers agree to leave sufficient cargo on board for ballast from Bombay to Calcutta.

In an action to recover damages, plaintiff claimed that defendants were not authorized to make the charter and were liable because the charter did not compel the charterers to deliver all the cargo at Bombay, except the 35,000 cases. <em>Held, </em>that the words of the cablegram, \u201csufficient cargo ballasting Calcutta,\u201d meant that there would be at least sufficient cargo left at Bombay to constitute ballast for Calcutta, so that plaintiff would be under no expense to buy ballast.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b496-7\"><em>Held, </em>further, that as plaintiff did not ask to go the jury on tkeequestion of the meaning of the phrase, but requested the direction of a verdict in his favor, the question became one of law for the court and there was no error in dismissing the complaint.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-8\">Appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment entered on the dismissal of his complaint at trial term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-9\"><em>Geo..

The defendants, as ship-brokers were expected to make the charter on behalf of the owner. Various cablegrams and letters passed between the parties culminating in an offer which the plaintiff accepted, by which the rate to Bombay was fixed at twenty-five, <em>\u201c </em>sufficient cargo ballasting Calcutta 21 half,\u201d with \u201c the option Bombay-Calcutta direct or combined.\u201d On June twelfth the defendants negotiated a charter of the vessel for a voyage from Hew York to Bombay and Calcutta, orto Bombay or Calcutta direct, at charterers\u2019 option, as ordered upon signing bills of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>lading, to carry a cargo of 90,000 cases, ten per cent more or less. The charter provided: \u2022 \u201c In case two ports are used in discharging, charterers agree to leave sufficient cargo on board for ballast from Bombay to Calcutta. The rate of freight is to be 25 cents per case on all cases landed at the former port; not less than 25,000 cases to be landed, and 21-J on balance cargo landed at Calcutta, if discharged in Bombay only 25 cents; if discharged in Calcutta only 21 cents.\u201d The total freight earned was $28,125.30. The ship proceeded to Bombay, where the 25,000 cases were discharged, and it thereafter sailed for Calcutta, where the balance of the cargo was unloaded. The question to be determined is whether the charter as made conforms to the authority given to the defendants, and this -depends upon the meaning of the terms used in the defendants\u2019 cablegram: \u201c Bombay 25, <em>sufficient ccvrgo ballasting </em>Calcutta 21 half.\u201d It is undisputed that 25,000 cases were a sufficient ballast for a voyage from Bombay to Calcutta, and the plaintiff claims that the language employed by the defendants conveyed to him the understanding that all the cargo was to be discharged in Bombay at twenty-five cents, except the 25,000 cases required for ballast, which were to go to Calcutta at twenty-one and one-half cents, and that in consequence of the charter not so providing he has sustained damage to the amount of $2,655.24. If the phrase in dispute has been used in letters of instruction from the plaintiff to the defendants, no liability would have attached to the latter on account of the ambiguity of the words used, for where language is ambiguous, and the agent <em>bona fide </em>adopts a permissible construction, the principal cannot, on the ground that such construction was not intended by him, disown and dishonor the act of the agent. <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>2 Q. B. 99 ; 5 id. 516; 5 Eng. App. 395 ; Whart. Agents, \u00a7\u00a7 224, 248; Benj. Sales (Perkins\u2019 ed.), \u00a7 590. The plaintiff contends that because the ambiguous language was used by the agent the converse of the rule is applicable, and the phrase is to be interpreted in the sense most beneficial to the plaintiff. <em>Wright </em>v. Williams, 20 Hun, 322; Jones Const. Com. Cont. \u00a7 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The trial judge held that the cablegram by defendants to plaintiff <em>\u201c </em>sufficient cargo ballasting Calcutta,\u201d meant that there would be at least sufficient cargo left at Bombay to constitute ballast for Calcutta, so that the plaintiff would be under no expense to buy ballast. The cablegram also admits of the technical construction applied to it by the plaintiff that <em>\u201c </em>sufficient cargo ballasting Calcutta,\u201d means enough, adequate to wants or equal to the end proposed, not more than required for the trip to Calcutta.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Which construction is to control ? The answer to this query naturally suggests another. Suppose the literal words of the cablegram had been inserted in the charter, what construction would then be placed upon them, for if the charterers would not in that event have been held to the construction urged against the shipbrokers, it is clear the latter are not liable in this action The rule requiring instruments to be construed <em>\u201c contra, proferentem </em>\u201d is not always of special value, and is most applicable to deeds poll. In cases of mutual promises, where neither party is more the undertaker than the other, the rule has no application. 2 Pars. Cont. (6th ed.) 505-510.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Testing the liability of the defendants by this rule, considering the situation and relation of the parties at the time, the subject-matter of the contract, the option and discretion asked for and not refused, the combination of the two ports expressly permitted, the absence of controlling expert evidence proving the meaning among shippers of the technical terms used in the cablegram, we are of opinion that the contract legally bears the construction put upon it by the trial judge, and that such construction must for the purposes of this case be adopted as the one controlling. True, the plaintiff as an expert gave his opinion as to the meaning of the technical terms used, and this sustains his construction thereof, but the plaintiff did not ask to go to the jury on that question, but requested the direction of a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The defendant, on the other hand, insisted upon the dismissal of the complaint. It is evident, therefore, that both parties treated the question involved as one of law for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>court, and not of fact for the jury. The plaintiff was interested in the result and his evidence not controlling <em>(Elwood </em>v. <em>Western Union Tel. Co., </em>45 N. Y. 549; <em>Kavanagh </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>70 id. 177; <em>Honegger </em>v. <em>Wettstein, </em>94 id. 252; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Diefendorf, </em>123 id. 191), so that the trial court had the right to dispose of all there was to the contention. <em>Reck </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>130 N. Y. 160; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Voorhies, </em>40 N. Y. St. Repr. 696; <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>41 id. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The defendants are not charged with breach of instructions nor of fraudulent conduct. All that is claimed against them is that the charter they entered was not for the reasons before stated, authorized by the cablegrams and correspondence which passed between the parties, and that they are in consequence liable for the damages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The fact that the <em>Lancing </em>was a water-ballast ship was unknown to the\" defendants until after the plaintiff\u2019s letter, dated June fourteenth, received long after the charter was made, so that this feature has no bearing whatever upon the rights of the parties, in no manner affects the liability sought to be enforced and throws no light upon the transaction. Though the question involved is close, we think that substantial justice has been done, and that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Sedgwick, Oh.
