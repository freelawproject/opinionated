On the trial, the complaint was dismissed on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. <em>Held, </em>error; that the complaint set up a good cause of action, provided the entire contract was in writing, and as there was no allegation to the contrary it should have been assumed that it was in writing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b71-11\">Also <em>held, </em>that a good cause of action existed on the face of the complaint on the ground of fraud.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-12\">Appeal from a judgment entered on a motion made at trial to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that it did not contain a statement of facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-13\"><em>11 d F.

Y. St. Repr. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">It seems to us in another view of the allegations, that a good cause of action can be fairly spelled out in the complaint, viz., that plaintiff was induced to enter into this executory contract for the purchase of the premises and the payment of $200, by his belief in and reliance upon the false and fraudulent representation, made by defendant for the purpose of deceiving the plaintiff, that the specified alterations could be made for $1,000. <em>Schumaker </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>133 N.
