Y. Supp. 24, and citations), that notice he not requisite in simple tenancies from month to month, here was something more; namely, a letting from month to month \u201c so long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the rent was paid.\u201d These qualifying words, in effect, make the term indefinite and entitle the tenant to hold so long as he pays the rent, or until he receives a month\u2019s notice to quit. The order reversed with costs, and restitution directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Bischoef, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
