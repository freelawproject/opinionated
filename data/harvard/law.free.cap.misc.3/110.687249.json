The Ottendorfer case was commenced first, and the plaintiff afterward brought suit against the newspaper. Both actions were brought for the same libel, published in the aforementioned newspaper. Issue was joined in the <em>Staats-Zeitung </em>case, which was placed on the calendar, and a notice of trial was served. Issue was joined in the case against Mr. Ottendorfer and a notice of trial was served, but the cause was not put upon the calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On February 9, 1893, an order was entered consolidating these two actions into one, entitled against both defendants, and directing the service of an amended complaint and answer in the consolidated action, and that \u201c said cause retain its place upon the calendar.\u201d A few days thereafter the defendant made an offer of judgment, with costs, in the action so consolidated, which was accepted and the plaintiff is about to enter judgment thereupon. Ho notice o'f trial has been served in the consolidated action. The plaintiff\u2019s proposed bill asked for costs to date in the <em>Staats-Zeihmg </em>case, and these were allowed by the clerk, although objected to by the defendant. The plaintiff asked also for costs in the Ottendorfer case, which, on being objected to by the defendant, were disallowed by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Both parties apply for a review of the clerk\u2019s taxation. The plaintiff contends that \u201c neither action was discontinued,\u201d but that both actions \u201c continue alive,\u201d and that they \u201c simply merge into each other.\u201d- The authorities, however, do not \u25a0 favor this contention. By consolidation, the other actions were \u2022 discontinued and only the consolidated action remains. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Mich. So. R. R. Co., </em>17 How. Pr. 228. The case of <em>Earl </em>v. <em>Lefferts, </em>1 Johns. Cas. 395, decided in 1800, seems to hold to the contrary; but this case cannot be regarded as an authority, \u2022for the very objects of consolidation are to prevent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>unnecessary accumulation of costs and a multiplicity of actions. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>9 Johns. 262 ; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>3 Wend. 441; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Mich. So. R. R. Co., 17 </em>How. Pr. 228; <em>Third Ave. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>54 N. Y. 159. See 2 McCarty\u2019s Civ. Proc. Rep. 177, note on consolidation of actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Where a consolidation is ordered, the successful party will be entitled to tax only the costs of the consolidated action, unless the right to tax the costs of the discontinued action is reserved in the order. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Mich. So. R. R. Co., </em>17 How. Pr. 228; 1 Rumsey\u2019s Pr. 236. Hogeboom, J., in delivering the opinion of the court in the case of <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Mich. So. R. R. Co., </em>17 How. Pr. 228, well says:I know of no principle by which costs, in actions discontinued, can be included in another action, even though it embraces the cause of action in the first. Provision for such costs must be made in the discontinued actions before they finally cease to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Inasmuch as the order of consolidation contains no provision reversing the right to costs of the original actions, already accrued, it follows that the plaintiff is not entitled to costs in either of them. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Mich. So. R. R. Co., 17 </em>How. Pr. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The plaintiff, therefore, should be allowed only costs of the consolidated action.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">For these reasons, the taxation of the plaintiff\u2019s costs should be set aside, and a new taxation directed <em>before </em>the clerk, who should allow to the plaintiff costs and disbursements in the consolidated action only from the time of the consolidation of the original actions, viz., February 9, 1893, to the time when the offer of judgment was made, and disallow items in the two actions which were consolidated. The clerk will, therefore, allow only for proceedings <em>before </em>notice of trial, and disbursements made or incurred since February 9, 1893, to the time when the offer of judgment was made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
