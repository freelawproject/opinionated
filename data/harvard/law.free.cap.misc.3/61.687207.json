Putting in evidence the agreement called a <em>u </em>lease,\u201d and a former judgment between the parties, plaintiff rested; and, thereupon, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, for defect of proof of liability under the lease, and of rent due on the first of December. Upon denial of the motion, the defendant offered no evidence, and the court directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that no right of recovery was shown is clearly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In a former action between the same parties upon the same instrument, plaintiff recovered an installment of rent <em>\u201c </em>which became due on the 1st day of March, 1891, in advance, for the quarter then commencing.\u201d This judgment conclusively established defendant\u2019s liability under the lease, and that an installment of rent fell due on the first of March.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">As by the terms of the lease the rent was payable quarterly in advance, and by the judgment a quarter\u2019s rent became due on the first of March, the inevitable result was that another installment was payable on the first of December. \u201c The estoppel of a former judgment extends to every material matter within the issues which was expressly litigated and determined, and also to those matters which, although not expressly determined, were comprehended and involved in the thing expressly stated and decided, whether they were or were not actually litigated or considered. It is not necessary that issue should have been taken upon the precise point controverted in the second action.\u201d <em>Campbell, etc., </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>114 N. Y. 7; <em>Lorillard </em>v. <em>Clyde, </em>122 id. 41. The efficacy of the former judgment was not impaired by the fact that it was taken by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>default. <em>Brown </em>v. Mayor, 66 N. Y. 385 ; <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>85 id. 253; <em>Gates </em>v. Preston, 41 id. 113; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>48 id. 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Appellant contends, nevertheless, that the corporate capacity of the plaintiff was not proved on the trial. Assuming this fact not adjudicated by the former judgment, still the objection is unavailing, since the answer contains no affirmative allegation that the plaintiff is not a corporation. Code, \u00a7 1776.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Again, appellant insists that here was no evidence of default in the rent; but the complaint alleges its nonpayment, and the answer, simply a denial, raises no issue as to the fact. <em>Lent </em>v. <em>New York, etc., R. Co., </em>130 N. Y. 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Bischoff and Giegebioh, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
