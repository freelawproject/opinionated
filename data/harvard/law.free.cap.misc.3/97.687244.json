All the coats except those of plaintiff were finished and returned by defendant to G., and upon the remaining lot, defendant claimed a lien for the work done upon those returned. In an action by plaintiffs to recover possession of their coats, a judgment was rendered sustaining defendant\u2019s lien. <em>Held, </em>error; that in order to enable defendant to acquire a lien thereon it should have appeared that G. was authorized by plaintiffs to hire defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-8\">Appeal from, a judgment of a District Court in the city of Hew York.

Gewirtz, without the knowledge of Gluckman <em>&amp; </em>Gross, employed Herman Kleiman, defendant, to make the buttonholes of a greater number of coats, including those of Gluckman <em>&amp; </em>Gross, which were delivered to him in one lot. All the coats delivered to Kleiman, except those of Gluckman <em>&amp; </em>Gross, were finished and returned to Gewirtz, and upon the remaining coats Kleiman claimed a lien for the work done upon those returned. Upon demand by Gluckman &amp; Gross for return of their coats, Kleiman asserted his supposed lien, and in an action to recover possession he had judgment sustaining the claim of a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">It is indisputable that an artisan, who by his skill and labor enhances the value of the goods of another, has a lien for his agreed or reasonable charges, which extends to all the goods delivered to him under one contract <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Congdon, </em>4 N. Y. 552; <em>Schmidt </em>v. Blood, 9 Wend. 268; <em>Moore </em>v. Hitchcock, 4 id. 292), and that the return of part of the goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>does not impair the lien for the labor bestowed thereon as against the goods remaining. <em>Wiles Laundering Co. </em>v. <em>Hahlo, </em>105 N. Y. 234; 3 Pars. Cont. 257. Bnt to enable the artisan to acquire the lien it must appear that the person from whom he has obtained possession of the goods was authorized to dispose of them for that purpose (3 Pars. Cont. 242), either as owner, or with the owner\u2019s consent, express or implied. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Delahunt, </em>65 N. Y. 128 ; <em>White </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>43 Am. Rep. 347; <em>Small </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>31 id. 299 ; <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Usher, </em>20 id. 208; <em>Gilson </em>v. <em>Gwinn, </em>107 Mass. 126. A mere bailee for hire has no such authority. <em>Small </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>31 Am. Rep. 299; 4 Lawson\u2019s Rights, Remedies &amp; Practice, -2983, \u00a7 1742. Accordingly, it was held that a mechanic who was employed by another, with whom the owner had contracted for work upon a chattel, could not claim a lien in his own right as against the owner for the value of his share of the work performed, and this notwithstanding the fact that the owner knew that he was performing the work while it was in progress <em>(Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>19 Pick. 228), and that one who had in good faith purchased a chattel from another who claimed to be the owner, and had by the expenditure of a considerable sum for repairs greatly improved the value of the chattel before he had ascertained the true owner\u2019s rights, could not, as against the latter, assert a lien for the expenditures. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>34 Conn. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The evidence is destitute of everything from which plaintiffs\u2019 consent to defendant\u2019s right as lienor can he inferred, and the judgment should, therefore, he reversed, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Pbyor, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
