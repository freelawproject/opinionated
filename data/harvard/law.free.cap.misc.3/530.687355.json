I give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Jeanette Weil, all my estate, real and personal and mixed, and of every name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>and nature, and whatsoever the same may be at the time of my death, to be held and enjoyed by her, together with the rents, issues, income, interest, gains and profits thereof for and during the term of her natural life, if she shall so long continue my widow, upon the express condition, however, that she shall out of such income maintain and educate my children during their minority * * * 4th. The provisions hereinbefore made for, and the devises and bequests to my said wife subject to. the maintenan\u00f3e and education of my children during their minority as aforesaid, are only made and given upon condition that she accept the same in lieu of all dower or thirds in my estate.\u201d It does not appear that the widow entered upon any lands which were assigned to her for dower, or that she commenced proceedings to recover her dower or for the assignment thereof, within one year after the testator\u2019s death, and under the provisions of the Revised Statutes of this state (3 R. S. 2198, \u00a7 14, Banks &amp; Bros. 7th ed.) she must be deemed to have elected to accept the testamentary provisions for her benefit in lieu of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Some time after the testator\u2019s death, Michael Lang, the appellant, obtained a lien pursuant to the provisions of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, (Laws of 1885, chap. 342) upon the widow\u2019s interest in the real property devised to her, for services performed and materials furnished in and about certain improvements and repairs. This lien was appropriately foreclosed by action in this court and the widow\u2019s interest decreed to be sold. At the sale Lang became the purchaser, and by the referee\u2019s deed, which is dated December 13, 1892, her interest was conveyed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Thereupon, Lang demanded payment of the month\u2019s rent which became due and payable in advance on the 1st day of February, 1893, from John Everling, who was conceded to be the tenant and lessee in possession under a lease from the widow, and upon his refusal to pay, proceedings to dispossess him were instituted by Lang on the ground that he continued in possession after default in the payment of rent without the landlord\u2019s permission. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2231, subd. 2. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the trial, it was contended for the tenant that the widow\u2019s estate under the will of Jules Weil was that of a trustee <em>to </em>receive the rents, issues and profits and to apply them towards the maintenance and education of the testator\u2019s children during their respective minorities; that Lang did not obtain a valid lien upon the trust estate, because such an estate is incapable of sale; and that he did not for the same reason acquire any interest in the premises by means of the foreclosure sale and the referee\u2019s deed to him, and so was not entitled to maintain proceedings to recover possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Could we agree to the trial justice\u2019s construction of the will of Jules Weil, the judgment appealed from would require our affirmance A trust estate is inalienable by express provision of law when the trust is expressed in the instrument which creates the estate. 3 R. S. 2183, \u00a7 65, Banks <em>&amp; </em>Bros. 7th ed. <em>Powers </em>v. Bergen, 6 N. Y. 360 ; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>18 id. 107; <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>20 id. 21; <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Topping, </em>48 id. 444; <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Cruger, </em>80 id. 15. Neither a creditor of the trustee personally nor of him in his representative-capacity can acquire by means of the assertion of a lien any rights respecting the trust estate which the trustee did not h^ve, and it follows that if the widow, as devisee of Jules Weil, obtained only a life estate in trust for the testator\u2019s children, that a pretended lien and a sale in proceedings to foreclose it are*inef\u00edectual to transfer the estate to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">But we are of the opinion that the will devised a life estate to the widow, charged only with the maintenance and education of the testator\u2019s children, which was determinable upon her remarriage, and that after providing for the maintenance and support of the children, the remainder of the rents, issues and profits inured to the benefit of the devisee of the life estate. That such was the testator\u2019s intention we think clearly appears from the language of the will; but if there is any ambiguity therein it is dispelled by the fact that the widow is required to elect between her right of dower and acceptance of the devise and bequest to her. Such an election may be imposed only when the testamentary provisions confer some benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the widow (3 R. S. 2198, \u00a7 13, Banks &amp; Bros. 7th ed.), and that the testator required his widow to elect between her dower and the provisions of the will manifests an intention to devjse to her something more than a nominal estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">A \u201c charge \u201d upon land by will is distinguished from a \u201c trust \u201d of the land, in that in the case of the former, the land is devised generally for the beneficial enjoyment of the devisee, subject, however, to the payment by him of a specific sum, or specific sums of money, or the performance of a particular duty, while in the case of a \u201c trust,\u201d the devise is limited to Some particular purpose, with no beneficial interest in the devisee. 13 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 109, note; <em>King </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>1 V. <em>&amp; </em>B. (Eng.) 260, 272; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>2 Myl. <em>&amp; </em>Cr. (Eng.) 684; <em>Tregonwell </em>v. <em>Sydenham, </em>3 Dowl. (Eng.) 194,210. It will be observed that the will under consideration devises to the testator\u2019s widow the income of all his estate generally, with no directions respecting its application, except that out of it she is to maintain and educate his children. This, under the definitions given above, excludes a \u201c trust \u201d and implies a \u201c charge.\u201d See, also, <em>Dill </em>v. <em>Wisner, </em>88 N. Y. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The life estate devised to the widow was capable of alienation by her in the absence of a condition restraining it, subject, of course, to the charge imposed thereon by the terms of the will. 16 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 881; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Van Hoesen, </em>4 Cow. 325. She was an \u201cowner\u201d within the Hechanics\u2019 Lien Law (Laws of 1885, chap. 342), upon whose interest a valid lien could be obtained for services performed and materials furnished in erecting, altering or repairing any house, etc., with his consent, to the extent of such owner\u2019s interest, whether it be that of a fee or of a less estate, and upon the foreclosure of the lien the widow\u2019s life estate, subject to the \u201c charge,\u201d was effectually transferred from her to the purchaser at the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The conveyance of the widow\u2019s estate to Lang, as purchaser at the foreclosure sale, was without any reservation respecting rent, and he, therefore, became entitled, as owner of the lessor\u2019s reversion, to all future accruing rent. <em>Demarest </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Willard, </em>8 Cow. 206; <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Street, </em>Anthon\u2019s N. P. 276; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>1 Johns. Cas. 81; <em>Jackson v Raymond, </em>Id. 86, note; Gear\u2019s Landl. &amp; Ten. \u00a7 130. As between him and the lessee, the conventional relation of landlord and tenant was created by the conveyance. <em>Birdsall </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>17 Wend. 464, 473. No attornment was necessary (3 R. S. 2195, \u00a7 146, Banks <em>&amp; </em>Bros. 7th ed.; 12 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 664; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>12 Abb. Pr. 103), and the purchaser became entitled to all the remedies for nonperformance of the covenants and conditions on the part of the lessee to he performed as the lessor might have maintained had the reversion remained in him. 3 R. S. 2203, \u00a7 23, Banks <em>&amp; </em>Bros. 7th ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Neither can it be successfully disputed that the grantee of the lessor\u2019s reversionary estate, whether he became such by voluntary conveyance or judicial sale, is entitled to maintain proceedings to recover possession of the premises, upon the tenant\u2019s or lessee\u2019s default in the payment of rent, under the provisions of sections 2231 <em>et seq. </em>of the Code of Civil Procedure. ' The term \u201c landlord,\u201d as used in section 2231, is not restricted to designate the lessor only, but includes the grantee of the latter\u2019s estate. That this is so appears from subdivision 2 of the section last referred to, by which it is required that a previous demand of payment of the rent shall be made, not in behalf of the lessor, but <em>\u201c </em>in behalf of the person entitled \u201d thereto, and from section 2235, which prescribes that application for the removal of the tenant may be made by the landlord or lessor, or by the legal representative, agent or assignee of the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Our conclusion from the foregoing is, that the trial justice erred in dismissing the proceedings, and that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the prevailing party to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the prevailing party to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Bookstaver, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u2022 Judgment reversed, new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
