In an action afterwards, brought to enforce said lien, judgment was rendered for plaintiff, and on defendants\u2019 failure to pay the same this action was brought to recover on the bond. The defendants Hauff and Muller did not answer, and Erslev and Updike demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. An order was entered overruling the demurrer as frivolous, and granting judgment thereon in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the relief demanded in the complaint.
