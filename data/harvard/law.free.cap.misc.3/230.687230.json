But, as is apparent, equally from the complaint and from the charge, the action is not for an excessive levy merely, but is also for an abuse of the process of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">It was shown, and indeed is conceded, that, in the execution of the attachment, the defendant took papers he was not authorized to take by the writ <em>(Hergman </em>v. Dettlebach, 11 How. Pr. 46), and committed other acts in abuse of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>process. Thus, he became a trespasser <em>ab </em>initio, and is answerable for all the consecpiences of his unlawful entry upon plaintiff\u2019s premises and seizure of her goods. <em>Carnrick </em>v. Myers, 14 Barb. 1; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Crofoot, </em>5 Wend. 507; <em>Adams </em>v. Rivers, 11 Barb. 390 ; <em>Dumont </em>v. Smith, 4 Den. 319, 321; Six <em>Carpenters\u2019 </em>Case, 8 Coke, 432; 1 Smith L. C. 259; <em>Duke of Brunswick </em>v. Slowman, 8 Mann., Gr. &amp; S. 317; <em>Garden </em>v. <em>Sabey, </em>10 Wkly. Dig. 33. Indeed, upon the evidence, we are bound to say that the conduct of the defendant\u2019s deputies was .rather a raid than a levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In view, then, of the nature of the action, it is apparent, at once, that the acts of the defendant\u2019s deputies in execution of the attachment and in pretended pursuance of the process, were competent and material evidence; and that the amount of the verdict could be restrained within no defined limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">At the same time, because of the character of the wrong which tended so strongly to inflame the passions of the jury; and because of the wide range allowed them in the estimate of damages, it is our duty to scrutinize the record to see if any evidence were wrongly admitted which probably swelled the verdict beyond the measure of justice. <em>Hinman </em>v. <em>Hare, </em>1 Silvernail (Ct. App.), 241, 246; 5 <em>N. </em>Y. St. Repr. 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">A witness for the plaintiff, her son, was permitted against objection, to testify that he had sued the defendant for taking away some of his papers, and that after a year and a half of delay his claim was satisfied. Thus, the wrong to the plaintiff was aggravated by the addition of another wrong to her son, and by proof of an extorted confession of the wrong by the defendant. The evidence was indisputably incompetent, and of inevitable prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">So, likewise, evidence was received of the taking of the property of the wife, son and daughter, a fact which could not fail to augment the indignation of the jury against the defendant. True, no objection was interposed to the evidence, but in review of an order denying a motion to set aside a verdict as perverse, excessive in amount, and contrary to the law and evidence, the court at General Term, in the exercise of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>discretion, may award a new trial although no exception was taken. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Amazon Ins. Co., </em>79 N. Y. 506, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Again, the computation of plaintiff\u2019s damages as submitted to the jury and presented to us on the argument, included 600 American gold dollars, and 1,285 Russian roubles, which the plaintiff swore was the property of her children. Indeed, she testified that \u201c none of the money belonged to my husband ; they took no money from Mr. G-runberg, but only goods.\u201d And yet for this money, the property of others, the plaintiff has recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The case discloses other allegations of error, some of apparent merit, but enough is already shown to necessitate a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">As was intimated by the learned trial judge in his opinion, the true theory of the action was misconceived by the parties, and it is not to be doubted but that the interests of justice will be promoted by another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Bischoff, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
