Appellant was charged with having negligently permitted the cellar entrance to remain open and uncovered without guarding against the risk of injury to passers-by, and the sidewalk in front thereof obstructed, while its servants and employees were engaged in the delivery of goods to T. The complaint further alleged that by reason of the several acts of the defendant, plaintiff, while proceeding along the street, without fault or negligence on her part, fell into the open cellar, and in that manner sustained the injury for which she sought to recover in this action. <em>Meld, </em>that so far as appellant was concerned, the facts alleged were sufficient to constitute a cause of action for damages resulting from an injury sustained by plaintiff through\" the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b348-11\">At the opening of the trial, appellant moved for the dismissal of the complaint for insufficiency. <em>Meld, </em>that it was properly denied ; defendant\u2019s proper course was to have compelled plaintiff to elect between the causes of action, and if she had elected to proceed upon that for damages resulting from the creation and maintenance of a nuisance, the motion for dismissal of the complaint as against the appellant would have been proper and should have been granted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b348-12\">Previous to the dismissal of the complaint as against the owner, plaintiff was permitted to prove, under appellant\u2019s objection, certain city ordinances -which in effect prohibited the construction and maintenance of cellar doors extending into the street beyond a specified distance, and also survey of the cellar entrance and the testimony of the surveyor was received. <em>Meld, </em>that as at the time of its admission the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>competent and relevant to the issues under the pleadings on a dismissal o\u00ed the complaint as to the owner, the appellant should have moved to strike the evidence out, or have asked that the jury be instructed to disregard it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-5\">Before the dismissal of the complaint, appellant, on cross-examination of the surveyor, sought to prove that like cellar entrances had existed in the city for many years and then existed in the vicinity of the premises described in the complaint. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was properly excluded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-6\">Plaintiff, on her direct-examination, testified that her husband was blind. <em>Held, </em>that as a motion to strike out her testimony as irresponsive included competent and relevant evidence tending to show how her fall was caused, it was properly denied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-7\">Plaintiff was asked on her direct-examination, \u201cHas your hurt ever been entirely cured?\" This was received, though objected to as improper. <em>Held, </em>that as the action was for negligence of appellant, plaintiff was entitled, under the general allegation of damage, to have included in her recovery, compensation for the pain and suffering endured up to the time of the trial and to be endured in the future.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">Appeal from judgment for plaintiff, which was entered upon a verdict, and from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-9\">Action to recover damages for. an injury sustained from the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants in the use of a cellar entrance adjacent to the street, and the street in front thereof, while engaged in the delivery of merchandise to the occupant of a building, from one of defendant\u2019s trucks.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-10\"><em>Geo.

The latter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>charged with the maintenance of the nuisance as lessee of the premises. Defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly &amp; Fogarty Company, was charged with having negligently permitted the cellar entrance to remain open and uncovered without guarding against the risk of injury to passers-by, and the side-walk in front thereof obstructed, while its servants and employees were engaged in the delivery of a number of barrels of ale to Tall\u00f3n between seven and eight o\u2019clock in the evening of April 2, 1891. The complaint further states that by reason of the several acts of the defendants, plaintiff, while proceeding along New Chambers street, without fault or negligence on her part, fell into the open cellar and in that manner sustained the injury from which she sought to recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">It seems indisputable that with respect to defendants Moore and Tall\u00f3n the complaint was framed as upon a cause of action for damages resulting from the creation and maintenance of a nuisance <em>(Forde </em>v. Nichols, 36 N. Y. St. Repr. 729, and cases there cited) with which the defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly <em>&amp; </em>Fogarty Company, was wholly disconnected, but so far as concerns the last-mentioned defendant, who is the only appellant, the facts alleged are sufficient to constitute a cause of action for damages resulting from an injury sustained by plaintiff through the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">At the opening of the trial counsel for defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly &amp; Fogarty Company, moved to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency, but for the reasons already stated the motion was properly denied. The proper course for the defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly &amp; Fogarty Company, would have been to compel plaintiff to elect between the causes of action, and then, if she had elected to proceed upon that for damages resulting from the creation and maintenance of a nuisance, the motion for dismissal of the complaint as against the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly <em>&amp; </em>Fogarty Company would have been proper and should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Respecting defendants Tall\u00f3n and the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly <em>&amp; </em>Fogarty Company, the use of the street in front of the premises for the delivery of merchandise was for the time being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>lawful, so neither <em>per se </em>nor <em>prima facie </em>a nuisance <em>(Callanan </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>107 N. Y. 360), and observing the allegations of negligence in the use of the cellar entrance and street for the purposes mentioned, the learned trial judge properly treated the action as against the defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly &amp; Fogarty Company, to be one for negligence. This also disposes of the contention that on the trial plaintiff was permitted, against the objection of the defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly &amp; Fogarty Company, to substitute and litigate a different cause of action for the one alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">When plaintiff rested the court dismissed the complaint as against defendant Moore. Previous to this plaintiff was permitted under objection by counsel for the defendant, the O\u2019Reilly, Skelly &amp; Fogarty Company, to introduce in evidence certain city ordinances which in effect prohibit the construction and maintenance of cellar doors extending into the street beyond a specified distance. Under like objection a survey showing the cellar entrance and the testimony of the surveyor were admitted in evidence. The complaint, however, charged, and the answer of the appellant denied, that the cellar entrance in front of the premises was constructed and maintained in violation of the ordinances. Hence, at the time of its admission the evidence was competent and relevant to the issues under the pleadings, and at any rate admissible as against defendants Moore and Tall\u00f3n. Laws of 1818, chap. 219, p. 213, as amended by Laws of 1819, chap. 211, \u00a7 1, p. 290; <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>New York Central, etc., R. Co., </em>63 N. Y. 530. If upon the dismissal of the complaint as against defendant Moore, and the prosecution of the action against the remaining defendants as one for negligence, the evidence admitted was irrelevant the defendants should have moved to have it struck out or requested the court to instruct the jury to disregard it. Again, before the dismissal of the complaint as against the defendant Moore, counsel for appellant-defendant on cross-examination of Lynch, the surveyor, sought to show that like cellar entrances to the one in question had existed in this city for many years and then existed in the vicinity of the prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ises described in the complaint, bnt this evidence was excluded. Assuming it to have been relevant at the times of taking exception to its exclusion, because the action had proceeded as one for a nuisance, it ceased to be so when the action continued as one for negligence. That there were other cellar entrances elsewhere in the city or vicinity of the premises could not in any sense help the appellant-defendant to relieve it from the exercise of due care in the use of the particular cellar entrance in question or the street in front thereof. The exclusion of the evidence was, therefore, not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Appellant next contends that the trial judge improperly refused to strike out certain irresponsive testimony on plaintiff\u2019s direct examination. This testimony was to the effect that plaintiff\u2019s husband was blind. On a proper motion it ought certainly to have been stricken out, as by the pleadings plaintiff was confined to the recovery of compensatory damages for the injury sustained by her, and that her husband was blind or crippled could in no wise tend to establish either that appellant-defendant was negligent, plaintiff free from contributory negligence, or the extent of the injury or damages to which she was entitled. <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. Roy, 102 U. S. 451; <em>Platner </em>v. <em>Platner, </em>78 N. Y. 90, 102; <em>Farmers\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>2 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 88, 90. But the motion to strike out included evidence tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s fall was caused by a rope stretched across the sidewalk, a fact which was competent and relevant to the questions of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence. Hence, the motion was properly denied. <em>McCabe </em>v. Brayton, 38 N. Y. 196; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>87 id. 508, 512. It was not thereafter renewed, nor was the court asked to instruct the jury to disregard the objectionable testimony. Baylies Trial Pr. 205 <em>etseg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Plaintiff was asked on her direcfiexamination, \u201c Has your hurt ever been entirely cured ? \u201d This was answered under objection and exception, the objection being that the inquiry\" was \u201cimproper,\u201d and the subject-matter thereof not pleaded. The question was plainly intended to elicit the fact of the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tinned, effect of the injury upon the witness, and, construing the action, as we do, to he one for negligence against the appellant-defendant, plaintiff was entitled, under a general allegation of damage, to have included in her recovery, compensation for the.pain and suffering endured up to the time of trial, and to be thereafter endured. <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Third Ave. R. R. Co., </em>1 Misc. Rep. 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">An exception was taken to the alleged charge of the learned trial judge, \u201c that the jury may take into consideration what the physicians consider as reasonably certain would he the permanent injury to the plaintiffbut what he did charge, was that the jury \u201c may take into consideration what the physicians have said as to the permanency of the injury,\u201d thus merely referring the jury to the testimony, and not assuming the injury to he of a permanent nature. But the evidence was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s inference that the injury was permanent. Dr. Shannon testified: \u201cAt her age, unless it was treated gradually (meaning plaintiff\u2019s arm) with manipulation and moving about, she won\u2019t recover the use of it. The prospect is, I think, it will remain permanently injured and we understand this to mean that while there was a possibility of a cure by gradual manipulation and moving about of the arm, it was not within the hounds of probability, because of plaintiff\u2019s advanced age, and her injury was, therefore, reasonably certain to remain permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The complaint alleged that the appellant-defendant was, at the t\u00fane of plaintiff\u2019s injury, engaged in the brewing business In the city of New York, and owned trucks and horses, and employed drivers and assistants in and about its business. This was not denied by answer, and must, therefore, be taken as admitted (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 522); and the admission, with the evidence that the truck from which the ale was being delivered at the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury, bore the name of \u201cO\u2019Reilly, Skelly&amp; Fogarty,\u201d coupled with appellant-defendant\u2019s refusal to disprove its ownership thereof, and the employment of the men assisting in the delivery of the ale, on the trial, was sufficient to sustain a finding that such was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>property of the appellant-defendant, and the men its servants and employees. <em>Seaman </em>v. Kochler, 122 N. Y. 646 ; <em>Wylde </em>v. <em>Northern R. Co., </em>53 id. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The remaining exceptions are without gravity, viewing the action as one for negligence, and not for the creation and maintenance of a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b354-7\">Pbtob, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"Axh\">In form the complaint is undoubtedly faulty, since it alleges two several and distinct wrongs, for each of which only some of the defendants were responsible. As the causes of action so combined do not affect all the parties they were improperly united, but the appellant\u2019s remedy was by demurrer, and by failure to demur it waived the vice in the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">True, the appellant was not answerable for the creation or maintenance of the alleged nuisance in the highway, but the verdict does not proceed upon appellant\u2019s liability for the nuisance. The complaint explicitly imputes to the appellant that it obstructed the sidewalk in so careless, negligent and unlawful a manner that thereby the plaintiff was precipitated into the excavation. The evidence tended to establish the allegation of negligence against the appellant; the court submitted the issue of negligence to the jury, and the verdict finds the fact of negligence upon sufficient proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The appellant, however, insists that it owed no such duty to the plaintiff as would support an imputation of negligence. The contention is untenable. Whoever uses the highway and for whatever purpose is under obligation so to conduct as not unreasonably and carelessly to expose to peril another lawfully engaged on the highway. Indeed, in every situation and relation of life the law exacts proper care to avoid injury to another. <em>Sie utere tuo ut alienum non Icedas </em>is a principle of universal prevalence.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Other exceptions are obviated by the argument in the prevailing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
