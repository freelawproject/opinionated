In <em>DeLavallette </em>v. <em>Wendt, </em>75 N. Y. 579, the instrument was as follows: \u201c $500. \u201c New York, <em>November </em>3, \u201966.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">\u201c Received from D. M. Peyser five hundred dollars, due on demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">It was held that the instrument did not sufficiently name a payee, bearer or otherwise; that the effect of the omission was to render the instrument a mere receipt of the payment of money and as such open to explantion by parol evidence. Edwards Bills. <em>&amp; </em>Prom. Notes, 131, star paging; <em>Union Trust Co. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Whiton, 97 </em>N. Y. 172. As the instrument in the case at bar is essentially identical, except as to the time of payment, with the one in <em>DeLavallette </em>v. <em>Wendt, 75 </em>N. Y. 579, there is no escape from the conclusion that the court below erred in excluding the evidence referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">Waiving the defect, however, and viewing the instrument sufficient for the purposes of a promissory note, it was nevertheless competent, as between the parties and their privies with notice, to show a failure of consideration, and this by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>parol evidence. 1 Rice Ev. 274 ; 2 id. 1137; Randolph Neg. Inst. \u00a7 565; <em>Bookstaver </em>v. <em>Jayne, </em>60 N. Y. 146 ; <em>Isaacs </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>15 Daly, 490; <em>Homestead Bank </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>48 N. Y. St. Repr. 775; <em>Juilliard </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>92 N. Y. 529, 535. That an instrument recites the receipt of a consideration at most, clothes it with the dual character of contract and receipt. As the latter it is but <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the fact and open to rebuttal by oral proof. <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>28 N. Y. 590 ; <em>Abbe </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>51 id. 410; <em>Van Etten </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>15 Daly, 538, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Other exceptions of gravity appear in the record, but as the one discussed requires reversal we refrain from specially noticing those remaining, as the alleged error thereby presented may not again occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial ordered, with the costs of this appeal to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b303-7\">Petos, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"AsC\">On perusal of the record the inference is unavoidable that the court declined to permit counsel for the defendant to sum up to the jury on the issue submitted to then1 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">After passing upon a motion by plaintiffs counsel for the direction of a verdict, the court immediately proceeded to-charge the jury, and at the earliest moment possible without an indecent interruption, counsel for defendant asked, \u201cAre we not to have an opportunity to sum up the case ? \u201d to which the court responded, \u201c Ro summing up is necessary * * * inasmuch as there is but one simple question of fact for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Be the issue simple or complex, counsel have a legal right to be heard upon it before the jury. If the court may deny the privilege upon the assumption that the case is too plain for argument, then the exercise of the privilege stands, not-upon legal right, but upon the misconception, or caprice, or arbitrary volition of the court. To this proposition I cannot, assent. The dictum in its support <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>8 N. Y. 67, 77), is of no authority and is repugnant alike to the rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of litigants and the duty of counsel. 2 Rumsey\u2019s Pr. 304; <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>29 Kans. 527, per Brewer, J.; <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Wilcoxson, </em>11 Ga. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Upon this ground I concur in the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">Judgment reversed._</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
