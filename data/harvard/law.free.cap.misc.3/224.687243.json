Ports, bays and harbors to the distance, at least, of a marine league from the shore are within the territorial jurisdiction and subject to the municipal law of the sovereign of the adjacent land. Accordingly <em>held, </em>that, in an action for the death of one by an act on board of a vessel lying in the port of a foreign country, at a point not more than two miles from the shore, a failure by the plaintiff to show that, by the law of that country, such death was an actionable wrong, is fatal to a recovery.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b270-10\">In an action for negligent injury, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to prove his non-negligence; and in the absence of evidence to the point, he should be nonsuited.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b270-11\">The relation of master and servant is ascertained, not by the relative rank of the two, but by the nature of the act to be done.

Co., </em>23 N. Y. 465 ; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>77 id. 546; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Columbia S. N. Co., </em>84 id. 48; <em>Wooden </em>v. <em>Western New Work &amp; P. R. R. Co., </em>126 id. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Incontestably the decision of the appeal, in one of its aspects, is suspended upon the application of these principles to the case in controversy. Counsel for the respondent so conceded on the trial, and accordingly, maintaining that the <em>locus </em>of the transaction was a British vessel on the high seas, and invoking, the recognized rule that the law of the flag is the law of a. vessel so situate <em>(McDonald </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>77 N. Y. 546), he introduced in evidence Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, by which the-death of a human being by the wrongful act of another is made the subject of a civil action. The appellant challenged the contention, and assuming the position that as it appeared by uncontroverted proof that the act in litigation was committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Colombia, and as no evidence was adduced that by the law of that country the alleged wrong is actionable, he moved to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We are of the opinion that the ground upon which the appellant stood is impregnable; and that the learned trial judge erred in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">When the plaintiff rested it was in evidence, by the log book, that at the time of the accident, the vessel was in the harbor of Savanilla, where the port authorities were received, where passengers and mails were discharged, and where the cargoes were delivered and taken in. A witness for the plaintiff testified: \u201c I couldn\u2019t tell how far the shore was</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">from the ship, when this accident happened; I couldn\u2019t calculate the distance. We could see tho shore from the ship, but I couldn\u2019t tell the distance. I should think it wouldn\u2019t be three miles.\u201d On the part of the defendant the evidence as \u2022 to the locality of the vessel was, that \u201c she was in the bay of Savanilla, a mile and three-quarters or two miles from the shore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Upon this uncontested state of fact, the question was one of law for decision by the court, whether at the time of the accident the vessel was on the high sea, as claimed by the plaintiff, or within the territory of the United States of Colombia, as asserted by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">That the vessel was not on the high sea, but was within the dominion and subject to the laws of the United States of Colombia, is, upon the authority of the publicists, an obvious and undeniable proposition. \u201cThe maritime territory of every state extends to the ports, harbors, bays, mouths of rivers, and adjacent parts of the sea inclosed by headlands belonging to the same state. The general usage of nations superadds to this extent of territorial jurisdiction, a distance of a marine league, or as far as a cannon shot will reach from the shore, all along the coasts of the state. Within these limits its rights of property and territorial jurisdiction are absolute, and exclude those of every other nation.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s Wheaton, part II, oh, IY, \u00a7 6, p. 320. \u201c The exclusive dominion of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>state unquestionably extends to those portions of the sea adjoining its territory embraced by harbors, gulfs, bays and estuaries, and into the open sea to the distance of a marine league.\u201d 1 Kent\u2019s Comm. 29, 30, marginal jiages.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u201c The ports and roadsteads are unquestionably a part of the territory and subject to the exclusive dominion of the state to which they belong, to the same extent as the land itself. They are governed in all respects by the municipal law.\u201d Pom. Inter. Law. \u00a7 lio.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">And the same doctrine is pronmlgated by the tribunal in this country of highest authority on the subject. \u201c Between nations the minimum limit of the territorial jurisdiction of a nation over tidewaters is a marine league from its coast.\u201d <em>Manchester </em>v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240, 258. \u201cIt is part of the law of civilized nations that when a merchant vessel of one country enters the ports of another for the purposes of trade it subjects itself to the law of the place to which it goes, unless by treaty or otherwise the two countries have come to some different understanding or agreement.\u201d <em>Wildenhus' </em>Case, 120 U. S. 1, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Upon a critical examination of the cases cited by the respondent, we find nothing to the contrary of the proposition that the rights of the parties to this litigation are to be determined by the law of the United States of Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The act upon which the suit proceeds having been committed abroad, the burden was on the plaintiff to prove it an actionable wrong; and as she produced no evidence in support of the proposition, the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Assuming, however, that at the time of the accident, the vessel was on the high sea, and so subject to the law of England, which authorizes an action for the death of a human being; still, upon a familiar principle, the law of the forum regulates the burden of proof and the quantum of evidence requisite to a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">It is a settled rule in the jurisprudence of this state that, to maintain an action for an injury by the negligence of another, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish the fact that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>negligence of Ms own contributed to cause that injury. Proof of the fact need not be positive, but may be circumstantial; still the non-negligence of the plaintiff must result as the rational conclusion from adequate evidence. It cannot rest in surmise or conjecture only; nor is it shown when the circum- \u25a0 stances are equally consistent with its presence or its absence. These propositions are upheld by irresistible authority and illustrated m a variety of adjudged cases. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Bridge Co., </em>84 N. Y. 56; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>78 id. 480; <em>Wiwirowski </em>v. <em>Lake Shore, etc., R. Co., </em>124 id. 420; <em>Cordell </em>v. <em>New York Central, etc., R. Co., </em>75 id. 330; <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>113 id. 378; <em>Riceman </em>v. <em>Havemeyer, </em>84 id. 647; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>New York Central, etc., R. Co., </em>58 id. 248; <em>Conlin </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>39 N. Y. St. Repr. 51; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>109 N. Y. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In the ease before us, no one saw the accident. The only facts in evidence are: That the place was dark; that the door in the side of the vessel was open, and the vacant space insufficiently guarded by a rope ; that a man was seen struggling for a moment in the water and then disappear; and that, upon a muster of the crew, the decedent was missing. Supposing Mm to have fallen in the sea by accident, what circumstance appeal's to repel an mference of Ms negligence ? <em>\u201c </em>There is no presumption that a person exposed to danger will exercise care and prudence in regard to Ms own safety.\u201d <em>Wiwirowski </em>v. <em>Lake Shore, etc., R. Co., </em>124 N. Y. 420. The woman Dmsmore had just before gone to the same spot, without incmTmg a similar casualty; who can say that proper care on decedent\u2019s part would not have averted the catastrophe? Beyond all controversy, the evidence is of no significance in negativmg an inference' of decedent\u2019s negligence; and the learned trial judge should, on that ground, have granted the-motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Indeed, conceding defendant\u2019s negligence, the action might well have miscarried for want of proof that it was the cause of plamtiff\u2019s injury. <em>Dobbins </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>119 N. Y. 188 ; <em>Conlin </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>39 N. Y. St. Repr. 51. Again, assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>negligence as the cause of the injury, it was the negligence of a fellow-servant. The relation of master and servant is not determined by gradation of rank or superiority ( <em>Wright </em>v. <em>New York Central R. Co., </em>25 N. Y. 562, 565), but by the nature of the act, the cause of the injury. If that act be one the performance of which is incumbent on the master, the delegation of it to a servant does not discharge the master from liability for its negligent performance. If the act be one within the duty of a servant, its negligent performance is the negligence of a fellow-servant, and the master is exempt from liability. <em>Crispin </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>81 N. Y. 516; <em>McCosker </em>v. <em>Long Island R. Co., </em>84 id. 77; <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>126 id. 1. It was the defendant\u2019s duty as master, to furnish the decedent a safe place in which to work, but <em>\u201c </em>the place which the master furnished was the ship itself \u201d <em>(Hogan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>125 N. Y. 775); and as the company had supplied iron doors to bar the gap through which it is supposed the decedent fell, it had discharged its duty in protecting him against the peril incurred. It is argued, however, that the negligence which caused the injury was the omission to close the doors, or otherwise prevent passage through the port; but to do tins was the duty of a servant, and the master is irresponsible for its nonperformance. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>125 N. Y. 774; <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>126 id. 1; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>New York Central, etc., R. Co., </em>88 id. 481; <em>Quebec S. S. Co. v. Merchant, </em>133 U. S. 375 ; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>117 N. Y. 638 ; <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>S. S. Co., </em>110 id. 625; <em>Byrnes </em>v. <em>New York, etc., R. Co., </em>113 id. 251; <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Village, </em>2 Silvernail (Ct. App.), 414. The negligence, therefore, which caused the injury, though that of the first officer or the captain even, was the negligence of a fellow-servant with the decedent; and for this reason too the learned trial judge should have dismissed the complaint. But, although the injury was from a defect in the place or appliances, the defendant is not responsible, for want of proof of knowledge of the defect, or its equivalent. <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>89 N. Y. 470; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>New York Central R. Co., </em>25 id. 562, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Bisohoff and Gieger^jh, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
