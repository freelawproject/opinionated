The failure of defendant to submit or offer to submit testimony of the character mentioned, justified the trial justice in directing a verdict as he did in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">The fact that he gave a wrong reason does not affect his action, which as above shown was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-18\">Ehrlich, Oh.
