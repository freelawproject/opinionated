To one of the counterclaims the plaintiff demurred; and the demurrer was sustained with leave to the defendant \u201c to amend his answer * * * upon payment of the costs herein <em>wpon said </em>demurrer.\u201d The plaintiff presented a bill of costs amounting with disbursements to sixty dollars and five cents. The disbursements being paid, the clerk taxed the costs at \u201c twenty dollars issue of law.\u201d Upon appeal from the clerk\u2019s taxation it was confirmed; and we are to determine whether the order at Special Term be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">The cause is on the calendar for trial of the issues surviving the decision of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The ruling of the clerk was right. The successful party is entitled to full costs only on the final determination of the action; otherwise he might recover such costs twice over. Here is but an interlocutory order; and as it disposes of duly one of several defenses, the plaintiff should not recover costs as upon a litigation and disposition of all the issues.* Hpon the decision of the demurrer he may claim only twenty dollars trial fee upon the determination of the single issue involved. Indeed, the allowance of any costs on sustaining the demurrer was discretionary (Code, \u00a7 3232); and it is apparent from the terms of the order, that the court intended to award costs only <em>\u201c </em>upon said demurrer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">If there be a diversity of adjudication on the point, the weight of authority is against the contention of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements.
