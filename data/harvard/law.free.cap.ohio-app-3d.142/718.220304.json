This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">In 1998, the Akron Police Department received a complaint against David Frazier from Joseph and Catherine Basile. Frazier was arrested, charged, and. convicted as a result of the complaint, but subsequently all official records pertaining to the case were sealed by the Akron Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-15\">Based on the criminal action, Frazier and his wife brought a civil cause of action against the Basiles, asserting a variety of causes of action and, in particular, malicious prosecution. For discovery purposes, Frazier and the Basiles filed a joint motion to have the criminal file unsealed. The trial judge granted the motion to unseal the criminal record. However, the trial judge later, <em>sua sponte, </em>vacated the judgment and ordered the criminal record to be resealed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Appellants assert four assignments of error. This court will address them collectively as they concern similar issues of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in not applying the exception found in [R.C.] 2953.53(D)(1) to allow the defendant [in] a criminal action and the prosecuting witnesses named by him in their joint written application to gain access to the sealed record of that criminal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to allow access to the sealed record of a criminal action for the limited purpose of allowing the parties to conduct discovery in a subsequent civil action for malicious prosecution and other torts arising directly out of the prosecution of that criminal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to recognize a public policy exception to the provisions of Ohio law respecting the sealing of the record in a criminal action to allow access for the limited purpose of conducting discovery in a subsequent civil action arising directly out of the prosecution of that criminal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in determining that the statutory requirements for filing a written application to seal the record in this criminal action were followed by defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">In their assignments of error, appellants aver that the trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 joint motion to unseal an official criminal record. This court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">Appellants\u2019 argument relies upon the interpretation and application of R.C. 2953.53(D). An appellate court\u2019s review of the interpretation and application of a statute is <em>de novo. State v. Sufronko </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 504, 506, 664 N.E.2d 596, 597. Additionally, an appellate court does not give deference to a trial court\u2019s determination when making its review. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594, 589 N.E.2d 1319, 1323. In order to determine the legislative intent, a court must first look to the statute\u2019s language. <em>Shover v. Cordis </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 213, 218, 574 N.E.2d 457, 461-462. \u201cWhether a statute is mandatory or directory is to be ascertained from a consideration of the entire act, its nature, its object and the consequences which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>would result from construing it one way or the other.\u201d <em>Schmidt v. Weather-Seal </em>(1943), 71 Ohio App. 387, 389, 26 O.O. 322, 323, 50 N.E.2d 362, 364. Additionally, particular provisions of a statute may be discretionary, while others may be mandatory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">R.C. 2953.53(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\u201cUpon receiving a copy of an order to seal official records pursuant to division (A) or (B) of this section * * * a public office or agency shall comply with the order and, if applicable, with the provisions of section 2953.54 of the Revised Code, except that it may maintain a record of the case that is the subject of the order if the record is maintained for the purpose of compiling statistical data only and does not contain any reference to the person who is the subject of the case and the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\u201cA public office or agency also may maintain an index of sealed official records * * * access to which may not be afforded to any person other than the person who has custody of the sealed official records. The sealed official records to which such an index pertains <em>shall not </em>be available to any person, <em>except </em>that the official records of a case that have been sealed <em>may </em>be made available to the following persons for the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">\u201c(1) To the person who is the subject of the records upon written application, and to any other person named in the application, for any purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">\u201c(2) To a law enforcement officer who was involved in the case, for use in the officer\u2019s defense of a civil action arising out of the officer\u2019s involvement in that case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">\u201c(3) To a prosecuting attorney or his assistants to determine a defendant\u2019s eligibility to enter a pre-trial diversion program established pursuant to section 2935.36 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">The statute clearly dictates for whom and under what conditions an official record may be unsealed. In this case, Frazier and the Basiles requested that Frazier\u2019s criminal record be unsealed for discovery purposes to provide assistance in a subsequently filed civil lawsuit. Therefore, R.C. 2953.53(D)(1) is applicable, and it does not confer discretion upon a trial court when faced with a request to unseal an official record. As such, the trial court was required to unseal the record as requested by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">In R.C. 2953.53(D) the words \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d are used throughout. Although the legislature utilized both \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d in the same provision, this usage does not eliminate the mandatory nature of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">\u201cThe literal meaning of the words \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018shall\u2019 is not always conclusive in the construction of statutes in which they are employed; and one should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>regarded as having the meaning of the other when that is required to give effect to other language found in the statute, or to carry out the purpose of the legislature as it may appear from a general view of the statute under construction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 367, 116 N.E. 516, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In reading R.C. 2953.53, it is clear that the legislature did not want \u201cany person\u201d to have access to sealed official records; however, the legislature did provide an exception to this prohibition. The exception outlined the persons who are entitled to have access to sealed official records. Therefore, reading the statute as a whole, it is clear that the legislature wanted those persons, as in R.C. 2953.53(D)(1), (2), and (3), to have access to official sealed records. Thus, in order to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent, R.C. 2953.53(D) must be read as mandatory in nature. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The judgment of the Akron Municipal Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-9\">Batchelder, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b767-10\">Slaby, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b767-11\">Slaby, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ArH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">I respectfully dissent. The majority holds that R.C. 2953.53(D)(1) mandates that a trial court unseal a defendant\u2019s sealed record, simply because the defendant requests it to do so. However, the unambiguous language of R.C. 2953.53(D)(1) gives the court the discretion to determine whether sealed records may be unsealed upon such a request. Therefore, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied appellants\u2019 motion to unseal the records, I would affirm the decision of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">The trial court\u2019s decision to unseal an official record is a matter of judicial discretion. Accordingly, the standard of review in this case is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motion. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment, but instead demonstrates \u201cperversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u201d <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748, 751. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Pursuant to R.C. 1.42, words and phrases in Ohio statutes are to be construed \u201caccording to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d R.C. 1.42. Plain and unambiguous language may not be ignored, regardless of the policy implications. <em>State v. Rowe </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 121, 125, 691 N.E.2d 1140, 1142, citing <em>Pike-Delta-York Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Fulton Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 147, 156, 70 O.O.2d 300, 305, 324 N.E.d 56, 571-572. The general rule of statutory construction provides that the word \u201cmay\u201d should be construed as \u201coptional, permissive, or discretionary,\u201d while the word \u201cshall\u201d should be construed as \u201cmandatory.\u201d <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conserv. Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 107, 56 O.O.2d 58, 60-61, 271 N.E.2d 834, 837-838.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">R.C. 2953.53(D) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\u201cUpon receiving a copy of an order to seal official records pursuant to division (A) or (B) of this section * * * a public office or agency <em>shall </em>comply with the order and, if applicable, with the provisions of section 2953.54 of the Revised Code, except that it <em>may </em>maintain a record of the case that is the subject of the order if the record is maintained for the purpose of compiling statistical data only and does not contain any reference to the person who is the subject of the case and the order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\u201cA public office or agency also <em>may </em>maintain an index of sealed official records * * * access to which may not be afforded to any person other than the person who has custody of the sealed official records. The sealed official records to which such an index pertains <em>shall not </em>be available to any person, except that the official records of a case that have been sealed <em>may </em>be made available to the following persons for the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">\u201c(1) To the person who is the subject of the records upon written application, and to any other person named in the application, for any purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">\u201c(2) To a law enforcement officer who was involved in the case, for use in the officer\u2019s defense of a civil action arising out of the officer\u2019s involvement in that case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">\u201c(3) To a prosecuting attorney or his assistants to determine a defendant\u2019s eligibility to enter a pretrial diversion program established pursuant to section 2935.36 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">The language used by the General Assembly in drafting the statute is straightforward and unambiguous. The statute sets forth the parties and respective conditions necessary to have an official record unsealed. Assuming those procedures are followed, the trial court is granted the ultimate discretion to determine whether an order unsealing the record would be appropriate. This is made clear through the language chosen by the legislature: \u201cthe official records of a case that have been sealed <em>may </em>be made available to the following persons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>following purposes.\u201d Thus, the grant of statutory discretion demonstrates that no right exists to have court records unsealed. The conclusion that the trial court retains discretion in granting relief when the conditions set forth in the statute have been met is further evidenced by the General Assembly\u2019s use of the words \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Absent evidence to the contrary, an appellate court must presume the regularity of the trial court\u2019s proceedings and judgment. <em>Wells v. Spirit </em>Fabricating, <em>Ltd. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 282, 288-289, 680 N.E.2d 1046, 1049-1051. The record before us contains the trial court order denying the motion to unseal the records. Inasmuch as there was no request for findings of fact and conclusions of law, we are unable to fully determine the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. Thus, this court must presume regularity of the lower court\u2019s order denying appellants\u2019 motion to unseal the record. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
