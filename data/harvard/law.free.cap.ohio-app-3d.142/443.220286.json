FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">This case involves a class action suit by appellants to recover the fees charged (\u201cBrady fees\u201d) to conduct background checks (\u201cBrady checks\u201d) for the purchase of handguns. The facts of the case are not in substantial dispute, and they are presented fully after a brief overview of the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">1. Overview</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>PRO is a nonprofit organization incorporated in Ohio \u201cdedicated to the rights of law-abiding firearm owners.\u201d Many of its members purchased handguns in Ohio between 1994 and 1998, paying the Brady fee, which they now seek to have refunded. Davis Guns is a federally licensed firearms dealer located in Plain City, Madison County, Ohio, which paid the Brady fee as part of promotional sales. John and Jane Does are Ohio residents and handgun purchasers who seek to remain anonymous. Some of them are PRO members.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Appellants filed a class action suit against the Attorney General seeking a refund of all Brady fees paid by handgun purchasers in Ohio for Brady checks pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (\u201cBrady Act\u201d), Section 921 <em>et seq., </em>Title 18, U.S.Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a subsequent agreement between the Attorney General and the United States Attorney General (\u201cUSAG\u201d), which continued the Brady checks after certain provisions of the Brady Act were declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Printz v. United States </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 898, 117 S.Ct. 2865, 138 L.Ed.2d 914. The Attorney General assigned the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification (\u201cBCI&amp;I\u201d) to collect the Brady fee. Appellants alleged that the Brady fee was not authorized by law and infringed upon their rights to bear arms and to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The Attorney General argued that charging and collecting the Brady fee to perform Brady checks was legal and not in violation of appellants\u2019 civil rights. The trial court granted the Attorney General\u2019s motion, finding that the Brady fees were authorized. Appellants\u2019 motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">2. The Brady Act</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The events of this case involve a number of government agencies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Gun Control Act of 1968 (\u201cGCA\u201d), Sections 921-930, Title 18, U.S.Code, established a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>detailed federal scheme governing the distribution and sale of firearms. The scheme requires that any person dealing in firearms first obtain a federal license. Section 923. Federal firearm licensees (\u201cFFLs\u201d), such as Davis Guns, must maintain records of their sales and allow the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) to inspect these records. Section 923(g). The scheme includes a prohibition against transferring handguns to, and the possession of firearms by, certain listed classes of persons. Sections 922(b), (d), and (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Congress amended Title I of the GCA effective November 30, 1993, with the Brady Act, Pub.L. 103-159,107 Stat. 1536. The Brady Act put into place interim provisions for a national background check system, Section 922(s), and required that the USAG establish a permanent national instant background check system by November 30, 1998. Section 922(t)(l). The Brady Act\u2019s interim system implemented a mandatory background check, the Brady check, and a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun. Section 922(s)(l)(A)(ii). The permanent instant background check system requires no waiting period. Section 922(t)(l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">As noted by the trial court, under the interim provision, a FFL who proposed to transfer a handgun had to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201c(1) receive from the transferee/buyer (\u2018buyer\u2019) the 'form prescribed by Section 922(s)(3) (\u2018Brady form\u2019), containing the name, address, and date of birth of the buyer, along with a sworn statement that the buyer is not among any of the classes of prohibited purchasers,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 922(s)(l)(A)(i)(I);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201c(2) verify the identity of the buyer by examining an identifying document, Section 922(s)(l)(A)(i)(II); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201c(3) provide the \u2018chief law enforcement officer\u2019 (\u2018CLEO\u2019)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the buyer\u2019s residence with a notice of the contents and a copy of the Brady form. Section 922(s)(l)(A)(i)(III)-(rV).\u201d (Footnotes added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Other than listed exceptions, the FFL was required to wait five business days before consummating the sale unless the CLEO earlier notified the FFL that there was no reason to believe that the sale would be illegal. Section 922(s)(1)(A)(ii). There were significant alternate methods of completing a handgun sale, including where the buyer possessed a state handgun permit issued after a state background check, Section 922(s)(1)(C), and where state law provided for an instant background check. Section 922(s)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">If a particular state, like Ohio, did not have in effect one of these alternatives applicable to all handgun buyers, CLEOs performed specific duties regarding Brady checks. Sections 922(s)(2) and (6). Thus, unless a state already had a system for approving the sale of handguns to prospective buyers, CLEOs were instrumental in administering the Brady Act\u2019s interim system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">When the CLEO received the required notice of a proposed sale from the FFL, the CLEO was to \u201cmake a reasonable effort\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to ascertain within five business days whether receipt or possession would be illegal, including research in state and local recordkeeping systems and a national system designated by the USAG. Section 922(s)(2). The CLEO was not required to take any particular action if it was determined that a pending sale would be unlawful,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but if the CLEO informed the FFL that the prospective buyer was ineligible to receive a handgun, the CLEO had to provide the prospective buyer with a written statement of the reasons for that determination. Section 922(s)(6)(C). If the CLEO did not discover a basis for objecting to the sale, any records in its possession relating to the sale, including the Brady form, were to be destroyed within twenty days. CLEOs could not convey the information in the Brady form to any other person or use it for any purpose other than the Brady check. Section 922(s)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">If the CLEO provided erroneous information, resulting in a denial of a handgun application, the denied buyer could \u201cbring an action against the State or political subdivision responsible for providing the erroneous information.\u201d See<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>tion 925A. CLEOs were specifically exempted from civil liability for performing their duties under the Brady Act. Section 922(s)(7). Under a separate section of the GCA, \u201c[wjhoever knowingly violates subsection (s) or (t) of section 922 [could] be fined not more than $1,000, imprisoned for not more than [one] year, or both.\u201d Section 924(a)(5).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">On January 21, 1994, before the Brady Act\u2019s effective date, the Director of the ATF sent an \u201cOpen Letter to State and Local Law Enforcement Officials\u201d (\u201cOpen Letter\u201d) explaining the Brady Act\u2019s interim requirements. The Open Letter stated that the Brady Act\u2019s primary intent was to \u201cprovide law enforcement an opportunity to screen out unlawful purchasers. Our goal is to see that [the] Brady [Act] is as effective as possible at keeping handguns out of the wrong hands.\u201d The Open Letter addressed how the background checks should be performed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cEach law enforcement agency serving as the CLEO will have to set it [sic] own standards based on its own circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>the availability of resources, access to records, and taking into account the law enforcement priorities of the jurisdiction. The law is designed so that the law enforcement authority who is doing the check [sic], is the one who is most likely to have to deal with the consequences of the buyer obtaining a handgun. Therefore, the CLEO of the buyer\u2019s residence has a vested interest in conducting an appropriate check and ultimately is in the best position to determine what is reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The Open Letter concluded by noting that in some situations the only reasonable Brady check would be no check at all, in accordance with circumstances predicted by Sections 922(s)(l)(B)-(F) and by the ATF in its administrative regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">3. CLEOs</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u201cCLEO\u201d was defined as \u201cthe chief of police, the sheriff, or an equivalent officer or the designee of any such individual.\u201d Section 922(s)(8). The Brady Act gave no express guidance in how a \u201cdesignee\u201d CLEO was to be appointed or whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>only local, not state, law enforcement officers could act as CLEOs. In any case, CLEOs, as the key law enforcement officers administering the interim Brady Act system, were to be state, not federal, officers. As noted by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">\u201c[T]he Brady Act purports to direct state law enforcement officers to participate, albeit only temporarily, in the administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme. Regulated firearms [FFLs] are required to forward Brady [fjorms not to a federal officer or employee, but to the CLEOs, whose obligation to accept those forms is implicit in the duty imposed upon them to make \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 within five days to determine whether the sales reflected in the forms are unlawful. While the CLEOs are subjected to no federal requirement that they prevent the sales determined to be unlawful (it is perhaps assumed that their state-law duties will require prevention or apprehension), they are empowered to grant, in effect, waivers of the federally prescribed 5-day waiting period for handgun purchases by notifying gun [FFLs] that they have no reason to believe the transactions would be illegal.\u201d <em>Printz, </em>521 U.S. at 904-905, 117 S.Ct. at 2369, 138 L.Ed.2d at 925.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The Open Letter also discussed CLEO status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">\u201cWhile the law [defining \u2018CLEO,\u2019 Section 922(s)(8),] is broad enough, in some cases, to give the [FFL] more than one official to contact, we believe the law will clearly permit law enforcement officials to agree that, within a given jurisdiction, one agency will serve the role as CLEO. It is essential that State and local law enforcement officials agree, within a given jurisdiction, that one agency will serve the role of [CLEO], for purposes of which agency should receive the notice of handgun sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\u201cWe urge you to work with your counterparts on the State and local level to decide who will be the CLEO for your area. Your discussions should also include consideration of the designation of the CLEO for the purposes of the \u2018threat to life\u2019 alternative * * * and the \u2018multiple sales reportsf.]\u2019 * * * Once you have reached a determination, ATF will be able to inform the [FFLs] when they begin calling us[J ATF\u2019s regulations will make it clear to [FFLs] that they will be required to abide by instructions from State and local officials as to which agency to contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In response to the Open Letter, on February 22, 1994, the Superintendent of the BCI&amp;I (\u201cSuperintendent\u201d) sent a letter to every Ohio FFL outlining how the Brady checks were to be conducted. The Superintendent indicated that the Brady checks would be conducted by the BCI&amp;I, setting forth specific procedures. Using a \u201c900\u201d telephone number, each FFL was to call the BCI&amp;I\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Identification Division, which would conduct computerized criminal background checks. There would be a $15-per-call charge (the Brady fee) assessed to the FFL\u2019s telephone bill.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">4. Ohio in the <em>Pre-Printz </em>Period</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">At the time that the Brady Act took effect, Ohio did not have a system of handgun purchase background checks in place.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As a result, Ohio was subject to Section 922(s), and the state acted accordingly. One of the first steps in this process was determining who would be a CLEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On February 25, 1994, the Ohio Association of Chief of Police, Inc. (\u201cOACP\u201d) sent a letter regarding the Brady Act to its members. Drafted by the OACP President and Todd Wurschmidt, Ph.D., the letter began, \u201cOn behalf of our OACP members, we have been involved in gathering a great deal of information and in dialoging with a number of federal and state agencies with regard to the implications of the Brady [Act] for local law enforcement agencies in Ohio.\u201d Regarding who was to act as Ohio\u2019s CLEO and that official\u2019s responsibilities, the letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">\u201c1. Through the efforts of the Attorney General\u2019s Office and BCI&amp;I, Ohio is attempting to establish a central repository for background checks through BCI&amp;I. We have agreed to support the proposal designating BCI&amp;I as Ohio\u2019s central repository. Thus, ATF has notified more than 9,000 [FFLs] to telephone BCI&amp;I with information regarding the request for purchase of handguns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">\u201c2. If an FFL contacts your local agency, you simply need to provide them with the BCI&amp;I (900) number * * *. It is the responsibility of the FFL to comply with the contact to BCI&amp;I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">\u201c4. BCI&amp;I informs us that they understand local law enforcements\u2019 [sic] interest in learning about persons residing in their communities who are either rejected from purchase of handguns or who attempt to purchase multiple handguns. [The] Superintendent * * * informed us of BCI&amp;I\u2019s intentions to address this issue, but does not have specific plans nor a timetable as of yet with regard to providing local law enforcement with feedback on ineligible purchasers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>or multiple handgun sales. We have written [the] Superintendent * * * requesting specific information * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">ii* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">\u201c5. The Brady [Act] contains a Sunset Provision after five years. The federal statute requires the implementation of a national instant criminal check system. From presentations by representatives of the FBI involved in the design of a national instant criminal background check system, we believe the national system will, in great part, rely on the networking of centralized state systems. We thus feel that with Ohio centralizing our background check process at the outset of the implementation of the Brady [Act], Ohio will be in a position to network with the possible national system to be put in place not later than five years from now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">This arrangement by which BCI&amp;I acted as Ohio\u2019s CLEO designee was memorialized by the ATF in its Federal Register list of responsible CLEOs. 59 F.R. 37582 (1994). The arrangement was also confirmed in an ATF announcement to Ohio FFLs, which included that \u201cfor purposes of the [Brady] Act, the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in Ohio is the Attorney General, State of Ohio. The Attorney General\u2019s designee is the Superintendente.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Beginning in March 1994, BCI&amp;I began performing Brady checks. BCI&amp;I performed such background checks until June 27,1997. On that date, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Printz, </em>521 U.S. 898, 117 S.Ct. 2365, 138 L.Ed.2d 914, and held that Section 922(s)(2), which obligated local law enforcement to perform Brady checks, violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court reasoned that Section 922(s)(2) imposed on state CLEOs an obligation to administer an unfunded and purely federal regulatory program. <em>Id. </em>at 933, 117 S.Ct. at 2383, 138 L.Ed.2d at 943. <em>Printz </em>effectively extinguished the duties imposed upon CLEOs by Sections 922(s)(1)(A)(i)(III) and (IV) to accept the Brady form submitted by FFLs. <em>Id. </em>at 933-934, 117 S.Ct. at 2384, 138 L.Ed.2d at 943-944.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">5. Ohio in the <em>Post-Printz </em>Period</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">As a result of <em>Printz, </em>law enforcement officials 'had to find other means to perform Brady checks. To that end, the Superintendent sent a letter to Ohio\u2019s FFLs on June 30,1997, setting forth a new plan for Brady checks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">\u201cOver the past forty-eight hours we have worked with the [United States] Justice Department to try to respond to the new decision and the legal problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>it causes Ohio particularly. In order for you to comply with the requirements of this federal law, we are working on an interim solution with the Department of Justice to assist you in the least intrusive way possible. The new Ohio Brady plan will take effect on July 1, 1997 and will remain in effect until November 30, 1998 or until the Federal system is implemented (or until a more permanent solution can be achieved).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Under the new system, buyers would still fill out the Brady form. The buyer could sign a waiver form, which would allow BCI&amp;I to verify the buyer\u2019s criminal record or the lack thereof. This allowed a voluntary Brady check to be done. Both of these forms were to be sent to BCI&amp;I, which would report its findings within two business days. The Brady fee for this system was $13 per check, still charged to the FFL via the \u201c900\u201d telephone number. The intent of this system was to create a method of voluntary Brady checks. The Superintendent\u2019s letter further included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201cIn the event the buyer does not wish to sign the waiver form please write \u2018REFUSED\u2019 on the applicants signature block and send both forms to BCI&amp;I and we will forward the check to ATF. In this event, as you know, you <em>must </em>wait 5 business days to hear from the ATF before you can sell a handgun. You will be billed $13.00 for the service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\"><em>\u00a1\u00a1t </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201cIt is our intent to assist you in complying with the federal mandate in a timely, cost effective and the least intrusive way possible. Signing the voluntary consent form coupled with a quick check system should afford you faster customer service while protecting you from possible liability should no record check be sought.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">At that time, the federal government was encouraging states to voluntarily perform Brady checks as before, continuing the system of involuntary, mandatory checks. In some states, as in Ohio, this posed legal problems. These concerns initiated correspondence between the Attorney General and the USAG negotiating a new Brady check system.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">On July 2, 1997, the Attorney General sent a letter to the USAG discussing legal impediments to the BCI&amp;I conducting involuntary Brady checks. The Attorney General wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cOhio is a Brady state and our General Assembly has not enacted a criminal record check law. Ohio is also unique in that, in 1994, [the Attorney General] entered into an agreement with local law enforcement to be designated [CLEO] for purposes of the Brady Act. This designation allowed the BCI&amp;I, which operates under the Attorney General\u2019s office, to conduct the Brady checks. Prior to the [Printz] decision, BCI&amp;I was able to assume the workload of the Brady <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>checks because the performance of a background check was a \u2018mandatory duty\u2019 of all local law enforcement agencies pursuant to statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cSince the Supreme Court nullified the <em>mandate </em>of Brady on state and local government, there is no longer a <em>duty </em>for CLEOs (or local law enforcement) to conduct Brady checks. Therefore, BCI&amp;I\u2019s handgun background check authority under [R.C.] 109.55 <em>has lapsed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The Attorney General continued that, although states were encouraged to continue involuntary Brady checks, Ohio was \u201cstatutorily impeded from complying with this request.\u201d R.C. 109.54, which gives the BCI&amp;I the authority to investigate \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d was inapplicable to involuntary Brady checks: \u201cThe purchase of a handgun is <em>not </em>a criminal activity,\u201d in light of the fact that 99.5 percent of prospective buyers had no record which would prevent the sale. The Attorney General proposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cIn the current circumstances, we believe the only legal alternative available to * * * Ohio is a voluntary compliance policy, which we are now implementing. This policy allows gun dealers to obtain a written waiver from the purchaser, thereby allowing BCI&amp;I to conduct a voluntary record check. * * * For those individuals who do not agree to our waiver request, BCI&amp;I will forward their applications to the appropriate federal agency which still retains <em>its </em>authority, under Brady, to conduct their own background check.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Although the Attorney General concluded that Ohio was prohibited from conducting involuntary Brady checks, the Attorney General was willing to work with federal authorities to implement a voluntary Brady check system. To this end, the Superintendent sent a letter to the ATF outlining the legal impediments to BCI&amp;I conducting involuntary Brady checks. The Superintendent notified the ATF that, pursuant to Ohio\u2019s new voluntary Brady check policy, BCI&amp;I would forward the Brady forms of those buyers not consenting to state record verification to the ATF for Brady checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">At this time, appellants\u2019 counsel wrote the Attorney General, contending that the Attorney General and BCI&amp;I never had the authority to conduct Brady checks or charge the Brady fee. On July 14, 1997, the Attorney General responded, asserting that the state agencies did have authority to conduct Brady checks: under the <em>pre-Printz </em>Brady check system, the Attorney General and BCI&amp;I were the agreed-upon CLEO designee; since <em>Printz, </em>Ohio could implement a system of voluntary Brady checks through R.C. 109.57, which allowed records release and verification where the buyer signed a written consent form; where such a consent form was not signed, the Brady form would be sent to federal authorities. The Attorney General maintained that the Brady fees were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>proper, as R.C. 109.57(E) allowed reasonable fees to be charged for records release and verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On July 29, 1997, the USAG opined in a letter to the Attorney General that Ohio law allowed BCI&amp;I to conduct involuntary Brady checks. The Attorney General had Ohio\u2019s State Solicitor review the USAG\u2019s contention. On August 4, 1997, the State Solicitor responded, informing the Attorney General that he disagreed with the USAG\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201cThe Brady Act, to be sure, initially compelled States to establish an interim system for conducting background checks on their citizens. Yet when the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated this provision of the [Brady] Act in <em>Prints </em>* * *, any requirement that [BCI&amp;I] continue to conduct involuntary background checks fell with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201cTo suggest that the Brady Act nonetheless still \u2018authorizes\u2019 [BCI&amp;I] to perform involuntary background checks represents an unhelpful play on words. Either the Brady Act <em>requires </em>Ohio to conduct such checks or it does not. It if does not, as is clearly true after <em>Printz, </em>it is no help to say that the federal government permits Ohio to continue to conduct such checks if authorized under Ohio law. That of course was as true before the Brady Act was enacted as after it \u2014 indeed, it is probably true about any conceivable legislative policy. In the last analysis, the only relevant question is whether Ohio law independently permits [BCI&amp;I] to conduct such checks when there is no freestanding federal duty to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The State Solicitor reviewed several relevant statutes that related to whether BCI&amp;I had the power to conduct Brady checks of any form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">\u201c[R.C. 109.54] no doubt gives [BCI&amp;I] authority to \u2018investigate\u2019 any \u2018criminal activity\u2019 in the State at the request of local authorities and to \u2018aid federal authorities\u2019 in their \u2018investigation\u2019 of \u2018criminal activity.\u2019 * * * But there has been no showing that across-the-board checks tenably amount to a legitimate \u2018investigation\u2019 of \u2018criminal activity.\u2019 * * * Under these circumstances, it is hard to maintain that a check on every purchase constitutes an \u2018investigation\u2019 of \u2018criminal activity,\u2019 at least if those terms are going to continue to have any legitimate content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">\u201cUnder Section 109.572, [BCI&amp;I] may conduct checks upon receipt of certain information and in certain circumstances. Accordingly, in some instances, [BCI&amp;I] may conduct the check only after it has received a proper form and fingerprints, <em>see </em>R.C. 109.572(A); and in others, [BCI&amp;I] may conduct the check without the form and fingerprints if authorized by enumerated statutory provisions. <em>See </em>R.C. 109.572(B). But, importantly, every single one of the back<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ground checks enumerated in R.C. 109.572(B) relates to checks to determine the background of individuals for prospective employment in areas like child care or elderly adult care. The provision says not a word about authorizing involuntary background checks in other areas generally or in the context of handgun purchases specifically. * * * The legislature\u2019s conspicuous silence about permitting background checks for handgun purchasers, in short, is meaningful and should be respected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cStill another statute confirms the danger to [BCI&amp;I] of freely commanding Ohioans to submit to involuntary background checks. [R.C.] 109.57 confirms that the background check information collected by [BCI&amp;I] may not be disclosed unless specifically authorized. It says that the confidential records are not \u2018public records\u2019 for purposes of [R.C.] 149.43, unless [BCI&amp;I] is specifically authorized to conduct the background check in accordance with the above provisions. As a result, any non-specified release of the information would constitute a violation of [R.C.] 102.03, which prohibits the release of confidential information by State employees, and any non-specified check would constitute a violation of [R.C.] 109.541(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cThe critical problem with the [USAG\u2019s] argument is this: [BCI&amp;I] is, and always has been, a creature of statute. As such, it possesses only those powers given to it by the Ohio General Assembly \u2014 more specifically, those set forth in section 109.541 to 109.65 of the Ohio Revised Code. Removing any room for doubt on this score, [R.C.] 109.541 codifies this limiting principle by providing that \u2018[n]o state official shall command, order, or direct (a [BCI&amp;I] employee) to perform any duty or service that is not authorized by law.\u2019 R.C. 109.541(C). [BCI&amp;I], in short, needs statutory authorization before it may act, a no-nonsense statutory limit that notions of implied authority [advanced by the USAG] cannot circumvent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201c[BCI&amp;I] likewise must respect all statutory limits on its powers. Quite simply, the agency may not bypass <em>express </em>statutory limits on its power through contentions that it has <em>implied </em>authority to do something else. Under these circumstances, the [USAG\u2019s] reliance on powers and functions of law enforcement officials implied from general grants of authority is misplaced. While there may be instances where law enforcement actions may be taken without specific statutory authorization, this simply is not one of them. In the end, the Ohio General Assembly has defined the instances when background checks my be conducted and has otherwise prohibited the distribution of background information; [BCI&amp;I] officials simply may not take contrary action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cNo more persuasive is the repeated suggestion in the [USAG\u2019s] letter that background checks are, or have become, a \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018routine\u2019 law enforcement technique. Such a description ignores the long and arduous struggle to enact the federal Brady Act, the variance among states with and without Brady laws, and the public debate surrounding the implementation of such checks. But even assuming for sake of argument that the letter\u2019s characterization of Brady checks is correct, this is only relevant if some legislative authorization or mandate \u2014 whether state or federal \u2014 still authorizes the checks to be conducted. The frequency with which background checks are conducted does not alter the fundamental question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The State Solicitor concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cWith respect to background checks, the General Assembly has specifically defined the circumstances under which [BCI&amp;I] may conduct background checks, and has otherwise prohibited the dissemination of background information. Following the passage of the Brady Act in 1993, the General Assembly took no other action to expand this authority in order to implement Brady checks. Instead, [BCI&amp;I] relied solely on the federal <em>requirement </em>to conduct such checks. In the absence of a federal mandate or the passage of an Ohio law authorizing involuntary background checks for handgun purchasers, [BCI&amp;I] may not conduct them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The Attorney General immediately conveyed these conclusions to the USAG, attaching the State Solicitor\u2019s memorandum. The Attorney General reiterated the earlier-made proposal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201c[T]here is a way to solve our background check dilemma and strengthen the Brady process. As we discussed last week, I write to propose a federal-state cooperative method for conducting background checks until the federal system is fully operational in 1998. Ohio intends to continue to conduct checks of consenting prospective handgun purchasers. Ohio also intends to continue to forward to the ATF all completed Brady Forms from all non-consenting prospective purchasers. In those instances where an individual has refused to provide a waiver for the background check, Ohio is willing to also forward to the ATF a portion of the fee paid by the purchaser and collected by [BCI&amp;I]. Our hope is that these funds will allow ATF to cover the costs of employing the few additional staff necessary to conduct the checks of non-consenting Ohio purchasers. ATF employees can conduct the checks through access to the Interstate Identification Index (III), which offers ATF precisely the same access to Ohio records that [BCI&amp;I] employees have. If there is a \u2018hit\u2019 by an Ohio handgun purchaser, ATF can notify [BCI&amp;I] and [BCI&amp;I] can then conduct a thorough review of all available criminal history information, that is, [BCI&amp;I] will assist federal authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ties in the investigation of a criminal activity (a suspected illegal purchase) \u2014 an action specifically authorized by Ohio law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cI can assure you that we understand and sympathize with the desire of the Justice Department and Treasury Secretary Rubin for Ohio to conduct Brady checks. As I have told you from the time the <em>Printz </em>decision was announced, we would be willing to conduct such checks if Ohio law allowed us to do so. Nonetheless, in the absence of that authority, we remain hopeful that our offices can continue to work together to conduct checks within constitutional and statutory parameters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The ongoing debate was further memorialized in a September 5, 1997 letter from the Attorney General to the federal Department of Justice Office of Intergovernmental Affairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201c[W]ithin 72 hours of the [United States] Supreme Court\u2019s action [in <em>Printz </em>], our office designed a system which allows background checks to be conducted for purchasers who give their consent. * * * Since Ohio law permits our [BCI&amp;I] to conduct background checks upon consent, our solution provided a workable system that was consistent with the unique application of Ohio law. Since then, more than two-thirds of prospective handgun purchasers have given their consent to [BCI&amp;I].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201cIn [the Attorney General\u2019s letter of August 4, 1997, the] Attorney General * * * went on to propose a federal-state cooperative method for conducting background checks until the overall federal handgun system * * * is fully operational in 1998. * * * In those instances where an individual has refused to provide a waiver for the background check, Ohio would * * * forward to the ATF a significant portion of the fee paid by the purchaser and collected by BCI&amp;I. I have indicated to you in the past that the amount of money forwarded to ATF would likely be in the range of $150,000-$200,000 per year \u2014 easily enough money to fund the two full-time ATF employees needed to conduct these checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\"><em>\u201cOn </em>August 15, 1997, the United States Justice Department (\u2018DOJ\u2019) responded [to the Attorney General\u2019s proposal] by offering a proposal whereby Ohio\u2019s [BCI&amp;I] agents would be deputized as federal agents. These [BCI&amp;I]/federal agents would then conduct Brady checks via Ohio\u2019s [BCI&amp;I] system. In response, I explained that simply deputizing State [BCI&amp;I] agents does not provide Ohio with authority to conducts [sic] checks that are not currently allowed under State law. In fact, permitting [BCI&amp;I] agents to accept deputation for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>unrelated to an <em>investigation of criminal activity </em>would appear to violate the specific mandate of the Ohio General Assembly[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cWe continue to believe that forwarding to ATF the Brady Forms provided by non-consenting prospective purchasers, along with a fee adequate to cover ATF\u2019s costs to conduct the checks, is the best method for assuring that Brady background checks are conducted in Ohio.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The debate over how to conduct Brady checks continued, with Ohio continuing to offer its proposal. As aptly put by the trial court, \u201c[a]s one can suspect, the ATF failed to cooperate.\u201d On February 4, 1998, the Superintendent wrote a letter to Ohio\u2019s FFLs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201cWhen the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a part of the Brady Act in June of 1997, the State of Ohio found itself in a unique situation. Ohio law permits criminal record information to be released for one of two reasons[:] first for criminal justice purposes, such as an ongoing investigation into suspected criminal conduct; and second, upon the individual authorizing their record to be checked as for pre-employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The Superintendent briefly described the Attorney General\u2019s proposal of voluntary Brady checks, continuing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">\u201cIt was later learned that ATF refused to conduct the checks and although over 90% of gun buyers were signing the waivers, [the] Attorney General * * * wanted to be as thorough as possible while following Ohio law. On December 22, 1997, an agreement was reached between [the] Attorney General * * *, the [DOJ], and the Franklin County Sheriffs Office [\u2018Sheriffs Office\u2019]. Several members of the Sheriffs Office have been designated as federal agents for the purpose of conducting non-waiver Brady checks. This system will ensure that everyone who is required to have a Brady check is screened according to the federal requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201cAs an FFL * * *, you should notice no difference in your current operation. You are still required to fill out the [Brady form] and contact BCI&amp;I via the 900 phone number/fax number. If the buyer signs the waiver, you may transfer a weapon after two business days. If the buyer does not sign the waiver, you still need to contact BCI&amp;I via the 900 number and BCI&amp;I will then forward the information to [the Sheriffs Office], who will run the check and notify BCI&amp;I of the results within five days. In the event of a denial, BCI&amp;I will notify you within the five day period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\u201cThis program will continue through November of 1998 when the FBI will take over the Brady check program. Please note that for people who consent to [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>waiver, the approval time is two days, while non-waivers remain at five days. The $13 fee remains the same for either check.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">This letter summarized the details of the Attorney General and federal authorities\u2019 agreement to ensure that Brady checks would continue in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The agreement was formalized in a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d (\u201cMemorandum\u201d) executed by the Attorney General, the USAG, and the United States Secretary of the Treasury. The Memorandum included provisions regarding the authority to conduct and the effectiveness of Brady checks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201c5. * * * Ohio law * * * empowers the * * * Attorney General and BCI&amp;I to cooperate with federal and local law enforcement agencies in the investigation of criminal activity. <em>E.g., </em>[R.C.] 109.52, 109.54, 109.62.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201c6. Sheriffs also share in broad authority under Ohio law to protect the public from crime through prevention, detection, and investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201c8. Cooperation among law enforcement agencies is particularly essential to combating violent crime and gun violence through enforcement of Federal and state laws governing firearm possession. In this regard, both Ohio and Federal law make acquisition or possession of firearms by certain categories of persons, such as convicted felons, a serious felony offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">\u201c11. The Brady Act has proven effective in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and others who should not have them. According to [DOJ] surveys, since the Brady Act became effective on February 28, 1994, the background checks of the kind provided for in the [Brady] Act have prevented over 250,000 persons nationwide, including convicted felons, fugitives from justice, individuals subject to domestic violence restraining orders and others in prohibited categories, from illegally obtaining firearms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">\u201c12. In Ohio, the Brady Act likewise has made an important contribution to preventing firearms from being sold to criminals and other prohibited persons. As of January 1, 1997, background checks had blocked nearly 1,000 felons, fugitives and others from illegally obtaining firearms from [FFLs].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">\u201c13.

At that time, the Brady Act\u2019s permanent provision, Section 922(t), was activated.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">6. Instant Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">On January 12, 1999, appellants filed their instant complaint against Betty Montgomery, both in her official capacity as Attorney General and as an individual. Appellants alleged that the Attorney General had no legal authority to charge the Brady fees. They alleged that the Attorney General deprived handgun purchasers, as a class, of property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and that the Brady fees were unlawful exactions. Appellants\u2019 class action claim for a refund of all Brady fees in Ohio was brought pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code to redress their alleged deprivation of constitutional rights, privileges, and immunities under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Appellants alleged that during the Brady Act\u2019s interim system, the Attorney General coerced handgun purchasers and FFLs into paying unlawful Brady fees by requiring FFLs to provide notice of the Brady form to BCI&amp;I through a \u201c900\u201d number at an automatic charge of $15. Appellants alleged that after <em>Printz, </em>the Attorney General coerced FFLs into having prospective handgun purchasers execute a waiver for BCI&amp;I to conduct Brady checks, or .else have the background check done by federal authorities. Under either <em>post-Printz </em>scheme, a $13 Brady fee was charged, and appellants asserted that a failure to pay the Brady fee could not constitute a valid reason to disapprove a handgun transfer. Davis Guns alleged that it was required to make payments between 1994 and 1997 for transmitting Brady forms on behalf of handgun purchasers as promotional sales. \u25a0 Appellants sought repayment of Brady fees paid between February 28,1994 and November 29,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The Attorney General answered, denying that BCI&amp;I was itself a CLEO or that BCI&amp;I was unauthorized to conduct Brady checks. The Attorney General admitted to instructing all Ohio FFLs to submit Brady forms to BCI&amp;I. The Attorney General asserted authority to charge the Brady fee and to establish the \u201c900\u201d telephone number to facilitate Brady fee collection. The Attorney General asserted that after <em>Printz, </em>Brady checks were either done by BCI&amp;I with the buyer\u2019s consent or by federalized sheriffs office deputies, and that the Brady fee charged for these checks was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The trial court certified the class, and a class action notice was distributed. The parties filed extensive motions for summary judgment. On March 1, 2000, the trial court granted summary judgment to the Attorney General in a forty-one-page decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The trial court first considered whether the Attorney General qualified as a CLEO under Section 922(s)(8) during the interim Brady Act system. The trial court looked to R.C. 109.02 and the statewide notice sent by the OACP agreeing that the Attorney General was Ohio\u2019s primary CLEO. Based upon these authorities, the trial court concluded that the Attorney General properly acted as Ohio\u2019s CLEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The trial court then turned to whether Ohio law authorized the BCI&amp;I to conduct involuntary Brady checks and to charge the Brady fee. The trial court engaged in a thorough discussion of relevant statutes delineating the powers of the BCI&amp;I and the Superintendent: R.C. 109.51, 109.52, 109.55, and 109.57. The trial court found that, with regard to the release of any records maintained by the BCI&amp;I, R.C. 109.57(E) allowed that a \u201creasonable fee may be charged for this service.\u201d The trial court concluded that the Attorney General had earlier adopted a procedure for requesting criminal records in Ohio Adm.Code 109:5-1-01, and that the Revised Code allowed charging a fee for voluntary records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>releases. The trial court found that any person complying with the regulation was entitled to access to or a release of their records.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The trial court also considered the statutory duties imposed upon BCI&amp;I, including its duty to cooperate with other law enforcement authorities in coordinating law enforcement work. R.C. 109.55. While Sections 922(s)(2) and (6) were in effect, BCI&amp;I was \u201cunder a federal requirement to perform background checks prior to handgun transfers.\u201d The trial court concluded that although the Brady Act did not specifically establish a Brady fee, BCI&amp;I was authorized by Ohio law to charge the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The trial court then turned to the Attorney General\u2019s decision to implement a voluntary Brady check system after <em>Printz. </em>The voluntary \u201cquick check\u201d system was effective only for those individuals who executed a written waiver allowing a record check pursuant to R.C. 109.57. Even though after <em>Printz </em>there was no federal mandate to conduct Brady checks, BCI&amp;I did have authority under Ohio law to conduct purely voluntary Brady checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The trial court determined that voluntary waivers were \u201can appropriate vehicle\u201d by which BCI&amp;I could perform Brady checks. The trial court found that this system did not violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, as that Amendment has yet to be selectively incorporated as effective upon the states. The trial court further concluded that appellants failed to demonstrate that the Brady fees charged under R.C. 109.57(E) constituted an unconstitutional and impermissible taking of property without due process. Appellants appeal and present two assignments of error which we will consider in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">\u201cThe court erred in holding this claim not actionable und\u00e9r 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Issues Presented for Review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">\u201cA. The court erred in relying on the possibility of post-deprivation procedures, because the deprivation was the predictable result of established state procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">\u201cB. The court erred in holding that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for violation of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">\u201cC. The court erred in not rejecting defendant\u2019s claim to immunity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Attorney General as to their Section 1983 claim. Appellants assert that the Brady check system and Brady fee infringed upon their rights and deprived them of property through an established state policy that did not provide a predeprivation state remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>B. SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), the trial court may grant summary judgment where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. <em>Welco Industries, Inc. v.

Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 482, 485, 696 N.E.2d 1044, 1046, citing <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 341, 617 N.E.2d 1123, 1126-1127. Summary judgment is appropriate where a plaintiff fails to produce evidence supporting the essential elements of his claim. <em>Welco Industries, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 346, 617 N.E.2d at 1131-1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In determining whether the plaintiff demonstrated the elements of his claim, an appellate court must independently review the record to determine if summary judgment was appropriate. Therefore, an appellate court affords no deference to the trial court\u2019s decision when making its own decision. <em>Beardsley v. Manfredi Motor Transit Co. </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 768, 769, 647 N.E.2d 555, 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">C. SECTION 1983 CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">1. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">We first address an issue of jurisdiction raised in the pleadings, but left unresolved by the trial court: whether appellants\u2019 cause of action was required to have been initiated in the Ohio Court of Claims, pursuant to R.C. 2743.02.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Conley v. Shearer </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 284, 595 N.E.2d 862, the Supreme Court ruled that R.C. 2743.02, which requires that suits against the state or its officers and employees must be instituted in the Court of Claims, is not applicable to Section 1983 claims because such suits are founded in federal, not state, law. <em>Id. </em>at 293, 595 N.E.2d at 869-870, citing <em>Schwarz v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 267, 31 OBR 493, 510 N.E.2d 808, paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, the trial court did have jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 Section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">2. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The Attorney General pled and argued in summary judgment that appellants\u2019 Section 1983 claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court did not decide this issue due to its resolution of the case on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The Reconstruction Civil Rights Acts, of which Section 1983 is a progeny, do not contain an explicit statute of limitations, \u201c \u2018a void which is commonplace in federal statutory law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson v. Garcia </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 261, 266, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1942, 85 L.Ed.2d 254, 260. For that reason, the United States Supreme Court has.looked to practical considerations to conclude that Section 1983 actions confer \u201ca general remedy for injuries to personal rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 105 S.Ct. at 1948, 85 L.Ed.2d at 268. \u201c[Section] 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury actions\u201d subject to the state \u201cstatute of limitations governing actions \u2018for an injury to the person or reputation of any person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 105 S.Ct. at 1949, 85 L.Ed.2d at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\"><em>Wilson </em>cleared some confusion regarding the statute of limitations applicable to Section 1983 claims, but it left unresolved what happened if a state had more than one personal injury statute of limitations. This circumstance was resolved in <em>Owens v. Okure </em>(1989), 488 U.S. 235, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594. There the court rejected an argument that the statute of limitations for intentional torts governs Section 1983 actions. The court reasoned that Section 1983 claims take many forms without state law analogy, and comparing them to intentional tort claims \u201cwould be inconsistent with [Section] 1983\u2019s broad scope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 109 S.Ct. at 581, 102 L.Ed.2d at 605. The court held that \u201cwhere state law provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, courts considering [Section] 1983 claims should borrow the general or residual statute for personal injury actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249-250, 109 S.Ct. at 582, 102 L.Ed.2d at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>This court addressed the effect of <em>Okure </em>in <em>State ex rel. Eckstein v. Midwest Pride IV, Inc. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 1, 713 N.E.2d 1055, wherein we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cR.C. 2305.09(D) contains a residual statute of limitations; however, it is apparent to this court that R.C. 2305.10 contains the general statute of limitations for personal injury actions. Therefore, we find that the appropriate limitations period to be applied in a Section 1983 action is the two-year period set forth in R.C. 2305.10.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 713 N.E.2d at 1063.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Midwest Pride IV </em>accorded with the federal courts and other Ohio appellate courts. See <em>id. </em>at 13-14, 713 N.E.2d at 1062-1064. Although some Ohio appellate courts have disagreed, finding that the four-year limitations period in R.C. 2305.09(D) governs Section 1983 actions, see <em>id. </em>at 14, 713 N.E.2d at 1063-1064, the reasoning of these other cases remains unpersuasive in light of the clear mandate of <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Okure </em>and the text of relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\"><em>Wilson </em>and <em>Okure </em>make clear that although not strictly personal injury claims, Section 1983 actions are most analogous to personal injury suits. <em>Okure, </em>488 U.S. at 249-250, 109 S.Ct. at 581-582, 102 L.Ed.2d at 605-606; <em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 278 and 280, 105 S.Ct. at 1948 and 1949, 85 L.Ed.2d at 267-268 and 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">R.C. 2305.09 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">\u201cAn action for any of the following causes shall be brought within four years after the cause thereof accrued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">\u201c(D) For an injury to the rights of the plaintiff not arising on contract nor enumerated in sections 2305.10 to 2305.12, 2305.14[,] and 1304.35 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">R.C. 2305.10 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">\u201c(A) Except as provided in division (C) of this section [as to product liability claims], an action based on a product liability claim and an action for bodily injury or injuring personal property shall be brought within two years after the cause of action accrues. Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) to (4) of this section, a cause of action accrues under this division when the injury or loss to person or property occurs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">R.C. 2305.09 applies to certain enumerated causes of action. It specifically excepts those claims governed by R.C. 2305.10, which include. actions \u201cfor bodily injury.\u201d Thus, the general personal injury limitations period is two years, as included in R.C. 2305.10. See <em>Browning v. Burt (1993), </em>66 Ohio St.3d 544, 558, 613 N.E.2d 993, certiorari denied (1994), 510 U.S. 1111, 114 S.Ct. 1054, 127 L.Ed.2d 375; <em>Gambill v. Bonded Oil Co. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 90, 556 N.E.2d 177, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>syllabus; <em>Richardson v.

That provision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cAn action for bodily injury or injuring personal property shall be brought within two years after the cause thereof arose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Section 11224-1, General Code, governed \u201call actipns the real purpose of which is to recover damages for injury to the person and losses incident thereto and it makes no difference whether such action is for a breach of contract or strictly in tort. The limitation is imposed on the cause of action and the form in which the action is brought is immaterial.\u201d <em>Andrianos v. Community Traction Co. </em>(1951), 155 Ohio St. 47, 44 O.O. 72, 97 N.E.2d 549, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The section was \u201cnot confined to any particular type of injury, nor does it concern itself with the circumstances under which an injury was inflicted. On its face, it clearly covers all actions based on a claim respecting bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 44 O.O. at 74, 97 N.E.2d at 552. The modern version of the limitations statutes are more detailed and specific, see R.C. 2305.09(A) to (C) and 2305.11, but the effect of R.C. 2305.10(A) is the same as was that of Section 11224-1, General Code: all personal injury actions, except those specifically governed by another statute, are subject to a two-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Cases finding R.C. 2305.09(D) applicable to Section 1983 actions misread the import of the limitations statutes, hinging their analysis upon R.C. 2305.09(D)\u2019s inclusion of the words \u201cinjury to the rights of the plaintiff.\u201d See <em>Bojac Corp. v. Kutevac </em>(1990), 64 Ohio App.3d 368, 370-371, 581 N.E.2d 625; <em>Weethee v. Boso </em>(1989), 64 Ohio App.3d 532, 534-535, 582 N.E.2d 19.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But these words must be read in light of the full text of subsection (D): \u201can injury to the rights of the plaintiff not arising on contract <em>nor enumerated in sectio[n] 2305.10.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Personal injury claims subject to R.C. 2305.10 are thus exempt from R.C. 2305.09\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\"><em>Wilson </em>and <em>Okure </em>held that Section 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury actions. Bodily injury, or personal injury, actions are specifically governed by R.C. 2305.10. See <em>Browning, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 558, 613 N.E.2d at 1004; <em>Gambill </em>at syllabus; <em>Richardson </em>at syllabus and 176 Ohio St. at 373, 27 O.O.2d at 347, 199 N.E.2d at 880. Thus, we reaffirm our holding in <em>Midwest </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>Pride IV </em>that R.C. 2305.10(A), the two-year general personal injury limitations period, governs Section 1983 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Appellants filed their complaint on January 12, 1999. But the initial decision about which they complain \u2014 the Attorney General\u2019s decision to charge the Brady fee \u2014 was made in 1994. Any complaint attacking the 1994 decision had to be filed in 1996. Appellants did not so file their complaint, and they are statutorily barred from challenging the 1994 decision directly.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Appellants did file their complaint within two years of the 1997 decision by Betty Montgomery to continue to charge the Brady fee. Their complaint was timely as to that 1997 decision. Further, appellants\u2019 complaint could be construed to state a cause of action as to the effect of the 1994 decision: each time a class member was charged the Brady fee prior to <em>Printz </em>could be construed to constitute a possible deprivation of that individual\u2019s rights. Thus, those Brady fees charged under the <em>pre-Printz </em>Brady system on or after January 12,1997 are not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Any relief relating to events occurring prior to January 12, 1997 is barred by the two-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.10(A). The trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to all events occurring before January 12, 1997 was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">3. Personal- and Official-Capacity Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Appellants sued Betty Montgomery in both her official capacity as Attorney General and in her personal capacity. In their personal-capacity claim, appellants allege that Betty Montgomery, although acting in her official capacity, is personally liable for violating appellants\u2019 civil rights when ordering the Brady fee to be charged. The official-capacity claim is premised upon the same principle: that the Attorney General\u2019s office acted improperly when charging the Brady fee. But the official-capacity suit seeks to hold the Office of the Attorney General, and thus the state, liable for the alleged illegal conduct. Because there is a distinction between personal-capacity and official-capacity suits, appellants\u2019 ability to maintain these claims must be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Personal-capacity suits, sometimes characterized as individual-capacity suits, seek to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of state law. <em>Hafer v. Melo </em>(1991), 502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 S.Ct. 358, 362, 116 L.Ed.2d 301, 309-310. By contrast, an official-capacity suit, wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>a government officer is sued in her official capacity, \u201c \u2018generally represents] only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Kentucky v. Graham </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d 114, 121. For this reason, official-capacity suits are treated as suits against the state itself. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 105 S.Ct. at 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d at 121-122.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The distinction between personal-capacity and official-capacity suits is important due to the test of Section 1983 providing that \u201c[e]very <em>person </em>who, under color of any * * * [law], custom, or usage, of any State\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> deprives citizens of their rights, privileges, or immunities under the federal Constitution or law is liable to the injured citizens. Only a \u201cperson\u201d is subject to liability under Section 1983. Section 1983 is inapplicable against a state, as \u201ca State is not a person within the meaning of [Section] 1983.\u201d <em>Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 58, 64, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2308, 105 L.Ed.2d 45, 53. The United States Supreme Court reached this conclusion through a lengthy review of Section 1983\u2019s text and legislative history. See <em>id. </em>at 64-69, 109 S.Ct. at 2308-2311, 105 L.Ed.2d at 53-57.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">When a state official is sued in her official capacity, the suit is actually one against the official\u2019s office, which is akin to a suit against the state. Thus, Section 1983 may not be the basis for-an official-capacity suit for money damages, as the official, acting in her official capacity, is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the ambit of Section 1983. <em>Hafer, </em>502 U.S. at 26, 112 S.Ct. at 362, 116 L.Ed.2d at 310; <em>Will, </em>491 U.S. at 70-71, 109 S.Ct. at 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d at 57-58; <em>Burkey v. S. Ohio Corr. Facility </em>(1988), 38 Ohio App.3d 170, 171, 528 N.E.2d 607, 608. This is because \u201cwhile an award of damages against an official in his personal capacity can be executed only against the official\u2019s personal assets, a plaintiff seeking to recover on a damages judgment in an official-capacity suit must look to the government entity itself.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. at 166, 105 S.Ct. at 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d at 121; see <em>Schwarz, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 273, 31 OBR at 499, 510 N.E.2d at 813: \u201cuniversity officials * * * are not \u2018the state,\u2019 * * * and such will usually be the case unless the state is the real party in interest and a judgment for the plaintiff could operate to control the action of the state or subject it to liability.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Thus, a Section 1983 claim for monetary relief may be brought against a state official only in that official\u2019s individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">There is one exception to the rule that a state and its officials in their official capacity are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of Section 1983. When only prospective relief is sought, the state and its officials are \u201cpersons\u201d within Section 1983\u2019s ambit. <em>Will, </em>491 U.S. at 71, 109 S.Ct. at 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d at 58, fn. 10; <em>Schwarz, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 272-273, 31 OBR at 497-499, 510 N.E.2d at 812-813; <em>Racing Guild of Ohio, Local 304 v. State Racing Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 317, 28 OBR 386, 503 N.E.2d 1025, paragraph one of the syllabus. Such actions are not treated as against the state. <em>Graham, </em>473 U.S. at 167, 105 S.Ct. at 3106, 87 L.Ed.2d at 122, fn. 14. With prospective relief, such as an injunction preventing future enforcement of a law, \u201cno affirmative action of any nature is directed, and the officer is simply prohibited from doing an act which he had no legal right to do. An injunction to prevent him from doing that which he has no legal right to do is not an interference with the discretion of an officer.\u201d <em>Ex parte Young </em>(1908), 209 U.S. 123, 159, 28 S.Ct. 441, 453, 52 L.Ed. 714, 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u201cThe act to be enforced is alleged to be unconstitutional; and if it be so, the use of the name of the state to enforce an unconstitutional act to the injury of complainants is a proceeding without the authority of, and one which does not affect, the state in its sovereign or governmental capacity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>209 U.S. at 159, 28 S.Ct. at 454, 52 L.Ed. at 729. Prospective relief has only an ancillary effect upon the state coffers. <em>Thomson v. Harmony </em>(C.A.6, 1995), 65 F.3d 1314, 1320-1321, certiorari denied (1996), 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S.Ct. 1321, 134 L.Ed.2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Appellants allege that their suit, although requesting only monetary relief, is really an action for prospective, equitable relief. In their arguments/memoranda to the trial court, appellants attempted to analogize their Section 1983 claim to suits seeking payment of back pay for discrimination under federal law, citing <em>Head v. Timken Roller Bearing Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1973), 486 F.2d 870, and <em>Robinson v. Lorillard Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1971), 444 F.2d 791, certiorari dismissed (1971), 404 U.S. 1006, 92 S.Ct. 573, 30 L.Ed.2d 655. Those cases involved suits against <em>private </em>employers, and Section 2000e-5(g), Title 42, U.S.Code, which gives courts the express power to award backpay to successful employment discrimination claimants. Neither circumstance is present in appellants\u2019 claim, making these cases inapplicable. Other cases cited by appellants, <em>Grandview Raceway, Inc. v. Ohio State Racing Comm. </em>(1966), 6 Ohio App.2d 91, 35 O.O.2d 186, 216 N.E.2d 765, <em>Thrope v. Ohio </em>(S.D.Ohio 1997), 173 F.R.D. 483, and <em>Roman v. Korson </em>(W.D.Mich.1993), 152 F.R.D. 101, were suits for injunctive relief against government officials; again, relief appellants are not seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Appellants nonetheless claim they are seeking prospective equitable relief because their Section 1983 claim attempts to refund the allegedly illegal Brady fee. \u201cProspective\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201c1. Effective or operative in the future prospective application of the new statute &gt;. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Anticipated or expected; likely to come about prospective clients&gt;.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 1238.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Prospective relief, by its very definition, would require a remedy preventing future conduct by the state. Appellants do not seek future relief, such as an injunction preventing future Brady checks or Brady fees.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although the second count of appellants\u2019 complaint, founded in assumpsit and alleging that the Brady fee was illegal, may have some equitable characteristics, see <em>Ohio Hosp. Assn. v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 97, 579 N.E.2d 695, paragraph three of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1992), 503 U.S. 940, 112 S.Ct. 1483, 117 L.Ed.2d 625, the first count of appellants\u2019 complaint, their Section 1983 claim, seeks monetary relief for alleged <em>past </em>violations of their civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Appellants\u2019 Section 1983 claim for a refund of the Brady fees is not one for prospective, injunctive relief. It seeks only alleged past damages. Thus, appellants have no basis for an official-capacity suit. Summary judgment was properly granted to the Attorney General\u2019s Office as to appellants\u2019 official-capacity claim. This leaves only appellants\u2019 claim against Betty Montgomery in her individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">4. Recapitulation</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">To summarize to this point, the trial court had jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 Section 1983 suit. Due to appellants\u2019 failure to file their complaint within the applicable statute of limitations, all claims founded upon events prior to January 12, 1997 are time-barred. For purposes of convenience, each time the BCI&amp;I charged the Brady fee after January 12, 1997 is considered a possible infringement of a class member\u2019s rights. Appellants did not state an official-capacity claim against the Attorney General because appellants did not seek prospective relief. The trial court properly granted summary judgment with regard to all events preceding January 12, 1997, and with regard to appellants\u2019 official-capacity suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">5. Merits of Section 1983 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">a. Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Civil rights actions have produced substantial litigation, and the law underlying Section 1983 claims is more than a little complex. Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, as amended into current Section 1983, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">To be entitled to relief under Section 1983, aggrieved parties must establish that \u201c[1] they were deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and [2] that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state law.\u201d <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 985, 143 L.Ed.2d 130, 142-144. Section 1983 was intended \u201cnot only to \u2018override\u2019 discriminatory or otherwise unconstitutional state laws, and to provide a remedy for violations of civil rights \u2018where state law was inadequate,\u2019 but also to provide a federal remedy \u2018where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zinermon v. Burch </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 113, 124, 110 S.Ct. 975, 982, 108 L.Ed.2d 100, 113, quoting <em>Monroe v. Pape </em>(1961), 365 U.S. 167, 173-174, 81 S.Ct. 473, 477, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, 497-498.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">This suit involves two classes of aggrieved parties. First, buyers contend that the Attorney General infringed upon their rights to bear arms and to receive a handgun by conditioning those rights upon the payment of the allegedly unlawful Brady fee. Second, FFLs and buyers contend that the Brady fee deprived them of property, namely the amount of the fee, without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">b. Deprivation of Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">i. Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The first element of a Section 1983 claim is an alleged deprivation of rights. <em>Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. at 49, 119 S.Ct. at 985, 143 L.Ed.2d at 142-143. Section 1983 \u201c \u2018is not itself a source of substantive rights,\u2019 but merely provides \u2018a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albright v. Oliver </em>(1994), 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S.Ct. 807, 811, 127 L.Ed.2d 114, 122, rehearing denied (1994), 510 U.S. 1215, 114 S.Ct. 1340, 127 L.Ed.2d 688, quoting <em>Baker v. McCollan </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 137, 144, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2694, 61 L.Ed.2d 433, 442, fn. 3. The first step in any rights inquiry under Section 1983 is to \u201cidentify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed.\u201d <em>Albright, </em>510 U.S. at 271, 114 S.Ct. at 811, 127 L.Ed.2d at 122. Three types of Section 1983 claims founded upon the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution may be brought against state officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>First, substantive rights may be enforced, via Section 1988. \u201c[T]he [Due Process] Clause incorporates many of the specific protections defined in the Bill of Rights,\u201d and a plaintiff may sue for an infringement of these specific rights. <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 125, 110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 113.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Due Process Clause also \u201ccontains a substantive component that bars certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions \u2018regardless of the fairness of the .procedures used to implement them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Daniels v. Williams </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 665, 88 L.Ed.2d 662, 668. Substantive due process thus protects both explicit rights and other fundamental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In a substantive rights claim, the actionable constitutional violation is complete when the wrongful conduct takes place. <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 125, 110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 113-114. A plaintiff may invoke Section 1983 regardless of any state tort remedies that may compensate for the deprivation. <em>Id. </em>But \u201c[w]here a particular Amendment \u2018provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\u2019 against a particular sort of government behavior, \u2018that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of \u201csubstantive due process,\u201d must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albright, </em>510 U.S. at 273, 114 S.Ct. at 813, 127 L.Ed.2d at 123-124, quoting <em>Graham v. Connor </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443, 454-455.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The second Section 1983 claim enforces a federal statutory right. A federal statutory right claim may be maintained only where the federal statute at issue clearly provides an enforceable right. <em>Maine v. Thiboutot </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2504, 65 L.Ed.2d 555, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The final Section 1983 Due Process Clause claim is founded upon the guarantee of fair procedure. A violation of procedural due process occurs where \u201cthe deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in \u2018life, liberty, or property\u2019 is not in itself unconstitutional; what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest <em>without due process of law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 125, 110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 114; see <em>Carey v. Piphus </em>(1978), 435 U.S. 247, 259, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1050, 55 L.Ed.2d 252, 262. A procedural due process violation is actionable not when the deprivation occurs, but only \u201cunless and until the State fails to provide due process.\u201d <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 126, 110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 114. The existence of state remedies is relevant, for the court must examine \u201cthe procedural safeguards built into the statutory or administrative procedure of effecting the deprivation, and any remedies for erroneous deprivations provided by statute or tort law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">ii. Substantive Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">(A) Violation of a Constitutional Right \u2014 Buyers</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Buyers contend that the Brady scheme and Brady fee infringed upon the protections of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. That Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-9\">\u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">It is long-settled law that, as to \u201cbearing arms for a lawful purpose\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\">\u201cThis is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its exercise. The [S]eeond [A]mendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress. This is one of the amendments that has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, leaving the people to look for their protection against any violation by their fellow-citizens of the rights it recognizes, to what is called * * * the \u2018powers which relate to merely municipal legislation, or what was, perhaps, more properly called internal police,\u2019 \u2018not surrendered or restrained\u2019 by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States v. Cruikshank </em>(1875), 92 U.S. 542, 553, 23 L.Ed. 588, 591, 592.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">It was later reiterated \u201cthat the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the [n]ational government, and not upon that of the States.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>Presser v. Illinois </em>(1886), 116 U.S. 252, 265, 6 S.Ct. 580, 584, 29 L.Ed. 615, 619. The United States Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in <em>United States v. Miller </em>(1939), 307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In <em>Miller, </em>the court found that a challenged state law that limited the possession of certain weapons did not run afoul of the Second Amendment because \u201cwe cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 59 S.Ct. at 818, 83 L.Ed. at 1209. The court determined that the Second Amendment was intended to be effective only upon the federal government, <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but \u201c[m]ost if not all of the States have adopted * * * the right to keep and bear arms. Differences in the language employed in these have naturally led to somewhat variant conclusions concerning the scope of the right guaranteed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 59 S.Ct. at 820, 83 L.Ed. at 1211.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As a result, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment to restrict the power of the states to regulate the right to keep and bear arms. <em>Peoples Rights Org. v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 152 F.3d 522, 538, fn. 18; <em>Hickman v.

Violation of this branch of substantive due process occurs where there is government action infringing a fundamental right or which \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d <em>Mansfield Apt. Owners Assn. v. Mansfield </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 988 F.2d 1469, 1474.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The protection of substantive due process exists to ensure \u201c \u2018the right to be free [from] state intrusions into [the] realms of personal privacy and bodily security through means so brutal, demeaning, and harmful as literally to shock the conscience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lillard v. Shelby Cty. Bd. of Edn. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 76 F.3d 716, 725. The courts are hesitant to extend the scope of substantive due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201c \u2018As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because the guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted area are scarce and open-ended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albright, </em>510 U.S. at 271-272, 114 S.Ct. at 812, 127 L.Ed.2d at 122, quoting <em>Collins v.

Thus, buyers failed to provide a substantive due process ground for their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Nor did buyers provide evidence showing that the Attorney General\u2019s conduct in authorizing the Brady fee \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d The lengthy correspondence in the record demonstrates that the Attorney General was very concerned about her authority to implement the Brady Act. The Attorney General was conscientious of the right of Ohioans. The Attorney General acted to address issues of handgun violence, issues which were recognized as being in the public interest. Under these circumstances, charging a minimal fee as part of the Brady check scheme cannot be said to shock the conscience. Buyers failed to demonstrate a fundamental rights violation to support their Section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>iii. Federal Statutory Right \u2014 Buyers</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Buyers contend that the Attorney General abridged their right to receive a handgun by imposing certain conditions not otherwise part of the Brady Act. Buyers argue that the Brady Act created a right to receive a handgun that could not be conditioned upon payment of the Brady fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">(A) Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Section 1983 prohibits conduct abridging a federal statutory right \u2014 a matter distinct from violations of federal law, which are not actionable under Section 1983. <em>Blessing v. Freestone </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 1359, 137 L.Ed.2d 569, 581-582, citing <em>Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles </em>(1989), 493 U.S. 103, 105, 110 S.Ct. 444, 448, 107 L.Ed.2d 420, 427. The essential inquiry in this regard is to determine whether the federal statute at issue creates a recognizable right that the plaintiff may defend or enforce. Three factors are examined to determine if a particular statutory provision gives rise to a right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">\u201cFirst, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so \u2018vague and amorphous\u2019 that its enforcement would strain judicial competence. Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Blessing, </em>520 U.S. at 340-341, 117 S.Ct. at 1359, 137 L.Ed.2d at 582; see <em>Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v.

As noted in <em>Blessing, </em>\u201c[i]n prior cases, we have been able to determine whether or not a statute created a given right because plaintiffs articulated, and lower courts evaluated, well-defined claims.\u201d 520 U.S. at 342, 117 S.Ct. at 1360, 137 L.Ed.2d at 583. A court must take \u201cpains to analyze the statutory provisions in detail, in light of the entire legislative enactment, to determine whether the language in question created \u2018enforceable rights, privileges, or immunities within the meaning of [Section] 1983.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suter v. Artist M. </em>(1992), 503 U.S. 347, 357, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 1367, 118 L.Ed.2d 1, 12, quoting <em>Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment &amp; Hous.

Dismissal of the cause is warranted where \u201cCongress \u2018specifically foreclosed a remedy under [Section] 1983.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Smith v.

Congress may effect such a result in two manners: first, \u201cexpressly, by forbidding recourse to [Section] 1983 in the statute itself,\u201d or second, \u201cimpliedly, by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under [Section] 1983.\u201d <em>Blessing, </em>520 U.S. at 341, 117 S.Ct. at 1360, 137 L.Ed.2d at 582, citing <em>Livadas v.

In <em>Sea Clammers, </em>the Federal Water Pollution Control Act gave the Environmental Protection Agency a panoply of enforcement options and several of the Act\u2019s provisions authorized private citizen enforcement actions, making it \u201chard to believe that Congress intended to preserve the [Section] 1983 right of action when it created so many specific statutory remedies, including the two citizen-suit provisions.\u201d 453 U.S. at 13-14 and 20, 101 S.Ct. at 2622-2623 and 2626-2627, 69 L.Ed.2d at 446-447 and 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Likewise, in <em>Robinson, </em>the review scheme of the Education of the Handicapped Act permitted the aggrieved party to invoke \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d local administrative procedures, followed by federal judicial review. The court reasoned that Congress\u2019s intent could not have been to allow aggrieved parents to skip such administrative and judicial procedures with a Section 1983 action because that would \u201crender superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute.\u201d 468 U.S. at 1009-1011, 104 S.Ct. at 3467-3468, 82 L.Ed.2d at 763-765.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Nonetheless, \u201ca plaintiffs ability to invoke [Section] 1983 cannot be defeated simply by \u2018[t]he availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the plaintiffs interests\u2019 \u201d or \u201cby limited state grievance procedures for individuals.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Blessing, </em>520 U.S. at 347-348, 117 S.Ct. at 1363, 137 L.Ed.2d at 586.

The Attorney General responds that the Brady Act did not create any such right, since Title 18 of the United States Code has traditionally not vested property rights in individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Following <em>Blessing, </em>520 U.S. at 340-341, 117 S.Ct. at 1359, 137 L.Ed.2d at 581-583, we must determine (1) whether the Brady Act was intended to benefit gun buyers, (2) whether the asserted right to receive a handgun when not a member of a prohibited class is too \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d for the courts to enforce, and (3) whether the Brady Act imposes a binding obligation upon the state to approve handgun sales for nonprohibited persons. Neither Section 922(s) nor the Brady Act itself directly addresses these issues. The Brady Act\u2019s preamble states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">\u201cAn Act to provide for a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun, and for the establishment of a national instant criminal background check system to be contacted by firearms dealers before the transfer of any firearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The Brady Act was clearly intended to protect the public from handgun violence by instituting a records check system to ensure that prohibited classes of persons were not sold handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">We must turn to the entire legislative scheme of the Brady Act and \u201cits object and policy\u201d to determine if it recognizes a specific enforceable right. <em>Halderman, </em>451 U.S. at 18, 101 S.Ct. at 1540, 67 L.Ed.2d at 708. The Brady Act was intended to benefit the public as a whole by protecting it from handgun violence. It prohibited certain persons from buying a handgun. As to lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>purchasers, the Brady Act only ensures that, under specific circumstances, the state will not intervene in a handgun transfer where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">\u201c(I) 5 business days (meaning days on which State offices are open) have elapsed from the date the transferor furnished notice of the contents of the statement to the chief law enforcement officer, during which period the transferor has not received information from the chief law enforcement officer that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would be in violation of Federal, State, or local law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201c(II) the transferor has received notice from the chief law enforcement officer that the officer has no information indicating that receipt or possession of the handgun by the transferee would violate Federal, State, or local law[.]\u201d Section 922(s)(l)(A)(ii).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The Brady Act, specifically Section 922(s), does not create an affirmative obligation upon the state to ensure that a handgun purchase takes place. Rather, it only guarantees that where otherwise allowed by law, the state will not intervene in the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">At first glance this may seem precatory, stating only a preference for certain state conduct. But another provision of the Brady Act demonstrates that a right is created. Section 925A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201cAny person denied a firearm pursuant to subsection (s) or (t) of section 922\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\u201c(1) due to the provision of erroneous information relating to the person by any State or political subdivision thereof, or by the national instant criminal background check system established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">\u201c(2) who was not prohibited from receipt of a firearm pursuant to subsection (g) or (n) of section 922, may bring an action against the State or political subdivision responsible for providing the erroneous information, or responsible for denying the transfer, or against the United States, as the case may be, for an order directing that the erroneous information be corrected or that the transfer be approved, as the case may be. In any action under this section, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">This section provides a guarantee to lawful handgun buyers: that the state will not provide erroneous information or erroneously deny the transfer. The Brady Act is clear as to those grounds which prevent a gun transfer: that the transfer would be in violation of federal, state, or local law. Sections 922(s)(l)(A)(ii), 922(s)(l)(C)(ii), 922(s)(l)(D), 922(a)(2), 922(b)(4), 922(b)(6)(B), and 922(s)(6)(C). In light of Section 925A, the Brady Act established a federal right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>in lawful gun buyers that states would not provide erroneous information or erroneously disapprove a handgun transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">This right is not so vague and amorphous as to be beyond the abilities of courts to enforce. The court may order that erroneous information be corrected or that the gun transfer be approved. Section 925A is specific as to this remedy. In fact, Section 925A would be superfluous if the obligation to provide correct information and to approve lawful transfers was merely precatory. Otherwise, there is no need to provide an enforcement mechanism within the Brady Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">We cannot conclude that Congress intended Section 925A to foreclose Section 1983 as a remedial means of securing the Brady Act\u2019s created right. Section 925A states that an aggrieved buyer \u201cmay\u201d bring suit under that provision. Buyers are not required in any way to use only 925A to protect their statutory rights, even though that provision may be a preferred method of right enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Buyers are correct that the Attorney General and BCI&amp;I could not disapprove a gun transfer for failure to pay the Brady fee. Buyers provided no evidence to show that gun transfers were disapproved for this reason. Therefore, there is no basis for concluding that the Attorney General violated the Brady Act by improperly denying handgun transfers.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Additionally, Section 922(s) did not create a right to have the Brady check conducted without the imposition of an administrative fee. Section 922(s) is silent as to the charging of fees. Buyers are correct that the Brady Act did not expressly provide authority to charge the fees. But nor did it disapprove of such fees. We may not fashion a federal statutory right out of mere silence. Congress must speak to the matter.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Buyers failed to demonstrate that the Brady fee was used as a basis for approving or denying handgun transfers. There was no federal statutory right preventing the charging of the Brady fee. Thus, no right created by the Brady Act is relevant to buyers\u2019 challenge to the Brady fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">iv. Procedural Due Process \u2014 Buyers and FFLs</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>(A) Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Appellants contend that the Brady fee constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law. They assert that the charging of the Brady fee was an established scheme requiring pre-deprivation hearing and notice, neither of which was afforded.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">To recover via Section 1983 for a due process violation, plaintiffs must establish (1) that they have a protected life, liberty, or property interest, (2) that they were deprived of this protected interest, and (3) that the state did not afford them adequate procedural rights prior to the deprivation. <em>Hahn v. Star Bank </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 190 F.3d 708, 716, certiorari denied (2000), 529 U.S. 1020, 120 S.Ct. 1423, 146 L.Ed.2d 314, citing <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 125-126, 110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 113-114.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The first step in the due process inquiry is determining if appellants were deprived of property. <em>I-Star Communications Corp. v. E. Cleveland </em>(N.D.Ohio 1995), 885 F.Supp. 1035, 1040, citing <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548. \u201cProperty interests are not created by the [United States] Constitution, \u2018they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Loudermill </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 532, 538, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1491, 84 L.Ed.2d 494, 501; <em>Paul v. Davis </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 693, 708-709, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1164, 47 L.Ed.2d 405, 417-419, rehearing denied (1976), 425 U.S. 985, 96 S.Ct. 2194, 48 L.Ed.2d 811. Thus, it must be found that state law vests appellants with property rights protected by due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect against all deprivations of life, liberty, or property by the state. Rather it protects against only deprivations \u201cwithout due process of law.\u201d <em>McCollan, </em>443 U.S. at 145, 99 S.Ct. at 2695, 61 L.Ed.2d at 442. In these claims, the deprivation of a citizen\u2019s interests by the state is not in itself unconstitutional; the deprivation without due process of law is unconstitutional. <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 125, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 114. An infringement of property interests is thus actionable under Section 1983 only if the state fails to provide due process. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 110 S.Ct. at 983, 108 L.Ed.2d at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Where the state deprives a person of a protected interest through an established state mechanism or procedure, due process normally requires notice and a predeprivation hearing prior to state interference with the interest. <em>Parratt v. Taylor </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 527, 537, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1914, 68 L.Ed.2d 420, 429-430, reversed on other grounds (1986), <em>Daniels, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662. The existence of post-deprivation remedies is largely irrelevant under such circumstances. <em>Harris v. Akron </em>(C.A.6, 1994), 20 F.3d 1396, 1401, citing <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co. </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 422, 436, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1158, 71 L.Ed.2d 265, 278. But predeprivation procedures are not always required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201c[C]ases recognize that either the necessity of quick action by the State or the impracticality of providing any meaningful predeprivation process, when coupled with the availability of some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the State\u2019s action at some time after the initial taking, can satisfy the requirements of * * * due process * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201c \u2018[Prior cases] merely stand for the proposition that a hearing must be had before one is finally deprived of his property and do not deal at all with the need for a pretermination hearing where a full and immediate post-termination hearing is provided. The usual rule has been \u201c[w]here only property rights are involved, mere postponement of the judicial enquiry is not a denial of due process, if the opportunity given for ultimate judicial determination of liability is adequate.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations and footnote omitted.) <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 539-540, 101 S.Ct. at 1915, 68 L.Ed.2d at 431-432, quoting <em>Phillips v. Commissioner </em>(1931), 283 U.S. 589, 596-597, 51 S.Ct. 608, 611, 75 L.Ed. 1289, 1297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Whether due process is afforded prior to or after a deprivation by the state, the fundamental requirement is that the opportunity to be heard \u201cmust be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Manzo </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62, 66. The Supreme Court has rejected the proposition that \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner\u201d always requires a predeprivation hearing, due to \u201cthe impracticability in some cases of providing any preseizure hearing under a state-authorized procedure, and the assumption that at some time a full and meaningful hearing will be available.\u201d <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 540-541, 101 S.Ct. at 1915-1916, 68 L.Ed.2d at 432. But this willingness to excuse the predeprivation hearing requirement \u201crest[s] in part on the availability of some meaningful opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>subsequent to the initial taking for a determination of rights and liabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916, 68 L.Ed.2d at 432.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Where a predeprivation hearing is impracticable, courts must review the adequacy of state postdeprivation procedures. Here, whether the state provides a means of redress is relevant. For example, in <em>Parratt, </em>Nebraska \u201cprovide[d] a remedy to persons who believe they have suffered a tortious loss at the hands of the State. See Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 81-8, 209 <em>et seq. </em>(1976).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 101 S.Ct. at 1917, 68 L.Ed.2d at 434. The court also addressed the scope of remedy which the state must afford:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cIt is argued that the State does not adequately protect the [aggrieved] respondent\u2019s interests because it provides only for an action against the State as opposed to its individual employees, it contains no provisions for punitive damages, and there is no right to trial by jury. Although the state remedies may not provide the respondent with all the relief which may have been available if he could have proceeded under [Section] 1983, that does not mean that the state remedies are not adequate to satisfy the requirements of due process. The remedies provided could have fully compensated the respondent for the property loss he suffered * * * .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543-544, 101 S.Ct. at 1917, 68 L.Ed.2d at 434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">After <em>Parratt, </em>the Supreme Court narrowed this exception to providing a predeprivation hearing. In <em>Zinermon, </em>the court acknowledged that <em>Parratt </em>applies where postdeprivation remedies are all that a state can be expected to provide due to the impossibility or impracticability of providing predeprivation remedies. The court then held that <em>Parratt </em>is not controlling when the state provides a procedure under which it is predictable that its officials might infringe protected rights. 494 U.S. at 136-139, 110 S.Ct. at 989-990, 108 L.Ed.2d at 120-123.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The court explained that the need for and adequacy of postdeprivation remedies must be reviewed under several balancing factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201c \u2018First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interests through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 110 S.Ct. at 984, 108 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>at 115, quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 33.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">With this test, the court generally holds that the Constitution requires some kind of predeprivation hearing. But should the factors balance to the state\u2019s benefit, statutory means for a postdeprivation hearing or common-law tort remedies for erroneous deprivations satisfy due process. <em>Id. </em>at 127-128, 110 S.Ct. at 984, 108 L.Ed.2d at 114-115. Thus, \u201cwhere a predeprivation hearing is unduly burdensome in proportion to the liberty [or property] interest at stake, or where the State is truly unable to anticipate and prevent a random deprivation of a liberty interest, postdeprivation remedies might satisfy due process.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 132, 110 S.Ct. at 987, 108 L.Ed.2d at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">(B) Protected Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The first step in establishing a due process violation is demonstrating that the plaintiff has a recognizable, protected life, liberty, or property interest. Buyers assert that they have a state right to bear arms that cannot be infringed through the imposition of the Brady fee. FFLs and buyers both assert a right to retain their property, the amount of the Brady fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Section 4, Article I, Ohio Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201cThe people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security; but standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and shall not be kept up; and the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">This provision \u201cconfers upon the people of Ohio the fundamental right to bear arms. However, this right is not absolute.\u201d <em>Arnold, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. <em>Arnold </em>further explained Section 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">\u201cThis provision is divided by two semicolons, coordinating three independent clauses. Rather than focusing merely on the preservation of a militia, as provided by the Second Amendment, the people of Ohio chose to go even further. Section 4, Article I not only suggests a preference for a militia over a standing army, and the deterrence of governmental oppression, it adds a third protection and secures to every person a fundamental <em>individual </em>right to bear arms for \u2018their <em>defense and security </em>* * * * * This clause was obviously implemented to allow a person to possess certain firearms for defense of self and property.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 43, 616 N.E.2d at 169.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">The Ohio Supreme Court recognized the fundamental nature of this right to bear arms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">\u201cThe right of defense of self, property and family is a fundamental part of our concept of ordered liberty. To deprive our citizens of the right to possess any firearm would thwart the right that was so thoughtfully granted by our forefa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>thers and the drafters of our Constitution. For many, the mere possession of a firearm in the home offers a source of security. Furthermore, given the history of our nation and this state, the right of a person to possess certain firearms has indeed been a symbol of freedom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 616 N.E.2d at 169-170.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Nonetheless, this right is not absolute, and limited prohibitions may be enacted. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 616 N.E.2d at 173-174. The right is \u201csubject to reasonable regulation\u201d which, under the state\u2019s police powers, must \u201cbear a real and substantial relation\u201d to secure \u201cthe health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46-47, 616 N.E.2d at 171-172; see <em>Mosher v. Dayton </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 243, 247, 2 O.O.3d 412, 414, 358 N.E.2d 540, 542-543.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Arnold </em>continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u201cAny form of gun control legislation is destined to attract much attention. That does not change the fact that there must be some limitation on the right to bear arms to maintain an orderly and safe society while, at the same time, moderating restrictions on the right so as to allow for the practical availability of certain firearms for purposes of hunting, recreational use and protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 616 N.E.2d at 173.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Thus, the recognized state right to bear arms is subject to reasonable regulation which advances the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public. The Brady Act was implemented for that purpose, to protect the public from handgun violence by ensuring that prohibited classes of persons do not purchase handguns. In implementing the Brady Act, the Attorney General furthered this goal. The Brady checks did not, in themselves, impermissibly infringe upon buyers\u2019 right to bear arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The other interest of both buyers and FFLs is the amount of the Brady fee itself. The Brady fee was directly charged to the FFL by the state via the \u201c900\u201d telephone number, and only later charged by FFLs to the buyers. They challenge the Brady fee as part of an administrative scheme enforced within the state\u2019s police powers. The first factor applicable to a due process analysis in the instant case is appellants\u2019 interest in the amount of the Brady fee. That the claims involve a property interest in $13 or $15 does not render appellants\u2019 claims less weighty or worthy. Instead, we still focus on the effect of the state\u2019s procedures in light of the above constitutional standards.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>(C) Risk of Erroneous Deprivation</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The Brady Act recognizes that an individual buyer may erroneously be disapproved for a handgun transfer. Section 925A then provides a remedy for any such erroneous deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">There was also the risk that the Brady fee would be erroneously imposed. This would occur if the Brady fee was, in fact, not authorized by Ohio law as appellants contend. An interesting situation thus exists. Unlike the normal unauthorized-action case, the Brady fee was imposed as part of an established state scheme, not as an individual, random deprivation. Such random deprivations occur, for example, when a prison guard deprives a prisoner of his property, as in <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson v. Palmer </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393. But the situation here was also unlike the normal, established procedure case, wherein the individual deprivation occurs as part of an otherwise unchallenged established procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">If the Brady fee was an unauthorized fee, the state need only provide a postdeprivation remedy. <em>Parratt, </em>451 U.S. at 541, 101 S.Ct. at 1916, 68 L.Ed.2d at 432-433. If it was part of an established scheme, the state had to provide a predeprivation hearing, except where to do so would be impracticable. In such case, a postdeprivation remedy which adequately addressed appellants\u2019 loss was necessary. <em>Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 128, 110 S.Ct. at 984, 108 L.Ed.2d at 115-116. In either case, the risk of deprivation concerns only the amount of the Brady fee, which was addressable through a monetary remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">(D) Governmental Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Due process generally requires notice and a hearing prior to the deprivation, unless such is impracticable. In this case, notice is not contested. FFLs were told that the Brady fee would be charged and how it would be charged. All evidence indicates that buyers were made aware of this arrangement, even if only at the time they sought to effectuate a gun transfer. But no predeprivation hearing was afforded to individual FFLs or buyers before the charging of the Brady fee in each separate gun transfer. Thus, under Parratt\u2019s general rule that an established procedure requires a predeprivation hearing, there arguably is a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>It is understandable that the state did not provide a means for appellants to challenge the Brady fee prior to individual transactions. It would have been highly impractical to have allowed individual challenges to a $13 or $15 fee. The Brady Act mandated prompt action by law enforcement in conducting Brady checks. Prior to <em>Printz, </em>the BCI&amp;I had to conduct the Brady check in five days or less. Section 922(s)(2). After <em>Printz, </em>the voluntary Brady checks conducted by BCI&amp;I were to be performed in two days. The federalized sheriffs office deputies had to conduct Brady checks in five days. If a Brady check was not quickly performed, the sale was deemed approved under the Brady Act. See Section 922(s)(l)(A)(ii). Thus, an unlawful sale could be prevented only by law enforcement acting quickly to discover if a potential buyer was a member of a prohibited class.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Had the state created a separate administrative means for individual buyers and FFLs to challenge the Brady fee before a sale, the Brady Act\u2019s mandate for quick action would have been thwarted. It was impracticable for the state to provide a pre-deprivation hearing to individual buyers and FFLs before charging the Brady fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">(E) Postdeprivation Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Appellants\u2019 inability to challenge individual payments of the Brady fee is not determinative. We now focus on whether the state provided appellants a postdeprivation remedy adequate to protect their due process rights. In this respect, two statutory schemes are relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">First, and less important, is the declaratory judgment statute, R.C. Chapter 2721. R.C. 2721.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">\u201cSubject to division (B) of section 2721.02 of the Revised Code, any person * * * whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a constitutional provision, statute, [or] rule as defined in section 119.01 of the Revised Code * * * may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the * * * constitutional provision, statute, [or] rule * * * and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations under it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">R.C. 2721.02(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">\u201cSubject to division (B) of this section [not relevant here], courts of record may declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. No action or proceeding is open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for under this chapter. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect. The declaration has the effect of a final judgment or decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>By these provisions, the state provided appellants a means to challenge the legal validity of the Attorney General\u2019s decision to charge the Brady fee, as this was done pursuant to statutory and administrative authority. See R.C. 109.54, 109.55, and 109.57; see, also, Ohio Adm.Code 109:5-1-01. Appellants could have sought an earlier declaration that the Brady fee, as part of the state\u2019s implementation of the Brady Act, was not authorized or was an unconstitutional infringement of their rights. <em>Burger Brewing Co. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 93, 63 O.O.2d 149, 296 N.E.2d 261, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Erie Cty. Democratic Executive Commt. v. Brown </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 136, 138, 35 O.O.2d 154, 155, 216 N.E.2d 369, 370. A party may also pray for monetary relief, should it be granted a declaratory judgment in its favor. <em>Jeppe v. Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio </em>(1980), 67 Ohio App.2d 87, 92, 21 O.O.3d 406, 409-410, 425 N.E.2d 947, 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">More important, the state provided appellants with a more specific remedy than declaratory judgment. The rule has long been that \u201can action for declaratory judgment is inappropriate where special statutory proceedings would be bypassed.\u201d <em>Rocky Fork Hunt &amp; Country Club v.

To this end, the General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 2723, Enjoining and Recovering Illegal Taxes and Assessments. R.C. 2723.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cCourts of common pleas may enjoin the illegal levy or collection of taxes and assessments and entertain actions to recover them when collected, without regard to the amount thereof, but no recovery shall be had unless the action is brought within one year after the taxes or assessments are collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">This provision was long ago held to satisfy the requirements of due process in allowing a citizen to challenge taxes and other assessments. <em>State ex rel. v. Jones </em>(1894), 51 Ohio St. 492, 516-517, 37 N.E. 945, 951-952. In <em>Jones, </em>the court reiterated a basic rule regarding due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">\u201c[WJhenever, by laws of a state, or by state authority, a tax, assessment, servitude, or other burden is imposed upon property for the public use, whether it be for the whole state or some limited portion of the community, and those laws provide for a mode of confirming or contesting the charge thus imposed, in ordinary courts of justice, with such notice to the person, or such proceeding in regard to the property as is appropriate to the nature of the case, the judgment in such proceedings cannot be said to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law, however obnoxious it may be to other objections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516, 37 N.E. at 952, citing <em>Davidson v. New Orleans </em>(1877), 96 U.S. 97, 24 L.Ed. 616.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The court then held that then Section 5845 of the Revised Statutes, now R.C. 2723.01, satisfied the requirements of due process by affording a property owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>an adequate postdeprivation means to contest a tax or assessment. <em>Id. </em>at 517-518, 37 N.E. at 952, citing <em>McMillen v. Anderson </em>(1877), 95 U.S. 37, 23 L.Ed. 335. This provision was subsequently upheld again as affording due process. <em>Hammond v. Winder </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 433, 445-446, 126 N.E. 409, 412-413 (discussing then-Section 12075, General Code, now R.C. 2723.01).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In <em>Superior Films, Inc. v. Dept. of Edn. </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 315, 335, 50 O.O. 305, 314, 112 N.E.2d 311, 321, reversed on other grounds (1954), 346 U.S. 587, 74 S.Ct. 286, 98 L.Ed. 329, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the inspection fee charged by the Department of Education under the then-existing censorship scheme was subject to enjoinment pursuant to Section 12075, General Code, now R.C. 2723.01. There, the plaintiffs challenged the inspection fee as an unlawful excise tax in excess of the costs necessary to make film inspections. The court found that the plaintiff was estopped from challenging the fees because it had failed to seek recovery under the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The relevance of R.C. 2723.01 to inspection fees was again addressed in <em>Paramount Film Distrib. Corp. v. Tracy </em>(1962), 118 Ohio App. 29, 24 O.O.2d 362, 193 N.E.2d 283, affirmed (1963), 175 Ohio St. 55, 23 O.O.2d 352, 191 N.E.2d 839. That court reviewed the history and purpose of R.C. Chapter 2723, and its intent to supersede prior common-law actions to enjoin or collect illegal fees and taxes from state collectors. Relying upon <em>Superior Films </em>and other authorities, the court then found that the film inspection fees were subject to attack pursuant to R.C. 2723.01:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cConsidering the common-law context of [the] enactment, the fact that the statute is remedial, the accepted broad meaning of the word, \u2018taxes,\u2019 in remedial statutes, and the opinion of the Supreme Court in the <em>Superior Films </em>case, we hold that Chapter 2723 does apply to the fees collected under the censorship statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 24 O.O.2d at 365, 193 N.E.2d at 286.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The Brady fee is similar to the film inspection fee at issue in <em>Superior Films </em>and <em>Paramount Film. </em>The film inspection fee was designed to cover the board\u2019s expenses and other costs. That fee was charged when the film was submitted to the Board of Censors to examine and determine whether the film should be censored. The board would then judge whether the film was \u201c \u2018of a moral, educational or amusing and harmless character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Superior Films, </em>159 Ohio St. at 320, 50 O.O. at 307, 112 N.E.2d at 314. Likewise, the Brady fee was charged at the time the Brady form was submitted to BCI&amp;I. It was charged to cover the administrative expenses of conducting the Brady checks. The Brady check would review the buyer\u2019s records to determine if the buyer was in a prohibited class or whether the handgun transfer could be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In light of these similarities, R.C. 2723.01 was available to challenge the legality of the Brady fee, whether before or after its imposition. Pursuant to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>2723.01, appellants could have challenged the Brady fee\u2019s legality and sought a refund of the paid Brady fees.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> R.C. 2723.01 thus provided a postdeprivation remedial means for appellants. Even if R.C. 2723.01 was not available, appellants could have earlier sought declaratory relief under R.C. 2721.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The imposition of the Brady fee was not, in itself, a violation of appellants\u2019 due process rights. Although appellants were not afforded predeprivation hearings, the state provided them statutory postdeprivation remedies adequate to meet the requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">c. \u201cUnder Color of State Law\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The scheme devised by the Attorney General for conducting and charging for Brady checks was highly unusual. In fact, this court\u2019s research has not revealed a similar scheme being implemented by the state of Ohio on any previous occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Briefly, the system devised by the Attorney General worked as follows: To have a Brady check conducted, FFLs transmitted the Brady form to the BCI&amp;I via the \u201c900\u201d telephone number. This automatically charged the Brady fee to FFLs\u2019 telephone bills. FFLs could then pass on the cost of the Brady fee to buyers or, as Davis Guns did in its promotional sale, choose not to pass on the cost. The Attorney General asserts that because FFLs\u2019 handling of the Brady fee was not regulated, FFLs could even charge the buyer more than the Brady fee, thus making a profit on the Brady check.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">This scheme created two classes of potentially harmed plaintiffs. FFLs were directly charged the Brady fee by BCI&amp;I. Buyers, though, were not directly charged by BCI&amp;I. Instead, their payment of the Brady fee was left to FFLs\u2019 discretion. We must therefore determine if the Brady fee as incurred first by FFLs and then by buyers was done \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">i. Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Section 1983\u2019s \u201cunder color of state law\u201d element is akin to the \u201cstate-action\u201d requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, and it \u201cexcludes from its reach \u2018merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. at 50, 119 S.Ct. at 985, 143 L.Ed.2d at 143.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> To demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>conduct taken under color of state law, there must be <em>\u201cboth </em>an alleged constitutional deprivation \u2018caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible,\u2019 <em>and </em>that \u2018the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Lugar v.

The same holds true even where the state provides significant financial assistance to a private entity. <em>Cannon v.

FFLs</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Without question, BCI&amp;I\u2019s charging the Brady fee to FFLs via the \u201c900\u201d telephone number was done under color of state law. Under the Brady check scheme in effect either before or after <em>Printz, </em>FFLs were directly charged the Brady fee by BCI&amp;I, a state agency acting pursuant to the Attorney General\u2019s mandate. The Superintendent\u2019s June 30, 1997 letter to Ohio\u2019s FFLs confirms this fact: \u201cYou [the FFL] will be billed $13.00 for the service.\u201d Thus, Betty Montgomery, an individual, acting as Attorney General, was ultimately responsible for the state\u2019s utilizing the \u201c900\u201d telephone number system. FFLs were affected by state action, but as determined above, this state action did not deprive FFLs of their property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">iv. Buyers</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Whether buyers were affected by state action requires a more thorough analysis. The state never directly charged buyers the Brady fee. BCI&amp;I charged the Brady fee only to FFLs. FFLs then charged the fee to buyers. The record contains no evidence that FFLs were regulated by the state in any manner as to how they handled the Brady fee. FFLs could charge buyers the cost of the Brady fee, or they could charge more or less than the Brady fee. Davis Guns\u2019s promotional sale, during which it did not charge the Brady fee, is evidence of this lack of regulation. Thus, we must determine if FFLs, as private entities, were somehow converted into state actors.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The charging of fees is not a traditional state function, akin to elections or company towns. In general, FFLs are heavily regulated by the federal government as to the manner in which they operate and to whom they may sell guns. See Sections 921 to 926A, Title 18, U.S.Code. Unlike the federal government, the state does not heavily regulate FFLs\u2019 day-to-day operations. Instead, Ohio regulates the possession and use of firearms through its Criminal Code, R.C. Title 29, and other sections prohibiting possession and use of firearms within restricted areas such as schools, shooting ranges, and wildlife and forestry areas. R.C. 3313.66, 3316.662, and 1533.83 to 1533.85; Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 1501.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The record in this case demonstrates that as to the Brady checks, BCI&amp;I \u2014 and thus the Attorney General \u2014 did not enact any regulations governing the relationship between FFLs and their customers. Although BCI&amp;I was responsible for conducting Brady checks, and accordingly notified FFLs of this responsibility, the record does not indicate that BCI&amp;I was responsible for ensuring that or was even concerned whether the Brady fee was paid by buyers. The decision to have buyers pay the cost of the Brady fee was left to FFLs\u2019 judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the United States Supreme Court dealt with state office/private entity relationships analogous to the instant arrangement, in determining when a private entity acts \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d The Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was amended to allow a self-insured employer or a private insurer to withhold payment for disputed medical treatments pending an independent \u201cutilization review.\u201d The amended Act set forth a specific procedure for the employer or insurer to request such a review. Employees and employee representatives initiated a Section 1983 action, alleging that withholding benefits without pre-deprivation notice and an opportunity to be heard deprived them of property without due process of law and that such action was done under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The Supreme Court first pointed out that all parties agreed that the public officials responsible for administering the workers\u2019 compensation system and fund were state actors. <em>Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. at 50, 119 S.Ct. at 985, 143 L.Ed.2d at 143-144. The case thus turned on the insurer\u2019s decision to seek a \u201cutilization review\u201d: \u201cwhether a <em>private insurer\u2019s </em>decision to withhold payment for disputed medical treatment may be fairly attributable to the State so as to subject insurers to the constraints of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 51, 119 S.Ct. at 986, 143 L.Ed.2d at 144. The Supreme Court noted that the plaintiffs \u201cdo not assert that the decision to invoke utilization review should be attributed to the State because the State compels or is directly involved in that decision. Obviously the State is not so involved. It authorizes, but does not require, insurers to withhold payments for disputed medical treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 119 S.Ct. at 986, 143 L.Ed.2d at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>The <em>Sullivan </em>plaintiffs asserted that the decision of the insurer was attributable to the state because the state encouraged insurers to withhold payments when it amended the statute. The Supreme Court did not doubt \u201cthat the State\u2019s decision to provide insurers the option of deferring payment for unnecessary and unreasonable treatment pending review can in some sense be seen as encouraging them to do just that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 119 S.Ct. at 986, 143 L.Ed.2d at 145. The Supreme Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">\u201cThe State\u2019s decision to allow insurers to withhold payments pending review can just as easily be seen as state inaction, or more accurately, a legislative decision not to intervene in a dispute between an insurer and an employee * * *. The 1993 amendments, in effect, restored to insurers the narrow option, historically exercised by employers and insurers before the adoption of Pennsylvania\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law, to defer payment of a bill until it is substantiated. The most that can be said of the statutory scheme, therefore, is that whereas it previously prohibited insurers from withholding payment for disputed medical services, it no longer does so. Such permission of a private choice cannot support a finding of state action. As we have said before, our cases will not tolerate \u2018the imposition of Fourteenth Amendment restraints on private action by the simple device of characterizing the State\u2019s inaction as \u201cauthorization\u201d or \u201cencouragement.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 119 S.Ct. at 987, 143 L.Ed.2d at 146.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This reasoning controls the instant case. The Attorney General and BCI&amp;I took no action as to the FFLs\u2019 ability to charge buyers the Brady fee. Without <em>any </em>governmental action in the matter, it cannot be said that FFLs, as private entities, functioned as state actors. The state did nothing compelling FFLs to conduct their business one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">FFLs and the Attorney General were not so intimately tied to one another that the act of one must be deemed the act of the other. As noted above, the Attorney General in no way prescribed what action the FFLs could take regarding the Brady fee. Sullivan\u2019s reasoning is easily adaptable to the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cThe State\u2019s decision to allow [FFLs to take any action they choose as to the Brady fees] can just as easily be seen as state inaction, or more accurately, a [governmental] decision not to intervene in a dispute between [the FFL] and [the buyer] * * *. Such permission of a private choice cannot support a finding of state action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Although the Attorney General\u2019s decision to charge FFLs the Brady fee was conduct done under color of state law, \u201cthe action of [FFLs] later [to charge buyers] cannot be fairly characterized as state action.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>444 U.S. at 284-285, 100 S.Ct. at 559, 62 L.Ed.2d at 489. Buyers cannot demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the Attorney General compelled FFLs to pass on the cost of the Brady fee to buyers. Nor can buyers show that the Attorney General and FFLs were so intimately tied as to be acting as if a single, governmental entity.. The decisions of FFLs were not \u201cdictated or guided by the state.\u201d <em>Groman, </em>47 F.3d at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Nor can it be said that FFLs charged buyers the Brady fee in accordance with state \u201ccustom or usage.\u201d Although it may have been fairly well understood that FFLs would pass on the cost of the Brady fee to buyers, buyers did not present any evidence showing that any such understanding that may have existed had the \u201cforce of law.\u201d <em>Adickes, </em>398 U.S. at 171, 90 S.Ct. at 1615, 26 L.Ed.2d at 162. Even if such an understanding existed, Davis Guns\u2019s own action demonstrates that it was not- compulsory. On its own, Davis Guns chose not to not pass on the Brady fee cost to some of its buyers, and the Attorney General took no action against Davis Guns. The decision to pass on the cost of the Brady fee was left solely to the FFLs\u2019 discretion, making their conduct purely private and outside Section 1983\u2019s purview.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Buyers cannot demonstrate that in making them pay the Brady fee, the FFLs\u2019 action was conduct taken \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d As held above, buyers were not deprived of any property or rights, without dues process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">d. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">i. Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The courts have recognized that state officials possess a qualified immunity defense when sued under Section 1983. <em>Johnson v. Fankell </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 911, 914, 117 S.Ct. 1800, 1803, 138 L.Ed.2d 108, 113-114. Under this defense, \u201c \u2018officials performing discretionary function[s], generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 914-915, 117 S.Ct. at 1803, 138 L.Ed.2d at 114, quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Qualified immunity is \u201cvaluable\u201d to state officials for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-11\">\u201cFirst, if it is found applicable at any stage of the proceedings, it determines the outcome of the litigation by shielding the official from damages liability. Second, when the complaint fails to allege a violation of clearly established law or when discovery fails to uncover evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue whether the defendant committed such a violation, it provides the defendant with an immunity from the burdens of trial as well as a defense to liability.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 915, 117 S.Ct. at 1803, 138 L.Ed.2d at 114.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Furthermore, deciding constitutional questions before determining the question of qualified immunity \u201cpromotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both the officers and the general public.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Layne </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 1697, 143 L.Ed.2d 818, 827, citing <em>Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 833, 840-842, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1714, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043, 1053-1055, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In practice, whether an official may be held personally liable or protected by qualified immunity \u201cgenerally turns on the \u2018objective legal reasonableness\u2019 of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time it was taken.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>526 U.S. at 614, 119 S.Ct. at 1699, 143 L.Ed.2d at 830, quoting <em>Anderson v. Creighton </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038, 97 L.Ed.2d 523, 530. What \u201cclearly established\u201d means depends largely \u201cupon the level of generality at which the relevant \u2018legal rule\u2019 is to be established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For purposes of qualified immunity, \u201cclearly established\u201d means that \u201c \u2018[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>526 U.S. at 615, 119 S.Ct. at 1699, 143 L.Ed.2d at 830, quoting <em>Anderson, </em>483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">ii. Attorney General</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">As noted above, buyers have an established right to not have state officials provide erroneous information when conducting the Brady check, and to not have state officials erroneously deny a handgun transfer. Buyers and FFLs both possess the right to retain their property, the amount of the Brady fee, except where the state lawfully assesses the fee and provides them with due process. But, as also held above, the Attorney General did not infringe upon these rights in devising the Brady fee system.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Additionally, the record demonstrates that the Attorney General was aware of appellants\u2019 rights and sought to create a system that would not violate those rights. The USAG repeatedly told the Attorney General that involuntary Brady checks could be performed by the Attorney General after <em>Printz. </em>The Attorney General responded that this would not be allowed by Ohio law. The Attorney General\u2019s correspondence, both internally and to the USAG, demonstrates that the Attorney General made a concerted effort to create a system that could further the Brady Act\u2019s purpose to protect the public and coexist with the recognized rights of gun owners and buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In light of the in-depth analysis the Attorney General undertook in devising the Brady fee system and the fact that appellants\u2019 rights were not violated, it can only be said that the Attorney General is entitled to qualified immunity. Even had the Brady fee abridged appellants\u2019 rights in some respect, it would be difficult for appellants to show that the Attorney General should not be entitled to qualified immunity. The Attorney General\u2019s efforts in attempting to find a workable scheme showed restraint, wise counsel, and a keen understanding of appellants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">6. Recapitulation</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The trial court correctly found that appellants could not prove an infringement of their rights or due process taken under color of state law as required by Section 1983. Even had appellant\u2019s rights been infringed in some way, the Attorney General would be entitled to qualified immunity. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Attorney General on appellants\u2019 Section 1983 claim. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">\u201cThe court erred in finding that the Attorney General had lawful authority to charge fees to allow firearm dealers to transmit statements of intent to purchase handguns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Issues Presented for Review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">\u201cA. The court erred in finding that the Brady Act prohibited transfer of a handgun without a background check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">\u201cB. The court erred in finding that the Attorney General/[BCI&amp;I] was the designee of the \u2018Chief Law Enforcement Officers]\u2019 of Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">\u201cC. The court erred in finding that [BCI&amp;I] was authorized to conduct background checks and to charge fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">\u201cD. The court erred in finding that firearm purchasers \u2018consented\u2019 to background checks and signed a valid \u2018waiver.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">\u201cE. The court erred in dismissing the claims of persons who did not sign the purported \u2018waiver.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">\u201cF. The court erred in finding that Ohio law authorized the background checks and fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">D. COMMON-LAW CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">Appellants seek a refund of all Brady fees paid on grounds that the fee scheme was not authorized by Ohio law. The Attorney General responds that the fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>scheme was authorized as part of the overall Brady system, and that the Brady fee was within the ambit of relevant statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">1. Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Count 2 of appellant\u2019s complaint is a common-law claim in assumpsit. But the action of assumpsit was abolished with the adoption of Civ.R. 2, and only one form of action \u2014 the civil action \u2014 now exists. See 17 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1980), Contracts, Section 10. Assumpsit was a contract remedy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201cThe common-law action of assumpsit was a remedy by which a compensation in damages could be recovered for the nonperformance of a contract under seal, and not of record, but either express of implied, written or verbal. * * * [I]n the course of its common law development, assumpsit acquired the dignity of a distinct form of action, which superceded debt, became concurrent with account, and with case upon a bailment, a warranty, and bills of exchange, and competed with equity in the case of essentially equitable quasi contracts growing out of principles of unjust enrichment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cIt is a general rule at common law that assumpsit lies only upon an express or implied contract. Quasi contracts or contracts implied in law are included, although such obligations are contracts in name only, as they do not have the essential requisites of what are ordinarily understood as contracts. * * * [I]t is well established that general assumpsit for money had and received lies to recover the proceeds of the sale of goods which have been taken without knowledge or consent of the owner.\u201d 17 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Contracts, Section 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Thus, in a technical sense, appellants\u2019 complaint is invalid to the degree that they attempt to raise a claim that is no longer a recognized cause of action. Nor did appellants show any contractual relationship between themselves and the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">More important, appellants\u2019 assumpsit claim was abrogated with the enactment of R.C. Chapter 2723, Enjoining and Recovering Illegal Taxes and Assessments. R.C. 2723.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">\u201cCourts of common pleas may enjoin the illegal levy or collection of taxes and assessments and entertain actions to recover them when collected, without regard to the amount thereof, but no recovery shall be had unless the action is brought within one year after the taxes or assessments are collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">As noted above in <em>Superior Films, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the inspection fees charged by the Department of Education under the then-existing censorship scheme were subject to enjoinment pursuant to then Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>12075, General Code, now R.C. 2723.01. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 50 O.O. at 314, 112 N.E.2d at 321. There, the plaintiff challenged the inspection fee as an unlawful excise tax exceeding the necessary costs to make film inspections. The court found that the plaintiff was estopped from challenging the fees because it had failed to seek recovery under what is now R.C. 2723.01. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">R.C. 2723.01 was extensively discussed in <em>Paramount Film. </em>That court reviewed the history and purpose of R.C. Chapter 2723 and the General Assembly\u2019s intent to have the statute supersede prior common-law actions to enjoin or collect illegal fees and taxes from state collectors. <em>Id. </em>at 30-32, 24 O.O.2d at 362-364, 193 N.E.2d at 283-285. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">\u201cWhen compared to the status of the remedy at law prior to 1856, it is clear that the scope of the statutory remedy includes all the pre-existing rights at law and goes further to broaden the grounds of recovery. At the same time the Legislature provided a one-year statute of limitations. This provision is a recognition of the fact that while the taxpayer needs a remedy against illegal exactions, yet the government must be provided with a reasonable basis for estimating revenues and making appropriations, and the collecting officer deserves protection from prolonged contingent liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cTo interpret [R.C.] Chapter 2723 as being a cumulative remedy in the alternative -with the common-law remedies, either being available at the taxpayer\u2019s option, is incompatible with the structure, operation and purpose of the statute. In our opinion, the statutory remedy is not in the alternative but is in lieu and exclusive of the common-law remedies where applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 24 O.O.2d at 364, 193 N.E.2d at 285.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The court ruled that R.C. 2723.01 was the sole means of challenging the fees, because it abrogated all common-law remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 30 and 34, 24 O.O.2d at 362-363 and 364-365, 193 N.E.2d at 283-284 and 286.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The instant case is similar to <em>Paramount Film:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">\u201cThe action is against the defendants personally and prays for personal judgments. Appellant relies upon a common-law theory of personal liability for an official who illegally collects or receives property or money. There is no claim of any statutory 'ground for the suit. The particular remedial basis of the suit rests on quasi-contract principles. The trial court found that the petition did not state a cause of action and gave judgment for the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">U* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cIn our opinion, the statute [R.C. 2728.01] applies to the fees paid by appellant and operates to exclude any recovery at common law. Since appellant does not, and, on the face of the petition, could not rely upon the statutory remedy [due to the running of the statute of limitations], the demurrer was properly sustained and the judgment for appellees was correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 24 O.O.2d at 362-363, 193 N.E.2d at 283-284.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Appellants brought their suit under the common-law quasi-contract claim in assumpsit. They seek to impose personal liability upon the Attorney General by alleging that she improperly collected illegal fees. And like the plaintiff in <em>Paramount Film, </em>appellants failed to pursue their claim pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">As noted above, the Brady fee was similar to the film inspections fees at issue in <em>Superior Films </em>and <em>Paramount Film. </em>Thus, R.C. 2723.01 was the means by which appellants could challenge the Brady fee and seek its recovery. This conclusion is more compelling when it is remembered that appellants\u2019 action in assumpsit was abolished with the enactment of the Civil Rules of Procedure. Appellants not only failed to seek redress through the proper statutory means, they founded their claim upon a now nonexistent action. For that reason, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the Attorney General\u2019s favor as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">For purposes of clarity, we will discuss the merits of appellants\u2019 claim as if their complaint was based upon R.C. 2723.01. Due to the one-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2723.01, only those Brady fees charged after January 12, 1998 would be challengeable. Nonetheless, we will review appellants\u2019 issues presented for review, including those relevant only to events prior to January 12, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">2. <em>Pre-Printz </em>Period</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Appellants first contend that the trial court incorrectly construed Section 922(s) as allowing a handgun transfer to be disapproved for a reason not provided for in the Brady Act \u2014 namely, a failure to pay the Brady fee. Appellants\u2019 contention is without merit. The trial court did not, as appellants claim, \u201cmisread the [statute] to state that it was unlawful for a licensee to transfer a handgun to a non-licensee \u2018in the absence of a background check conducted within five business days.\u2019 \u201d The trial court was only quoting in part from Section 922(s)(l), and a plain reading of the trial court\u2019s decision demonstrates that the quote had no bearing on the trial court\u2019s resolution of the issue whether BCI&amp;I had authority to conduct Brady checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Appellants next complain that the Attorney General lacked authority to act as Ohio\u2019s CLEO for purposes of conducting Brady checks. Appellants assert that the Attorney General did not receive permission to act as Ohio\u2019s CLEO from every single law enforcement chief or official in the state. R.C. 109.02 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>\u201cThe attorney general is the chief law [enforcement] officer for the state and all its departments </em>* * *. The attorney general shall appear for the state in the trial and argument of all civil and criminal causes in the supreme court in which the state is directly or indirectly interested. When required by the governor or the general assembly, the attorney general shall appear for the state in any court or tribunal in a cause in which the state is a party, or in which the state is directly interested. Upon the written request of the governor, the attorney general shall prosecute any person indicted for a crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">By statute, the Attorney General is Ohio\u2019s premiere chief law enforcement officer. Furthermore, R.C. 109.55 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cThe superintendent of the bureau of criminal identification and investigation shall recommend cooperative policies for the coordination of the law enforcement work and crime prevention activities of all state and local agencies and officials having law enforcement duties to promote cooperation between such agencies and officials, to secure effective and efficient law enforcement, to eliminate duplication of work, and to promote economy of operation in such agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">By R.C. 109.55, BCI&amp;I is given the primary responsibility of recommending policies that would further, and make more effective, its law enforcement duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Because the Attorney General is statutorily defined as Ohio\u2019s primary chief law enforcement officer, the Attorney General could delegate to BCI&amp;I the responsibility of centralizing the Brady check system where such would make it more efficient and effective. Additionally, the ATF, the federal agency responsible for implementing the Brady Act, stated in its Open Letter to all local law enforcement officials that more than one official could be a CLEO within any given jurisdiction. The ATF suggested that local <em>and state </em>law enforcement officials coordinate their activities and choose a single entity to act as CLEO. After the Open Letter, the OACP president sent a letter to all OACP members stating that the association agreed that the Attorney General should act as Ohio\u2019s CLEO.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Appellants argue that the OACP letter is \u201cunauthenticated\u201d and \u201cdoes not demonstrate that each Ohio chief of police designated [BCI&amp;I] as CLEO, and says nothing about the sheriffs of Ohio, who are CLEOs for their respective jurisdictions.\u201d Unfortunately for appellants, they presented <em>no </em>evidence to refute the conclusion drawn by the trial court from the record: that the Attorney General had received permission to act as Ohio\u2019s sole CLEO. In fact, the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. The correspondence throughout the record demonstrates that the Attorney General was given permission to act as CLEO, and notice of this was sent to local officials. The ATF recognized the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>General\u2019s designation as CLEO in its Federal Register. Appellants presented no evidence to infer that any local, official objected to the Attorney General acting as Ohio\u2019s CLEO. Without presenting some evidence in support of their contention, appellants cannot complain that the trial court reached the incorrect conclusion from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Appellants further contend that the BCI&amp;I lacked authority to conduct involuntary Brady checks and, as a result, BCI&amp;I could not charge the Brady fee for such checks. R.C. 109.55, quoted above, requires that BCI&amp;I cooperate in law enforcement activities and crime prevention within the state. Similarly, R.C. 109.52 provides that BCI&amp;I \u201cmay * * * assist in the prevention of crime, and engage in such other activities as will aid law enforcement officers in solving crimes and controlling criminal activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Printz, </em>the Brady Act imposed upon state and local officials an obligation to conduct Brady checks. 521 U.S. at 933, 117 S.Ct. at 2383, 138 L.Ed.2d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Under the pr <em>e-Printz </em>Brady system, BCI&amp;I was required, as Ohio\u2019s CLEO designee, to conduct the Brady checks. In fact, under R.C. 109.52, BCI&amp;I was authorized to pass on the Brady form to federal officials in the <em>post-Printz </em>period. Under both the pre- and post <em>-Printz </em>schemes, the Brady check assisted in preventing crime and controlling criminal activity, as it aided law enforcement\u2019s efforts to prohibit unauthorized persons from receiving handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Whether BCI&amp;I could charge a fee for the pr <em>e-Printz </em>involuntary Brady checks requires more discussion, because no Revised Code provision specifically speaks to the issue. As an administrative agency, BCI&amp;I \u201chas only such authority, either express or implied, as conferred upon it by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Burger Brewing, </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 379, 71 O.O.2d at 367, 329 N.E.2d at 695. BCI&amp;I\u2019s authority is limited to only these express and implied powers. It may not extend its powers beyond those granted by the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>In determining if an act is within the purview of an administrative agency\u2019s powers, the entire administrative or regulatory scheme at issue must be considered. See <em>id. </em>at 379-381, 71 O.O.2d at 367-368, 329 N.E.2d at 695-696. Or more fully:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201c \u2018Such grant of power, by virtue of a statute, may be either express or implied, but the limitation put upon the implied power is that it is only such as may be reasonably necessary to make the express power effective. In short, the implied power is only incidental or ancillary to an express power, and, if there be no express grant, it follows, as a matter of course, that there can be no implied grant. In construing such grant of power, particularly administrative power through and by a legislative body, the rules are well settled that the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the grant of power, as well as the extent of the grant, must be clear[:] that in case of doubt that doubt is to be resolved not in favor of the grant but against it. It is one of the reserved powers that the legislative body no doubt had, but failed to delegate to the administrative board or body in question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 71 O.O.2d at 369, 329 N.E.2d at 697, quoting <em>State ex rel. A. Bentley &amp; Sons Co. v. Pierce </em>(1917), 96 Ohio St. 44, 47, 117 N.E. 6, 6-7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">It was easily within BCI&amp;I\u2019s authority to charge the Brady fee when conducting Brady checks in the pr <em>e-Printz </em>period. BCI&amp;I is expressly granted the power to charge a fee for those criminal records checks required to be conducted. R.C. 109.572. In other cases where a person requests a records release, BCI&amp;I is allowed to charge a \u201creasonable fee.\u201d R.C. 109.57(E). Because BCI&amp;I was required to conduct Brady checks, such checks were akin to those required by R.C. 109.572. Just as the fee charged for R.C. 109.572 records checks is intended to cover the administrative costs of such checks, the Brady fee was intended to cover the administrative costs of the Brady check system. It would be incongruent if BCI&amp;I were allowed to cover its expenses for all background checks but those required by the Brady Act. Only by charging a fee sufficient to meet its administrative burdens could BCI&amp;I be expected to effectively administer the Brady Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In the pr <em>e-Printz </em>period, the Attorney General properly acted as Ohio\u2019s CLEO for purposes of the Brady Act. BCI&amp;I was authorized to conduct the Brady checks and charge the Brady fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">3. <em>Post-Printz </em>Period</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Appellants also raise a number of attacks against the <em>post-Printz </em>voluntary Brady check system created by the Attorney General. Appellants first argue that the \u201cwaivers\u201d signed by buyers to allow \u201cquick checks\u201d by BCI&amp;I were in fact not voluntary because the buyers did not truly \u201cconsent\u201d to the checks. Appellants\u2019 argument is superfluous at best. The voluntary system devised by the Attorney General was not mandatory. Nothing required buyers to sign the waivers and subject themselves to the state quick checks. All buyers could, as some did, refuse to sign the waivers, thus requiring federally authorized officials to conduct the Brady check.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Appellants assert that the waivers were not supported by consideration. Appellants are incorrect. In consideration for signing the waivers, the Attorney General and BCI&amp;I performed the Brady check in two days, rather than five. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>time was not important to a particular buyer, the buyer could simply refuse to sign the waiver and have federal authorities conduct the Brady check in five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Appellants argue that under either Brady check method they were required to pay the Brady fee, thus making the waivers involuntary. The record demonstrates only that, as to those buyers refusing to sign the waiver, BCI&amp;I acted as a collection agency, keeping for itself only those fees necessary for conducting or verifying record checks. R.C. 109.52 requires BCI&amp;I to assist other law enforcement officials in preventing and controlling crime, and its actions were in furtherance of this mandate. In any case, it is irrelevant that the Brady fee was identical for both Ohio and federal Brady cheeks when the state provided other significant consideration for the waivers- \u2014 -a shorter check period.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Appellants also contend that the post <em>-Printz </em>Brady fee was not authorized by Ohio law. Appellants assert that no relevant statute provided authority to conduct involuntary background checks in this time period. Appellants are correct. Of course, the Brady checks conducted by BCI&amp;I after <em>Printz </em>were only those done with the buyer\u2019s consent. Ohio was not involved in any involuntary Brady checks after <em>Printz. </em>Those were done by federalized deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The Attorney General has the authority to release and review a person\u2019s records, with the person\u2019s consent, by R.C. 109.57(E):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cThe attorney general shall adopt rules, in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, setting forth the procedure by which a person may receive or release information gathered by the superintendent pursuant to divisions (A)(2) to (5) of this section. A reasonable fee may be charged for this service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">This statute plainly provides the Attorney General with the authority to release a person\u2019s records where that person requests such a release.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In accordance with R.C. 109.57(E), the Attorney General devised a method by which a potential gun purchaser could authorize a records release to BCI&amp;I for a background check.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> BCI&amp;I used the Brady form as the means by which buyers could release their records for a Brady check.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Pursuant to R.C. 109.57(E), the Attorney General could then charge the Brady fee for such a records release.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Appellants make a passing argument that the Brady fee scheme was not created in accordance with Ohio Adm.Code 109:5-1-01. But appellants presented <em>no </em>evidence in support of their contention. Although the voluntary Brady check scheme devised by the Attorney General did not strictly require the same information as the administrative regulation, appellants did not present any evidence upon which the trial court could infer that the Brady check system did not comply with the requirements of R.C. 109.57(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">More important, as discussed above, the Brady fee was impliedly authorized as part of the Brady check system. BCI&amp;I is required to assist and coordinate law enforcement activities to make such more effective. R.C. 109.52 and 109.55. As part of that required activity, BCI&amp;I created the voluntary Brady check scheme. As part of this system, BCI&amp;I had the implied authority to charge a fee to offset its own administrative burdens. The trial court properly found that the voluntary Brady check procedure and the Brady fee related to that procedure were authorized by R.C. 109.57(E).<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The voluntary Brady check system was proper and the waivers signed by buyers under this system were valid. The Brady fee charged as part of the voluntary Brady check system was authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">4. Recapitulation</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Appellants claim in assumpsit did not state a valid cause of action, as appellants were required to seek redress through R.C. 2723.01. Even had appellants stated a viable claim, the Attorney General and BCI&amp;I acted within their statutory authority in conducting Brady checks and charging the Brady fee. The trial court properly granted summary judgment as to appellants\u2019 common-law claim. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">E. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The trial court correctly found that as to the Section 1983 claims which appellants could bring and which were not barred by the applicable statute of limitations, appellants\u2019 rights were not infringed by the actions of the Attorney General. Nor were appellants-buyers affected by any conduct taken under color of state law. The trial court also properly concluded that the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>and BCI&amp;I acted within their statutory powers when conducting Brady checks and charging the Brady fee. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-6\">Powell, P.J., and Valen, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-16\">.

The Brady fee was then charged to the FFL, the requesting party. Just as buyers were not affected by the Attorney General in their Section 1983 claim, they were not directly affected by the Attorney General for purposes of their challenge to the legality of the adopted check scheme, other than the release of their records.
