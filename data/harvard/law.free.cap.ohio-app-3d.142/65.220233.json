He was sentenced to fife imprisonment together with three years on a gun specification. In his appeal, Griffin raises four assignments of error in which he challenges (1) the prosecution\u2019s reliance on other-acts and hearsay evidence, (2) remarks made by the prosecution to the jury reflecting upon the evidence and his character, (3) the sufficiency of the forensic evidence to establish that his wife\u2019s death was a homicide as opposed to a suicide, and (4) the jury\u2019s weighing of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Because we hold that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of other acts through testimony of neighbors and hearsay of the victim, and because we cannot say that the effect of such evidence was harmless, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">On September 2, 1998, sometime between one and two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Pamela Griffin was fatally shot in the head in the trailer-park home she shared with Joseph Griffin and their two children. The weapon was a .38-caliber revolver that Griffin had purchased within the previous month. The bullet entered Pamela\u2019s head under the right ear and lodged in her skull, producing no exit wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Griffin, who was with his wife, placed a 911 call, telling the operator that his wife had committed suicide. The 911 operator sent an ambulance and coached Griffin through an attempt at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and emergency medical personnel soon arrived upon the scene. They found the weapon lying to the left of Pamela\u2019s body on the couple\u2019s bed. Efforts by paramedics failed to resuscitate Pamela, and she was later pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Speaking to the police at the scene and later at the police station, Griffin stated that, prior to her suicide, he and Pamela had argued and that she had told him, \u201cI wish I was dead.\u201d He then described how, after going to the bathroom, he came back into the hall and, peering into the bedroom, discovered that Pamela had taken the gun in her left hand and put it to her head. According to Griffin, Pamela then grinned at him and pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Homicide investigators were suspicious of Griffin\u2019s version of events. Their suspicions were aroused primarily by the lack of \u201cblow-back\u201d spatter in the bedroom and on Pamela\u2019s hands. They reasoned that if Pamela had shot herself by holding the gun in contact with her head, blood should have blown back upon her arm in a spatter pattern as the result of pressure expelled through the wound. The lack of \u201cblow-back\u201d spatter on Pamela was disturbing, as was the actual spatter of blood they detected on Griffin\u2019s shirt. Further, investigators could not reconcile the placement of the gun on the left side of Pamela\u2019s body with the location of the bullet wound under her right ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Subsequent investigation of the relationship between Griffin and Pamela revealed recent episodes of domestic violence. Due to an industrial accident, Griffin had been unemployed while Pamela worked as a nurse\u2019s aide at the Riverview Nursing Home. According to different witnesses, Griffin became mistrustful of his wife, suspecting her of having an affair. As portrayed by the prosecution, Griffin\u2019s emotional instability, as well as his use of drugs and alcohol, exacerbated this mistrust. After Griffin obtained the .38-caliber gun on August 10, neighbors at the trailer park witnessed episodes in which he had physically abused his wife while brandishing the gun. One neighbor described an incident in which Griffin, with gun in hand, had pushed Pamela against the trailer and threatened to kill both of them. On the day of his wife\u2019s shooting death, Griffin had purchased a particularly lethal type of bullet referred to as a \u201chollow point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The prosecution also presented the testimony of eoworkers, who described Pamela as feeling increasingly threatened by her husband, particularly in the days leading up to her death. One witness told of Pamela bringing the family\u2019s steak knives to work because of her fear of what her husband might do with them. Witnesses also described her as having bruises on her arms and legs. Two days before Pamela\u2019s death, Griffin was discovered at the nursing home going through the time cards. When asked to leave, according to the witness, Griffin announced, \u201cYou\u2019ll never see her again\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to Pamela.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>At trial, Griffin did not testify. Instead, Griffin\u2019s defense relied on witnesses whose testimony suggested that Pamela had become suicidal due to the deteriorating, turbulent nature of her marriage. Further, Griffin presented the testimony of a highly qualified expert in blood spatter, who disputed the prosecution\u2019s theory 'that the absence of blow-back spatter confirmed a homicide. The expert also testified that he had produced experimental support for the defense position that the blood on Griffin\u2019s shirt had been expirated by the victim during CPR. Finally, Griffin presented family witnesses who testified to Griffin\u2019s apparently genuine grief over the death of his wife and his persistent questioning of why she had committed suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">OTHER-ACTS AND HEARSAY EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In his first and second assignments of error, Griffin argues that the trial court improperly allowed the prosecution to present character and hearsay evidence to portray him as a violent substance abuser who terrorized not only his wife, but also the neighbors at the trailer park where the couple lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The rule governing the admissibility of character or other-acts evidence is contained in Evid.R. 404. Section (A) states the general principle that evidence of a person\u2019s character is \u201cnot admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion * * The reason for the general exclusion of character evidence is the temptation it poses for the jury to try the case on evidence of character rather than on evidence of guilt. When such character evidence is allowed, it becomes difficult for the jury not to speculate that since the defendant has shown a propensity for committing criminal or bad acts in the past, <em>i.e., </em>is a bad person, he probably committed the present crime. The result is a potential for prejudice with respect not only to the weighing of the evidence but also the creation in the jury\u2019s mind of an urge to punish for past acts. Lily, The Law of Evidence (1978) 124, Section 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Evid.R. 404(B) specifically states the same rule of exclusion for evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts.\u201d The rule provides, however, for an exception when the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of other bad acts not to show the accused\u2019s character or his criminal propensity, but to establish circumstantially either an element of the crime or a material fact at issue. Specifically, Evid.R. 404(B) allows the introduction of evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d when that evidence is used as \u201cproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or the absence of mistake or accident.\u201d This principle is further embodied in R.C. 2945.59, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">\u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant!,] which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court has held that both R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) are to be strictly construed against the state and conservatively applied by trial courts. State <em>v. DeMarco </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 194, 31 OBR 390, 392-393, 509 N.E.2d 1256, 1259. As the court pointed out in <em>DeMarco, </em>evidence of other acts is admissible \u201c \u2018not because it shows that the defendant is crime prone, or even that he has committed an offense similar to the one in question, but in spite of such facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>State v. Burson </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 158, 67 O.O.2d 174, 174-175, 311 N.E.2d 526, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The threshold question in determining the admissibility of other-acts evidence under Evid.R. 404(B) is whether any of the matters of proof (motive, opportunity, scheme, etc.) are at issue in the case. If not, then other-acts evidence is not admissible, no matter how telling, and regardless of whether an accused\u2019s past behavior constitutes a \u201cbehaviorist fingerprint.\u201d See <em>State v. Knight </em>(1998), 131 Ohio App.3d 349, 722 N.E.2d 568.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The state, citing <em>State v. Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982, argues that Griffin \u201cplace[d] his intent at issue by entering a plea of not guilty.\u201d This is an incorrect statement of the law and a misreading of <em>Greer. </em>A plea of not guilty does not automatically place at issue any of the factors necessary to allow for the admissibility of other-acts evidence (If such were the case, there would be no reason for the rule.) That determination must instead be made upon the theory of the case as presented by the prosecution and the defense. As recently emphasized by the Second District Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">\u201cEvid.R. 404(B) creates an exception for [other-acts] evidence when it is, nevertheless, also probative of certain matters identified in the rule. However, the <em>matter </em>concerned must genuinely be in issue. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 647, 617 N.E.2d 1160. Further, the other act or acts offered as probative of the matter must themselves be temporally and circumstantially connected to the operative facts of the offense alleged. <em>State v. Burson </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 67 O.O.2d 174, 311 N.E.2d 526; <em>State v. Curry </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>O.O.2d 37, 330 N.E.2d 720; <em>Smith, supra.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Hawn </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 449, 462, 741 N.E.2d 594, 603.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>A. Other Acts of Violence by Griffin Toward the Victim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">At trial, the prosecution solicited testimony from neighbors at the trailer park where the couple lived who had personally observed Griffin physically assault, verbally abuse, and threaten to kill his wife in the weeks before her death. The state argues that the admission of such evidence was proper to show Griffin\u2019s identity as the killer. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Griffin\u2019s defense was that he was misidentified as the killer' \u2014 -in essence, that someone else did the shooting, not he. By interposing such a defense (as opposed, for example, to accident or self-defense), he put in issue his identity as the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">\u201cIdentity is in issue when the fact of the crime is open and evident but the perpetrator is unknown and the accused denies that he committed the crime. In that event other act evidence tends to show the defendant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator by showing that he committed crimes of a similar methodology within a period of time reasonably near to the offense on trial, which itself would constitute probative evidence of the probability that the same person, whoever he or she may be, committed both crimes.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 666-667, 617 N.E.2d at 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Here, the fact of the crime \u2014 the shooting death of Pamela \u2014 was open and evident. The only issue was whether it was Pamela or Griffin who fired the fatal shot. Evidence of other episodes in which Griffin had threatened to kill his wife with the same gun was circumstantial evidence identifying him as the killer. Furthermore, such episodes, occurring weeks before her death, were sufficiently temporally connected to the facts of her death to be probative on the issue of the identity of the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">It should be pointed out that since oral argument in this case, the Second District Court of Appeals in <em>Hawn, supra, </em>has ruled that in a murder or suicide case the identity of the perpetrator is <em>not </em>in issue. Explaining its reasoning, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201cAccording to the theory of the state\u2019s case and the evidence it presented, if the alleged crime took place at all, no person other than Hawn [the defendant] could have committed it. Further, Hawn did not claim that another person had murdered Jack [the victim]. Instead, he denied that she was murdered at all. The only genuine issue, therefore, was whether Jack was murdered or whether she committed suicide. Because the identity of the perpetrator of the state\u2019s murder alternative was not in issue, evidence of defendant Hawn\u2019s prior acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>extrinsic to the operative facts of the crime alleged was not admissible per Evid.it. 404(B) to prove identity.\u201d <em>Hawn, supra, </em>at 463, 741 N.E.2d 594.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We respectfully disagree with the Second District Court of Appeals on this issue. The court\u2019s analysis, in our view, errs by concluding that in a murder or suicide case the defendant is the only suspect. As we have noted, in our view there are two suspects \u2014 the defendant and the victim. While it is true that only one of the suspects, the defendant, can be found guilty of murder, evidence of suicide creates a genuine issue concerning the identity of the person who pulled the trigger. Thus, we believe that, in a case such as this, and in <em>Hawn, </em>evidence of other acts of domestic violence, particularly those involving the same gun used in the killing, and occurring within the same time period as the shooting, should be admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) to establish the identity of the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Finally, we reject the argument that identity was not in issue here because there was no dispute that Griffin was physically present in the trailer at the time the shooting occurred. Identity is not synonymous with mere presence. For example, if Griffin had claimed that a burglar had entered the trailer on that afternoon and shot his wife while he was in the bathroom showering, identity would certainly be at issue. See <em>State v. Aldridge </em>(N.C.App.2000), 534 S.E.2d 629 (evidence of domestic violence against former wives admissible to show identity where defendant claimed that intruder had broken into house and killed his current wife while he was present). Similarly, if O.J. Simpson had claimed that he was standing next to Nichole Brown when unidentified assailants murdered her, identity would have been in issue. Whether the act of killing is by fictional third parties or by the victim\u2019s own hand, a defense that amounts to \u201csomeone else did it, not me\u201d raises the issue of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\n<em>B. Other Acts of Drug or Alcohol Abuse Not Involving the Victim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In addition to acts of violence against Pamela, the prosecution also solicited, or attempted to solicit, testimony that Griffin was seen often around the trailer park in an intoxicated or drug-induced state. For example, the state asked Cathy Sue Vinson whether Griffin appeared to her to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol on those occasions when she had seen him walking by himself around the trailer park in a <em>two-month </em>period before Pamela\u2019s death. An objection to the question was sustained. But the trial court overruled an objection and allowed another witness, Candice Black, to answer a question whether she had ever seen Griffin under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the <em>summer </em>that Pamela died. Black answered that she had. (The prosecution then asked whether it \u201cwas unusual\u201d for Griffin to be seen in such a condition. After Black answered that it was not, the trial court sustained a defense objection and advised the jury to disregard both the question and the answer.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The prosecution next solicited from Black testimony concerning an incident in which Griffin had allegedly approached Black and her teenage friends two weeks before his wife\u2019s death, pulled a gun out of the waistband of his trousers, and threatened to \u201cfucking kill\u201d them. The prosecution then asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve indicated that at times you\u2019ve seen him under the influence. On that date when you saw the gun in his waistband and he made the threat to you, do you have an opinion as to whether or not he was under the influence that day.\u201d Black answered, \u201cHe was.\u201d A defense objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The state argues on appeal that testimony regarding Griffin\u2019s general alcohol or substance abuse \u201cwas admissible as to motive\u201d because \u201cit contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and his violent behavior toward his wife.\u201d Griffin was not on trial, however, for ruining his marriage or for any of the other prior acts of violence toward his wife. He was on trial for shooting his wife. Critically, the prosecution did not present any evidence that Griffin was under the influence of either alcohol or drugs on the day of his wife\u2019s death. To the contrary, Officer Bryan Pitchford, who interviewed Griffin at the scene, testified that Griffin was \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cspoke intelligently, calmly.\u201d The officer, in fact, rejected a defense suggestion that Griffin might have been somewhat hysterical after the shooting, stating that Griffin was, contrary to expectation, \u201cpretty calm\u201d and that he was cooperative throughout the investigation that day. To the extent that Griffin\u2019s behavior aroused suspicion that day, it was because witnesses thought he was acting too emotionless or \u201cflat,\u201d not because he was acting excitable or irrational.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Without any evidence directly implicating Griffin\u2019s alleged substance abuse in the shooting of his wife, we fail to see how evidence of Griffin\u2019s alleged drug or alcohol use was a matter genuinely in issue. Put differently, we fail to see how such evidence was circumstantially connected to Pamela\u2019s shooting. Significantly, during closing argument, the state did not propose that Griffin may have been under the influence when he allegedly shot his wife. Rather, the prosecution\u2019s only attempt to connect the alleged substance abuse to Pamela\u2019s death during closing argument was to state that Griffin had become insanely jealous and was \u201cnot helping himself by being on drugs and alcohol from <em>time to time.\u201d </em>We consider this \u2014 the fact that Griffin was \u201cnot helping himself\u2019 \u2014 to be a particular<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ly weak, not to mention speculative, basis upon which to present to the jury evidence that Griffin was an alcohol or drug abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The state cites <em>State v. Wilkinson </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 308, 18 O.O.3d 482, 415 N.E.2d 261, for the proposition that evidence of Griffin\u2019s alleged drinking and drug abuse was \u201cso involved in his motivation as to be inseparable.\u201d The decision in <em>Wilkinson, </em>however, concerned evidence of a prior drug sale interlaced in conversation during negotiations for the drug sale that was the subject of trial. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the admission of the evidence because \u201c \u2018[r]eference to the prior [drug] sale was intrinsic to the bargaining\u2019 \u201d for the drug sale that was the object of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 18 O.O.3d at 488, 415 N.E.2d at 268, quoting <em>People v. Vails </em>(1977), 43 N.Y.2d 364, 368, 401 N.Y.S.2d 479, 481-482, 372 N.E.2d 320, 322-323. In our view, the facts of <em>Wilkinson </em>are completely distinguishable from those here. The record in this case presents no basis to conclude that Griffin\u2019s alleged episodes of drug or alcohol abuse \u201cfrom time to time\u201d were in any sense intrinsic to the shooting death of his wife. As we have noted, it is entirely speculative whether drugs or alcohol played any role in Pamela\u2019s death. We reject, therefore, the state\u2019s argument that the earlier unrelated episodes of alleged drug and alcohol abuse were somehow \u201cinseparable\u201d from Griffin\u2019s alleged motivation for killing his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>C. Other Acts of Violence against Neighbors in the Trailer Park</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">As we have noted, Candice Black testified concerning an incident in which Griffin had allegedly threatened to \u201cfucking kill\u201d her and her other teenage friends while acting as if he was either drunk or on drugs. In its brief, the state does not offer any justification for the admission of this evidence other than to implicitly link it to Griffin\u2019s drug use and thus his \u201cmotive\u201d for killing his wife. We have already rejected the relevance of Griffin\u2019s alleged drug or alcohol abuse due to the prosecution\u2019s failure to produce evidence circumstantially connecting it to Pamela\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Even more circumstantially disconnected, however, was Griffin\u2019s behavior toward the group of teenage girls. Unlike the prior episodes of domestic violence between Griffin and his wife, this episode appears to have had nothing to do circumstantially with the shooting death of Pamela. Rather, the only purpose of such testimony appears to have been to portray Griffin as a person with violent propensities-the terror of the trailer park.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\n<em>D. Other Acts Introduced through Hearsay by the Deceased Victim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Griffin also challenges the prosecution\u2019s solicitation from another witness, Kimberley Wesley, of testimony concerning incidents described to her by Pamela. Accordingly to Wesley, Pamela told her that she had brought the family steak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>knives to work because of fear spawned by incidents in which she had awakened to find Griffin holding a knife to her throat and threatening to kill her. Griffin challenges this testimony not only as a violation of Evid.R,. 404 but also upon the basis that it constituted hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As this court has held in a similar murder case, <em>State v. Sutorius </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 1, 701 N.E.2d 1, statements that the deceased victim feared the defendant are admissible under Evid.R. 803 to show the victim\u2019s \u201cthen existing state of mind, emotion, [or] sensation * * Our decision in <em>Sutorius </em>was based upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 514 N.E.2d 394, in which the court held that hearsay evidence reflecting a victim\u2019s fearful state of mind and fear of the defendant was admissible, while hearsay testimony establishing the facts underlying that fear was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">It should be noted that the court in <em>Hawn, supra, </em>criticized the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apanovitch, </em>finding it irreconcilable with the court\u2019s subsequent holding in <em>State v. Greer </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 530 N.E.2d 382. According to the court in <em>Hawn, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Greer </em>refused to allow a defendant the same right to introduce evidence that the victim was afraid when the object of that fear was a person other than the defendant. Again, we have to respectfully disagree with the court in <em>Hawn. </em>In <em>Greer, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court ruled specifically that the hearsay testimony of the victim that the defendant wished to introduce did not reflect fear, and that the jury would have to speculate as to its meaning. Thus, we do not agree with the court in <em>Hawn </em>that the holdings of <em>Apanovitch </em>and <em>Greer </em>represent two different rules on the admissibility of such evidence, one for the prosecution and one for the defendant. It is noteworthy in this regard that the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Apanovitch </em>cited as authority <em>United States v. Cohen </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 631 F.2d 1223, a case in which the defendant, not the prosecution, was allowed to introduce testimony of state-of-mind witnesses to demonstrate that he had acted out of fear of his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">We disagree, further, with the court\u2019s view in <em>Hawn </em>that it is better that such evidence should be excluded for both parties, as it \u201cinvites speculation, not rational inference.\u201d <em>Hawn </em>at 460, 741 N.E.2d at 602. The victim\u2019s fear of the defendant can be a particularly compelling piece of circumstantial evidence, particularly in a case such as this, where the defendant is the only other person present at the victim\u2019s shooting and professes to have been an innocent observer. Pamela\u2019s fear, it strikes us, was just as much a part of the crime scene as the forensic evidence. Without evidence of her fear, the jury would have been left without an important clue as to what really happened. Concededly, such evidence could be used to introduce \u201cthrough the back door\u201d evidence of the defendant\u2019s bad character, as <em>Hawn </em>suggests. <em>Id. </em>To alleviate the risk of this, however, the rule specifically forbids the introduction of the victim\u2019s hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>statement to establish the facts giving rise to the fear. So long as this prohibition is assiduously followed, other-acts evidence should not come in through the back door.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In the present case, Wesley testified both to the fact of Pamela\u2019s fear and to the reason for her fear \u2014 the incidents in which she had allegedly awakened to find Griffin pointing a knife at her throat. The state does not attempt to argue that Pamela\u2019s hearsay statements regarding such incidents were admissible. They were clearly not under the holding of Apanovitch, our decision in <em>Sutorius, </em>and Evid.R. 803. But the state does argue that defense counsel opened the door to such testimony during cross-examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On direct examination, Wesley testified that Pamela would bring the family steak knives to work on occasion and \u201cwould hide them in our cleaning room for several days at a time because she said that she was afraid that he [Griffin] would kill her.\u201d This testimony narrowly avoided the rule that hearsay testimony of the victim cannot be used to establish the facts underlying the victim\u2019s fear, as the jury would have been hard-pressed not to associate Pamela\u2019s fear and her bringing the knives to work with some threat involving the knives. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Wesley whether she did not find it \u201cunusual\u201d that Pamela would periodically bring the knives to work and then take them home again, suggesting that, if she was really afraid of her husband, she would never have taken the knives back home. Wesley testified that she did not find Pamela\u2019s behavior unusual given the \u201cstories\u201d Pamela had told concerning the knives. Defense counsel, obviously not wanting to delve into the \u201cstories,\u201d dropped the subject and moved on to another line of questioning. Immediately, however, on re-direct examination, the prosecution asked Wesley to explain what she meant by \u201cstories.\u201d Over objection, Wesley testified concerning Pamela\u2019s hearsay statements about waking up to find Griffin holding a knife to her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Despite the state\u2019s urging, we hold that, under the above scenario, defense counsel did not open the door to the hearsay testimony concerning the cause of Pamela\u2019s fear of the knives. Rather, defense counsel avoided opening the door by dropping the subject of the knives once Wesley obliquely referred to the \u201cstories\u201d told to her by Pamela. It was clearly the prosecution, not the defense, that solicited the improper hearsay testimony concerning Griffin\u2019s alleged use of the knives to threaten his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">It should be noted that the \u201copen door\u201d theory is theoretically intended to be <em>curative. </em>The justification for a party\u2019s use of improper rebuttal evidence is the necessity to respond to the opponent\u2019s first use of such evidence. In other words, the theory is a means of counterattack. Here, rather than as a response to improper hearsay, the state is urging the \u201copen door\u201d theory as a means to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>justify the state\u2019s introduction of improper, highly prejudicial hearsay evidence for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">HARMLESS-ERROR ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">To summarize, we hold that the jury in this case was improperly exposed to evidence that (1) Griffin was a drug or alcohol abuser, prone to being seen around the trailer park in an intoxicated state; (2) while apparently high on either drugs or alcohol, Griffin had threatened to \u201cfucking kill\u201d a group of teenage girls by waving the alleged murder weapon at them in a threatening manner; and (3) Griffin had awakened his wife at night by holding a knife to her throat and threatening to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The question we must address now is whether the admission of such evidence, in a case based entirely on circumstantial evidence, was harmless. The standard for determining this issue depends upon whether the errors involved a nonconstitutional violation or were of constitutional magnitude. If there was a constitutional violation, then, in order to consider the errors harmless, we must find that beyond a reasonable doubt the errors did not contribute to the verdict. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 332, 339, 643 N.E.2d 1098, 1105. Conversely, if the errors were not of a constitutional nature, then they may be deemed harmless so long as there was substantial other evidence to support the guilty verdict. <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 335, 638 N.E.2d 1023, 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We hold that the errors were of a constitutional magnitude. The admission of the hearsay evidence of Griffin holding a knife to his wife\u2019s throat while threatening to kill her did not fall within any of the hearsay exceptions and thus violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. <em>Webb, supra, </em>at 335, 638 N.E.2d at 1032; see, also, <em>DeMarco, supra </em>(applying constitutional harmless-error analysis to introduction of inadmissible hearsay). While the other-acts evidence of his alleged drug or alcohol abuse and his threats to kill his teenage neighbors did not, by themselves, invoke a particular constitutional protection, we hold that, when combined with the testimony concerning the knives, the cumulative effect of such evidence raised concerns over the fairness of the trial, thus invoking Griffin\u2019s constitutional right to procedural due process. <em>Webb </em>at 334, 638 N.E.2d at 1032. It should be noted that the prosecution\u2019s use of the other-acts evidence was not isolated within the context of the trial, but was part of what was manifestly a strategy to portray Griffin as an emotionally unstable person to be feared for his violent propensities. Indeed, at one point the prosecution attempted to solicit from one of the trailer-park witnesses testimony that she was even afraid to come into the courtroom to testify against Griffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Having found the errors to be constitutional in nature, we must now determine whether they were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In order to meet this standard, there must be \u201cno reasonable possibility that the evidence may have contributed to the accused\u2019s conviction * * *.\u201d <em>DeMarco </em>at 195, 31 OBR at 393, 509 N.E.2d at 1260. To arrive at this conclusion, there must either be overwhelming evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt or \u201csome other indicia that the error[s] did not contribute to the conviction.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>see, also, <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We have already briefly summarized the evidence against Griffin. Essentially, this evidence consisted of two components: the forensic evidence and the evidence of Griffin\u2019s assaults and threats against his wife. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\n<em>1. The Forensic Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The prosecution attempted to show that the forensic evidence disproved Griffin\u2019s claim that his wife had committed suicide. To this end, the prosecution relied heavily upon the absence of \u201cblow-back\u201d spatter upon Pamela\u2019s person, particularly her arms and hands, reasoning that if she had held the gun to her head, as described by Griffin, blood and other viscera should have come out of the wound and spattered back upon her \u2014 or at least somewhere near her. Conversely, the prosecution argued, the light spattering of Pamela\u2019s blood that was visible on Griffin\u2019s tee shirt was, in fact, \u201cblow back\u201d spatter confirming that he had been the one who fired the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">To refute the state\u2019s theory, Griffin presented an expert in blood spatter, who testified that, even in the case of contact gunshot wounds <em>(contact </em>referring to the placement of the gun in touch with the body), \u201cblow back\u201d occurred in less than fifty percent of the cases. Further, Griffin argued that the spattering of Pamela\u2019s blood on his tee shirt occurred during his attempt at CPR, in which, he alleged, Pamela\u2019s expirated blood entered his mouth and he spat it out. To support this contention, Griffin pointed to the blood that was reported around Pamela\u2019s mouth and nose by the medical personnel who arrived on the scene, as well as his own statement to the 911 operator describing such blood. (The prosecution, conversely, pointed out that the telephone did not have any blood on it, suggesting that Griffin\u2019s attempt at CPR was a sham.) Further, Griffin\u2019s blood-spatter expert testified that in two experiments he had successfully duplicated the spatter pattern on material identical to that of Griffin\u2019s tee shirt by spitting out blood. The prosecution\u2019s blood-spatter expert, on the other hand, testified in rebuttal that the blood spatter on Griffin\u2019s shirt could not possibly have been expirated blood, because she did not detect on microscopic examination any mucous globules in the individual drops, which, she claimed, would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>present had the blood been transferred by mouth. Still, providing support for Griffin\u2019s \u201cspit theory,\u201d a serologist from the Hamilton County Coroner\u2019s office testified that the bloodstains showed a mixture of Pamela\u2019s and Griffin\u2019s DNA, and that it was possible to get DNA from saliva.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Other aspects of the forensic evidence were debated by the parties. A Gun Shot Residue (\u201cGSR\u201d) test established that there was residue found on both of Pamela\u2019s hands (particularly the left) but none that was found on Griffin\u2019s. This evidence would seem to support Griffin\u2019s suicide defense, although the prosecution argued that Griffin had ample opportunity either to wash his hands or to rub them clean of any residue. The placement of the gun on the left side of the bed was also characterized as significant by the prosecution, since the placement of the wound suggested the impracticality, if not the physical impossibility, of Pamela shooting herself with the left hand as Griffin claimed in his statements to police. A prosecution witness pointed out that there was no hammer spur from the gun on Pamela\u2019s hands, although even the witness testified that, because such spurs were ephemeral and statistically uncertain, the lack of such a spur was not conclusive. The prosecution also pointed to the presence of a small cut on Pamela\u2019s lip that, according to the pathologist, was not self-inflicted. In the prosecution\u2019s view, the cut was evidence that Griffin and Pamela had been involved in a physical altercation before the fatal shot. The prosecution argued that a particularly critical piece of evidence was that Griffin\u2019s own blood was found on his shirt, a fact totally irreconcilable with his version of events and strongly indicating that there had been a bloody struggle prior to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\n<em>2. Griffin\u2019s Assaultive, Threatening Behavior before the Shooting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">As we have noted, witnesses testified that Griffin had physically assaulted and threatened his wife with the gun in the days and weeks before her fatal shooting. On the evidence of record, it is clear that Griffin was a physically abusive husband who could fly easily into a violent rage. The prosecution also produced evidence that Griffin was suspicious that his wife was having an affair and would repeatedly call Pamela at the nursing home to confirm her whereabouts. There was testimony and autopsy evidence that Pamela had visible bruises, although the defense countered that such bruises were occupationally related and were not considered suspicious before the shooting. Perhaps most damaging of all to Griffin, he was observed going through the employee time cards at his wife\u2019s place of employment two days before her death and, when asked to leave, allegedly announced, \u201cYou\u2019ll never see her again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The prosecution further emphasized that Griffin had purchased the especially lethal \u201chollow point\u201d bullets on the same day that Pamela was fatally shot. Griffin attempted to counter this evidence by presenting the testimony of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>father, who stated that he had recently advised Griffin to procure a different type of ammunition after Griffin complained about a lack of accuracy during target practice. The prosecution, on the other hand, solicited testimony from the deputy coroner that, approximately ten days after his wife\u2019s death, Griffin called him in an intoxicated state, demanding his gun back for \u201csentimental reasons,\u201d and stating that he had bought the hollow-point bullets precisely because of their capacity to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">To sum up: while the merits of the forensic evidence may be argued, there is certainly a wealth of circumstantial evidence that Griffin killed his wife. This evidence includes (1) the earlier episodes of domestic violence, (2) the motive of a suspected affair, (3) Griffin\u2019s alleged announcement two days before his wife\u2019s death that her co-workers would not be seeing her again, and (4) Griffin\u2019s purchase of particularly lethal hollow-point bullets on the very morning of his wife\u2019s death. While not conclusive, the evidence is certainly compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">THE POSSIBILITY OF SUICIDE</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">According to a taped statement Griffin gave to the police on the night of his wife\u2019s death, he and Pamela had been earlier arguing because she had supposedly lied to him. He claimed that they both went together to the gun shop where he had purchased the .38-caliber hollow-point bullets, and then came home at around one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. He stated that he then took his revolver into the bedroom and was loading it with the new shells when Pamela came in and they began to talk. Asked if they were still arguing, Griffin replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\u201cNo, no, no, no. We\u2019re not arguing, right now, we\u2019re not arguing. Okay. I \u2014 I think she was still upset from, you know, maybe, you know, from where we was arguing, you know, you know, it was \u2014 it\u2014it wasn\u2019t what you call argument. It was where I was trying to tell her not to lie to me, just to be honest with me. I said, you know, I said, I mean I said, you know, I said, \u2018You want to destroy our marriage?\u2019 I said, \u2018Marriage is got,\u2019 I said, T don\u2019t even know if you know anything about marriage.\u2019 I said, \u2018It\u2019s got to do with trust.\u2019 You know, I said, \u2018And if you lie to me, how am I supposed to trust you? I ain\u2019t gonna be able to believe a word, a single word you say.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Griffin stated that, as he discoursed in this manner, his wife said nothing. \u201cShe was like being real quiet.\u201d He stated that she did not speak until he got up to go to the bathroom, leaving the gun behind. At that point, according to Griffin, she stated, \u201cI wish I was dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Griffin stated that he then went into the bathroom. And when he returned to the hallway, he saw his wife on the bed with the gun pointed at the right side of her head, with the trigger cocked. He then described how she pulled the trigger. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>According to Griffin, Pamela\u2019s body fell backward with the gun still in her <em>left </em>hand. Asked again if she had used the left hand to kill herself, Griffin replied. \u201cI guess. I \u2014 I guess, yeah, because the gun was in her left hand.\u201d But he then stated a moment later, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Later he stated, \u201cIt was on her left side. The gun was.\u201d The next moment he seemed to again equivocate, stating, \u201cI mean because that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s the way it looked to me, unless she had her other hand like this. I don\u2019t know. Less it dropped, and \u2014 and\u2014and I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">A transcript of the 911 call was admitted into evidence. Griffin told the operator that his wife had shot herself in the head: \u201cSir, she\u2019s dead. She just blowed her brains out with a .38.\u201d He then agreed to attempt CPR, during the process of which he was told to cover Pamela\u2019s mouth and to force air into her lungs. At that point, Griffin told the operator that \u201cthere\u2019s blood coming out of her nose, her mouth, and everything.\u201d Griffin then told the operator, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. Oh, my God.\u201d The operator asked Griffin if his wife had given him any indication about committing suicide. Griffin replied that \u201cwe was just talking, and all of a sudden, she said, T wish I was dead,\u2019 and I had gone and she loaded it up, the \u2014 oh, Lord, Lord.\u201d Griffin then apparently continued to attempt CPR. During further exchange with the operator, Griffin recounted how he had left the room and come back to discover his wife with the gun to her head. At one point, Griffin, apparently speaking to his wife\u2019s corpse, said, \u201cDamn, mother fuck, damn, why\u2019d you do this, damn you.\u201d He then stated. \u201cLooks like she shot herself in the ear. Don\u2019t know why she shot herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Tabatha Koger, a neighbor at the trailer park, testified that both Griffin and Pamela had appeared to be in good moods earlier on the day of the shooting. She testified that she did not believe that Pamela would commit suicide, although she did concede that Pamela \u201chad once said that if that\u2019s the only way out, then she would do it.\u201d Ashley Griffin, the couple\u2019s twelve-year old daughter, was asked on the witness stand if her mother had ever said anything to her about killing herself. She responded, \u2018Yes, she did. She said, T wish\u2019 \u2014 T wish I could MU\u2019 \u2014 T wish I was dead.\u2019 \u201d Ashley was asked how many times her mother had expressed such a wish; she replied that she could not remember. Ashley also testified that several days before her mother died, she read to her the following poem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">TO A FRIEND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cA heart is not a plaything. A heart is not a toy.

Griffin\u2019s statements that Pamela held the gun in her left hand were damaging to him, given the placement of the wound, but it is clear from his statements to the police that he was intermittently uncertain on this point, at times saying he did not know in which hand she held the gun. (Griffin\u2019s placement of the gun in his wife\u2019s left hand, it should be noted, though conflicting with the placement of the wound, would seem to be supported by the presence of gunshot residue.) We note further that the defense presented evidence that Griffin has an IQ in the mid-seventies, which is a state of borderline retardation. Finally, there was testimony that Griffin continued to question why his wife would commit suicide in the weeks following her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">While we acknowledge the compelling nature of the circumstantial evidence against Griffin, it would be disingenuous to suggest that the evidence against him was so overwhelming that there was no reasonable possibility that the improperly admitted other-acts and character evidence did not contribute to his conviction. As the prosecution\u2019s resort to such evidence attests, of critical importance in this .case was the jury\u2019s perception of Griffin. For the jury to have been told that he abused drugs and alcohol, threatened to \u201cfucking kill\u201d teenage girls while on drugs, and held a knife to his wife\u2019s throat at night while threatening to kill her, strikes us as appreciably damaging to that perception. It is noteworthy that the prosecution, obviously convinced that the evidence would be of help to its cause, commented upon both the alleged drug and alcohol abuse and the alleged knife-to-throat incident during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Accordingly, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Griffin\u2019s conviction, and that the jury\u2019s finding of guilt was not contrary to the weight of the evidence. Regrettably, however, we cannot conclude that the evidence against Griffin was so overwhelming that the extraneous other-acts evidence and impermissible hearsay could not reasonably have influenced the jury\u2019s deliberations. Indeed, had the evidence of guilt been overwhelming, we assume that the prosecution would not have offered Griffin a plea bargain of eight years on a charge of involuntary manslaughter during the course of the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the circumstantial evidence against Griffin was compelling, it was not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>We sustain, therefore, Griffin\u2019s first and second assignments of error. Griffin\u2019s third assignment of error is considered moot. Pursuant to our discussion of the evidence, his fourth assignment, challenging the sufficiency and the weight of the evidence to convict him of aggravated murder, is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Accordingly, Griffin\u2019s conviction is reversed, and this cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-6\">Shannon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b130-7\">Painter, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b130-8\">Raymond E.

Interestingly, the owner of the gun shop where Griffin bought the bullets on the morning of his wife\u2019s death gave a written statement to the police in which he stated that Griffin had been acting \u201cmuch different\u201d than he had the two times he had been in the store before. The owner stated that Griffin was quite \u201canimated,\u201d whereas before he had seemed subdued, and that Griffin \u201cseemed a different person.\u201d When the prosecution attempted to solicit the same testimony at trial, however, a defense objection was sustained. The written statement was not introduced into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. Defense counsel made sure that Griffin rejected the plea bargain on the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b130-9\">Painter, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9q\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding and most of the well-reasoned opinion, but write separately to note that I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s position on Hawn.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unlike the majority, I agree with my colleagues on the Second District Court of Appeals that, when a trial court must decide whether the deceased was murdered or committed suicide, and the defendant admits to being the only other person present when the events occurred, the identity of the defendant is <em>not </em>at issue in the case. Thus other-acts evidence purporting to identify the defendant through a \u201cbehavioral fingerprint\u201d is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">As we have stated, \u201c[A]dmission of other-acts evidence is strictly limited because of the substantial danger that a jury will find a defendant guilty solely because it believes a defendant has a propensity to commit criminal acts or deserves punishment regardless of whether he committed the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One of the more obvious requirements of admissibility is that the matter the other-acts evidence is offered to prove, in this case the identity of the alleged murderer, must be at issue in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no justification for admitting potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>prejudicial evidence without a disputed issue. And Griffin\u2019s identity is not an issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">If the jury were to have found that Griffin\u2019s wife was murdered, then there would have been no dispute about who committed the crime, because Griffin was the only other person present. If, on the other hand, the jury were to have concluded that Griffin\u2019s wife committed suicide, then Griffin\u2019s identity would have been irrelevant, because the crime of murder was not committed. The issue in this case is whether a murder occurred, and not Griffin\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The majority\u2019s view that Griffin placed his identity in issue by claiming he did not shoot his wife confuses a plea of not guilty with a genuine issue of identity. And it confuses identity with culpability. There is no dispute about whether Griffin was the individual in the room \u2014 any more than about whether his wife was in the room. The issue of identity encompasses only a situation where there is a genuine question whether it was the defendant or another (usually unknown) person who was <em>present.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The <em>Hamm </em>court was correct that \u201c \u2018[\u00a1Identity is in issue when the fact of the crime is open and evident but the perpetrator is unknown.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the fact of the crime of murder was not open and obvious, but was instead the central issue in this case, I would hold that other-acts evidence purporting to establish Griffin\u2019s identity as the murderer was not admissible.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-12\">.
