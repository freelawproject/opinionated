Moore asserts that the trial court erred in imposing a maximum sentence that is to be served consecutively to a sentence that he was serving at the time of the incident. Because we find that the trial court did not set forth its reasons for imposing a maximum consecutive sentence as required by R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>2929.19(B)(2), we agree. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">In November 1998, a grand jury indicted Moore for possessing cocaine on June 29, 1998. Moore was an inmate at Chillicothe Correctional Institution (\u201cCCI\u201d) in June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">At trial, Moore admitted that he purchased cocaine from other inmates, tasted it to ensure that it was cocaine, and gave it to a guard. He asserted that he did this to be moved to a more secure facility because he could not handle the conditions at CCI. The jury found Moore guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The trial court immediately held a sentencing hearing. The state pointed out Moore\u2019s prior convictions for felony theft, receiving stolen property, involuntary manslaughter, and aggravated robbery. The state argued that Moore should receive the maximum penalty because the crime occurred in a prison. After Moore made a statement, the trial court stated that it had considered (1) Moore\u2019s statement, (2) the evidence presented at trial, (3) the purposes and principle of felony sentencing pursuant to R.C. 2929.11, (4) the seriousness and recidivism factors in R.C. 2929.12, and (5) the guidance by degree of felony in R.C. 2929.13. The trial court then made the following findings: (1) Moore posed the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes, (2) consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime and to punish Moore, (3) consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime and the danger Moore poses to the public, and (4) Moore is not amenable to community control sanctions and a prison sentence is consistent with the purposes and principles of felony sentencing. The trial court then sentenced Moore to twelve months in a penal facility consecutive to any term of imprisonment Moore was serving when the sentence was imposed. These findings were also reflected in the trial court\u2019s sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">On June 23, 1999, Moore appealed. In September 1999, Moore\u2019s attorney filed a motion to withdraw, alleging that he was unable to find any arguable issue for appeal and submitted a brief outlining possible issues for appeal and the reasons they had no merit. In December 1999, we directed the clerk to serve a copy of the attorney\u2019s brief upon Moore and granted Moore twenty days to file a <em>pro se </em>brief. Moore did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">We granted the motion to withdraw but found that there were nonfrivolous issues to argue on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Moore </em>(June 26, 2000), Ross App. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>99CA2495, unreported. Therefore, we appointed new counsel to represent Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">In September 2000, Moore filed his brief asserting the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to give separate reasons in support of its findings as required by R.C. 2929.14(C) and 2929.19(B)(2)(c) and (d) when imposing [a maximum] and consecutive sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In his only assignment of error, Moore argues that the trial court erred by failing to give reasons for imposing a maximum and consecutive sentence as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">An offender who has received a maximum term of imprisonment has a statutory right to appeal the sentence. R.C. 2953.08(A)(1)(a). We must not reverse a felony sentence unless we find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the sentence is unsupported by the record, or contrary to law. R.C. 2953.08(G)(1)(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">We first address Moore\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in imposing a maximum sentence without making the findings required by R.C. 2929.14(C) and without stating its reasons for doing so as required by R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">R.C. 2929.14(C) limits a trial court\u2019s authority to impose a maximum term of imprisonment. The statute prohibits a trial court from imposing the maximum term of imprisonment for an offense unless the trial court determines that the offender falls into one of four classifications. <em>State v. Holsinger </em>(Nov. 20, 1998), Pike App. No. 97CA605, unreported, 1998 WL 820035; <em>State v. Kauff </em>(Nov. 9, 1998), Meigs App. No. 97CA13, unreported, 1998 WL 789431. Maximum sentences are reserved for those offenders who (1) have committed the worst forms of the offense, (2) pose the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes, (3) are certain major drug offenders, and (4) are certain repeat violent offenders. R.C. 2929.14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Here, the trial court stated at the sentencing hearing that Moore posed the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes. The trial court made the same finding in its sentencing entry. Therefore, the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">However, before imposing the maximum sentence when \u201cthe sentence is for one offense,\u201d the trial court must also make \u201ca finding that gives its reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>selecting the sentence imposed\u201d and must set forth its \u201creasons for imposing the maximum prison term.\u201d R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(d); <em>State v. Edmonson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 328, 715 N.E.2d 131, 134-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Here, the trial court did not set forth its reasons for imposing the maximum term, even though it imposed the maximum sentence and the sentence was for one offense. Therefore, the trial court did not comply with R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(d). We find that the length of Moore\u2019s sentence is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We next address Moore\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Under the statutory framework of R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), the sentencing court may not impose consecutive sentences unless it finds three statutory factors applicable. <em>State v. Brice </em>(Mar. 29, 2000), Lawrence App. No. 99CA21, unreported, 2000 WL 334004. First, the court must find that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender. R.C. 2929.14(E)(4). Second, the court must find that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public. <em>Id. </em>Third, the court must find that at least one of these three factors applies to the offender:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">\u201c(a) The offender committed the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to [R.C.] 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 * * *, or was under post-release control for a prior offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">\u201c(b) The harm caused by the multiple offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of a single course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">\u201c(c) The offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(E)(4)(a) through (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">The verb \u201cfinds,\u201d as used in R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), means that \u201cthe court must note that it engaged in the analysis\u201d called for by the statute. <em>State v. Edmonson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 326, 715 N.E.2d 131,133-134.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Here, the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) by finding that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime and to punish Moore, that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime and the danger Moore poses to the public, and that Moore\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by Moore. R.C. 2929.14(E)(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">However, before imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court must specify on the record that the reasons allowed by R.C. 2929.14(E)(4) justify consecutive rather than concurrent terms. R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c); <em>Edmonson; Brice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Here, the trial court did not set forth its reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence even though it imposed the maximum sentence and for one offense. Therefore, the trial court did not comply with R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(c). We find that the consecutive nature of Moore\u2019s sentence is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Because we have found that the trial court did not comply with R.C. 2929.19(B)(2), we sustain Moore\u2019s only assignment. of error. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case to the trial court only for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-10\">Harsha, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b642-11\">Peter B.

We declined to address the merits of these issues so that Moore could be represented by counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Anders v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\">. In <em>Edmonson, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court analyzed the verb \"finds\u201d within the context of R.C. 2929.14(B), which describes what a sentencing court must find before sentencing a first-time offender to a prison term longer than the minimum term authorized by statute. In our view, the word \"finds\u201d carries the same meaning in R.C. 2929.14(B) as it does in R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>2929.14(E)(4). See, e.g., <em>State v. Brice, supra; State v.
