Remarkably, the facts are not even in dispute. According to Cincinnati Police Officer Chancey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Prude, he and his partner, who was hiding in the trunk of their unmarked car, were patrolling to catch prostitutes. Swann was walking along the street, and Prude pulled his car to the curb and engaged her in conversation. He then invited her into the car, and they discussed various things, at first not of a sexual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Officer Prude testified that the sexual issue arose in the following manner: \u201c[I asked her] well, do you want to trade off crack \u2014 or instead of money for the sex act, which was oral sex, and she said no, I\u2019ll take the money. I said okay, and I said, how much is it going to cost me, and we kind of went back and forth on that, and I said $10, and she said no, I\u2019ll take $15.\u201d At that point, a prearranged signal brought Prude\u2019s partner from his hiding place in the trunk, and he arrested Swann.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Swann\u2019s testimony is similar: \u201cHe [Officer Prude] asked me, did I want to do something for some money and he offered me $10 for oral sex and I said, no, not $10. I did say maybe $15, and he said what would you do for everything. I said, I\u2019m not doing everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The charge against Swann was soliciting, in violation of R.C. 2907.24, which states that \u201c[n]o person shall solicit another to engage with such other person in sexual activity for hire.\u201d In spite of the syntactically jumbled sentence, we can discern that three elements make up the offense: (1) the accused\u2019s solicitation of another, (2) to engage in sexual activity, (8) for hire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first element is the only one in question here. \u201cSolicit\u201d is defined as \u201cto entice, urge, lure or ask.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAq1\">The state\u2019s position is that any time a person <em>agrees </em>to have sex for money, the statute is violated. That would be true if the statute read \u201cagree with another\u201d rather than \u201csolicit another.\u201d But we cannot redraft the statute; we have to hold that it means what it says. Furthermore, criminal statutes, according to the same statutory scheme, are to be interpreted strictly against the state.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Swann did not \u201centice, urge, lure or ask\u201d the officer for anything. She simply agreed to his suggestion. This case is almost exactly the same as <em>State v. Howard,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the facts of which were as follows: \u201cThe policeman approached the defendant standing on or near the curb and said, \u2018Are you dating?\u2019 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>defendant replied affirmatively. The officer\u2019s next statement was \u2018What will you do?\u2019 The defendant\u2019s answer was \u2018anything.\u2019 \u2018Oral sex?\u2019 asked the officer. The defendant agreed, got in the car and was promptly arrested and charged with the offense of soliciting.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The court in <em>Howard </em>ruled as follows: \u201cThe defendant in this case did not entice, urge, lure or ask for money in return for sexual performance. What defendant did was agree to what the officer had suggested and as such he cannot be found to be guilty of soliciting, an offense unlike some other offenses where entrapment is raised, where the crime <em>is </em>in the asking.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We agree with the reasoning of <em>Howard </em>that, in a soliciting case, the crime is the asking.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Swann was the solicitee, not the solicitor. Although she agreed to the solicitation, the specific crime with which she was charged does not prohibit acceptance, only entreaty. Of course, if she had gone through with the act, she would have been guilty of prostitution, regardless of who had made the original solicitation. That distinction makes sense, especially because the law should be slow to punish conversation alone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and order Swann discharged from further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and appellant discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-9\">Doan, P.J., and Winkler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\">.
