He arrived at Seattle, Wash., August 14, 1934, and applied for admission into the United States as a citizen thereof by virtue of being a foreign-born. son of Wong Fook, a native-born citizen of the United States. Appellant was accompanied by his alleged father, Wong Fook, and an alleged half-brother, Wong Shong Fay, both of whom were admitted as citizens. Appellant was denied admission by a board of special inquiry at the. Seattle Immigration Station on the ground that his claim of relationship to his alleged father had .not been established. He appealed from this decision to the Secretary of Labor, who dismissed the appeal and directed that he be returned to China. Thereafter he petitioned the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">It is conceded that the alleged father, Wong Fook, is a native citizen of the United States and that he was in China at a time to render his paternity of a child born on April 29, 1913, possible. The only - issue involved is whether or not appellant has established the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The testimony of appellant and his witnesses is ' in substantial agreement throughout. The denial of appellant\u2019s admission is based upon the sworn testimony given by the alleged father on January 17, 1916, before the United States Immigration Office in Vancouver, B. C., upon a hearing on his application for admission to the United States as a citizen. At this hearing he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">\u201cQ.

On the hearing before the board of special inquiry at Seattle on August 23, 1934, Wong Fook testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-18\">\u201cQ. How many wives have you had? A.

The record shows that you testified Jan. 17, 1916, that your first wife Gee Shee died in 1910, the 12th month, about six years prior to the date you have given today for her death. A. I did not make such a statement at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-14\">\u201cQ. Are you able to read English? A. A little.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-15\">\u201cQ.

A. .1 did mention Shong Bin at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-26\">The appellant\u2019s appeal to the Secretary of Labor was dismissed on the ground that \u201cthe two-fold record contradiction of the relationship now claimed would appear to make it impossible to find that this relationship is satisfactorily or reasonably established.\u201d In view of the testimony of the alleged father in 1916 regarding the claimed relationship which was independent evidence on such relationship, we cannot say that the immigration authorities abused their discretion or acted arbitrarily in refusing to believe his subsequent testimony to the contrary. Fong Kong v. Nagle (C. C. A.) 57 F.(2d) 138; Chin Ching v. Nagle (C. C. A.) 51 F.(2d) 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-27\">Appellant claims an unfair hearing on the ground that the Secretary of Labor refused to reopen the case for the introduction of testimony of three Chinese witnesses, re-examination of the alleged father so that he could explain his 1916 testimony, and the reception in evidence of a family photograph, and that the District Court erred in denying his motion to reopen the case for the introduction of this evidence, together with an additional family photograph. The reopening of a case by the immigration authorities for the introduction of further evidence is a matter for the exercise of their discretion and we cannot interfere unless their action constitutes a denial of due process of law. Appellant and his alleged father were given full opportunity to testify and to present all witnesses and documentary evidence at the original hearing, if they so desired. No allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>tion is made that they were not then available or that their proposed testimony was then unknown. In denying the application, the immigration authorities found that this evidence proposed to be offered could not \u201creasonably be regarded as overcoming the weight of the sworn statement of applicant\u2019s alleged father given on January 17, 1916, that Gee Shee, who is claimed to have become the mother of this applicant on April 29, 1913, had died in 1910 and his further failure to mention such a son as this applicant when in 1916 he was asked regarding the chibdren who had been born of the union of himself and Gee Shee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">There was no denial of a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
