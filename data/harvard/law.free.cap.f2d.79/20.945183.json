HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">This is an infringement suit of the usual kind, upon patent No. 1,719,848, issued on July 9, 1929, to George M. Paul-son; the invention was for a spark-plug in a gas engine. When such engines are idling, or running at low speeds, if the heat be too readily conducted off through the \u201csparking-point,\u201d the point as it cools will foul, interfering with ignition. On the other hand when the engine is running fast, the point will overheat, due to the more frequent explosions; this causes premature firing \u2014 \u201cback-firing\u201d\u2014unless the point can conduct away the heat quickly enough to remain relatively cool. The optimum condition is therefore to retain the heat in the point at low speeds and to get rid of it at high. Paulson\u2019s purposes, as declared in the preamble to his specification, were to devise a \u201cshank\u201d or \u201cspindle\u201d which should withstand the \u201cheat and strains\u201d of its position; a \u201chead\u201d which should not \u201cscale,\u201d or lose its shape under \u201ccombustion conditions,\u201d and a \u201csparking-point * * * resistant to erosion.\u201d Moreover, although he later mentions the high conductivity of the \u201cshank\u201d as a desideratum (page 1, lines 10, 43, 44, 80, 85), the heat resistance of the \u201chead\u201d appears only in claim one. There however all the elements are described by their function; the \u201cshank\u201d must be beat conducting; the \u201chead\u201d heat-resisting; \u201csparking-point,\u201d non-erosive. Thus the specifications if followed would certainly secure that flexibility which the plug disclosed in use, whether or not Paul-son had fully grasped its operation, as he certainly had not its usefulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The issue of infringement is too verbal and too insubstantial to deserve discussion; we need consider only validity. A spark-plug must bring into the explosion chamber the two terminals of an electric current; the spark is the discharge across the gap which separates them. One terminal, usually a piece of wire, is grounded to the oilier iron shell of the plug which in turn is suitably connected to a source of current; the other must be insulated from the shell. It is attached to the lower end o\u00ed a metal \u201cshank,\u201d surrounded and insulated from the shell by porcelain, mica, or the like, whose upper end is properly wired back to the same source of current. The \u201cshank\u201d might therefore be no more than an insulated wire running through the plug and into the chamber. Plowever, the art had long since abandoned any such simple device, if indeed it had ever strictly speaking used it; it had been customary to make the \u201cshank\u201d of another metal and of a different calibre from the \u201cpoint,\u201d and at times to enlarge it at the end into a flange. Usually this flange was of a piece with the \u201cshank,\u201d but occasionally it' was made integral with the \u201cpoint,\u201d as in Rail. No. 1,221,906 (1917). Blattmann, No. 1,105,746 (1914), Standish, No. 1,247,345 (1917), and Rogers, No. 1,516,460 (1924), each showed a covering piece for the end of the \u201cshank,\u201d separate from \u201cshank\u201d and \u201cpoint.\u201d In Rogers this was to protect the insulator; in Blattmann it was to prevent injury to the \u201cshank\u201d; in Standish it was a heat-conductor, not a heat resister; and in none is there evidence that it was to be of a different metal. Yet all the metals which Paulson used had been used before in some part of a plug. Nickel was common for the \u201cpoint\u201d; Rall, supra; Blattmann, supra; manganese nickel, which Paulson especially prescribed was disclosed by Olsen, No. 1,335,793 (1920), Littleton, No. 1,525,453 (1925); and Rohde, No. 1,313,419 (1919). . The \u201cshank\u201d and \u201chead,\u201d in a single piece, were disclosed as of chromium steel, Paulson\u2019s high resistant, by Mason (1922), Brit. Pat. 209,-207; steel \u201cshanks\u201d were very common; Blattmann, supra; Mitchel, No. 1,441,444 (1923); Standish, No. 1,247,345 (1917). Walsh, No. 1,076,535 (1913), specially disclosed a \u201cshank\u201d made of a low grade carbon steel, the very metal chosen by Paulson.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">For these reasons the defendant argues that the supposed invention is no more than a substitution of materials familiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to the art in the same uses; an aggregation of which each part performs what it <em>did </em>before. We may concede as much arguendo, for the same may be said of every invention. All machines are made up of the same elements; rods, pawls, pitmans, journals, toggles, gears, cams, and the like, all acting their parts as they always do and always must. All compositions are made of the same substances, retaining their fixed chemical properties. But the elements are capable of an infinity of permutations, and the selection of that group which proves serviceable to a given need may require a high degree of originality. It is that act of selection which is the invention; and it must be beyond the capacity of common-place imagination. Often we can truly treat the inquiry as one of fact by observing what went before and what followed. If the combination would have had practical value long before it appeared, if no impediment, technical, or commercial, stood in the way, if during that time others had been at work upon the same subject, and if the invention was at once accepted as an answer to the old need, there is usually just basis for the inference. When such evidence is not at hand, we are forced to fabricate a standard as best we can from our naive ignorance; but that is so unsatisfactory an expedient that resort to it should be as sparing as possible. In either case, whether we have evidence, or must grope unguided, those putatively objective principles by which it is so often supposed that invention can be detected are illusion, and the product of unconscious equivocation; the inexorable syllogism which appears to compel the conclusion is a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In the case at bar it seems to us that the evidence is at hand to show that Paulson\u2019s combination \"was beyond the scope of even the -most skilled routineers. The record is peppered with a score of patents upon spark-plugs distributed more or less evenly over more than fifteen years. They show a manifold ingenuity and all sorts of permutations, but not Paulson\u2019s; it is uncommon to find so much ingenuity devoted to so small a device. During that time the motor car was being made in prodigious, almost monstrous 'quantities, millions upon millions; a new discovery which gave its possessor an exploitable advantage' was likely to be the source of great wealth; the stimulus to invention was rarely strong. Moreover, nothing stood in the path; the defendant\u2019s very argument may be turned against itself; for Paulson\u2019s metals were all being used and were all available commercially; yet they did not suggest this combination, which would have been as serviceable at any time' as it has been since the patent issued. True, its especial use is for the extremely trying service conditions of the airplane, but extensive exploitation of airplanes, commercial and military, had begun long before 1927, the date of Paulson\u2019s application. When his plug did appear it was at once recognized as of great service, and has so far become standard equipment for airplanes that the list of its users is a catalogue of most of the responsible airplane companies, as well as the United States army and navy. Before such an industrial picture it seems to us the extreme of incredulity to hesitate. Monopolies may be undesirable; perhaps they should go only to those distinguished benefactors of mankind who will never claim them, whose creative imagination needs no such goad. That is not the assumption which, for good or bad, underlies our patent law, as has been declared over and over again; it presupposes not genius, only an emergence from the common ruck of men who are content to follow beaten paths and unable to find others. Judged by that standard this combination was surely an invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">It is true that Paulson did not foresee the particular adaptability of his plug to the airplane; indeed, we may assume that he did not even know the especial needs of its engine. Nevertheless he did not shoot in the dark; he laid down with perfect certainty what he wished to accomplish and how; it was to conduct away the heat by his choice of metal for the \u201cshank,\u201d to resist its loss by the metal in the \u201chead,\u201d to use a metal for the \u201cpoint\u201d which would stand up. The unsuspected value of this flexibility of heat control contributes to establish his discovery as an invention; he is not charged with a prophetic understanding of the entire field of its usefulness.
