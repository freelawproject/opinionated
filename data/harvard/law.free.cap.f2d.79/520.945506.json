On filing the bill, the state court granted the injunction prayed for. On application of the collector, the case was removed to the court below, and, on motion of the state to remand on the ground the court below had no jurisdiction, the District Court refused so to do, on the ground that it had jurisdiction of the federal question involved and on the merits dismissed the bill on two principles \u2014 one, that the state had adequate remedy at law, viz., paying the contested taxes and bringing suit for the recovery of the same because allegedly illegally assessed; and for the further reason that under the cases of State of Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360, 54 S. Ct. 725, 78 L. Ed. 1307, and State of South Carolina v. U. S., 199 U. S. 437, 26 S. Ct. 110, 50 L. Ed. 261, 4 Ann. Cas. 737, the taxes were legally payable. Thereupon the commonwealth took this appeal, assigning as error the refusal to remand and the dismissal of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-23\">Finding no error in the court\u2019s action, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
