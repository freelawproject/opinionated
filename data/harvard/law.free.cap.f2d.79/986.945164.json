The order complained of held that a paper writing, executed by the. bankrupt purporting to convey certain property to secure a debt of $7,000, created a valid lien upon the property conveyed. The instrument was recorded more than four months prior to the adjudication of Blount as a bankrupt, and according to the evidence the transaction was a bona fide one and the instrument was given to secure a debt honestly due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-24\">While the instrument in question was defective in many respects, an examination of it leads us to the conclusion that the judge below was right in holding that it created a valid lien upon the property.
