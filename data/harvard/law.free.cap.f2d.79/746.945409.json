It reads: \u201c23. Well casing having an unobstructed open bore throughout its length, a normally closed lateral port in the casing adapted to open responsive to pressure in the casing, a plug slidable in the bore of the casing, and means for anchoring the plug in the unobstructed bore of the casing below the port and above the lower end of the casing so as to shut-off the entire bore of the casing below [the port and leave the entire bore of the casing unobstructed above the port].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The Board of Appeals held that as appealed claims 1 and 8 were for substantially the same subject-matter as that defined in canceled claim 23, appellant was estopped from presenting them in the involved application. The board rejected appealed claim 6 on the ground that <em>it </em>contained new matter not disclosed in the original specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">It will be observed that appealed claim 1 differs from canceled claim 23 in that the former states that the bore of the casing is \u201cnormally substantially open,\u201d whereas the latter specified a casing having an \u201cunobstructed open bore throughout its length\u201d; and \u2022 that whereas the appealed claim provides for closing of valves controlling the ports in the casing, such v\u00e1lves are not expressly referred to in the canceled claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">' Counsel for appellant contend that canceled claim 23 is \u201conly for a sub-combination,\u201d and that the provision for a normally substantially open bore of a casing, plus the additional step of closing valves controlling the ports in the casing, contained in appealed claim 1, calls for a patentable combination not disclosed in the prior art, nor claimed in the canceled claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Appellant states in his specification that it is advantageous \u201cto have the full bore, or substantially the full bore, of a string of casing available when carrying on. drilling operations or washing down the string of casing, -and it is also desirable when circulating \u00e1 washing medium preparatory to <em>ai </em>cementing, operation to utilize the' bore of the casing, which should <em>not be 'substantially impeded </em>or restricted, and then to. supply the cementing mixture through the unobstructed bore of the casing, or, at least, through a bore of the casing not restricted or obstructed to such an extent as to seriously impede or prevent the operation referred to.\u201d Appellant frequently refers in his specification to the bore of the casing as being \u201cunobstructed,\u201d \u201csubstantially unobstructed,\u201d and \u201csubstantially open,\u201d and it is perfectly clear that the bore of the casing must be substantially open in order to carry out appellant\u2019s process.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">It will be observed, therefore, that appellant has used the terms \u201cunobstructed,\u201d \u201c-substantially unobstructed,\u201d and \u201csubstantially open\u201d interchangeably. Accordingly, for the purpose of this case, the term \u201cunobstructed,\u201d contained in canceled claim 23, should be interpreted as having the same meaning as the term \u201csubstantially open,\u201d contained in appealed claim 1. See Walker on Patents (6th Ed.) vol. 1, \u00a7 227. Obviously, then, a \u201ccasing having an unobstructed open bore throughout its length\u201d means a casing having a substantially open bore.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">It will further be observed that canceled claim 23 provides for a \u201cnormally closed lateral port in the casing adapted to open responsive to pressure in the casing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">.The solicitor for the Patent Office insists that the quoted language in canceled claim 23 clearly implies a means to close the port in the casing at the proper time after it is opened by pressure in the casing, and that as it is old, as disclosed in the Crowell reference, patent No. 1,601,239, issued September 28, 1926, to close the ports in the casing by means, such as a \u201cspring,\u201d it would not involve invention to add such element to the combination defined in canceled claim 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">We quote from that reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-15\">\u201cIt is a further object of the invention to provide an extremely simple but practical valvular control, adapted to normally positively close the valves, but readily yielding for opening thereof, when cement is forced downwardly through the casing. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-16\">\u201cThe shifting of valve 11 longitudinally of the casing rather than radially thereof, eliminates the possibility of the valvular control striking the wall of the well, irrespective of restrictions in the well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>bore, and full opening of the valve is thus assured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">\u201cAfter discharge of all of the cement, the valve collar 11 is positively reseated by its spring 12, sb as to close the discharge ports and thus permit the cement to harden without the possibility of it reentering the bore of the string of casing. The back pressure valve 7 is subsequently drilled out in usual manner to provide an unobstructed passage through the bore of the string of well casing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">If, as stated in canceled claim 23, the lateral port in the casing is <em>normally closed, </em>but is adapted to open responsive to pressure in the casing for the purpose of permitting the cementing operation, a means adapted to close the port subsequent to the cementing operation is necessarily implied. That feature being old and well known to the art, as disclosed in the patent to Crowell, No. 1,601,239, it would not involve invention to add it to the combination defined in canceled claim 23. We are of opinion, therefore, that appealed claim 1 is not patentably distinct from canceled claim 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">As pointed out by counsel for appellant, appealed claim 8 calls for a \u201cplug carrying means slidingly fitting said casing,\u201d and the closing of the bore of the casing \u201cby the stoppage of said plug at a predetermined point intermediate the upper and lower ends of said casing\u201d; whereas canceled claim 23 calls for a \u201cplug slidable in the bore of the casing, and means for anchoring the plug in the unobstructed bore of the casing below the port and above the lower end of the casing so as to shut-off the entire bore of the casing below [the port and leave the entire bore of the casing unobstructed above the port].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Counsel for appellant contend that the quoted language contained in canceled claim 23 implies that it is the \u201cmeans for anchoring the plug\u201d which wholly or partially closes the bore of the casing; whereas, in fact, the bore of the casing is entirely closed by the plug itself, as stated in appealed claim 8. Counsel for appellant further point out that, in a decision by the Board of Appeals in a companion case, referred to in its decision in the case at bar, it was stated that appellant was the first \u201cto provide a plug slidably fitting the casing and force it down into the casing to close it so that the bore is unobstructed up to the time the cementing is to occur,\u201d and that the anchoring means in appellant\u2019s device did not obstruct the bore in the casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">It clearly appears in appellant\u2019s specification that the means for anchoring the plug does not in any way obstruct the bore of the casing, and that it is the plug itself which entirely closes the bore of the casing below the port. We quote from the specification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">\u201cBelow the ports 4 the bore of the ported section of the casing preferably has an increased .diameter forming an elongated annular recess 7 terminating in upper and lower shoulders 8 and 9 formed by continuations of the uniform bore of the string of casing; and the lower shoulder 9 forms a seat for a plug 10 adapted for expansion into recess 7, while the upper shoulder \u2022 8 is preferably inclined to permit ready expansion of the plug when it is lowered through the bore of the casing to the level of the recess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-12\">\u201cIn order to provide anchoring means for plug 10 in recess 7, the plug is shown as provided with an intermediate reduced diameter 11 adapted to receive arcuate locking slips 12 which are adapted to contract wholly within the outer periphery of the plug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-13\">\u201cBias springs 13 fixed to the plug in back of the slips engage the latter so as to tend to expand the same beyond the periphery of the plug, and expansion of the slips is preferably guided and limited by abutments 14 on the plug engaging in notches IS in the slips. As the plug is lowered through casing A, the uniform bore of the latter contracts the slips to permit free passage of the plug, and when the plug is opposite recess 7, the annular enlargement formed thereby permits springs 13 to expand the slips so that they rest on shoulder 9 and thereby anchor the plug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-14\">\u201cPacking is preferably mounted on the plug to insure a tight shutting-off of the casing when the plug is anchored in recess 7, the parts being so arranged that when the plug is anchored its packing closes the bore of the casing just below ports 4.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">The plug referred to in canceled claim 23 as a \u201cplug slidable in the bore of the casing,\u201d and in appealed claim 8 as \u201ca plug carrying means slidingly fitting said casing,\u201d is described in appellant\u2019s spec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ification as \u201ca plug,\u201d an \u201canchored plug,\u201d and a \u00b0 \u201cplug * * * adapted for expansion\u201d into the elongated annular recess in the hore of the casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Obviously, then, the language \u201ca plug slidable in the bore of the 'casing, and means for anchoring the plug in the unobstructed bore of the casing *I * * so as to shut-off the entire bore pf the casing below [the port and leave the entire bore of the casing unobstructed above the port],\u201d contained in canceled claim 23, in view .of appellant\u2019s specification, could not reasonably be construed as meaning that the means for anchoring the plug either partially or substantially closes the bore of the casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The sixth step in appealed claim 8 relates to the closing of the valves controlling the ports in the casing.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Our discussion relative to the closing of the valves controlling the ports in the casing, called for in claim 1, is applicable to the sixth step in appealed claim 8, and we deem it unnecessary to repeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">We are of opinion that the Board of Appeals was right in holding that appealed claim 8 is not substantially different from canceled claim 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Counsel for appellant challenge the correctness of the decision of the board holding the doctrine of estoppel applicable to the subject-matter Of appealed claims 1 and 8, in view of the fact that canceled claim 23, although for the same subject-matter, was contained in a \u201ccop'ending apparatus case\u201d \u2014 the parent application, and not in the divisional application.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">It should be said here, however, as stated by the solicitor for the Patent .Office, that the co-pending case referred to by counsel for appellant \u201c * * * was the parent of the application resulting in the patent sought to be reissued. In other words, appellant divided his parent case, got a patent on the divisional application and now seeks to reissue that patent. It is clear that any claims canceled in the parent case to get a patent could not be reinserted in a reissue of a patent granted on the parent case, and it seems equally clear that such claims should neither be allowed in a reissue application of a patent granted on a divisional . application of the parent case. It would be. a strange anomaly indeed if a deliberately 1 cancelled . claim which .could not be revived in reissue application of a parent case could be revived by the mere expedient of dividing the parent case and instead of seeking a reissue of the parent case, seek a reissue of the patent resulting on the divisional application. The proceedings in the divisional case are merely a continuation of those in the parent case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">It may be that, in applying the doctrine of estoppel in this case, the Board' of Appeals, as stated by counsel for appellant, \u201chas gone further than any previous decision in rejecting a reissue on such ground.\u201d But, however that may be, we think the doctrine of estoppel is clearly applicable, and that appellant is estopped to- claim subject-matter in the present application for reissue which he deliberately cancelled in claim 23 of the-parent application. See In re Murray, Jr., 64 F.(2d) 788, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1046, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">As hereinbefore stated, appealed claim 6 was .rejected by the Board of Appeals-on the ground that it contained new matter -not disclosed in the original specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">The present application contains the-following description 'of the invention defined in appealed claim- 6, which, it is conceded by counsel for appellant, was not contained in the divisional application which matured into patent No. 1,828,098:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">\u201cAs is well understood by those of skill in this art, various and diverse conditions are met in the process of shutting off water from oil wells. Sometimes, for instance, the casing becomes frozen and cannot be- raised from the bottom so as to permit circulation or cementing through the bottom of the casing; at other times while the casing may be raised, caving of such character and to such an extent may have occurred that sufficient circulation cannot be obtained, nor, in such cases, can the cementing fluid, be properly placed through the bottom of the casing or effectively to a sufficient height above the bottom of the casing. Again, sometimes a good formation seat is available, and at other times not. Occasionally a partial cementing may be accomplished through the bottom of the casing, but it. may be deemed desirable to continue the operation of forcing the cementing fluid outwardly through one or more of a series of ports above the bottom of the casing in addition to the attempted cement-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>ing at the bottom of the well. In the process of my present invention, barriers may be used or omitted, and indicating plugs may be used or omitted during the course of cementing or attempting to cement through the bottom of 'the casing. The process of the present invention is adapted to all such varying conditions, the provisions for circulation or cementing, or both, through lateral ports intermediate the ends of the casing and located at any predetermined point or points, either separately or in conjunction with circulating or cementing, or both, through the bottom of the casing, during all of which operation any substantial built-in closure or partitioning off of the casing is avoided, constituting advantages which make my process of great adaptability and therefore of great value as an improvement in this art. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\u201cSteps old in this art, consisting of circulating through the bottom of the casing and of cementing through the bottom of the casing, are not prevented or impeded in any manner by the improvement herein described; on the contrary, they are made part of the present method, and it is contemplated that said steps or either of them may be used in conjunction with either or both of the steps of circulating or cementing through ports in the casing intermediate the top and bottom of the casing, all of which -are comprised as elements within my process of shutting off water from a well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Counsel for appellant argue that the alleged new matter contained in the quoted excerpt amounts only to a statement of matters long known tO' the art; that such matter was inserted in the reissue application \u201con the theory that the original description was defective or insufficient as not fully showing the uses of the invention\u201d; that if the alleged new matter is entirely eliminated, the original specification upon which the reissue application is based amply supports appealed claim 6, if it be read in the light of the prior art; and that, therefore, the tribunals of the Patent Office erred in holding that claim 6 contains new matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">We are unable to concur in the views expressed by counsel for appellant. It is clear, we think, that the matter contained in the quoted excerpts does not relate merely to the uses of an invention already described, but, on the contrary, is, in fact, new matter, and discloses for the first time the combination of steps contained in appealed claim 6. We must hold, therefore, that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion. See In re Collins, 75 F.(2d) 1000, 22 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1053, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">LENROOT, Associate Judge, dissents as to claim 6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
