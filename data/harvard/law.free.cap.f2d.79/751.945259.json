Neither is there any question as to appellee\u2019s prior use of its mark upon dairy products generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Upon this state of facts, the tribunals of the Patent Office concurred in holding that the only question to be considered (save a contention of estoppel interposed by appellant to which we shall later make reference) was that of the similarity of the opposing marks, and they concurred in finding the similarity to be so striking as that confusion in trade would be likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">It seems obvious to us that this conclusion is sound. The marks, except in the arrangement of the words and the absence of the letter \u201cg\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark, are identical. The likelihood of confusion here is certainly as strong, if not stronger, than in the case of Sutter Packing Co. v. Piggly Wiggly Corporation, 64 F. (2d) 1006, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1069, where the opposing marks were \u201cSlices O\u2019Gold\u201d and \u201cSunset Gold,\u201d applied to canned fruits and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Upon the question of estoppel it is unnecessary to say more than that, under the rule announced with great definite-ness in our decision in the case of Skookum Packers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Pacific Northwest Canning Co., 45 F.(2d) 912, 18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 792, the question of estoppel has no place in this opposition proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
