The Commissioner held against the taxpayer; the Tax Board in his favor. In so doing the Tax Board discussed in detail the situation in its reversing opinion, and reference thereto saves needless repetition. It grasped and decided the gist of the case as follows: \u201cIn our opinion, however, the controlling factor here is not the method by which the partnership obtained\u2019 customers or made sales. It is the fact that the partnership purchased securities and held them not for investment or speculation, but for resale at a profit to anyone who\" desired to buy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">Finding no error in the Board\u2019s action, we limit ourselves to approving the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
