Certain of its provisions work an injustice. They are modified. The modifications are scrutinized, not in the spirit of tlieir enactment, but according to the letter of their language:. Procedure designed to fit that letter is de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>vised. The courts are asked to appraise that devising. Cf. our own opinion of two years ago, George H. Clapp v. D. B. Heiner, Collector of Internal Revenue, 51 F.(2d) 224.</p>\n<p id=\"AZG\">An economy based on money might have eliminated the once universal practice of barter. That seems to have been the assumption of the draftsmen of the original (1916) income tax act (39 Stat. 756). es omission was repaired by section 202 (b) of the 1918 Act (40 Stat. 1060), whereby, gain or loss from exchanges was in-eluded in express terms. The principal opinion does not require us to follow in any detail the subsequent improvement of the first provision. The history of the legislation is set forth in some detail in opinions filed in the Fourth and Second Circuits. C. H. Mead Coal Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. C. A.) 72 F.(2d) 22; John J. Watts v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. C. A.) 75 F.(2d) 981. Curiously, counsel did not cite us to a recent book devoted entirely to this rather narrow subject (Reorganization and Other Exchanges in Federal Income Taxation, by Miller, Hendricks, and Everett), The struggle of the Congress to be fair with the taxpayer is made abundantly clear therein.</p>\n<p id=\"A8Dh\">The statute in the form with which we are presently concerned is found in section 2112, title 26, USCA,' and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Oq\">\n<em>\"Recognition of Gain or Loss '</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa8l\">\"(a) <em>General Rule. </em>Upon the sale or exchange of property the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under section 2111, shall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayv\">\u201c(b) <em>Exchanges Solely in </em>Kind.-* * * ' <em>* J</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuG\">, , (4) <em>Same Gam of corporation. </em>No gam or loss shall be recognized if a corporation a party to a reorganization exchanges pioperty, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities m another corporation a party to the reorganization. -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6k\">\u201c(i) <em>Definition of Reorganisation. </em>As used in this section and sections 2113 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2G\">\u201c(1) The term \u2018reorganization\u2019 means (A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation), 'or (B) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation' if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of corporation to which the assets are t/ansferred, or (C) a recapitalization, or P) a fere cha*f \u201c ldentl1T&lt; or Place of organization, however effected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afz\">\u201c(2) The term \u2018a party to a reorganization\u2019 includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization and includes both corporations in the case of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANd\">The real -party in interest in the case at bar js one C. Easman Jacobus. Prior to 1929, he was engaged in the transport bus business in Morris county, N. J. The citiZens of that state will remember that about that time the Public Service Corporation realized that the advance of the motor vehicle art was making\u2018serious inroads upon its transportation by trolley. The highways and streets of the state were crowded with busses, all competing with the street cars of the Public Service. It became anxious to extend its trolley transport monopoly to gasoline propelled trackless vehieles, i. e., busses. These busses were generally owned in small units. One individual, either personally or through the corporate device, owned and operated a small fleet of busses on limited routes.</p>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">_ order to acquire this particular bus ^ne&gt; \u2022 Public Service Coordinated Transport Company was willing to afford Mr. Jacobus a handsome profit, namely, a quarter of a million dollars. To the lay mind, this would seem to be easily recogn\u00a1zabie\u00bb as a gain. But then those without benefit of legal education would not \u00abrecognize\u201d the possibilities of the \u201ccorp0rate reorganization\u201d provisions of the Revenue Act. The case at bar arises out of sudl recognition by Mr. jacobus\u2019, ad-visor or advisors. It fails in this court at least, because we happen to share the lay, rather than the legalistic, point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"A3d\">Mr. Jacobus could have transferred the stock in his bus company to the Public Service Coordinated Transport Company for cash; he could have-transferred it for some form of obligation issued from that corporation, i. e., preferred stock, notes, bonds, etc. But then the fact of gain could not have been denied. So instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>each party to the sale created a new corporation and transferred the respective considerations, i. e., bus company stock and the preferred stock to the treasury of the two new corporations. Then the sellers\u2019 corporation acquired all the stock in the buyers\u2019 corporation. The memorandum filed by the Board of Tax Appeals indicates that it considered the transaction outside the technical terms of the statute. That is a solution. We prefer a more fundamental one.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">It is our opinion that the provision of the Revenue Act invoked here is in no way applicable. The section is entitled, \u201cThe gain of a corporation.\u201d We are not dealing with the gain of any corporation. The gain is that of C. E. Jacobus and his alone. If he is to be allowed to disguise that gain by the creation of corporations, any attempt to tax gain is rendered nugatory. Obviously, any seller and any buyer can proceed exactly as the buyer and seller did in this case. So for the payment of a small franchise tax and perhaps equally small legal fees, the gain becomes not a \u201cgain\u201d hut a \u201creorganization.\u201d To so declare would make impossible taxation of receipts from appreciation of assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
