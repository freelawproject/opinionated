As matter of form it is argued against the petition <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: (a) That the administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>is not a citizen of the United States within such statute, whose oath entitles him to its benefits; (b) further, that the petition, not showing that neither the estate nor any person interested is able to pay or secure the costs, but merely that the administrator is not and being sworn to by the administrator, and not by the beneficiaries, is defective; (c) that it does not show, as required by the statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the cause it seeks to prosecute is a meritorious one.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">As matter of fact it' is urged against the appeal: (a) That both the creditors .of the estate and the widow of the deceased, as beneficiaries subject to its debts, are solvent and amply able to pay or secure the costs of the appeal; and (b) that there is no merit in it, because it plainly appears that'not only does the record fail to show the accidental death of the deceased by drowning, but it affirmatively and indisputably shows that his death was voluntary and suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">We cannot agree with appellee that an administrator or legal representative may not prosecute an appeal in forma pauperis. The decisions it cites, Reed v. Pennsylvania Co. (C. C. A.) 111 F. 714, Clay v. Southern Railway Co. (C. C. A.) 90 F. 472, are to the contrary as the general practice is. Cunningham v. United States (C. C. A.) 67 F.(2d) 714. We think it plain, however, that the petition on which the appeal was granted is defective, both in its failure to negative the ability of the estate to pay the costs, and its failure to have attached to it the affidavits of the persons to be benefited by the appeal that they were not able.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>We tliink it is plain too, that the ap peal, while taken in good faith, is whollj without merit. The statute under which the appeal is prosecuted is a statute o\u00ed grace. It extends to those embraced in it, but only to those, Quittner v. Motion Picture Producers &amp; Distributors (C. C. A.) 70 F.(2d) 331, the privilege of prosecuting, without paying or securing the costs, appeals which arc substantially meritorious, and which, because of the appellant\u2019s poverty, could not be prosecuted if bond or seettrity were required. It may <em>not </em>be used by persons not poor persons, in whose interest, though not parties to the suit, the litigation is being conducted, to prosecute an appeal without giving bond or costs, Neither may it be used to prolong a plainly fruitless litigation by prosecuting a plainly meritless appeal. Kinney v. Plymouth Rock Squab Co., 236 U. S. 43, 35 S. Ct. 236, 59 L. Ed. 457. Because of this want of merit, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss will be granted. case. The proof in this case fails to present a single fact or circumstance which would sustain a finding that the deceased came to his death by violent, external, and accidental means. More, it definitely and positively establishes in an irrefutable and inescapable way that his death was suicide. More completely than was the case in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Trimble (C. C. A.) 69 F.(2d) 849, 850, the very case plaintiff made proved that the death was not within the policy. There, with no molive shown, we held the circumstances all consistent with the theory of siticide, and all inconsistent with any but that theory, In the main opinion we said: \u201cThe presumption against suicide was overcome if the preponderance of the evidence was consistent with the theory of suicide and at the same time was inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of death by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\"> While appeals may not he prosecuted with effect except where good and sufficient bond is given, or the poor persons statute is complied with, an appel<em>lat</em>e court will not ordinarily dismiss an appeal for defects in these particulars, wi<em>tho</em>ut first affording opportunity for their corr<em>e</em>ction. Reed v. Pennsylvania Co., supra. The District Judge having granted the p<em>e</em>t<em>it</em>ion on the showing deemed sufficient by him, and the appeal papers having been prepared and lodged here in reliance on <em>hi</em>s order, we would not, but for the e<em>n</em>tire lack of merit m the appeal, dismiss it wi<em>t</em>hout first giving appellant an opportunity to comply with the poor persons statute, <em>o</em>r give bond. Since the record plainly shows that the appeal is wholly without merit, w<em>e </em>will not put appellant to the amendment of his appeal papers to no purpose, but will now dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB4\">In the concurring opinion it was said: \u201cIn suits on accident policies insuring against the risk of death from external, y and acddental C\u00a3mses mere f of death wi]] <em>a(A </em>su(Ece_ piaintiff Ust , <em>. ^ . </em>. <em>. </em>.. . , prove, too, that the death was accidental, * <em>* </em>' . T , 1 \u2022 &lt; <em>^ ^ </em>lhe true rule, 1 think, is that, where 1 . .rr, \u2019 <em>i </em>plainti\u00f1 s proor shows a violent death and \\ <em>^ </em>, 1 <em>* </em>, does not show it to have been self-inflicted, <em>r . </em>. <em>^ </em>. his case is prima facie made out, because ... , , ,*r1 , suicide will not be presumed.

Plaintiff fails here, not because the . , <em>\u2019 </em>proof has overcome tne presumption . . , ..... . against her son s suicide, but because the b . \u2019 ,. . , proof fails to raise any presumption in her favor.\"</p>\n<p id=\"AxW\">Our reasons for concluding that the appeal is without merit may be briefly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">The evidence is without dispute. It shows inescapably that appellant\u2019s deco-dent, confronted with a claim of shortage, committed suicide by drowning himself in the Warrior river. The policy on which appellant sued is in substance identical in its terms with the policy we had before <em>us </em>in the Wilkes Case, 76 F.(2d) 701, 705. The burden upon appellant here was the same as the burden upon Wilkes in that</p>\n<p id=\"APP\">Later- in the W!lkes Case,_ we said: \u201cSuicide, at least when sane, is not accidenfal death. A plaintiff under this poliCy kas burden of proving an accidental death, thereby negativing suicide,</p>\n<p id=\"AZd\">In the light of these authorities, it is perfectly plain that no other verdict than the one rendered would have been proper, This being so, it can serve no useful purpose to prolong the litigation by further perfecting the appeal. Fruitless litigation like that presented here should cease. Kinney v. Plymouth Rock Squab Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"AM1\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-19\"> \u201cNow comes J. J. Boggan, as administrator of the estate of D. J.
