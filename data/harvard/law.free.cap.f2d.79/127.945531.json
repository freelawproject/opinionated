Burr, of Washington, D. C. (William T. Kelley, Chief Counsel, and Martin A. Morrison, Asst. Chief Counsel, for Federal Trade Commission, both of Washington, D.

Petitioner now expressly asserts that machinery used in manufacturing the raw material \u2014 the slugs or blanks \u2014 with which the Indian starts his artistry, is outside the scope of the hearing or the order; that the order is not concerned with the dimensions of the raw material; that the order is designed to confine the term \u201cIndian-made\u201d to those who heat and hammer the slug or blank before ornamentation; and that the order does not define the amount of such heating or hammering. So construed, the order is applicable only to so much of respondent\u2019s jewelry, if any, as is not heated and hammered at all before ornamentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-22\">Both sides complain of the complexity and the difficulty of complying with our modification of petitioner\u2019s order;' petitioner\u2019s order is complex and has already given rise to much misunderstanding. The second paragraph of petitioner\u2019s order will be modified to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-23\">\u201cIt is now ordered that respondent, its agents, representatives, and employees, shall cease and desist from designating, describing, or offering any of its silver jewelry products for sale in interstate commerce as \u2018Indian\u2019 or \u2018Indian-made\u2019 jewelry, where in substantial part machinery (other than hand tools, or nonmechanical equipment, or buffing wheels for polishing) shall be substituted for hand hammering, shaping, or ornamenting the same, unless the label, stamp, catalogue, or advertising shall clearly, expressly, and legibly state the method of such manufacture in immediate context with the descriptive terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-24\">A decree will be entered vacating our former modification of the commission\u2019s order, affirming the order of the commission as now modified; each party to pay its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
