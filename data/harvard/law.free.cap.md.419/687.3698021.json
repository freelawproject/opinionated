Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.02 (5th ed. 1992) [hereinafter Sutherland]; <em>see </em>Jeremy Bentham, <em>Truth </em>versus <em>Ashhurst, in </em>5 The Works of Jeremy Bentham 235 (1863) (\u201cThey won\u2019t tell a man beforehand what it is he <em>should not </em>do\u2014they won\u2019t so much as allow of his being told: they lie by till he has done something which they say he should not <em>have done, </em>and then they hang him for it.

This case presents the question of whether Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>land Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-117\u2014enacted in 2003 expressly to extend from three years to seven years the statute of limitations for civil<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claims stemming from alleged child sexual abuse\u2014 permits, at least under certain circumstances, a kicking of Bentham\u2019s dog, albeit in a procedural way.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">James Doe challenges here the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Calvert County, the latter having reasoned that the Legislature intended \u00a7 5-117 to apply \u201cpartially retroactively\u201d to sexual abuse claims filed against him that, as of the effective date of the extended limitations enactment, had not been barred by the previously-applicable three-year limitations period. We hold, for reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>application of \u00a7 5-117 to the claims in the present case represents a retrospective application of the statute, \u00a7 5-117 is a procedural and remedial statute, and, accordingly, it may be given such retrospective application to claims that were not-yet barred by the previously-applicable three-year limitations period as of the extended period\u2019s effective date, 1 October 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Mary Roe<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cRoe\u201d) was born on 29 September 1983. She reached the age of majority on 29 September 2001. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, \u00a7 24 (\u201cExcept ... as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a person eighteen years of age or more is an adult for all purposes whatsoever____\u201d). Roe alleges in her complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>in this litigation that James Doe (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cDoe\u201d), her grandfather, raped her on two separate occasions, the first of which occurred when Roe was either six or seven years of age, and the second incident when she was eight years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">At the time Roe reached the age of majority, the limitations period on the civil claims stemming from the alleged sexual assaults was governed by Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl. Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 5-101, which provided that \u201c[a] civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues.... \u201d Chapter 360 of the Acts of 2003, effective 1 October 2003, however, added \u00a7 5-117 to the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, establishing the statute of limitations \u201cfor damages arising out of an alleged incident or incidents of sexual abuse that occurred while the victim was a minor\u201d as \u201c7 years [from] the date that the victim attains the age of majority.\u201d Section 2 of Chapter 360, which remains uncodified, provides that \u201c[t]his Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On 3 September 2008, Roe filed a five-count complaint against Doe, alleging (1) assault; (2) battery; (3) false imprisonment; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (5) negligence. Doe responded with a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Complaint and Request for Hearing,\u201d arguing that all of the claims were time-barred because Roe filed her complaint after 28 September 2004, one day shy of three years from the date on which Roe reached the age of majority. Doe asserted that the seven-year statute of limitations did not apply to Roe\u2019s claims against Doe, asserting that \u201c[t]he [Legislature made it clear that the new legislation was prospective only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The Circuit Court, on 22 January 2009, heard oral argument on Doe\u2019s motion to dismiss and Roe\u2019s opposition, and took the matter under advisement. On 3 February 2009, the Circuit Court issued a three-page memorandum opinion, holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>all of Roe\u2019s claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were time-barred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">The language is clear that [\u00a7 5-117] cannot be applied retroactively. If the [Legislature intended for CJ \u00a7 5-117 to apply to those actions still viable as of October 1, 2003, it would have had to explicitly enact such language. \u201cA statute is presumed to operate prospectively from its effective date, absent clear language to the contrary, or unless the manifest intention of the Legislature indicates otherwise.\u201d <em>Rawlings v. Rawlings, </em>362 Md. 535, 555[, 766 A.2d 98, 109] (2001). Here, there is no clear language to contradict the presumption that the statute is prospective or has selective retroactivity, as [Roe] contends. Even the legislative history of CJ \u00a7 5-117 indicates that the statute is not retroactive. Since the enactment of Chapter 360, the Maryland Legislature has introduced, and rejected, numerous attempts to make \u00a7 5-117 retroactive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">Because [Roe]\u2019s cause of action accrued in 2001, before the 2003 enactment of Chapter 360, the \u201cperiod of limitations applicable\u201d to her claims is three years. Therefore, [Roe] had until September 28, 2004 to file a complaint, and, thus her complaint, filed September [3], 2008, is time-barred.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Alternatively, the Circuit Court held that even \u201c[i]f the Court were to apply CJ \u00a7 5-117 retrospectively, [Doe]\u2019s due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>rights would be infringed because he has a vested right to be free from a suit where the statute of limitations has run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Roe noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. A panel of our appellate brethren reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">SECTION 2 [i.e., the uncodified section] manifests the legislative intent that Chapter 360 have some retroactive application. If Chapter 360 were intended to apply purely prospectively, then it would have sufficed to enact only SECTION 3. In that way, the ordinary rule would apply under which legislation is presumed to operate only prospectively. But, here, it cannot be concluded that Chapter 360 operates only prospectively because, to do so, would render SECTION 2 surplusage, in its entirety. That reading violates a cardinal rule of statutory construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">SECTION 2, by its plain language, prohibits a construction of CJ \u00a7 5-117 that would effect a fully retroactive application that revived causes of action that were barred, prior to the enactment of Chapter 360, under the previously applicable law of limitations. Once again, if the Legislature intended, in addition, that CJ \u00a7 5-117 also bar causes of action on which limitations had not run, as of October 1, 2003, under the prior limitations law, then the Legislature did not say so. Further, if that were the legislative intent, it could have been accomplished simply by enacting SECTION 3 and omitting SECTION 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">Defendant\u2019s position seems to be that the prior limitations law continues to govern claims that arose prior to October 1, 2003, and that CJ \u00a7 5-117 governs only claims that arose on or after October 1, 2003. But, that is not what SECTION 2 says. Defendant\u2019s reading would have SECTION 2 state, \u201cThat this Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred or becomes barred by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d Adding words to a statute to affect the meaning manifested by the statute\u2019s plain language is unsound statutory construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>Roe v. Doe, </em>193 Md.App. 558, 565, 998 A.2d 383, 387-88 (2010). Such a conclusion, the Court of Special Appeals explained, was consistent with \u00a7 5-117\u2019s legislative history and its pre-history. <em>See Roe, </em>193 Md.App. at 566-69, 998 A.2d at 388-390. Finally, the intermediate appellate court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">[T]he General Assembly did not infringe any vested or substantial right of Defendant when it extended the period of limitations on claims of sexual abuse of minors and made that extension applicable to claims that were not barred, as of the effective date of the new legislation, by expiration of the prior limitations period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Roe, </em>193 Md.App. at 579, 998 A.2d at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Doe filed a timely Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, <em>Doe v.

CIT Technology Financing Services, Inc., </em>416 Md. 249, 257, 258, 6 A.3d 890, 894, 895 (2010), we explained that although \u201c[i]n Maryland the general rule is that \u2018[a] civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues\u2019 \u201d (quoting Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-101), such a \u201c \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach does not always serve to further the policies underlying the three-year limit,\u201d and, accordingly, \u201cthe Legislature [has] enacted numerous exceptions to \u00a7 5-101\u2019s three-year statute of limitations.\u201d One such exception, \u00a7 5-117, is at the heart of the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">I. The Making of \u00a7 5-117</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In <em>Piselli v. 75th Street Medical, </em>371 Md. 188, 212, 808 A.2d 508, 522 (2002), we explained that \u201cthe principle that statutory time limits for a minor to bring an action do not begin running until the age of majority has been firmly established in our law for a long time.\u201d <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-201 (\u201cWhen a cause of action ... accrues in favor of a minor or mental incompetent, that person shall file his action within the lesser of three years or the applicable period of limitations after the date the disability is removed.\u201d). Accordingly, before \u00a7 5-117 was enacted, victims of child sexual abuse had until the day prior to their twenty-first birthday to file a civil action for damages relating to such abuse. <em>See Mason v. Bd. of Educ. of Baltimore County, </em>375 Md. 504, 826 A.2d 433 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Concerned that a three-year statute of limitations may effectuate a unique injustice in cases of child sexual abuse, the Maryland Legislature first considered in 1994 extending the generally-applicable three-year statute of limitations on civil claims by alleged child sexual abuse victims. Although House Bill 326 of 1994\u2014similar to an earlier draft of Senate Bill 68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>(2003)\u2014passed the House of Delegates and was referred to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, it received an unfavorable report before the latter, <em>see </em>Senate Bill 68 (2003), Fiscal and Policy Note. It would be another nine years before efforts to extend the statute of limitations for sexual abuse victims were revived.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">By 2003, Maryland\u2019s failure to address anew this issue since 1994 apparently reached critical mass. <em>See </em>Baltimore-Washington Conference Council on Ministries, Letter in Support of Senate Bill 68 (2003) (stating that, at the time Senate Bill 68 was being considered, \u201cMaryland [wa]s one of only ten states that ha[d] not extended the statute of limitations in recognition of the special reporting difficulties often encountered in child sexual abuse and other serious crimes committed against children\u201d). Numerous individuals and organizations renewed their support for an extension of the three-year statute of limitations for child sexual abuse cases. One organization expounded upon the unique circumstances inherent to child sexual abuse cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">Perpetrators use many tactics to prevent their victims from disclosing abuse. These range from threats against the victim or loved ones, manipulating the victim, convincing the victim nothing is wrong, and exploiting the victim\u2019s desire to keep a family together. Some victims remain financially and emotionally dependent on the perpetrator well into their late teens and twenties. Others face pressure from other family members to remain silent, or have a deep sense of shame. A short, three year statute of limitations effectively prevents many of these victims from ever obtaining justice in the civil courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, Inc., Testimony in Support of Senate Bill 68 (25 February 2003); <em>see also </em>Letter From Eileen King, Regional Director, Justice for Children, to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (24 February 2003) (\u201cChild abuse victims may not know or understand the harm that has occurred as a result of the abuse; many problems may only develop gradually. A twenty-one year old victim will not have had the time to see the impact of abuse on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>his or her relationships, parenting, work, or studies.\u201d); Citizens\u2019 Review Board for Children, Statement to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (25 February 2003) (\u201cA sexually abused child may have a variety of psychological reactions to his or her victimization....

Rowe regarding (1) \u201cwhether the application of the [initial version of the] bill to apply retroactively to cases that were barred prior to the effective date of the law would violate due process\u201d; and (2) \u201cwhat the effect would be if the bill is passed without any provision as to whether it is to be given retroactive or prospective effect.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Letter from Kathryn M. Rowe to Sen. Brian E. Frosh, Chairman, Judicial Proceedings, at 1 (10 March 2003) [hereinafter \u201cRowe Letter\u201d]. In her informal advice letter<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> addressing the initial inquiry, Ms. Rowe first noted a split in authority regarding whether statutes extending a statute of limitations for certain classes of actions would be read to revive causes of action barred by a previously-in-plaee limitations period, and then explained that \u201c[t]he question that must be answered is wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>er Maryland courts would apply the federal rule [allowing such statutes to revive previously-barred claims], or the rule that appears to be the majority rule among the states in analyzing the constitutionality of a retroactive application of Senate Bill 68.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this point, Ms. Rowe concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">Having reviewed all of these cases,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] it is my view that there is no reported case in Maryland that would mandate the unconstitutionality of [a fully] retroactive application of Senate Bill 68. However, it is possible, given the actions of other states, and its own statement in <em>Dua [v. Comcast Cable of Md., Inc., </em>370 Md. 604, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002) ], that the Court could conclude that retroactive application to revive barred causes of action violates Due Process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Rowe Letter, at 4. Regarding the second inquiry, Ms. Rowe opined that it was her \u201cview that in the absence of a specific provision, the statute could be interpreted to have prospective effect, and that most likely would mean that it would apply only to causes of action based on abuse occurring after the effective date.\u201d Rowe Letter, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Less than two weeks after Ms. Rowe responded to Senator Frosh\u2019s inquiries, a revised version of the bill surfaced.

They also include statutes intended for the correction of defects, mistakes and omissions in the civil institutions and the administration of the state. The definition of a remedial statute has also been stated as a statute that relates to practice, procedure, or remedies and does not affect substantive or vested rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">Every statute that makes any change in the existing body of law, excluding only those enactments which merely restate or codify prior law, can be said to \u201cremedy\u201d some flaw in the prior law or some social evil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">The appellate courts of this state have also defined remedial legislation. For instance, we [have] said that an act is remedial in nature when it provides only for a new method of enforcement of a preexisting right. Under Maryland law, statutes are remedial in nature if they are designed to correct existing law, to redress existing grievances and to introduce regulations conducive to the public good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">(Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">We think that \u00a7 5-117 is remedial. The extended limitations period \u201cimproves remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries,\u201d as an extended period of time during which alleged victims of child sexual abuse may seek redress in the courts \u201cimproves\u201d the child\u2019s right to seek compensation for the alleged wrongs committed against him or her. Further, it may be said fairly that \u00a7 5-117 is \u201cdesigned to correct [then-]existing law,\u201d and to \u201cintroduce regulations conducive to the public good,\u201d as the legislative history of the statute reflects that the extended limitations period\u2014both in Maryland<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in other jurisdictions\u2014was passed (at least in part) \u201cin response to the outcry and evolving understanding of childhood sexual abuse.\u201d Sandee L.

Finally, in concluding that\u2014at least as applied to causes of action not-yet barred by the generally-applicable three-year limitations period\u2014\u00a7 5-117 is a remedial and procedural statute, we are in accord with the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that hold that a change to a limitations period\u2014when applied to claims not-yet-barred by the previous limitations period\u2014is procedural or remedial in nature.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>It would be an oversimplification of the law, of course, to say that every application of a statute expanding a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>of limitations period is remedial or procedural. <em>See Lujan v.

In fact, we stated that, in certain circumstances, a statute changing a limitations period may constitute a substantive change in the law. For instance, in <em>Blocher v.

Additionally, the placement of \u00a7 5-117 within Subtitle 1 (\u201cLimitations\u201d) of Title 5 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article supports further our view that the Legislature intended to extend the limitations period in cases of child sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>abuse, and nothing more (i.e., no new cause of action was created thereby).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We would be faced with a different situation entirely had Roe\u2019s claim been barred under the three-year limitations period as of 1 October 2003, the effective date of \u00a7 5-117.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because we are not presented with that scenario, we express no holding regarding the applicability of \u00a7 5-117 to child sexual abuse claims barred under the three-year statute as of 1 October 2003, the effective date of the new statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Because we deem \u00a7 5-117\u2014at least as applied to those claims not-yet barred by the previously-applicable three-year limitations period as of the effective date of \u00a7 5-117\u2014a procedural and remedial statute, and because we see no indication in the record<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that this procedural and remedial statute was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>intended to be applied prospectively only, <em>see Rawlings, </em>362 Md. at 555, 766 A.2d at 109 (stating that a statute effecting a change in procedure only ... ordinarily applies to all actions whether accrued, pending or future, <em>unless a contrary intention is expressed) </em>(emphasis added), we afford \u00a7 5-117 no presumption of prospectivity<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> such that we would need to determine whether the \u201cmanifest intention of the Legislature\u201d was for the statute to apply retrospectively.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In conclusion, we agree with our appellate brethren when they stated: \u201cSECTION 2 effects an extension of time, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>three years to seven years after majority, for the filing of claims for sexual abuse against a minor that were not barred prior to October 1, 2003, by the then applicable limitations.\u201d <em>Roe, </em>193 Md.App. at 565-66, 998 A.2d at 388.

Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1993) defines \"revive\u201d as \"to live again\u201d or \"to return to consciousness or life.\u201d Accordingly, Section 2 only acts to prohibit application of the Act to those claims that were dead or barred as of the effective date of the statute, and does not speak directly to an application of the act to those claims that were not yet dead or barred as of the effective date. <em>See Dolezal v. Blevins, </em>105 N.M. 562, 734 P.2d 802, 803 (App.1987) (applying the \"general view that the legislature may validly enlarge the period of limitation and make it applicable to existing causes of action\u201d to a statute enlarging a limitations period that provided that \"[n]othing in this act shall be construed to revive a judgment for which the statute of limitation has expired under prior law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Section 2 of Senate Bill 68 provides explicitly: \"[Tjhis Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u201d Put simply, as of 1 October 2003\u2014the effective date of the statute\u2014(save the assault count), Roe\u2019s claims were not yet barred by \u00a7 5-101 and thus, Section 2 is inapplicable to the present scenario. <em>See Roe, </em>193 Md.App. at 565, 998 A.2d at 387-88 (\"Defendant\u2019s reading would have SECTION 2 state, \u2018That this Act may not be construed to apply retroactively to revive any action that was barred <em>or becomes barred </em>by the application of the period of limitations applicable before October 1, 2003.\u2019 \u201d).

We have applied the presumption of prospectivity to statutes effectuating an extension of the generally-applicable three-year limitations period for certain types of claims. For instance, in <em>Slate v. Zitomer, </em>275 Md. 534, 541, 341 A.2d 789, 793 (1975), we applied the \"general presumption ... that all statutes, State and federal, are intended to operate prospectively\u201d to a statute extending the period of limitations for bringing a wrongful death suit from two years to three. Yet, there, application of the presumption of prospectivity was apt, as we held that \"the substantive rights of the respective defendants would be affected by retrospective application of the three year period of limitations,\u201d considering Maryland\u2019s \"wrongful death statute created a new liability not existing at common law, [and thus] compliance with the period of limitations for such actions is a condition precedent to the right to maintain the action.\" <em>Slate, </em>275 Md. at 542, 341 A.2d at 794. Accordingly, in <em>Slate, </em>we were dealing with \"a substantive provision rather than a procedural one.\u201d <em>Slate, </em>275 Md. at 543, 341 A.2d at 795; <em>see also Blocher v. Harlow, </em>268 Md. 571, 579-80, 585, 303 A.2d 395, 399, 402 (1973) (applying the presumption of prospectivity to a statute extending the limitations period for certain actions against an estate, but involving a situation where the \"extending or enlarging [of] the original limitation period ... is part of the substantive remedy\u201d); <em>Smith v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>266 Md. 52, 58, 291 A.2d 452, 456 (1972) (similar).

That notwithstanding, even if we were to hold that the statute is not procedural or remedial\u2014thus engaging the presumption of prospectivity\u2014we think that recourse to the legislative history of \u00a7 5-117 does not dictate a different result. Petitioner argues that \u201d[w]here two competing, reasonable interpretations exist, the uncodified section cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>possibly be a clear expression of legislative intent in favor of retroactive application.\u201d Yet, we have held for over a century-and-a-half that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1k2\">It must be admitted, that by construction, if it can be avoided, no statute should have a retrospect anterior to the time of its commencement. This principle is founded on the supposition that laws are intended to be prospective only. But when a statute, <em>either by explicit provision or necessary implication, is retroactive, </em>there is no room for construction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Grinder v. Nelson, 9 </em>Gill 299, 303 (1850) (quoting <em>Goshen v. Stonington, </em>4 Conn. 209 (Conn. 1822)) (emphasis added). Invocation of the phrase \"or necessary implication\u201d\u2014as an alternative to the statute\u2019s \u201cexplicit provision\u201d\u2014suggests that the express language of a statute is not the only source from which we may glean the requisite clear expression of legislative intent regarding retrospective application. Accordingly, merely because the plain language of a legislative enactment is ambiguous as to retrospectivity\u2014which we think may be said fairly of Section 2 of Senate Bill 68\u2014does not mean that we may not glean the necessary \u201cclear expression\u201d of legislative intent that an enactment be applied retrospectively. <em>See Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. River-dale Heights Volunteer Fire Co., Inc., </em>308 Md. 556, 561, 520 A.2d 1319, 1322 (1987). Therefore, recourse to legislative history to assist in ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent by necessary implication, vis \u00e1 vis retrospective application, is entirely acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">As noted <em>supra, </em>the First Reading of Senate Bill 68, by providing that the statute would \"apply to any action commenced on or after October 1, 2003, including any action that would have been barred by the application of the [original limitations period],\u201d would have provided for full retrospectivity. For the next piece of the puzzle, we consider that Assistant Attorney General Rowe advised Senator Frosh that \"in the absence of a specific provision, the statute could be interpreted to have prospective effect, and that [that] most likely would mean that it would apply only to causes of action based on abuse occurring after the effective date.\u201d Rowe Letter, at 5. Although because, as explained <em>supra, </em>we hold that \u00a7 5-117 is procedural and remedial in nature and thus presumed to be retrospective\u2014thus disagreeing with Ms. Rowe\u2019s advice\u2014apparently in reliance on Ms. Rowe's advice, the Legislature, nevertheless, decided to keep a modified version of Section 2 (the retrospectivity provision) in the Third Reading of Senate Bill 68. If the Legislature intended for the Bill to apply prospectively only, why would it, armed with advice that becoming silent on the issue of retrospectivity would render the legislation presumed prospective, retain a retrospectivity clause? <em>See Roe, </em>193 Md.App. at 565, 998 A.2d at 387. To us, it appears abundantly clear from this legislative \"context,\u201d <em>see Kim, </em>376 Md. at 290, 829 A.2d at 619 (\"Context becomes important.\u201d), that retaining a modified version of the retrospectivity clause evinces a legislative intent that the statute be applied, as the Court of Special Appeals termed it, \u201cpartially retroactively.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
