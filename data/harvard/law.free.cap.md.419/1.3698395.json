Two factors make this case uncommonly hard\u2014(1) the lack of progress towards parent-child reunification despite significant efforts by the Department of Social Services <em>combined </em>with cooperation from the parent, and (2) the apparent impact of our governmental financial downturn on the availability of services for those who are developmentally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Petitioner, Ms. B., and Mr. T.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are the biological parents of Shirley B., Davon B., Jordan B., and Cedric B. (collectively \u201cthe Children\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2005, the Children were referred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) following reports of neglect and sexual abuse. A subsequent psychological evaluation revealed that Ms. B. was cognitively impaired, and it was observed that the Children had special needs of their own. Perhaps due to her cognitive limitations, Ms. B. was largely unresponsive to the Department\u2019s assistance and she allowed vital benefits to lapse. She also permitted unauthorized adults to move into her home and exposed the Children to drug use and sexual activity. Finally, a violent altercation between Ms. B., Mr. T., and Shirley prompted the Department to remove the Children from Ms. B.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">As the Children sat in foster care, the Department continued to offer services to Ms. B. in the hopes that she would be able to develop the parenting skills necessary for reunification with her Children. In addition to general parenting classes, the Department attempted to connect Ms. B. with services specifically tailored to meet her special needs through various State agencies and outside institutions. Yet, due to economic constraints, funding for these services was non-existent, leaving Ms. B. ineligible to receive them. The Department remained determined, however, and it continued to search in vain for other sources of funding or funded services.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">By the Children\u2019s 2009 permanency plan hearing, the funding and services had not materialized. At this time, the Children had been in foster care for 28 months, and there was no end in sight. The Children\u2019s case worker believed that it was not in the Children\u2019s best interests to be returned to Ms. B., and was unsure whether they could ever be safe in Ms. B.\u2019s care. At the hearing\u2019s conclusion, the juvenile court, concerned with the Children\u2019s welfare and need for stability, changed the goal of the Children\u2019s permanency plans from reunification to adoption. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed that decision, and Ms. B. appealed to this Court so that we might consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">(1) Does the Department of Social Services satisfy the statutory requirement that it must make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan of reunification where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>parent was referred to services pertaining to specific impediments to reunification, but never received those services due to lack of funding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">(2) Where Petitioner had concededly followed through with the Department\u2019s referrals to services identified by the juvenile court as \u201ccritical\u201d for efforts at reunification with her children, but did not receive those services solely because of a lack of funding, did the Department satisfy its statutory obligation to make reasonable efforts toward reunification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">(8) Did the juvenile court abuse its discretion when it changed the permanency plans for the four children from reunification to adoption?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">We shall hold that the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement is case-specific, and must be considered in light of the services at the Department\u2019s disposal. Here, the juvenile court did not clearly err when it found that the Department had diligently pursued available avenues to reunification. Furthermore, Ms. B.\u2019s limitations prevented her from providing a safe home for her children in the foreseeable future; thus, the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that changing the Children\u2019s permanency plans was in their best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">A. CINA Determinations</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The four children in this case were referred to the Department in June 2005 following allegations of neglect. At that time, there was no food in the home, the children were dirty, and the school-aged children were not attending school regularly. The Department also had to remove Ms. B\u2019s older son, Dion, from the home following concerns that he had sexually assaulted his younger siblings. It assisted Ms. B and the Children in moving to an emergency shelter placement, and provided them with Family Preservation Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Thereafter, the Department provided several types of assistance to Ms. B and the Children, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u2022 securing and moving mother and children into transitional housing,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">\u2022 providing furniture for the home,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">\u2022 securing food stamps and providing emergency food services even after food stamps were awarded,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u2022 transporting mother to medical appointments,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">\u2022 providing in-home parenting instruction,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u2022 referring Ms. B for vocational training at the Department of Rehabilitative Services (\u201cDORS\u201d), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">\u2022 arranging individual and family counseling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">The Department also arranged and paid for a psychological evaluation of Ms. B. That evaluation was conducted by Dr. Sybil Smith-Gray, who determined that Ms. B\u2019s \u201ccognitive functioning indicates her problem solving abilities to be in the mildly retarded range[.]\u201d Smith-Gray observed that these limitations resulted in an \u201caffect driven\u201d problem-solving approach, meaning that Ms. B. relies \u201cheavily upon her feelings in arriving at conclusions and making decisions about any given situation because she has difficulty in carefully thinking through possible solutions.\u201d Smith-Gray opined that Ms. B.\u2019s \u201ccognitive limitations are capable of impinging upon her ability to sustain adequate care for her children over time without external support and intervention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">According to the Department, Ms. B was \u201clargely unresponsive\u201d to its initial efforts. She never attended DORS or counseling, and she let her Temporary Cash Assistance (\u201cTCA\u201d) benefits lapse. She also allowed unauthorized adults to move into her home and exposed the Children to drug use and sexual activity. The Children\u2019s school reported that the Children would attend class</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-13\">with an obscene body odor, dirty clothes, and roaches crawling out of their book bags.... [Jordan and Davon\u2019s] behavior was out of control with their peers. All- of the children appear to have speech impairments that Ms. B. refused to address, as well as taking the children for their annual physicals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The final straw for the Department came on February 4, 2007, when Ms. B.\u2019s oldest daughter, Shirley, attempted to use a knife to intervene in a fight between her mother and Mr. T. For the Children\u2019s safety, the Department removed the Children and placed them in emergency shelter care. Two days later, a juvenile court authorized the continuation of shelter care placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">One month after the Children were removed from their mother, the juvenile court determined that Shirley was a Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found that the \u201chome [was] chaotic with domestic violence, lack of sexual boundaries and drug use by several people that are there most of the time including her father.\u201d Indeed, Shirley admitted that her father and his siblings had used drugs in her presence. Moreover, the court recognized that Ms. B. \u201cis cognitively limited[,]\u201d and the \u201cservices DSS recommended [to Ms. B.] were available and in place but not used with the exception of the Section 8 housing voucher.\u201d The court later made the same findings with regard to Davon, Jordan, and Cedric, and also designated them as CINA. At this time, the permanency plans for all four children were designed for reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">B. December 2008 Permanency Plan Review Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">For approximately the next two years, the Department crafted services for Ms. B. and Mr. T. aimed at reunification. It referred Mr. T. to substance abuse treatment after he admitted to a 20-year crack cocaine habit and his urine tested positive for cocaine at the time the Children were removed from their parent\u2019s care. He was also advised to seek counseling for domestic violence. Mr. T., however, \u201c[did] not follow[ ] through\u201d with any of these referrals. Similarly, Ms. B. was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>offered an intervention program for victims of domestic violence, but she never made herself available for any such meetings despite the program administrator\u2019s willingness to work around her schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In June 2008, the parents\u2019 lack of progress prompted a juvenile master to recommend that the Children\u2019s permanency plans be changed from reunification with Ms. B. to adoption. The master observed that, despite the Department\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d efforts, Ms. B. \u201chad not made much movement towards reunification!!.]\u201d Both parents filed exceptions to this ruling, and on December 2, 2008, the juvenile court held a <em>de novo </em>review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">At the hearing, Natalie Gimperling, a Department social worker assigned to the case, testified that all four children were making progress and were receiving the help they needed to encourage their educational and personal development. Regarding Ms. B., Gimperling believed that Ms. B.\u2019s primary barrier to reunification was her cognitive limitations. Gimperling also testified that when she spoke with Mr. T., he informed her that he had been living with the Ms. B \u201cthe whole time[,]\u201d a direct violation of an earlier court order that stated he could not be present at any of Ms. B.\u2019s unsupervised visits with the Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Despite agreeing with Gimperling\u2019s opinion that it was not in the best interests of the Children to return to Ms. B., the juvenile court sustained the exceptions and determined that the goal of the permanency plan should continue as reunification. The court believed that it was \u201csignificant that none of the evaluations ... or the reports absolutely stated that the mother would not be able to parent.\u201d The court did find, however, that \u201cthe [Department [had], indeed, made reasonable efforts towards achieving reunification\u201d and that Ms. B. \u201cneeds specialized parenting classes that are only available through the Developmental Disabilities Administration [\u201cDDA\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] or Melwood[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] in light of her diagnosis and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>special needs of each child.\u201d The court also warned that though it supported reunification, its decision did \u201cnot necessarily mean that once services [were] provided and [were] in place that the [c]ourt would be satisfied that reunification [was] viable.\u201d The juvenile judge simply believed that the \u201cmother need[ed] a chance, and [that time was] not the time to cut off that chance\u201d to reunify.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">C. The Children\u2019s Neuropsychological Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In an effort to aid its permanency planning, the Department engaged clinical neuropsychologist James E. Lewis to evaluate Ms. B. and the Children. In April 2009, Lewis interviewed the Children, who all graphically recalled episodes of violence and inappropriate behavior they had witnessed and the abuse they suffered while residing with Ms. B. and Mr. T. According to Jordan, Mr. T. would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">slap our mommy in the arm and face [and] punch her in the stomach and face, too. He hit our mommy so hard he knocked her down ... I was scared and I\u2019d hide under the bed.... Our dad would hit all of us with his hand or a big fat belt ... he beat us on our butts and legs with the belt ... if our mom tried to stop him, he\u2019d hurt her, too ... he\u2019d drink a lot of beer out of these big cans and then get crazy ... when he was acting crazy, he would be yelling and cussing and calling everybody names ... sometimes the police came ... I think they locked my daddy up once ... I was glad because he was a bad boy all the time ... I think he went to jail because he was such a bad boy to all of us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\">Davon recalled that Mr. T.\u2019s beatings would \u201cleave big red marks [on the Children] and [that he would tell them] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>[they] shouldn\u2019t tell at school what he did or he would beat [them] up worse.\u201d Lewis reported that Davon, Jordan, and Cedric all suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The troubles at home perhaps fell the most heavily on Shirley, who, at the age of eleven, had assumed the \u201cgrossly inappropriate role of mothering her own mother and her younger siblings.\u201d Shirley explained that she would \u201ctake care of [her] little brothers, like getting them dressed and trying to remind them about their lunches and their books to go to school[,]\u201d and that she would \u201ceven take care of our mom[.]\u201d She also described being raped by her older brother, Dion, at her mother\u2019s house:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">[H]e\u2019d have me back in this room but he\u2019d have his hand over my mouth ... he\u2019d push his pee pee into my private area ... other times, he\u2019d touch my private area with his hand. I\u2019ve had really bad dreams and nightmares about all of this ... and I feel bad even saying what happened, because people think it was my mom\u2019s fault for not taking better care of us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Moreover, like her siblings, Shirley was a witness to and a victim of Mr. T.\u2019s violence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201c[0]ur dad ... hurt our mom really bad ... he\u2019d hit her with his fists and knock her down ... I remember hearing that the police had come ... I think they took him off to jail ... but then our mom would let him come back again and hurt us all over again ... including her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Following the interview, Lewis concluded that Shirley suffers from Depressive Disorder as well as \u201ca Severe and Unresolved PTSD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">D. June 2009 Review Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Two months after Dr. Lewis\u2019s interviews, the juvenile court held another review hearing. Prior to the hearing, Ms. B. moved to exclude Dr. Lewis\u2019s report with regard to her assessment, citing patient-psychologist privilege. The juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>court granted the motion, and a redacted copy of the report was received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">At the hearing, Gimperling testified as the sole witness, and she chronicled the Department\u2019s efforts since the previous hearing to rehabilitate Ms. B. so that she could be reunited with the Children. Specifically, Gimperling had been in contact with DORS so that Ms. B. could receive vocational training from Melwood.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet, \u201cbecause of the funding circumstances right now between the State and [DORS], they\u2019re not referring clients to [Melwood] at this time because [Melwood] does not have the funding to provide them with that vocational training service.\u201d Gimperling encountered the same problem when she contacted the DDA, another resource that could fund Ms. B.\u2019s Melwood services. Even though the DDA did accept Ms. B. and placed her on its waiting list for funds, it repeatedly told Gimperling that it was unsure when Ms. B. would be eligible for services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gimperling also contacted the Community Connections agency \u201cto get some ideas as to [whether there were] other pots of money that could be drawn off of to somehow provide her with services.\u201d She learned of a couple thousand dollars in rolling access funds, but by January, those funds had already been exhausted for that funding year. As there was \u201cno money to have any assessments done by either a psychiatrist or a psychologist from DDA, [Gimperling] then made the referral to Dr. Lewis.\u201d Gimperling had also been communicating with the Arc of Prince George\u2019s County, an organization that offers a support group for parents who have developmental disabilities and who have children with developmental disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>In addition to Gimperling\u2019s attempts to connect Ms. B. with services from the DDA, Melwood, and the Arc, the Department assisted Ms. B. with her daily living. After Ms. B. allowed her Medical Assistance lapse, Gimperling helped her to reactivate it. Ms. B. also suffered from high blood pressure and high blood sugar, and she allowed these medical conditions to go untreated. Upon learning of this, a Department case associate took Ms. B. to an urgent medical care facility, which later transferred Ms. B. to the hospital after she complained of chest pains. The case associate stayed with Ms. B. during her entire hospital visit, helped her to get medicine afterwards, and then took her home. The case associate also scheduled Ms. B.\u2019s gynecological and dental exams and transported her to her medical appointments. Moreover, the Department took Ms. B. to and from all of the Children\u2019s educational appointments, and caseworkers have \u201cbeen there with her and helped to try and explain the [C]hildren\u2019s educational status.\u201d Department workers have also transported Ms. B. \u201cfor all of the family visits that occur at the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Later in the hearing, Gimperling recounted her observations of Ms. B.\u2019s interactions with the Children. During the supervised visits, Gimperling would bring in games or prepare an activity for Ms. B. and the Children to complete together, but it was always a challenge to keep each of them focused on the activity at hand. Gimperling also noticed that Ms. B. focused her aggression on Davon. A case associate reported seeing Ms. B. strike Davon on multiple occasions, and Gimperling observed that Ms. B. would keep food from Davon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Food is brought in, like candy and different cookies and treats. [Ms. B.] usually primarily starts with Shirley, favoring Shirley first, and then will distribute. And if Davon is wanting to have something somebody else has, rather than letting them maybe [share], she will just immediately say, no, Davon, you can\u2019t have it. And if he attempts to then get it, she will hit him, and she yelled at him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Gimperling instructed Ms. B. on how to handle her children in a stressful situation, but Ms. B. still continued to strike Davon. Regarding the unsupervised visits between Shirley and Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>B., Shirley had reported that she would use her own allowance money to purchase groceries for Ms. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Gimperling also testified that the children were thriving in their current placements. Shirley had made \u201cextreme progress\u201d in her current foster home and was performing \u201cmuch better in school\u201d because she has \u201ca very consistent schedule in terms of she knows what to expect on a daily basis.\u201d Davon, Jordan, and Cedric were also doing well in their foster placements, and there was potential for those placements to become adoptive resources for them. When asked what efforts the Department could make to reunify the Children with Ms. B. within the next year, Gimperling responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we could do to make [reunification] a safe situation where all the kids would flourish as they are right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the juvenile court changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption. The court emphasized that it was not reconsidering its decision from the December hearing, but rather making a decision based upon the lack of progress since the time of that hearing. The court found that it was not in the Children\u2019s best interests to be reunited with Ms. B. because she had not received the necessary educational training and she did not reside in a home that would accommodate the Children. It recognized that Ms. B. had cooperated with the Department, but it still did not believe that the Children could be safe in her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Regarding the Department\u2019s efforts, the court explained that the Department\u2019s responsibilities did \u201cnot include making administrative decisions for other agencies charged with specific responsibilities.\u201d The court did not think that it was \u201cappropriate in any of these instances to order the [Department] to finance services that are within the purview of other agencies, such as the [DDA] or [DORS].\u201d Against this backdrop, the court found that, since the December hearing, the Department</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">ha[d] done more [with regard to linking Ms. B. with services consistent with her abilities.] The Department is at the mercy of agencies that lack necessary funding to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>services that are critical to informing this Court as well as the parties as to the process for [Ms. B.] to acquire skills that are necessary to meet the special needs of Cedric, D[a]von, Jordan and Shirley. Those are special educational needs, as well as developmental needs. The [c]ourt finds that mother requires services that will allow her to have assistance that will permit her to attend to those needs. The evidence is that mother requires hands\u2014on assistance of the Department to meet her very own personal needs. And the [cjourt finds that mother is not able to access or to negotiate the system that\u2019s necessary to provide for the safety of the four children, or to attend to their developmental and educational needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">[W]e don\u2019t know how much time it would take for funding to become available to the agencies. We know that now we\u2019re 28 months into the life of the children with the Department!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">The [c]ourt finds that the Department globally\u2014the Department has made reasonable efforts to achieve the plan [for] reunification by referring mother to the [DDA] and [DORS], assisting in her preparation of the application and a submission in achieving placement of mother on a second tier waiting list\u2014a waiting list at the second tier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">The Department has made reasonable efforts by attempting to ... determine when mother may be able to receive services, and those efforts have met with an inability of the agency to give a date when services might be available. The Department\u2019s efforts have included determining when mother might be able to be placed with [Melwood], only to find that ... [Melwood] is no longer receiving\u2014taking clients of [DORS].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">The Department\u2019s reasonable efforts included contacting the Community Connections Agency to determine if other funds were available for the services that were not ... readily accessible through the [DDA] and [DORS]. And funds that might have been available had been exhausted by January of 2009, within a ... relatively short period of time after the parties were before the [c]ourt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The Department\u2019s reasonable efforts included obtaining a necessary neuro-psychological evaluation in an effort to provide an evaluation that would have otherwise been funded by these other sources, albeit the evaluation that this Court did not review. The Department\u2019s efforts included obtaining a ... family clinical interview with regard to the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">The Department\u2019s reasonable efforts included discussing with mother medical issues, assisting her in reactivating her medical assistance ... arranging for and transporting for medical appointments, including a gynecological examination, as well as an examination to address issues of high blood pressure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">The Department\u2019s reasonable efforts [have] included transportation of mother to educational meetings, appointments affecting the minor children, and assisting her in understanding what [is] occurring during those sessions, including assisting her with questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">The Department\u2019s efforts have included transporting mother to visits with the children. The element of transporting mother and assisting with appointments and scheduling is indicative and representative of the [c]ourt\u2019s concerns about mother\u2019s inability to access or to navigate systems that are more complex with regard to ... addressing the educational and developmental needs of each of the [children].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">And the [c]ourt finds that it\u2019s in the [Children\u2019s] best interest [to change] each of [their] permanency [plans to] adoption. The [c]ourt finds that it continues to be in the interest of each of the [Children] that the Department continue at a minimum to follow up on referrals to the [DDA] and [DORS]. And the [c]ourt\u2014the context of that is that each of the children have a strong b[o]nd to their mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">Who knows? Next month the funding could become available. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen, but (indiscernible) we\u2019re at the bottom of it all. But at the same time if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>is\u2014-we know the process. There\u2019s a long road from filing a petition for guardianship and the granting of the guardianship. We know and the [c]ourt believes that it\u2019s going to be in the best interest of these children if at all possible that there would be continued visitation\u2014that there be a continued contact with mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Ms. B. timely appealed the juvenile court\u2019s decision on the grounds that the Department failed to make reasonable efforts toward reunification because Ms. B. never received any specialized parenting services. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the lower court\u2019s finding that the Department had made reasonable efforts and held that the court did not abuse its discretion by changing the permanency plan to adoption. <em>See In re Shirley B., </em>191 Md.App. 678, 719, 993 A.2d 675, 699 (2010). This Court then granted Ms. B\u2019s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AXS\">A.

This is because \u201cwe have recognized that parents have a fundamental, Constitutionally-based right to raise their children free from undue and unwarranted interference on the part of the State, including its courts.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Rashawn H. and Tyrese H., </em>402 Md. 477, 495, 937 A.2d 177, 188 (2007).

The parental right is not absolute, however. The presumption that protects it may be rebutted upon a showing either that the parent is \u201cunfit\u201d or that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist which would make continued custody with the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-7\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, this Court has often recognized that, absent compelling circumstances to the contrary, the plan should be to work towards reunification as it is presumed that \u201cit is in the best interest of the children to remain in the care and custody of their [biological] parent[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495, 937 A.2d at 188. Nevertheless, that course must be \u201cconsistent with the best interests of the child[.]\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-823(e)(l)(i). In other words, \u201cwhere the fundamental right of parents to raise their children stands in the starkest contrast to the State\u2019s effort to protect those children from unacceptable neglect or abuse, the best interest of the child remains the ultimate governing standard.\u201d <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 495, 937 A.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Additionally, where, as here, there is a proven history of abuse or neglect, \u201cthe proper issue before the hearing judge [is] whether there was sufficient evidence that further abuse or neglect [is] unlikely.\u201d <em>Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 593, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>819 A.2d at 1055. <em>See also </em>FL \u00a7 9-101(b) (\u201cUnless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by [the parent], the court shall deny custody or visitation rights to that party[.]\u201d). The burden of proof rests upon the parent to show that the past neglect or abuse will not be repeated. <em>See Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 587, 819 A.2d at 1052 (\u201cThe burden is on the parent previously having been found to have abused or neglected his or her child to adduce evidence and persuade the court to make the requisite finding under [Section] 9-101(b).\u201d).

The Extent of \u201cReasonable Efforts\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The thrust of Ms. B.\u2019s argument is that the Department does not satisfy its \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement if it merely refers a parent to services necessary for reunification, when that parent, \u201cthrough no fault of her own[,] cannot avail herself of those services[.]\u201d The Department and counsel for Shirley counter, arguing that the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s efforts must be considered in light of the limitations on its and other related governmental resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The Court of Special Appeals opinion in <em>In re James G., </em>178 Md.App. 543, 943 A.2d 53 (2008), tracked, in great detail, the evolution of the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement. As Judge Hollander explained, the \u201c \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 requirement ... has its genesis in federal law, with the enactment of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (\u201cAACWA\u201d)[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 943 A.2d at 69. The AACWA \u201cwas designed with a focus on family preservation and reunification. [It] sought to end the stagnation [of] keeping children in foster homes by requiring states to make reasonable efforts to reunite families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 943 A.2d at 70 <em>(quoting </em>Kathleen S. Bean, <em>Reasonable Efforts: What State Courts Think, </em>36 U. Tol. L.Rev. 321, 325 (2005)). Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>AACWA, \u201creasonable efforts quite simply had to do with the quality of preservation services given before foster care placement and the quality of reunification services provided during foster care placement.\u201d Will L. Crossley, <em>Defining Reasonable Efforts: Demystifying the State\u2019s Burden under Federal Child Protection Legislation, </em>12 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 259, 272 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Although the AACWA initially fulfilled its goal of decreasing the number of children left to languish in \u201cfoster care drift,\u201d the reverse began to occur in the late 1980s. <em>See </em>Bean, 36 U. Tol. L.Rev. at 325-26. Many believed the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement was to blame. <em>Id. </em>at 326. The criticism included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">charges that children were still in foster homes too long. The charge was that they lingered now, not because of agency inaction, but because agencies were engaged in excessive efforts to repair hopelessly dysfunctional families. Instead of the permanency intended by the federal reasonable efforts clause, impermanency resulted. Perhaps of even greater concern, however, was the perception that children were being reunited with parents when it was not safe to do so in the name of reasonable efforts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). In response, Congress amended the AACWA by enacting the Adoption and Safe Families Act (\u201cASFA\u201d) in 1997. <em>See </em>Bean, 36 U. Tol. L.Rev. at 325-26. While it did not eliminate the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d mandate, Congress did narrow it by making the health and safety of the child the \u201cparamount\u201d consideration when \u201cdetermining reasonable efforts to be made ... and in making such reasonable efforts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Despite the problematic history of the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d mandate, the term itself remains undefined under federal law. <em>See James G., </em>178 Md.App. at 578, 943 A.2d at 73. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with regard to ASFA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services provided the following explanation for its rejection of a clear definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>During our consultation with the field, some recommended that we define reasonable efforts in implementing the ASF A. We do not intend to define \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d To do so would be a direct contradiction of the intent of the law. The statute requires that reasonable efforts determinations be made on a case-by-case basis. We think any regulatory definition would either limit the courts\u2019 ability to make determinations on a case-by-case basis or be so broad as to be ineffective. In the absence of a definition, courts may entertain actions such as the following in determining whether reasonable efforts were made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u2022 Was the service plan customized to the individual needs of the family or was it a standard package of services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u2022 Did the agency provide services to ameliorate factors present in the child or parent, i.e., physical, emotional, or psychological, that would inhibit a parent\u2019s ability to maintain the child safely at home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u2022 Do limitations exist with respect to service availability, including transportation issues? If so, what efforts did the agency undertake to overcome these obstacles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">... Typically, State child welfare agencies and the courts encounter cases in which it is appropriate to make reasonable efforts to prevent a child\u2019s removal from home or to reunify the family. Quite frequently, though, States are faced with circumstances in which it is unclear how much effort is reasonable. At the initial stage of and throughout its involvement with a family, the child welfare agency assesses the family\u2019s needs and circumstances. The State agency should make reasonable efforts to prevent the child\u2019s removal from home or to reunify the family commensurate with the assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">63 F.R. 50058, 50073 (1998) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The relevant Maryland statutes contain language \u201cnearly identical to the reasonable efforts provision of ASF A, [and the General Assembly has] done little else legislatively to define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>reasonable efforts.\u201d Crossley, 12 B.U. Pub. Int\u2019l L.J. at 295. Thus, it is not surprising that the Court of Special Appeals considered Maryland\u2019s definition of \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to be \u201camorphous[,3\u201d without any \u201cbright line rule to apply to the \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 determination!;, meaning that] each case must be decided based on its unique circumstances.\u201d <em>Shirley, </em>191 Md.App. at 710-11, 993 A.2d at 694. The Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article defines \u201creasonable efforts\u201d as \u201cefforts that are reasonably likely to achieve the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3-801(b)(l) and (2) of this subtitle.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-801(v).

In the seminal case, <em>Rashawn, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">poverty, of itself, can never justify the termination of parental rights.... Nor will homelessness, alone, or physical, mental or emotional disability, alone, justify such termination .... [W]hat the statute appropriately looks to is whether the parent is, or within a reasonable time will be, able to care for the child in a way that does not endanger the child\u2019s welfare.

In this vein, we directed the Department to actively pursue services aimed at reunification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">The statute does not permit the State to leave parents in need adrift and then take away their children. The court is required to consider the timeliness, nature, and extent of the services offered by DSS or other support agencies ... and whether additional services would be likely to bring about a sufficient and lasting parental adjustment that would allow the child to be returned to the parent. Implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>in that requirement is that a reasonable level of those services, designed to address both the root causes and the effect of the problem, must be offered!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 500, 937 A.2d at 191. Yet, we also recognized that there are limits to what the Department is required to do:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">The State is not obliged to find employment for the parent, to find and pay for permanent and suitable housing for the family, to bring the parent out of poverty, or to cure or ameliorate any disability that prevents the parent from being able to care for the child. It must provide reasonable assistance in helping the parent to achieve those goals, but its duty to protect the health and safety of the children is not lessened and cannot be cast aside if the parent, despite that assistance, remains unable or unwilling to provide appropriate care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">The State is not required to allow children to live ... in temporary shelters ... or to grow up in permanent chaos and instability, bouncing from one foster home to another until they reach eighteen and are pushed onto the streets as adults, because their parents, even with reasonable assistance from DSS, continue to exhibit an inability or unwillingness to provide minimally acceptable shelter, sustenance, and support for them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 500-01, 937 A.2d at 191 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Here, perhaps more so than any of our previous CINA cases, the record demonstrates that economic considerations have shaped the boundaries of the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts. As the juvenile court recognized, the Department was \u201cat the mercy of agencies that lackfed] necessary funding to provide services\u201d that the court deemed potentially helpful to Ms. B. In situations such as this, \u201cthe State\u2019s ability to provide adequate services is constrained by its staff and dollar limitations!;] therefore, the State must put forth reasonable efforts given its available staff and financial resources to maintain the legal bond between parent and child.\u201d <em>In re Jonathan T., </em>148 N.H. 296, 808 A.2d 82, 88 (2002) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). <em>See also </em>COMAR 07.02.11.14(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(2011) (The Department shall provide, \u201c[t]o the extent that funds and other resources are available, a range of services that will facilitate or maintain successful reunification of the child[.]\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, \u201creunification efforts must be judged within the context of the resources available to the agency, with the agency receiving the benefit of the doubt when resources are limited.\u201d Bean, 36 U. Tol. L.Rev. at 365. <em>See also In re Giorgianna II, </em>205 S.W.3d 508, 519 (Tenn.App. 2006) (\u201cThe factors that courts use to determine the reasonableness of the Department\u2019s efforts include ... the resources available to the Department!.]\u201d). In short, a juvenile court must be cognizant of the availability of services when determining whether the Department\u2019s efforts have been reasonable. <em>See In the Interest of C.S., </em>516 N.W.2d 851, 858 (Iowa 1994) (\u201cTo allow the juvenile court to order placements without regard for funding limitations would circumvent the appropriations process of the legislature and the budgetary process of the Department.\u201d). Indeed, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services instructs courts to consider whether \u201climitations exist with respect to service availability\u201d when examining reasonableness. 63 F.R. 50073.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">To be sure, the Department must make a good faith attempt at connecting a parent with services necessary for reunification. In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 &amp; J9711031, </em>368 Md. 666, 682, 796 A.2d 778, 787 (2002) <em>(\u201cCase 36 </em>\u201d), we reversed a juvenile court\u2019s order terminating the parental rights of a mentally-disabled father because the Department could not show that it had \u201coffered any specialized services designed to be particularly helpful to a parent\u201d with such cognitive limitations. For example, the Department failed to utilize services from the Arc and the DDA, \u201ceven though it was relying in its drive toward termination on the fact that in the opinion of its [social] workers, petitioner was disabled by reason of mental impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 682-83, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>796 A.2d at 787-88. This was particularly unsettling because the \u201cservices [were readily] available\u201d and the father had proven to be willing and eager to work toward reunification. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 700, 796 A.2d at 787, 798. In sharp contrast, as we detail later, those services were not available here, despite extensive efforts by the Department to obtain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Similarly, in <em>James G., </em>the juvenile court erred by changing a child\u2019s permanency plan from reunification to relative placement when the Department made only a single referral in an effort to combat the parental obstacles to reunification. <em>James, </em>178 Md.App. at 599, 943 A.2d at 85. A Department case worker had testified that the only impediments to reuniting father with son was the father\u2019s lack of stable employment and lack of housing, and the Department claimed that it could not provide housing assistance until the father was employed. <em>Id. </em>Yet, \u201cthe only effort the Department made to address [the father\u2019s] unemployment was a single referral to an organization that could not address [the father\u2019s] employment needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The juvenile court concluded that \u201c[c]ertainly, more could have been done to help [the father] get a job, which would in turn have helped with getting housingf,]\u201d but it agreed with the Department that a change in the permanency plan was both \u201cpracticable and realistic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 943 A.2d at 65. The Court of Special Appeals, on the other hand, considered the Department\u2019s efforts to be \u201cshameful and unacceptable\u201d because the fruitlessness of this one referral created a domino effect that led to the decision not to reunify parent and child. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 943 A.2d at 86. It held that the Department had not made \u201creasonable efforts\u201d toward reunification and, accordingly, reversed the juvenile court\u2019s order changing the son\u2019s permanency plan. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 943 A.2d at 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>An examination of these two cases provides some glaring distinctions from the one at hand. First, in both <em>Case </em>36 and <em>James </em>there was no history of child abuse or willful neglect, <em>see Case 36, </em>368 Md. at 688, 796 A.2d at 791 and <em>James, </em>178 Md.App. at 565, 943 A.2d at 65. Here, there are well-documented instances of physical and sexual abuse, as well as extreme neglect. Moreover, the number of services readily available to the Department here was severely limited by a general dearth of financial resources. This is in contrast with the circumstances in <em>Case 36, </em>where we held that the Department \u201chad at its disposition better suited services for petitioner\u201d than those which it had offered, 368 Md. at 701, 796 A.2d at 798, and in <em>James, </em>where the juvenile court found that Department could have done more, 178 Md.App. at 564, 943 A.2d at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Here, the juvenile court understood that the Department was in a bind when it came to providing appropriate services for Ms. B., and that it was inappropriate for the court to \u201corder the Department to finance services that are within the purview of other agencies[.]\u201d Despite these financial obstacles, however, the Department\u2019s efforts to reunify Ms. B. with her children, including its assistance with her daily living, were legion. As enumerated in the court\u2019s Order of Commitment, these efforts included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">a. referring Mother to the DDA and DORS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">b. assisting in Mother\u2019s preparation of the application for services and its submissions and achieving placement of Mother on a waiting list (second tier);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">c. attempting to determine when Mother might be able to receive services (however, efforts did not meet with success in determining when the services might be available);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">d. determining when Mother might be able to be placed with Melwood, only to find that, although an assessment was done, Melwood has lost the assessment and Melwood is no longer accepting clients of DORS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">e. contacting the Community Connections Agency to determine if other funds were available for the services that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>were not readily accessible through DDA and DORS and funds that might have been available after the December review in this case had been exhausted by January, 2009;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">f. funding and obtaining a necessary neuropsychological evaluation of Mother in an effort to provide an evaluation that would have been provided by other sources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">g. obtaining a family clinical interview with regard to [Shirley] and her siblings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">h. discussing with Mother her medical issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">i. assisting Mother in reactivating her medical assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">j. arranging for and transporting Mother for medical appointments, including a gynecological examination, as well as an examination to address issues of high blood pressure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">k. transporting Mother to educational meeting and appointments affecting [Shirley] and assisting Mother in understanding what was occurring and assisting her in questioning;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">l. transporting Mother to visits with [Shirley] and her siblings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">m. providing for management of [Shirley\u2019s] medication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">n. attending meetings concerning and following the progress of [Shirley\u2019s] Individualized Education Program; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\">o. providing necessary therapy and referring [Shirley] to Pathfinders for specialized therapy to help her work through trauma issues[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">This is an extensive list, and it is clear that the Department did not sit on its hands and wait for the necessary services to materialize. Indeed, the crux of Ms. B.\u2019s argument is not that the Department, itself, could have done more, but that she was unable to avail herself of the requisite services through no fault of her own. She attempts to analogize this situation to the revocation of probation where the failure to comply was not the fault of the probationer. This Court has held that \u201cordinarily probation may not be revoked if the probationer proves that his failure to comply was not willful but rather resulted from factors beyond his control and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>through no fault of his own.\u201d <em>Bailey v. State, </em>327 Md. 689, 695, 612 A.2d 288, 291 (1992) (emphasis omitted). Yet, as the Department correctly explains, the purpose of a CI\u00d1A case is to protect the child, not to punish the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Certainly, Ms. B.\u2019s situation is a tragic one, with which we sympathize, but our sentiment cannot distract us from the relevant statutory criteria. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5\u2014525(f) (\u201cIn developing a permanency plan for a child ..., the local department shall give primary consideration to the best interests of the child[.]\u201d). In this instance, we must \u201cbalance\u201d Ms. B.\u2019s right to raise her children against the State\u2019s right \u201cto protect children, who cannot protect themselves, from abuse and neglect.\u201d <em>Rashawn, </em>402 Md. at 497, 937 A.2d at 189. As Shirley described, Ms. B. repeatedly invited the violence that wreaked havoc on their lives back into her home, in the form of Mr. T.: \u201c[0]ur dad ... hurt our mom really bad ... but then our mom would let him come back again and hurt us all over again ... including her.\u201d Even the Department\u2019s removal of the Children from her care did not prevent Ms. B. from continuously placing them in harm\u2019s way, as Gimperling later discovered when Mr. T. informed her that, during the Children\u2019s home visits, he had been living with the Ms. B \u201cthe whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Here, we must be particularly cautious not to presumptively favor reunification because of the severe neglect and emotional trauma suffered by the Children in Ms. B.\u2019s home. <em>See In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 570, 819 A.2d at 1041 <em>(quoting In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705-06, 782 A.2d 332, 342-43 (2001)) (\u201cThat which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent.\u201d); <em>see also </em>FL \u00a7 9-101(b) (\u201cUnless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by [the parent], the court shall deny custody or visitation rights to that party[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We agree with the juvenile court that the Department\u2019s efforts were diligent and made in good faith. As the CSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>observed, the Department did not throw up its hands in defeat when presented with multiple monetary barriers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">[The Department] referred Ms. B. to parenting classes with the Family Tree. It arranged, and paid for, individual mental health therapy at Community Counseling and Mentoring, with therapist Debbie Austin, to address Ms. B.\u2019s mental health needs and parenting skills. The Department then sought more specific services for Ms. B. due to her cognitive limitations, including referring Ms. B. to DORS, Melwood, and DDA, and helping Ms. B. complete an application for services. When Ms. B. was placed on a waiting list for DDA because adequate funding was not available, the Department attempted, albeit without success, to locate an alternative source of funds through the Community Connections Agency. It provided Ms. B. with information about ARC, which offered a support group for parents with developmental disabilities. Additionally, the Department paid for an individual neuropsychological evaluation for Ms. B. It cannot be said here ... that the Department did not seek specialized services to assist Ms. B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Shirley, </em>191 Md.App. at 715-16, 993 A.2d at 697. We do not see how the Department could have acted any differently to attempt to address Ms. B.\u2019s needs, and counsel for Ms. B. does not enlighten us.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As discussed earlier, many authorities, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, direct courts to consider the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the Department\u2019s efforts in light of the availability of services. Here, services were withheld from Ms. B. due to forces outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Department\u2019s control, but not for its lack of trying. Thus, we agree with the CSA that the Department made reasonable efforts to reunify Ms. B. with her children, and we hold that the juvenile court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">D. The Decision To Change The Children\u2019s Permanency Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Ms. B. also challenges the juvenile court\u2019s ultimate decision to change the Children\u2019s permanency plans from reunification to adoption. We have already discredited her primary contention that \u201cthe trial court necessarily abused its discretion\u201d in making the threshold determination that the Department had made reasonable efforts towards reunification. Moreover, the record makes clear that, while in Ms. B.\u2019s care, the Children had been exposed to physical and sexual violence and neglect, and Ms. B. does not present any evidence that such conduct would be unlikely to continue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 9-101(b) (\u201cUnless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by [the parent], the court shall deny custody or visitation rights to that party[.]\u201d). Indeed, there was some testimony that Ms. B. continued to allow unsupervised contact between Mr. T. and Shirley, a dangerous gamble in direct violation of an earlier court order. Finally, Ms. B.\u2019s inability to improve her situation, arguably through no fault of her own, left the Children \u201clanguishing in foster care drift\u201d for 28 months, with no end in sight. <em>Cf. Rashawn H., </em>402 Md. at 500, 937 A.2d at 192. (\u201cThe State is not required to allow children to ... grow up in permanent chaos and instability, bouncing from one foster home to another ... because their parents, even with reasonable assistance from [the Department], continue to exhibit an inability ... to provide minimally acceptable shelter, sustenance, and support for them.\u201d). While we acknowledge that Ms. B. had been largely cooperative with the Department, we must balance her interests with the Children\u2019s health and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>safety. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5\u2014525(f)(1) (listing \u201cthe child\u2019s ability to be safe and healthy in the home of the child\u2019s parent\u201d as an integral factor in determining the permanency plan). Thus, from the sum of these factors, we see no abuse of discretion in the juvenile court\u2019s decision to change the Children\u2019s permanency plans from reunification to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We hasten to note that placing a child in an adoptive home does not necessarily sever all ties between child and biological parent. \u201cOpen adoption\u201d is an \u201cadoption in which it is the explicit intent of all parties to the adoption that the child maintain contact, including the possibility of visitation, with the birth parents[.]\u201d COMAR 07.02.12.02(B)(29) (2011). The Department is directed to explore \u201copen adoption\u201d when \u201c[ojlder children who are placed in out-of-home care know who their birth parents are and have already formed significant emotional attachments to them; and ... [ijt is otherwise appropriate and in the child\u2019s best interest not to sever all ties with the child\u2019s birth parents[.j\u201d COMAR 07.02.12.12-1(A) (2011). <em>See also </em>COMAR 07.05.03.19(A)(2) (2011) (\u201cA child may be considered for open adoption when ... [tjhe child\u2019s age and level of contact with, or commitment to, the parent make it emotionally difficult for the child to sever all ties with the parent[.j\u201d). Indeed, here, the juvenile court found that \u201cit\u2019s going to be in the best interest of these children if at all possible that there would be continued visitation\u2014that there be a continued contact with mother.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered that the standing visitation orders permitting contact between Ms. B. and her children remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The reasonableness of the Department\u2019s efforts to reunify parent with child cannot be considered in a vacuum, but rather, must be evaluated against the backdrop of the services available to it. Here, the Department actively tried to connect the mother with services that could potentially assist her in her parental role, only to be thwarted by forces outside its control. Accordingly, it made reasonable efforts toward reunification. Ultimately, as the Children could not be safely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>returned to the mother anytime within the foreseeable future, the juvenile court did not err in changing the Children\u2019s permanency plans from reunification to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AND THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.
