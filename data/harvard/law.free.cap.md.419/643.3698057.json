Health Serv. v. Fritz, </em>295 Md. 268, 273, 454 A.2d 846, 848 (1983). I therefore dissent from the decision to deny the petition before us on the ground that it was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">In <em>In re Najasha B., </em>409 Md. 20, 972 A.2d 845 (2009), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-11\">The State of Maryland has a <em>parens patriae </em>\u201cinterest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves\u201d and \u201cthe child\u2019s welfare is a consideration that is of transcendent importance when the child might ... be in jeopardy.\u201d <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705-06, 782 A.2d 332, 343 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>(stating that visitation may be restricted or even denied when the child\u2019s health or welfare is threatened).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 33, 972 A.2d at 852-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">While I would not dissent from a decision that leaves to another day the issues of whether the \u201cstay away\u201d and/or \u201cput out\u201d provisions of a TPO can be quashed prior to an adversary hearing, in my opinion, this Court should squarely hold that the \u201ccustody\u201d provision in a TPO does <em>not </em>operate to prevent the Circuit Court from exercising its <em>parens patriae </em>authority when presented with information that a child is in need of protection from the parent who obtained the TPO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">It is clear that an appeal from a custody order does not divest the Circuit Court of jurisdiction to decide the merits of a claim that, as a result of a <em>material </em>change in circumstances that has occurred <em>after </em>the order was entered, a change in custody is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>In Re Deontay J., </em>408 Md. 152, 167, 968 A.2d 1067, 1075 (2009). This Court should make it equally clear to the bench and bar of this State that the entry of a TPO does not operate to temporarily divest the Circuit Court of jurisdiction to modify or invalidate any child custody provisions in that order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\">. For reasons stated in <em>In Re Deontay J., </em>408 Md. 152 at 160, 968 A.2d 1067 at 1071 (2009), it is of no consequence that relief from the custody provision of the TPO was requested in a pleading captioned \"EMERGENCY MOTION TO QUASH AND DISMISS.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
