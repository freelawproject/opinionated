Baranowski </em>415 Md. 337, 1 A.3d 467 (2010), which we have renumbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">1. Did the District Court err by striking tenant\u2019s appeal as untimely in an action pursuant to \u00a7 8-401 of the Real Property Article where the tenant filed a timely post-judgment motion under Maryland Rule 3-535, and the District Court subsequently heard the case on the merits and then issued judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">2. Did the District Court err as a matter of law in granting possession to the landlord on his claim under Real Property Article \u00a7 8-401 because the landlord\u2019s failure to obtain a license to rent the property precluded him from using the courts to enforce the rental agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">3. Did the District Court err as a matter of law by denying tenant\u2019s claims under the Consumer Protection Act where the uncontroverted evidence showed not only that the rental property at issue was unlicensed for rental use, but also that the property contained an electrical defect and other problems that affected and endangered the tenant on a daily basis throughout the majority of her tenancy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We shall hold that a rental property owner who does not possess a current license to operate the premises, is not entitled to utilize the summary ejectment procedures outlined in Section 8-401 of the Real Property Article upon a tenant\u2019s failure to pay rent, if the dwelling is located in a jurisdiction that requires owners to obtain such licenses. We shall further hold that the District Court judge did not err in determining that the tenant did not demonstrate actual loss or injury due to the rental property owner\u2019s failure to obtain a license for the premises, and was, thus, not entitled to damages pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>On March 9, 2009, Katie McDaniel, Petitioner, entered into a -written lease with Tom Baranowski, Respondent, for the rental of a second-floor apartment in Brooklyn Park, in Anne Arundel County, the tenancy of which commenced a few days later, on March 12, 2009. Although McDaniel was not aware at the time, Baranowski had failed to obtain a license for the \u201cmultiple dwelling,\u201d defined in Section 15-4-202 of the Anne Arundel County Code (2005, 2009 Supp.), as \u201ca non-owner occupied dwelling containing two or more dwelling units.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In Anne Arundel County, \u201c[a] person may not operate a multiple dwelling ... without a license issued by the Department [of Inspections and Permits],\u201d and \u201c[a] separate license is required for each multiple dwelling....\u201d Section 11-10-102. A license may not be issued, moreover, \u201cwithout the approval of a Health Officer,\u201d who \u201cshall approve the issuance of a license if an inspection ... reveals that the multiple dwelling ... complies with the requirements of [the Anne Arundel County Code].\u201d Section ll-10-105(a). Those requirements are designed to insure the safety and habitability<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>premises, namely that the dwelling is \u201cclean, sanitary, fit for human occupancy, and in compliance with this title and other applicable State and County law.\u201d Section 15-4-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Although Baranowski had previously secured a license to lease the premises, that license had expired on January 31, 2005. Thereafter, the Anne Arundel County Department of Inspections and Permits Commercial Division contacted Baranowski on February 14, 2005, August 10, 2005, July 11, 2007, December 28, 2007, and on July 24, 2008, requesting that Baranowski renew his license to operate the premises in question. Baranowski finally reapplied for a rental license on May 21, 2009, after he had initiated summary ejectment proceedings against McDaniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Before moving into the apartment, McDaniel had paid Baranowski the first month\u2019s rent of $650, as well as a security deposit of $650. Upon taking possession, after putting the utilities in her name, McDaniel discovered various problems involving the fuse box, which was \u201csizzling and sparking.\u201d Specifically, when the fuse box sparked, the power in the apartment would shut off. McDaniel contacted Baltimore Gas and Electric and was directed to contact the fire department, whose personnel, upon assessing the situation, advised her to vacate the apartment. She, nevertheless, stayed in the apartment because she \u201chad nowhere to go.\u201d Although McDaniel did contact Baranowski, who had sent a maintenance person on more than one occasion, the problems with the fuse box persisted, happening \u201cevery day, quite a few times\u201d per day, with the power shutting off each time for \u201cone to two minutes.\u201d It was not until the weekend of May 22nd when Baranowski hired a professional electrician to repair the problem, that the fuse box was fixed, a week before the trial in the present case commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>According to McDaniel, other aspects of the apartment also were in disrepair, including two windows that had fallen out of their frames, hitting McDaniel and her young daughter on the head on separate occasions. In addition, the kitchen windows were missing locks, and the kitchen countertop was loose, unglued to the cabinet on which it sat.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">McDaniel also had contacted the Anne Arundel County Department of Health, and an inspector was dispatched to inspect the premises in mid-April. The inspector issued a letter to Baranowski dated April 22, 2009, notifying him of numerous Code violations involving the poor condition of the windows, kitchen countertop, and electrical system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Throughout all of this, McDaniel did not pay any rent, after the $1,300 she had initially paid for the first month\u2019s rent and the security deposit. She apparently vacated the apartment on or about June 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">On April 16, 2009, Baranowski filed a \u201cComplaint for Repossession of Rented Property under Real Property \u00a7 8-401\u201d in the District Court of Maryland, Anne Arundel County, against McDaniel, for failure to pay rent that was due April 12th. McDaniel was present when the case was heard on April 23, 2009, and the District Court judge awarded possession of the premises to Baranowski and entered judgment in the amount of $707.50 in rent and late fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">McDaniel was scheduled to be evicted on May 15, 2009, but was granted an extension to remain on the premises until May 19th. That day, after securing representation from the Legal Aid Bureau, she filed an \u201cEmergency Motion to Stay Eviction and to Revise Judgment, and Request for Rent Escrow,\u201d alleging that the District Court had erroneously entered judgment \u201c[b]y consent\u201d when in actuality, McDaniel, who at that time was pro se, had asserted at the hearing that the premises \u201ccontained serious and substantial defects\u201d and also had requested \u201cthe remedy of rent escrow.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Prior to the filing of the \u201cEmergency Motion to Stay Eviction and to Revise Judgment,\u201d Baranowski had filed a second complaint for repossession of the premises against McDaniel on May 13, 2009, for failure to pay rent due May 12th. Through counsel, in response, McDaniel filed a \u201cNotice of Intention to Defend and Counterclaim,\u201d in which she alleged that the lease was void or voidable as against public policy, because Baranowski had failed to obtain a license for the premises, as well as that Baranowski had breached the implied warranty of habitability, and violated the Consumer Protection Act; McDaniel also requested a rent escrow. In support of her claim that the lease was void or voidable as against public policy, McDaniel alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">COUNT ONE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">(Recovery of Money Paid Under Void Lease)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">1. Tenant and the Plaintiff, Mr. Thomas Baranowski (hereinafter, \u201cLandlord\u201d), entered into a purported lease of the real property at 5210 Brookwood Road, Second Floor, Brooklyn Park, Maryland 21225 (the \u201cProperty\u201d), on or about March 12, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">2. On or about March 12, 2009, in consideration of the purported lease, Tenant paid Landlord a total of $1,300.00, representing $650 for the first month\u2019s rent and a $650 security deposit. Landlord presently retains this sum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>3. The Property is a \u201cmultiple dwelling\u201d under Anne Arundel County Code, \u00a7 15-4-201[sic] (2005, Feb. 2009 Supp.) (\u201cCounty Code\u201d), as supplemented by the Construction <em>&amp; </em>Property Maintenance Code Supplement, because it is a \u201cnon-owner occupied dwelling containing two or more dwelling units.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">4. Under County Code, \u00a7 11-10-102, \u201c[a] person may not operate a multiple dwelling or rooming house without a license issued by the Department [of Inspections and Permits].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">5. On information and belief, Landlord does not have a current license to operate the Property as a multiple dwelling, nor did he have such a license at the time the purported lease was executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">6. Because County law prohibits Landlord from operating the Property as a multiple dwelling, the purported lease of the Property is void or voidable as an illegal contract and/or as against the public policy of Anne Arundel County and the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">McDaniel further alleged that Baranowski had breached the implied warranty of habitability as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">COUNT TWO</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">(Breach of Implied Warranty)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">7. Tenant incorporates the allegations of the foregoing Paragraphs 1-6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">8. The Property contains serious and substantial defects that are a hazard to human life and health. These defects include a serious electrical problem, whereby the circuit breaker box sparks and the power to the dwelling goes out intermittently, while failing to trip the electrical breakers, causing a fire hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">9. As such, the Property is not presently habitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">10. Landlord knew, or should have known, of the dangerous defects in the Property at the time the purported lease was executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>11. Landlord knew, or should have known, at the time the purported lease was executed, that he was not legally permitted to operate the Property as a multiple dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">12. By proffering a residential lease to Tenant, Landlord impliedly warranted that the Property was habitable as a residence, and further impliedly warranted that he was authorized to rent the Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">13. By entering into the purported lease under the circumstances, Landlord breached the aforementioned implied warranties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Additionally, McDaniel alleged that Baranowski had violated the Consumer Protection Act by failing to provide a safe and habitable living environment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">COUNT THREE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">(Violation of the Consumer Protection Act)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-10\">14. Tenant incorporates the allegations of the foregoing Paragraphs 1-12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-11\">15. By making the aforesaid implied warranties in connection with the lease of the Property, when he knew or should have known that they were false, Landlord engaged in unfair or deceptive trade practice in violation of the Consumer Protect Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Maryland Code, Commercial Law Article (2005 RepkVol., 2008 Supp.) (\u201cC.L.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-12\">16. C.L. \u00a7 13-408 authorizes an action for damages for violation of the CPA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">Finally, McDaniel alleged that she was entitled to abate rent, because she had informed Baranowski of the \u201csubstantial electrical defect,\u201d and he had failed to timely correct the problem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-14\">COUNT FOUR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADL\">(Request for Rent Escrow)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-15\">17. Tenant incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs 1-16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-16\">18. Landlord has had actual notice of the substantial electrical defect in the Property since at least on or about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>March 21, 2009, when Tenant informed Landlord by telephone of the defect. The defect was also cited in a letter dated April 22, 2009 to Landlord from an inspector with the Anne Arundel County Department of Health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">19. Section 8\u2014211(i) of the Maryland Code, Real Property Article (2003 RepLVol., 2008 Supp.) (\u201cR.P.\u201d) authorizes a tenant to \u201crefuse to pay rent and raise the existence of [serious and substantial] defects or conditions as an affirmative defense to ... any complaint proceeding brought by the landlord to recover rent or the possession of the leased premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">20. Relief under R.P. \u00a7 8-211 is conditioned upon proper notice to the landlord, reasonable time to correct defects, and \u201c[p]ayment by the tenant, into court, of the amount or rent required by the lease, unless this amount is modified by the court....\u201d R.P. \u00a7 8-211(k).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">21. Landlord has had sufficient notice under the statute and reasonable time to correct defects. <em>See </em>R.P. \u00a7 8-211(g)(2)-(3), (h).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">McDaniel requested that the District Court dismiss Baranowski\u2019s complaint and sought $1,300 in damages (the amount of her first month\u2019s rent and security deposit). She further requested that the District Court abate her rent until Baranowski had made repairs to the premises. McDaniel also contemporaneously filed a \u201cMotion to Consolidate\u201d Baranowski\u2019s April and May complaints, which the court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">At a hearing on the consolidated cases on May 29, 2009, the District Court Judge denied McDaniel\u2019s Motion to Revise the April judgment, denied her counterclaims, and entered judgment in favor of Baranowski for possession of the property, as well as for May rent with concomitant late fees, determining that Baranowski\u2019s failure to obtain a license for the premises did not preclude his summary ejectment action and that McDaniel had failed to prove actual injury under the Consumer Protection Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">[The cases] [t]alk about damage to the consumer. Look at actual loss or injury caused by the unfair or deceptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>trade practice.... And what I find is that the failure to get a license in this case, [ ] I don\u2019t find it to be void.... [The] tenant basically agreed that everything has finally been fixed. It would be nice to have a letter from the county that they\u2019re satisfied____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">So what I\u2019m doing today is, in the April [complaint], motion for rent escrow is denied. Motion to revise judgment is denied. Motion to stay eviction, order staying eviction as to June 1, 2009 is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">In the case for May\u2019s rent, I enter judgment in favor of the landlord for six hundred eighty-two dollars and fifty cents. Counter claim is denied. And in that case, both sides are advised that they have four days to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aam\">The Judge did grant McDaniel\u2019s motion to stay the eviction until June 1, 2009; McDaniel appealed the various adverse judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Regarding McDaniel\u2019s appeal of the April judgment of repossession, the court struck the appeal as \u201cnot timely filed,\u201d but allowed the appeal involving the monetary judgment entered in the consolidated cases. Thereafter, McDaniel filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration,\u201d asserting that her \u201cEmergency Motion to Stay Eviction and to Revise Judgment,\u201d filed on May 19, 2009, was timely in connection with the judgment of repossession, entered on April 28, 2009. Specifically, McDaniel argued that the motion was filed pursuant to Rule 3-535, describing the District Court\u2019s \u201crevisory power,\u201d which provides that \u201c[o]n motion of any party filed within 30 days after entry of judgment, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment and may take any action it could have taken under Rule 3-534 [governing motions to alter or amend a judgment].\u201d The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Although McDaniel filed an appeal in the Circuit Court regarding the rental amount and alleged damages to her, Baranowski\u2019s failure to obtain a license for the premises and the availability of a summary ejectment was not pursued, because McDaniel had \u201cmoved out of the property\u201d by the time of the hearing. In a memorandum opinion, the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Court affirmed the decision of the District Court regarding back rent and concomitant late fees due Baranowski and also the denial of McDaniel\u2019s Consumer Protection Act claim, reasoning that she had failed to present any evidence of \u201cactual injury\u201d as required by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">As a threshold matter before us, McDaniel asserts that the District Court erred in striking her appeal regarding the judgment of repossession entered on April 28, 2009. McDaniel contends that the May 29, 2009 hearing, in which the District Court considered both of Baranowski\u2019s complaints, amounted to a \u201cnew trial on the April [repossession] case,\u201d such that her appeal was timely. Alternatively, McDaniel suggests that her appeal in connection with the repossession judgment was timely, because she had filed a timely \u201cMotion to Revise Judgment,\u201d pursuant to Rule 3-535(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> asking the District Court to \u201c[vjacate the judgment of possession,\u201d because Baranowski had failed to repair the \u201cserious electrical problem,\u201d as well as a host of other defects in the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The issue regarding the appealability of the Motion to Revise Judgment requires only cursory review, because we have previously indicated that a motion to revise judgment \u201cclearly is subject to appellate review.\u201d <em>Southern Management Corp. v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 495, 836 A.2d 627, 647 (2003).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, an appeal from the timely post-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>motion to revise the dispossession and denial of damages judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Our focus in the present case is whether a rental property owner in Anne Arundel County, who does not possess at the relevant times a license to operate the rental premises as mandated by the County Code, may nevertheless initiate summary ejectment proceedings, should a tenant fail to pay rent. McDaniel asserts that because Baranowski undisputably failed to comply with the licensing requirements of Section 11-10-102 of the Code, he should \u201cnot be permitted to reap the benefits\u201d of the streamlined repossession process outlined in Section 8-401 of the Real Property Article. McDaniel further argues that the county ordinance \u201cis a public health and safety measure,\u201d designed to safeguard tenants and insure the habitability of rental properties. Baranowski counters that because Section 8-401 contains no explicit requirement that a landlord \u201cbe licensed by local authority in order to recover possession of premises when the tenant fails to pay rent,\u201d he should be permitted to initiate and maintain a summary ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The legal relationship between landlord and tenant is governed by the contract between the parties, <em>Delauter v. Shafer, </em>374 Md. 317, 822 A.2d 423 (2003), <em>Village Green Mutual Homes v. Randolph, </em>361 Md. 179, 760 A.2d 716 (2000), as well as any statutory authority.

Section 8-208 of the Real Property Article was enacted in 1974 in response to the recommendations of the Governor\u2019s Landlord-Tenant Laws Study Commission,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(a) <em>Prohibited </em>provisions.\u2014No lease shall contain any of the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">(1) A provision whereby the tenant authorizes any person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of the lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">(2) A provision whereby the tenant agrees to waive or to forego any right or remedy provided by applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">(3) A provision providing for a penalty for the late payment of rent in excess of 5% of the amount of rent due for the rental period for which the payment was delinquent----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">(4) Any provision whereby the tenant waives his right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(5) Any provision whereby the tenant agrees to a period required for landlord\u2019s notice to quit less than that provided by applicable law; provided, however, that neither party is \u2022 prohibited hereby from agreeing to a longer notice than that required by applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">(6) Any provision authorizing the landlord to take possession of the leased premises, or the tenant\u2019s personal property therein unless the lease has been terminated by action of the parties or by operation of law, and such personal property has been abandoned by the tenant without the benefit of formal legal process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">(b) <em>General </em>provisions.\u2014(1) If any lease shall contain a provision calling for an automatic renewal of the lease term unless prior notice is given by the party or parties seeking to terminate the lease, any such provision shall be distinctly set apart from any other provision of the lease and provide a space for the written acknowledgment of tenant\u2019s agreement to the automatic renewal provision, except leases containing an automatic renewal period of one (1) month or less.

In at least one section of the Study Commission\u2019s meeting minutes, the Commission envisioned comprehensive habitability codes being enacted by local governments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In fact, a licensure requirement to operate rental premises, addressing habitability concerns, was in existence in Anne Arun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>del County as early as 1967.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Former Section 11A-1200 of the Anne Arundel County Code, (1967 Supp.), provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">No person shall operate a multiple dwelling or rooming house unless he holds a current, unrevoked operating license issued by the department of inspections and permits with the concurrence of the health officer, in his name for the specific named multiple dwelling or rooming house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXL\">The Study Commission also recognized the necessity of multiple dwelling licensing laws to insure the safety and habitability of rental premises.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">If, then, Section 8-208(f) recognizes the enforceability of local habitability ordinances, what should their effect be on the availability of summary ejectment?<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We have recognized in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>analogous contexts that the failure to obtain a license as required by local ordinance ordinarily renders the contract invalid and unenforceable. In <em>Berenter, Inc. v. Berman, </em>258 Md. 290, 265 A.2d 759 (1970), we considered whether a contractor could enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, when he was not licensed as required by the Maryland Home Improvement Law. In holding that the unlicensed contractor could not resort to a mechanic\u2019s lien, we reasoned that if a statute requiring a license for conducting a trade or business is \u201cregulatory in nature for the protection of the public, rather than merely to raise revenue,\u201d a person who has neglected to obtain a license \u201cwill not be given the assistance of the courts\u201d in enforcing the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 298, 265 A.2d at 761. In other words, once we determined that the purpose of the statute was to eliminate a perceived harm, rather than to build the public fisc, then we recognized that an unlicensed person should not be afforded the benefit of swift justice,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or the establishment of a mechanic\u2019s lien, which requires but a filing in court for its creation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Former Section 19 of Article 63, Maryland Code (1957, 1968 Repl.Vol.), in effect at the time <em>Berenter </em>was decided, provided for the establishment of a mechanic\u2019s lien once the builder filed a petition in the circuit court containing cursory information, namely the contractor\u2019s name and address and a description of the work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">Every such claim shall set forth: First, the name of the party claimant and of the owner or reputed owner of the building, and also of the contractor or architect, or builder, when the contract was made by the claimant with such contractor, architect, or builder; second, the amount or sum claimed to be due and the nature or kind of work or the kind and amount of materials furnished and the time when the materials were furnished or the work done; thirdly, the locality of the building and the number and size of the stories of the same, or such matters of description as may be necessary to identify the same.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>As a builder cannot seek swift justice through the institution of a mechanic\u2019s lien if he is unlicensed to operate his business, so should a landlord not be able to seek to dispossess a tenant, summarily, -without having a license to operate the leased premises as required by local ordinance.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Whether, though, the landlord must establish his bona fides regarding licensure at the time of filing, as a matter of law, or whether the tenant should plead the lack of a license as an affirmative defense remains an issue. In this regard, we have characterized summary ejectment proceedings as substantively and procedurally limited, precluding complexity. We recognized this in <em>Shum v. Gaudreau, </em>317 Md. 49, 562 A.2d 707 (1989), in which we considered whether a landlord\u2019s action for repossession of the premises and unpaid rent, pursuant to Section 8-401, precluded, by virtue of the doctrine of res judicata, a subsequent contract action by the landlord to recover for damage to the premises. In <em>Shum, </em>we determined that res judicata did not bar a subsequent suit for damages by a landlord, because \u201cthe relief available in a summary eject<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ment action is limited to a judgment for repossession of premises and rent actually due\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">To accomplish the objective of speedy adjudication, our General Assembly, like legislatures in other states, limited a summary ejectment action to repossession of premises and rent actually due. The determination of the amount of rent due is often (although not always) a relatively straightforward calculation, and its recovery is not inconsistent with simple and speedy adjudication. <em>It would be contrary to the purpose of the summary ejectment statutory scheme to allow recovery of general contract damages, with possible complexities of proof, in a summary ejectment action.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa_\"><em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 562 A.2d at 712 (emphasis added). In so holding, we emphasized that Section 8-401 would not afford \u201cample procedural means for fully developing the entire transaction,\u201d and therefore, the landlord\u2019s more complex contract claim was more appropriately heard in a separate action. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 562 A.2d at 713; <em>see Greenbelt Consumer v. Acme Mkts., </em>272 Md. 222, 229, 322 A.2d 521, 525 (1974) (describing summary ejectment as one of several \u201cpossessory in rem or quasi in rem actions that provide[] a means by which a landlord [may] rapidly and inexpensively obtain repossession of his premises... .\u201d); <em>Law Offices of Taiwo Agbaje v. JLH Props., II, LLC, </em>169 Md.App. 355, 370, 901 A.2d 249, 258 (2006) (reasoning landlord\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees was not cognizable in a summary ejectment proceeding, because \u201csuch a complex factual inquiry would frustrate the expedited design of the summary ejectment statute\u201d). As a result, the summary ejectment proceedings could become enmeshed in complexity, were the tenant to have to plead and prove the <em>absence </em>of a license to operate the rental property on the part of the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The summary ejectment procedure itself is mired in the superior title of the landlord to the leased premises, once nonpayment occurs, because it only requires that the landlord describe \u201cthe property sought to be repossessed,\u201d \u201cthe name of each tenant,\u201d and \u201cthe amount of rent and any late fees due and unpaid,\u201d in making the landlord\u2019s prima facie case war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ranting summary ejectment. Licensure under local ordinances in order to operate rental dwelling units is an integral part of a landlord\u2019s status as claimant in those jurisdictions that require licensure. As a result, in order to invoke the facile process of summary ejectment, a landlord in those jurisdictions requiring licensure, must affirmatively plead and demonstrate that he is licensed at the time of the filing of the complaint for summary ejectment in order to initiate the summary ejectment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">With respect to the damages to which McDaniel claims entitlement under the Consumer Protection Act, McDaniel argues that the District Court erred in denying her claim because she failed to prove actual damages. In <em>CitaraManis v. Hallowell, </em>328 Md. 142, 613 A.2d 964 (1992), we considered whether a tenant, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act, could obtain restitution of rent paid for premises that were not licensed as required by a local housing code, after the tenant only proved lack of licensure. In the case, the CitaraManises had not alleged nor proved that the house they had rented \u201cwas unclean, unsafe, uninhabitable or unsuitable in any regard,\u201d or that they had suffered any diminution of the rental value of the property as a result of the lack of licensure. In our analysis of the implications of these omissions, we contrasted the situation -with that in <em>Golt v. Phillips, </em>308 Md. 1, 517 A.2d 328 (1986), in which the tenant was forced to move to another apartment, because the unit he had rented from an unlicensed landlord contained numerous housing code violations, including no toilet facilities in Golt\u2019s apartment, defective door locks, and the lack of fire exits and fire doors. Golt demonstrated actual injury, in both the diminution of value of the premises due to defects in the unit, which did not even have toilet facilities, and also in the cost of securing suitable substitute housing. <em>See also Galola v. Snyder, </em>328 Md. 182, 613 A.2d 983 (1992) (reasoning tenant was required to prove actual loss or injury stemming from the lack of licensure).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The present case is analogous to <em>CitaraManis, </em>because McDaniel failed to present any evidence that she sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>any actual damages, such as bills for medical treatment, loss of wages, or the cost of securing suitable substitute housing, for example. Therefore, we agree with the District Court that McDaniel failed to prove actual loss or injury, a prerequisite to recovery under the Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REGARDING THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT CLAIM AFFIRMED.

Thereafter, in 1978, the General Assembly repealed and reenacted former Section 8-401(b), Maryland Code (1974, 1977 Supp.), requiring personal service on the tenant for the entry of a money judgment for past due rent. 1978 Md.

In 1996, the Legislature amended former Section 8-401(d) of the Real Property Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1996 Repl.Vol.), increasing the number of days, from two to four, for a tenant to vacate the premises should the landlord prevail. 1996 Md.

To the extent that the language in the second clause of Section 8-208(f), which provides, \"no such law can diminish or limit any right or remedy granted under the provisions of this section,\u201d could suggest that a landlord\u2019s ability to seek summary ejectment under Section 8-401 may not be defeated by a local habitability ordinance, this argument is without merit. Section 8-208 enumerates several safeguards for residential tenants. In particular, subsection (a) requires that any landlord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>who offers five or more units for rent must use a written lease, and Section 8-208(b) provides that a landlord must furnish a copy of the written lease to a prospective tenant upon request. Subsection (c) outlines mandatory lease provisions, including a statement that \u201cthe premises will be made available in a condition permitting habitation,\u201d and Section 8-208(d) contains numerous terms that a landlord may not insert in a residential lease. Finally, subsection (e) requires that a provision calling for an \u201cautomatic renewal\u201d of the lease must be \"distinctly set apart\u201d and \u201cprovide a space for the written acknowledgment of the tenant's agreement.\u201d These statutory protections for the tenant may be supplemented, but cannot be diminished by any local law, as stated in Section 8\u2014208(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b609-6\">. We have also determined that the failure to obtain a license precluded the enforcement of a contract in proceedings regarded as other than \u201csummary\u201d in nature. <em>See Snodgrass v.

In a similar vein, Section 8-208(d) of the Real Property Article acknowledges that particular lease terms may be rendered void and unenforceable as against public policy. Specifically, the Section prohibits lease terms that provide for indemnity by a tenant of a landlord for loss within the landlord\u2019s control as void against public policy. Present Section 8-208(d) was enacted by Chapter 789 of the Maryland Laws of 1976 to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">provide that lease provisions that are void and against public policy under RP Article Section 8-105 cannot be placed in a lease. Real Property Article Section 8-105 currently provides that lease provisions seeking to exculpate a landlord from tort liability to persons injured in the common areas are void and against public policy; neither Section 8-105 nor Section 8-208, however, prohibit a lease from containing such a void provision. Even though such a clause is void under Section 8-105, it might deter a tenant from seeking redress for personal injuries if it is contained in a lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Letter from Steven G.
