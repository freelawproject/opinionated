(\u201cBEKA\u201d) and the Board of Education of Worcester County (\u201cthe County Board\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Between 2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and 2006, BEKA was one of twenty trade contractors to be awarded a lump sum contract to contribute to the construction of a new public school, Ocean City Elementary School, in Worcester County. Dissatisfied with the method and amounts of the County Board\u2019s payment for its work, BEKA filed suit in the Circuit Court for Worcester County and obtained a judgment against the County Board. The County Board appealed that judgment to the Court of Special Appeals and succeeded in obtaining a reversal of the judgment and an order for a new trial. BEKA has appealed the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment and before us contends that the trial court\u2019s judgment should be fully reinstated. We affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s judgment that a new trial is warranted because the County Board was precluded from presenting evidence on its recoupment claim and BEKA may have been awarded impermissible \u201cdelay damages\u201d under the contract. But, we reverse the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding that the County Board\u2019s governmental immunity is not waived unless and until BEKA proves that there is a funding mechanism to satisfy a judgment for money damages rendered against the Board. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the intermediate appellate court with direction to remand to the Circuit Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On June 8, 2004, the County Board executed a written contract with BEKA. to perform site clearing, excavation, grading, site utilities, curb and gutter work, and paving for a new elementary school. The \u201clump sum bid\u201d proposed for the work by BEKA and accepted by the County Board was $1,856,000. Subsequent to execution of the contract, the parties agreed to three approved change orders, totaling $105,913, that increased the total contract price to $1,961,913. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>BEKA\u2019s work on the contract began in June 2004 and was completed by May 2006. During that time, there were numerous disputes regarding BEKA\u2019s responsibilities under the original contract as well as the monetary consequences of modifications made by the County Board. To date, the Board has paid BEKA a total of $1,421,852.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Alluded by resolution to their dispute, BEKA filed a Complaint for Money Damages and Other Relief in the Circuit Court for Worcester County. BEKA\u2019s original complaint sought damages in the amount of $1,157,053.75, as well as prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, costs and attorney\u2019s fees. BEKA tabulated that figure alleging that the County Board owed it $361,991.47 under the original contract and an additional $795,062.28 for alterations made to the scope of BEKA\u2019s work under the contract. The County Board generally denied liability, raising 12 affirmative defenses in its first Answer; a recoupment claim for \u201ccredits, backcharges, and/or setoffs\u201d in the amount of $531,979.52 in its Amended Answer and Counter-Complaint; combining the recoupment claim and the 12 affirmative defenses in its Second Amended Answer; and adding four more defenses to its Third, and final, Amended Answer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County Board conceded at trial that it owes at least $361,991.47 on the balance of the original contract. Numerous motions were filed during the course of the litigation and are discussed with particularity <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Following a four day bench trial, the Circuit Court for Worcester County \u201ccompromised the claim\u201d between what the trial judge viewed to be BEKA\u2019s final claim for $1,215,035,80 (exclusive of prejudgment interest) and the County Board\u2019s claim for $505,487 and entered a judgment in favor of BEKA for $1,100,000, excluding prejudgment interest and not awarding attorney\u2019s fees or post-judgment interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Board appealed the judgment and filed a \u201cMotion to Stay Enforcement of the Judgment,\u201d which was denied by the trial judge, but granted on appeal on the condition that a <em>supersedeas </em>bond be filed in the Circuit Court for Worcester County. The County Commissioners of Worcester County fulfilled the bond requirement and the intermediate appellate court heard the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>purposes of a new trial. <em>Board of Ed. v. BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. 668, 989 A.2d 1181 (2010). BEKA petitioned for <em>certiorari </em>and the County Board filed a conditional cross-petition, both of which were granted, <em>BEKA v. Worcester County Bd. of Edua, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010), to address the following questions, rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">1. Is the doctrine of sovereign immunity applicable to a suit against a county board of education for breach of a written contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals incorrectly apply the abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the trial judge\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s \u201cMotion <em>in Limine </em>to Exclude Evidence of Backcharges?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">3. Did the Court of Special Appeals err by reversing the trial judge\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment precluding the County Board from presenting evidence on its recoupment claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">4. Did the Court of Special Appeals err as a matter of law by allowing the County Board to raise its recoupment claim when the trial judge had stricken the pleadings that raised the claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">5. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in determining that the contract contains a broad \u201cno-damages-for-delay\u201d clause in light of other contract provisions allegedly providing for recovery of damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">6. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment because of non-compliance with Md. Rule 2-522(a)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">As Cross-Petitioner, the County Board has asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">1. Does Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-518(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.P.\u201d) apply to contract claims against a county board of education?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>We answer each question above in the negative. We affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s judgment that sovereign immunity is legislatively waived in the action against the County Board based on a written contract for the construction of a public school. We reverse, however, that part of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding that requires BEKA to prove a source of funding in order to obtain a judgment at a new trial. Additionally, as discussed <em>infra, </em>we affirm the intermediate appellate court\u2019s judgment concerning the treatment of the County Board\u2019s recoupment claim and concerning procedural defects in the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">I. Public School Construction in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We have recognized there exists \u201ca carefully conceived legislative structure in which the respective powers and limitations of local school boards, the State Board of Education and county governments are delineated and balanced.\u201d <em>Bd. of Ed. v. Montgomery County, </em>237 Md. 191, 197, 205 A.2d 202, 205 (1964). The construction of public schools exemplifies those interwoven roles; State and local governments provide funding, and, along with the county boards of education, they provide oversight for the construction of public schools in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The Maryland State Board of Education (\u201cMSBE\u201d) establishes standards and planning guidance for construction projects and the State Superintendent must approve of all plans for new construction and the remodeling of school buildings exceeding $350,000. Md.Code (2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2-205(l), </em>2\u2014303(f) of the Education Article (\u201cE.D.\u201d). Annually, the MSBE must submit a public school budget to the Governor including appropriations for the Department itself and for aid to \u201ccounties ... for the construction of school buildings.\u201d E.D. \u00a7 2\u2014205(j); <em>see also </em>E.D. \u00a7 5-101 (requiring county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>boards to submit an annual budget including \u201cestimated receipts\u201d and \u201crequested appropriations\u201d for local school construction that has been approved by the local government). The Interagency Committee on School Construction, established by the Board of Public Works pursuant to E.D. \u00a7 5-302, provides a recommendation to the Board of Public Works on which submitted, locally approved construction projects should be funded through the Public School Construction Program. The General State School Fund, established by E.D. \u00a7 5-201, is a source of funding for school building construction aid described in E.D. \u00a7 5-301(c), which requires the State to pay the excess costs above available federal funds for approved school construction projects or improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">County boards of education may undertake the construction of public school buildings as long as the plans conform to the \u201cbylaws, rules and regulations of the State Board\u201d and to the regulations of the Board of Public Works related to alternative financing, when applicable. <em>See </em>E.D. \u00a7\u00a7 4-115(b), 4-126. The procurement of bids from contractors for school construction contracts, which is addressed in \u00a7 5-112 of the Education Article, is administered by county boards. The local county governments meet the requirements of the county board\u2019s approved annual budgets by levying and collecting taxes in their jurisdictions and appropriating revenues from other sources. <em>See </em>E.D. \u00a7\u00a7 5-104, 5-107; <em>see generally Montgomery </em>County, 237 Md. 191, 205 A.2d 202 (1964). Once appropriated, county boards must keep school construction funding isolated in a separate and independent account. <em>See </em>E.D. \u00a7 5-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The State, the State Superintendent, the county governments, and the county boards of education are all subject to school construction-related regulations promulgated by the Board of Public Works found in COMAR Title 23.03.02, <em>et seq. </em>(2011) (\u201cAdministration of the Public School Construction Program\u201d). <em>See </em>E.D. \u00a7 5-301(g)(l). Clearly, in light of the aforementioned statutory provisions, \u201c[sjtate law provides for close supervision of county boards with regard to construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>of school buildings.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Ramsey, </em>413 F.Supp. 523, 530 (D.Md.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>552 F.2d 117 (4th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">II. Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Here, the County Board has been sued for breach of contract, and lacking money (or the ability to raise money on its own) to pay a judgment, the Board contends that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the suit. The doctrine of sovereign immunity \u201cprohibits suits against the State or its entities absent its consent.\u201d <em>Magnetti v. University of Md., </em>402 Md. 548, 557, 937 A.2d 219, 224 (2007) (citing <em>Deft of Natural Resources v. Welsh, </em>308 Md. 54, 58-59, 521 A.2d 313, 315 (1986)); <em>see also Proctor v. WMATA, </em>412 Md. 691, 709, 990 A.2d 1048, 1058 (2010) (stating that sovereign immunity is applicable to the State, and its agencies and instrumentalities); <em>Stem v. Board of Regents, </em>380 Md. 691, 700, 846 A.2d 996, 1001 (2004) (\u201cThe doctrine of sovereign immunity has long been recognized as applicable in actions against the State of Maryland and its official representatives.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In order to determine if the doctrine of sovereign immunity applies to the County Board in the underlying contract suit, we ask: \u201c(1) whether the entity asserting immunity qualifies for the protection; and if so, (2) whether the legislature has waived immunity either directly or by necessary implication, in a manner that would render the defense of immunity unavailable.\u201d <em>Magnetti, </em>402 Md. at 557, 937 A.2d at 224 (quoting <em>ARA Health v. Dept. of Public Safety, </em>344 Md. 85, 92, 685 A.2d 435, 438 (1996)); <em>see also Austin v. City of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 69-71, 405 A.2d 255, 264-66 (1979) (Eldridge, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (describing the legislative origins of sovereign immunity and the resulting deference to that body regarding waivers of the doctrine). A legislative waiver of sovereign immunity, notably, is ineffective unless \u201cthere are \u2018funds available for the satisfaction of the judgment\u2019 or the agency has been given the power \u2018for the raising of funds necessary to satisfy recovery against it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 701, 846 A.2d at 1001-02 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>(quoting <em>University of Maryland v. Maas, </em>173 Md. 554, 559, 197 A. 123, 126 (1938)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">BEKA asserts that even if the County Board is entitled to sovereign immunity, that doctrine has been legislatively waived for its contract claim pursuant to Md.Code (2009 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Conversely, the County Board, as Cross-Petitioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>asserts that BEKA may obtain only a limited judgment because sovereign immunity applies and has only been legislatively waived for claims of $100,000 or less, or the limits of an insurance policy, pursuant to Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-518 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The County Board contends that when C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518 is read together with \u00a7 4-105 of the Education Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there is \u201clittle room for the applicability of any other sovereign immunity waiver provision found in State law, including S.G. \u00a7 12-201 <em>et seq.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that S.G. \u00a7 12-201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>applies; however, it also determined that S.G. \u00a7 12-203<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> does not provide a funding mechanism for a contract judgment; therefore, according to the intermediate appellate court, because no proof was offered on the County Board\u2019s ability to pay a judgment the waiver of sovereign immunity was \u201cineffective.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 712, 989 A.2d at 1207. Consequently, the intermediate appellate court held that \u201cin the event that there is a new trial, and a judgment is entered against the Board on the contract claims, there will need to be evidence presented, and a factual finding by the Circuit Court, regarding whether there are funds available to satisfy the judgment.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 715, 989 A.2d at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We shall hold that the legislative waiver of sovereign immunity in S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a) is applicable to the Board of Education of Worcester County. Additionally, we hold that S.G. \u00a7 12-203 provides a funding mechanism for judgments rendered against the County Board following a waiver of sovereign immunity under S.G. 12-201(a). Thus, suit on a written contract for construction of a public school may be brought against the County Board. Moreover, the limited waiver of sovereign immunity contained in C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">A. S.G. \u00a7 12-201 Waives Sovereign Immunity for the County Board of Education Arising out of a School Construction Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">BEKA advances the contention, which was adopted by the intermediate appellate court, that \u201cin the context of this case, the Board is a \u201cunit\u201d of the State pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 12-201, and this statute waives [the County Board\u2019s] right to the defense of sovereign immunity in contract actions.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>190 Md.App. at 709, 989 A.2d at 1205 (footnote omitted). Conversely, the County Board asserts that \u201cS.G. \u00a7 12-201 <em>et seq., ... </em>applies only to contract claims against the State, its officers, and its units\u201d and that local boards of education, the County Board contends, are not \u201cunits\u201d of the State.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We reject the County Board\u2019s position and affirm the intermediate appellate court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">First, we must determine \u201cwhether the entity asserting immunity qualifies for its protection.\u201d <em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 700, 846 A.2d at 1001-02 (citation omitted). We affirm that a county board of education, is \u201ca State agency entitled to governmental immunity.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 694, 989 A.2d at 1196 (citing <em>Board of Ed. v. Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 205-06, 973 A.2d 233, 236-37 (2009)) (noting numerous cases in support of the proposition that the Court of Appeals has \u201clong considered\u201d county school boards to be State agencies); <em>see also Chesapeake Charter v. Board of Ed., </em>358 Md. 129, 135-36, 747 A.2d 625, 628-29 (2000) (holding that county school boards are \u2018creatures\u2019 of the General Assembly and principally governed by state policies, although not \u201cunits\u201d for the purposes of the State\u2019s General Procurement Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">If a county board of education may benefit from the sovereign immunity enjoyed by State agencies, then, necessarily, it is also subject to statutory restraint on that defense by operation of a legislative waiver. <em>See State v. Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. 129, 140, 854 A.2d 1208, 1214 (2004) (\u2018We have held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>consistently, that immunity from suit is \u2018one of the highest attributes of sovereignty,\u2019 and that any waiver of that immunity must come from the Legislature.\u201d); <em>see also </em>E.D. \u00a7 3-104(b)(2) (allowing a county board of education to \u201csue or be sued\u201d); <em>see also </em>C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518 (discussed infra). \u201cTitle 12 of the State Government Article addresses the liability of state agencies and the scope of the doctrine of sovereign immunity ... containing] separate statutory provisions regarding tort and contract actions.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 695, 989 A.2d at 1197. Alluding briefly to the legislative history of S.G. \u00a7 12-201, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that because the Board of Education of Worcester County is a State agency, a \u201cunit\u201d of the State in the parlance of the statute, then the waiver of sovereign liability in contract actions set forth in S.G. \u00a7 12-201 was expressly applicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 708, 989 A.2d at 1204-05. We agree. Moreover, as required by the statute and cases interpreting the provision, the contract between the County Board and BEKA, irrefutably \u201cwas [ (1) ] reduced to writing; and (2) the State employee or official [the County Superintendent on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the Board] acted within the scope of his, her, [or its] authority in executing the contract,\u201d therefore, the contract was duly executed and falls within the waiver of sovereign immunity provided by S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a). <em>See ARA Health, </em>344 Md. at 92, 685 A.2d at 440 (holding that immunity was not waived where a claim did not satisfy the formal requirements of a written contract under S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The County Board contends that the legislative waiver of sovereign immunity contained in S.G. \u00a7 12-201 does not apply because a county board of education is neither a State \u201cunit,\u201d nor a local government entity,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> drawing on the distinction made in <em>Chesapeake Charter </em>in which Judge Wilner discussed the \u201chybrid nature\u201d of county boards of education, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">[Although the county boards are generally regarded as State agencies because they are part of the State public education system, are subject to extensive supervision and control by the State Board of Education, and exercise a State function, <em>from a budgetary and structural perspective, they are local in character. They are not divisions of or units within the State Department of Education. They are subject to the county, not the State, budget process and must justify their budget requests to the county government. </em>Most of their operational funding comes from the county, not the State, government.

Thus, the fine distinction drawn in <em>Chesapeake Charter </em>for the purposes of determining whether a school bus contract (a local, operational expense) was governed by the State\u2019s General Procurement Law, as highlighted by the County Board and the Maryland Association of Boards of Education as amicus curiae, in this case, does not proscribe the application of S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a)\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity to the County Board in the present contract action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>B.

Because S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a) waives the County Board\u2019s sovereign immunity in an action based on a written contract for public school construction, we must ascertain whether the General Assembly intended for a judgment awarded thereunder to be satisfied by funding requested by the Governor as part of a \u201cbudget bill\u201d pursuant to S.G. \u00a7 12-203. Thus, the issue before us is whether \u00a7 12-203 applies to all judgments, or only certain judgments, as it appears the intermediate appellate court concluded. In the later case, it would be necessary to have some intelligible way of discerning which judgments would be the responsibility of the State and which would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held that, pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stem, </em>and notwithstanding the waiver of sovereign immunity, \u201cthe burden of proving the availability of funds to satisfy the judgment is on the party seeking to show a waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity, in this case, BEKA[,]\u201d because \u201cSG \u00a7 12-203 does not provide a mechanism for appropriation of State funds to satisfy a judgment against a county board of education.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 710, 712, 989 A.2d at 1205, 1207. The Court of Special Appeals reviewed the record to ascertain if facts were alleged to indicate that the County Board had the means to satisfy the judgment, through taxation or appropriation. <em>See BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 712-13, 989 A.2d at 1207. Finding none and concluding that several allegations of sources of funding made by BEKA on appeal had not been made at trial, the intermedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ate appellate court determined that a new trial would require fact-finding on the issue of availability of funding. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 715, 989 A.2d at 1208. In our view, additional fact-finding is unnecessary because funding is provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that S.G. \u00a7 12-203 could not be used to satisfy a judgment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">To be sure, this provision generally would satisfy the funding requirement for State agencies. As indicated, however, school boards are \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201chybrid\u201d agencies. <em>See Dean [v. Board of Education of Cecil County </em>], 71 Md.App. [92] at 98 [523 A.2d 1059 (1987)]. These boards, while State agencies for most purposes, \u201care not normally regarded for structural or budgetary purposes, as units within the Executive Branch of the State government.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>358 Md. at 137[, 747 A.2d. at 625].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\"><em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 710-11, 989 A.2d at 1206. The Court of Special Appeals determined that S.G. \u00a7 12-203 did not apply to the present dispute relying largely upon <em>Chesapeake Charter. </em>In that case, we did not consider the sections of the State Government Article, at issue in the present case, because there the parties brought their procurement contract to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (\u201cMSBCA\u201d) pursuant to \u00a7 15-205 of the State Finance and Procurement Article (\u201cS.F.P.\u201d). Consequently, sovereign immunity was not an issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>we held that a county board of education\u2019s school bus contracts were not subject to the General Procurement Law, because the board was not a \u201cunit\u201d of the Executive Branch of the State Government within the meaning of the pertinent statutory provision, S.F.P. \u00a7 11-101(x), and therefore the MSBCA had no jurisdiction over the dispute between the county board and a school bus contractor. <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>358 Md. at 145-46, 747 A.2d at 634. Determining that the language of the pertinent statute was ambiguous, we considered the legislative history and concluded that, other than school construction, the State Board of Public Works and the Department of General Services had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>never \u201cexercised any authority over the procurement of supplies and services by the county boards of education.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>358 Md. at 140, 747 A.2d at 631 (footnote omitted, quoted <em>swpra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Accordingly, our holding in <em>Chesapeake Charter </em>was a narrow one. We determined that \u201cmost of [the county board of education\u2019s] operational funding comes from the county, not the State, government\u201d and that \u201c[t]hey are subject to the county, not the State budget process\u201d therefore the school bus contract was a local, and not a State concern. <em>Chesapeake Charter, </em>358 Md. at 139, 747 A.2d at 631. The Court of Special Appeals relied on this reasoning to conclude that, \u201c[b]ecause county boards of education are subject to the county budget process, it does not appear that the State would be responsible for paying a judgment against a county board of education.... Accordingly, S.G. \u00a7 12-203 does not provide a mechanism for appropriation of State funds to satisfy a judgment against a county board of education.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 712, 989 A.2d at 1207. While we do not disagree that the county board of education must submit a budget to the local government for approval, the funding that is appropriated to fulfill the budget emanates from local, State, and federal sources. This \u201clocal budgetary character,\u201d therefore, appears insufficient to overcome the overwhelming support in our case law for the notion that county boards of education are \u201clegally State agencies.\u201d <em>See Chesapeake Charter, </em>358 Md. at 137, 747 A.2d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Here, the issue is one of statutory construction because we must determine whether S.G. \u00a7 12-203, by its terms, is applicable to the underlying action.

Thus, there is no other burden on BEKA in the instant case to prove the availability of funds, as there was in <em>Ruff, </em>and the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that BEKA bore that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Moreover, we have previously noted that S.G. \u00a7 12-203 was enacted by the General Assembly for the particular purpose of addressing the funding requirement that must precede a waiver of sovereign immunity under S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a). In <em>Stem, </em>we concluded that the General Assembly enacted S.G. \u00a7 12-203 upon an acknowledgment of our reasoning in <em>Maas, </em>173 Md. at 558-60, 197 A. at 125-26 and <em>Ruff, </em>278 Md. at 590-91, 366 A.2d at 366, that sovereign immunity is a valid defense unless funds have been appropriated to pay a judgment or funds may be raised for that purpose, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">The General Assembly is cognizant of how to specifically authorize the power to raise funds in satisfaction of the second prong of the <em>Maas </em>and <em>Ruff </em>test, as it has enacted a power to appropriate funds for the purpose of paying judgments arising from an express legislative waiver of immunity in Md.Code (1984, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 12-203 of the State Government Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\"><em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 715, 846 A.2d at 1010.

Judge Wilner noted that \u201c \u00a7 12-203 requires the Governor to include in the budget bill money that is adequate to satisfy final judgments,\u201d citing \u00a7 52(4) and (12) of Article III of the Maryland Constitution. <em>Stern, </em>380 Md. at 732, 846 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>at 1019, fn. 4.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Section 12-203 applies to the instant case because this Court has determined, <em>supra, </em>that its statutory companion, S.G. \u00a7 12\u2014201(a), waives the County Board\u2019s governmental immunity and the language of S.G. \u00a7 12-203 requires that all judgments rendered against the State, its officers or units, upon breach of a written contract shall be requested by the Governor as part of a budget bill. Furthermore, the application of S.G. \u00a7 12-203 to written contract disputes between a State entity and a private party is consistent with the purpose of providing a waiver to immunity in contract actions involving written agreements. It gives effect to \u201cthe moral obligation on the part of any contracting party, including the State or its political subdivisions, to fulfill the obligations of a contract.\u201d <em>Magnetti, </em>402 Md. at 560, 937 A.2d at 227, fn. 6 (quoting 1976 Md.

Section 5-518(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article does not apply</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The County Board has asserted that the only applicable legislative waiver of its sovereign immunity is exclusively found in C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518 because \u00a7 4-105 of the Education Article states \u201ca county board of education shall have the immunity from liability described under \u00a7 5-518\u201d and this is the only provision in the Education Article that addresses sovereign immunity for county boards of education. E.D. \u00a7 4-105(d). Therefore, the Board contends in its cross-peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tion that it is insulated from paying damages to BEKA over $100,000 (or the amount of its insurance policy) pursuant to C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518(b) and pursuant to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 973 A.2d 233 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">In <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>in the context of what we perceived to be a claim for personal injury resulting from an alleged age discrimination violation, we commented that the term \u201c \u2018any claim\u2019 [under \u00a7 5-518(c) ] cannot reasonably be read to exclude certain categories of claims.\u201d <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. at 215, 973 A.2d at 242 (quoting <em>Zimmer-Rubert v. Board of Ed., </em>179 Md.App. 589, 612, 947 A.2d 135, 149 (2008)). Our interpretation of \u00a7 5-518(e) was clearly in the context of a tort or insurable claim, such as \u201cthose for personal injury,\u201d and for claims arising from \u201calleged employment law violations.\u201d <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. at 216, 973 A.2d at 242. We did not imply in that case that C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518(c) applies to contract claims, nor did we address, by association, the meaning of C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518(b), to which Respondent looks in the present case. Thus, Respondent\u2019s contention that <em>Zimmer-Rubert </em>interpreted C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518 to be applicable to contract claims is incorrect. Moreover, we have found no eases to support the contention that C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518(b) applies to contract claims filed against a county board of education. Therefore, we affirm, without the need for further discussion, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that C.J.P. \u00a7 5-518 does not place limitations on the waiver of sovereign immunity under S.G. \u00a7 12-201(a). <em>See BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 707, 989 A.2d at 1204 (holding \u201c[t]hus, the language of \u00a7 5-518, limiting the liability of a self-insured board of education to $100,000, does not apply to BEKA\u2019s contract claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">III.

Because the questions are factually and procedurally intertwined, we address them together. BEKA first contends that the intermediate appellate court erred by not affirming the portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, by which the trial court barred the County Board from \u201craising the issue.\u201d Secondly, BEKA contends that the County Board\u2019s use of the defense of recoupment is barred as a matter of law. Finally, BEKA asserts that the intermediate appellate court applied incorrectly the abuse of discretion standard of review to ultimately reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of BEKA\u2019s \u201cMotion <em>in Limine </em>to Exclude Evidence of Backcharges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">BEKA\u2019s three questions arise in response to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s consideration of a single question posed to it by the County Board, which asked \u201c[d]id the trial court err in prohibiting the County Board from submitting evidence regarding its [$531,079.52] recoupment claim[.]\u201d In finding that the trial judge abused his discretion, the Court of Special Appeals analyzed this question wholly in the context of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine </em>concluding that it was \u201cunable to determine the basis for the court\u2019s ruling excluding the Board\u2019s evidence of recoupment^]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he inherent contradictions in the trial court\u2019s statements indicate that there was not a sound exercise of discretion in excluding this evidence.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 729, 989 A.2d at 1216. The Court of Special Appeals held that in its view of the record the trial court\u2019s ruling may have been based on a finding that the recoupment issue was not timely asserted and, to that extent, the decision was erroneous because the Board\u2019s \u201cinitial answer preserved the defense.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 729-30, 989 A.2d at 1216-17.

The same \u201centitlement\u201d claim was presented in four subsequent pleadings: (1) the Second Amended Answer filed July 18, 2008; (2) the response to BEKA\u2019s \u201cMotion <em>in Limine </em>to Exclude Evidence of Backcharges\u201d filed August 5, 2008; (3) the Third Amended Answer filed August 12, 2008; and (4) the Board\u2019s \u201cResponse to BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary\u201d Judgment filed August 18, 2008, wherein the Board maintained that no judgment should be entered until the court received evidence concerning certain proposed \u201camounts, credits, backcharges and setoffs totaling $531,080.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">At a motions hearing on September 18, 2008, less than a month before trial, the trial judge struck the County Board\u2019s Counter-Complaint and Amended Answer as untimely, stating: \u201cThe fact that discovery closed just four days before the County Board\u2019s filing of its Countercomplaint unfairly prejudiced BEKA, and the County Board\u2019s Countercomplaint and Amended Answer are stricken.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Secondly, the trial judge barred the defense of recoupment by granting that portion of BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, in which BEKA argued that the County Board \u201cdid not comply with the contract provisions governing changes to BEKA\u2019s work under the contract.\u201d BEKA assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ed that there was no dispute of material fact about the failure of the County Board\u2019s claim for back-charges, credits or setoffs because: (1) \u00a7 4.7.1 of the contract defined a \u201cclaim,\u201d which BEKA argued clearly included the County Board\u2019s recoupment claim; (2) claims must be filed within 7 days and must be substantiated; and (3) claims must be submitted to the Architect for resolution. Therefore, BEKA contended, because the County Board did not submit its \u201cback-charges, credits or setoffs\u201d through this process, it waived its claim. The County Board asserted that there were genuine disputes of the facts related to its claims for recoupment and that the trial court should not enter a money judgment without receiving evidence on the recoupment amounts. The trial judge ruled in BEKA\u2019s favor, stating: \u201cAs to Beka\u2019s Request for Summary Judgment on the issue of credits, back-charges and setoffs, the County Board failed to address Beka\u2019s argument that it did not adhere to the contract provisions for asserting a claim and the County Board should be precluded from raising the issue at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Prior to commencement of trial, on October 6, 2008, the trial judge struck the County Board\u2019s Second and Third Amended Answers, which each raised recoupment, and the court ruled explicitly on BEKA\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine, </em>stating that: \u201cI\u2019m going to bar any evidence of recoupment as an affirmative answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">BEKA asks us to determine whether it was error for the Court of Special Appeals to, in effect, reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Because the Court of Special Appeals did not consider expressly the trial court\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, but rather limited its discussion of the County Board\u2019s recoupment claim to the context of the trial court\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine, BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 727, 989 A.2d at 1216, there is no analysis stated in the intermediate appellate court\u2019s opinion regarding the trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment for this Court to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The intermediate appellate court did not engage in de novo review, which would have inquired into whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling pertaining to the recoupment claim was legally correct. <em>See e.g., Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 163, 913 A.2d 10, 18 (2006) (\u201cWith respect to the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment, the standard of review is de novo.\u201d) (citing <em>Rockwood Cas. Ins. Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>385 Md. 99, 106, 867 A.2d 1026, 1030 (2005)). Upon our review of the grant of the summary judgment motion, however, we conclude that the trial judge was legally incorrect to have granted BEKA\u2019s motion as to the County Board\u2019s recoupment claim. \u201cPrior to determining whether the trial court was legally correct, an appellate court must first determine whether there is any genuine dispute of material facts.... Any factual dispute is resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.... Only when there is an absence of a genuine dispute of material fact will the appellate court determine whether the trial court was correct as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Dashiell, </em>396 Md. at 163, 913 A.2d at 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The facts relevant to the recoupment claim were disputed and therefore the issue should not have been resolved by summary judgment. The County Board claimed it was owed back-charges for ten proposed change orders (\u201cPCOs\u201d), presented to the trial court as Exhibit 2 in BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, restated in the County Board\u2019s \u201cResponse to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment,\u201d and in its \u201cSupplement to Defendant\u2019s Response to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\u201d BEKA asserted that the contract required certain claims procedures, namely provisions 4.7.1, 4.7.2 and 4.7.3, to be followed to pursue such credits, but that the County Board did not follow those procedures. The County Board claimed that it was not required to submit the credits through the claims procedure in the contract. Moreover, it argued that the two contract provisions, 4.7.4 and 5.7.1. permitted the withholding of payment on uncontested amounts until all unsettled claims were determined. The trial judge ruled that because \u201cthe Board failed to address Beka\u2019s argument that it did not adhere to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>contract provisions for asserting a claim ... the Board should be precluded from raising the issue at this time.\u201d In our view, the trial court erred in arriving at this legal conclusion despite several disputed, material facts concerning legal requirements of the contract; the impact of contract modifications made by the parties; the timeliness of submissions of claims to the architect prior to litigation; and the precise monetary amounts owed to BEKA because of changes to its scope of work or credits for nonperformance owed to the County Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Even if there were no disputed material facts the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the County Board \u201cfailed to address Beka\u2019s argument that it did not adhere to the contract provisions for asserting a claim,\u201d is not supported by the record.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The record indicates that the County Board did in fact address the issue of compliance with the contract procedures in at least two pleadings, the \u201cResponse to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\u201d and the \u201cSupplement to Defendant\u2019s Response to Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">C. Recoupment Claim Not Barred as a Matter of Law</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">The Court of Special Appeals suggested that on remand the [trial] court can address the contention that the Board is not entitled to present its recoupment defense because it failed to follow the procedures set forth in the contract for asserting a claim. Neither party addressed whether a defense of recoupment, as opposed to an affirmative complaint, would be subject to the claims procedure set forth in the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\"><em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 730, 989 A.2d at 1217, fn. 37. In our view, this statement likely prompted BEKA\u2019s second argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ment that, in effect, the distinction described by the intermediate appellate court is irrelevant and would not need to be addressed on remand. BEKA asserts that because the trial judge struck the County Board\u2019s Counter-Complaint, which included its recoupment claim as a cause of action against BEKA, the County Board had no legally, subsisting affirmative claim for recoupment and therefore the \u201cdefense\u201d of recoupment was barred as a matter of law. BEKA argues, \u201c[i]n other words, if the defendant has no legally subsisting cause of action, the defendant should not be able to counterbalance or diminish the plaintiffs claim through the defense of recoupment.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">As BEKA notes, the intermediate appellate court did not address this issue directly because it only considered the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on BEKA\u2019s motion in limine. The Court of Special Appeals indirectly indicated, however, that the trial judge\u2019s ruling to strike the Counter-Complaint (and the later exclusion by granting BEKA\u2019s Motion <em>in </em>Limine) had no impact on the recoupment claim because it was implied and preserved by the County Board\u2019s initial answer. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 729-30, 989 A.2d at 1217 (holding that recoupment need not be specifically pled under Md. Rule 2-323(d) and therefore it was timely raised and preserved for appellate review by the County Board\u2019s initial answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">BEKA relies on <em>Inibesi </em>to support this assertion; however, that case did not address recoupment, but rather a set-off claim<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in an unrelated transaction that was statutorily barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>by a provision of the Estates and Trusts Article of the Maryland Code. <em>Imbesi </em>357 Md. at 392, 744 A.2d. at 558 (\u201cWhether the result is the same if the estate\u2019s debtor raises recoupment is an issue that need not presently be decided.\u201d). Thus, <em>Imbesi </em>does not assist with the resolution of the treatment of the County Board\u2019s recoupment claim in the instant case. BEKA also calls our attention to <em>Cohen v. Karp, </em>143 Md. 208, 122 A. 524 (1923), where this Court noted that a set-off to a judgment was a defense that could be raised if the defendant had \u201ca right to receive the amount due him from the plaintiff, [and] his claim ... [is] of such a nature that he can sue for and recover it in a court of law.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>143 Md. at 211, 122 A. at 525 (noting that \u201c[t]he defense of set-off, technically, means a cross-claim\u201d). Finally, BEKA relies upon <em>Telmark, Inc. v. C &amp; R Farms, Inc. et al., </em>115 A.D.2d 966, 966-67, 497 N.Y.S.2d 536 (1985) in which a New York intermediate appellate court held that because of the express terms of a lease agreement \u201c \u2018under no circumstances\u2019 ... [could] the defendants have a cause of action against plaintiff for consequential damages, [therefore] they cannot assert such claim in recoupment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In <em>Telmark, </em>unlike the instant case, a lease agreement between the parties contractually precluded the defendants from suing the plaintiff for consequential damages and so recoupment could not be used as a \u201cback-door\u201d mechanism for raising the issue. <em>Telmark, </em>115 A.D.2d at 966-67, 497 N.Y.S.2d 536. Similarly, in <em>Imbesi </em>the preclusive effect of a statutory bar to a set-off claim (not a recoupment claim) was dispositive. <em>Imbesi </em>357 Md. at 392, 744 A.2d at 558. In <em>Cohen, </em>again a case about set-offs and not recoupment, this Court held that the trial judge erred in not granting a motion to arrest a judgment because the plaintiff had been ordered erroneously to pay co-defendants the excess of their set-off claim against him. <em>Cohen, </em>143 Md. at 212-13, 122 A. at 525. <em>Cohen, </em>therefore, does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Here, there was no factual conclusion on the record about whether the contract would apply to the County Board\u2019s recoupment defense for \u201cback-charges, credits and/or set-offs,\u201d as the Court of Special Appeals correctly pointed out. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 729, 989 A.2d at 1217. Because we hold that the trial judge\u2019s rulings precluding the County Board from presenting its evidence on recoupment were in error, and the question of whether the contract precludes a claim by the County Board for \u201cback-charges, credits and/or set-offs\u201d remains unresolved, we hold that the recoupment issue, whether a \u201cdefense\u201d or \u201caffirmative claim,\u201d is not barred and in fact must be addressed in a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">D. Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">To address BEKA\u2019s third argument, we consider whether the Court of Special Appeals erred by holding that the trial judge abused his discretion when he granted BEKA\u2019s \u201cMotion <em>in Limine </em>to Exclude Evidence of Defendant\u2019s Backcharges.\u201d As the Court of Special Appeals noted, we have said also that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">[j]udicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn from objective criteria; it means a sound judgment exercised with regard to what is right under the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>393 Md. 269, 279, 900 A.2d 765, 771 (2006) (citing <em>Gunning v. State, </em>347 Md. 332, 351, 701 A.2d 374, 383 (1997)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\"><em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 727-28, 989 A.2d at 1216. BEKA asserts that there was no abuse of discretion because the trial judge had already barred the recoupment defense in his grant of its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, the trial judge had granted all motions striking the County Board\u2019s amended pleadings that raised recoupment, the County Board had committed discovery violations warranting exclusion of the evidence, and even if BEKA had the recoupment information it did not know that the County Board was going to use the credits as an affirmative claim or affirmative defense. Conversely, the County Board asserts that the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Appeals was correct to find abuse of discretion because the trial judge excluded the evidence without commenting or engaging in any fact finding on the disagreement between opposing counsel on the allegation of discovery violations, the County Board\u2019s responses to BEKA\u2019s motion identified sources of information substantiating the recoupment claim dating back to February 2008 (well before the commencement of trial), and that the trial judge should have taken a more conservative approach in responding to the discovery dispute under Md. Rule 2-433 (\u201cSanctions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">BEKA\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>was based entirely on allegations that the County Board violated unspecified discovery rules. Recently, we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">The decision as to which remedy or sanction to impose [for a discovery violation] generally rests within the broad discretion of the trial court. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 570, 919 A.2d 49, 57 (2007)____Ordinarily, a court will \u201cimpose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 571, 919 A.2d at 58. This Court has explained that in remedying a discovery violation, the court should weigh [\u201c](1) the reasons why the disclosure was not made; (2) the existence and amount of any prejudice to the opposing party; (3) the feasability of curing any prejudice ...; and (4) any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>[Thomas </em>] at 570-71, 919 A.2d at 57-58; <em>see also Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 390-91, 456 A.2d 29, 37 (1983) (enumerating similar factors and stating that the factors \u201cdo not lend themselves to a compartmental analysis\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\"><em>Williams v. State, </em>416 Md. 670, 698-99, 7 A.3d 1038, 1054 (2010). We have not required that statements addressing each of these factors be part of the record. The Court of Special Appeals held, in the present case, that the trial judge\u2019s ruling was an abuse of discretion because it concluded that the trial judge\u2019s statements leading up to the ruling contained \u201cinherent contradictions\u201d and that there was an erroneous \u201cbasis\u201d for the ruling. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 729, 989 A.2d at 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>BEKA\u2019s motion alleged that the County Board had failed to produce information substantiating its recoupment claim totaling $531,079.52 and that it was severely prejudiced by this withholding because it could not prepare a defense without the ability to determine the reasonableness of the pricing of material and labor in the discrete claims. During argument on the motion, BEKA claimed that it wanted the trial judge to strike two particular pieces of evidence that it alleged were filed untimely by the County Board, namely the August 20, 2008 filing of a Supplement to Answers to Interrogatories and a Supplement to Document Production. BEKA claimed that the documents did not substantiate the claim for back-charges because the documents did not contain the specificity required by the claims procedure under the contract. The County Board alleged, however, that BEKA had been in possession of the same information since commencement of litigation in February 2008 and therefore there was no prejudice. The County Board also noted that BEKA had not made any formal allegations of violation of the discovery rules, therefore, pursuant to <em>Food Lion v. McNeill, </em>393 Md. 715, 904 A.2d 464 (2006), it should not be granted the extreme relief of exclusion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">What is clear from the record is that the trial judge had issued three rulings to bar evidence of the County Board\u2019s recoupment claim prior to his ruling on the motion in limine and each time the ruling had favored BEKA. In granting BEKA\u2019s motion in limine to exclude the County Board\u2019s evidence of recoupment, the trial judge simply stated: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll enter my ruling ... I\u2019m going to bar any evidence of recoupment as an affirmative answer.\u201d No other evidence or rationale exists in the record explaining or elaborating on the trial judge\u2019s determination of the validity of BEKA\u2019s allegations regarding the discovery violations, prejudice, or waiver because of violation of the contract terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that there is scant commentary from the trial judge regarding his deliberation on BEKA\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>except to indicate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>belief that he had already ruled on the substantive issue of presentation of the recoupment claim by striking the Counter-Complaint and Amended Answer and that the County Board\u2019s counsel apparently annoyed the court with its circular presentation of its recoupment claim. The particular phrasing of the ruling, barring evidence of recoupment as \u201can affirmative answer,\u201d indicates that the trial judge may have been persuaded by BEKA\u2019s argument that it was prejudiced by failing to appreciate that information provided on \u201cbackcharges, credits and/or set-offs\u201d at the beginning of litigation would be used as an \u201caffirmative answer\u201d or \u201caffirmative defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Notwithstanding the alleged prejudice, there is no legal reasoning stated on the record supporting the trial judge\u2019s grant of this motion. The trial judge should have engaged in some factual and legal analysis regarding treatment of the recoupment claim pursuant to, or outside, of the contract. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, in spite of the trial judge\u2019s apparent fatigue with the issue, the Board should have been permitted to present evidence to support its recoupment claim because the record indicates that the Board put BEKA on notice of its claims during discovery. Moreover, BEKA never formally alleged that discovery was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">IY. Interpretation of the Contract: \u201cDelay Damages\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court\u2019s final judgment must be reversed because of a failure to comply with Md. Rule 2-522(a)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and because it was impossible to know whether \u201cdelay damages\u201d had been awarded in the judgment, when as a legal matter, delay damages were expressly precluded by the terms of the Contract. BEKA contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that the contract contained a broad \u201cno-damages-for-delay\u201d clause. There is no evidence in the record that the trial judge engaged in any legal analysis of the issue of delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>damages under the contract, ostensibly because BEKA did not present its claim for damages under Counts 23, 40, 42, 44 and 45 as \u201cdelay damages\u201d even though in closing argument the County Board asserted that characterization.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Having been asked by the County Board on appeal, however, to determine if BEKA was entitled to \u201cdelay damages\u201d under the contract, the intermediate appellate court reviewed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The interpretation of written contracts presents a question of law for the trial court, which an appellate court reviews de novo. <em>United Services v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 79, 899 A.2d 819, 833 (2006) (quoting <em>Towson University v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 78, 862 A.2d 941, 946 (2004)). \u201cCourts in Maryland follow the law of objective interpretation of contracts, \u2018giving effect to the clear terms of the contract regardless of what the parties to the contract may have believed those terms to mean.\u2019 \u201d <em>Riley, </em>393 Md. at 79, 899 A.2d at 833 (quoting <em>Towson University, </em>384 Md. at 78, 862 A.2d at 946-47).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held that \u00a7 8.3.1 of the Contract precluded BEKA from recovering \u201cdelay damages\u201d from the County Board because the express language provided that \u201c[extension of time shall be Contractor\u2019s sole remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>for delay.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 734, 989 A.2d at 1219 (quoting \u00a7 8.3.1. of the disputed contract). BEKA asserted that even if \u00a7 8.3.1 barred delay damages, other provisions in the Contract modified the plain language of \u00a7 8.3.1 thereby expressing the parties mutual assent to accommodate delay damages. On that point, the intermediate appellate court held that \u201cthe parties nullified other provisions in the contract that may have allowed damages for costs incurred due to delay. Thus, the contract here clearly precluded BEKA from recovering damages for delay.\u201d <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 734, 989 A.2d at 1219-20. The Court of Special Appeals did not identify which \u201cother provisions\u201d had been nullified by the parties or how.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In response to BEKA\u2019s alternative assertions that its claims on Counts 23, 40, 42, 44 and 45, totaling $448,349, were not \u201cdelay damages\u201d but \u201cdirect costs\u201d recoverable under the contract, or that they were delay damages but the clause was unenforceable because of nefarious actions by the County Board, the intermediate appellate court determined that both were determinations appropriately made by the trier of fact, but that \u201cthe trial court made no factual findings\u201d on the issues. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 735, 989 A.2d at 1220. Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE6\">we cannot ascertain if the court found: (1) as a matter of law, that the contract did not preclude delay damages; (2) as a matter of fact that the damages sought were not delay damages; (3) as a matter of the fact that the damages sought were for delay, but the Board\u2019s actions prevented enforcement of the no-damages-for-delay provisions; or (4) that some of the claims were not timely submitted pursuant to the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 736, 989 A.2d at 1220. Therefore, lacking factual and legal conclusions upon which to assess whether it would be appropriate to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, the intermediate appellate court reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. <em>See e.g., Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>414 Md. 556, 565, 996 A.2d 382, 387 (2010) (\u201cPursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(c), where, as here, an action has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. We will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous.\u201d) (citing Md. Rule 8-131(e)). We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">V. Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The trial judge announced the judgment of the court on the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">Counsel, certainly we have fully aired the issue and I appreciate your advocacy on both sides, but here\u2019s the way I see it. I\u2019m disallowing any claim for prejudgment interest which I\u2019m going to do. I see the claim being $1,215,035 and I understand that the Board believes the proper amount is $505,487. There\u2019s much to be said on both sides on what has been a very unhappy performance of contract, and the public unfortunately has to pay the brunt of the cost of the contentious attitude of the Board in administering this money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">I\u2019m therefore going to compromise the claim and I\u2019m going to allow $1,100,000 as the judgment against the County or the Board in final resolution of the claims and counterclaims. And that judgment will enter as of today and of course will draw interest from this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The parties contest the specificity with which the trial court must address the discrete claims pursuant to Md. Rule 2-522, which requires that the trial judge must \u201cprepare and file or dictate into the record a brief statement of the reasons for the decision and the basis of determining any damages.\u201d Md. Rule 2-522(a). Before this Court, BEKA contends that the Court of Special Appeals has erred because the trial judge \u201cis presumed to know, and properly apply, the law\u201d and \u201cthe record is replete with competent and largely unrebutted evidence,\u201d so that the trial judge \u201cproperly used the jury verdict approach in determining the amount of damages to award to BEKA.\u201d Moreover, BEKA asserts that the trial judge\u2019s statement complies with Md. Rule 2-522(a) because the judge\u2019s \u201cdecision indicates that he took all of the claims and counterclaims into consideration and determined that Beka was enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tied to recover $1.1 million.\u201d To the contrary, the County Board has urged us to uphold the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s application of Md. Rule 2-522 in the instant case because \u201c[s]eparate claims [49 counts in Beka\u2019s original complaint] for damages with specific evidence for each were presented[,]\u201d and the \u201ctrial court did not state which of the 49 counts of Plaintiffs Complaint had been proven, nor did the court address the myriad of issues presented to it[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial judge did not comply with Md. Rule 2-522(a), and it is apparent from the record that the trial judge entered the \u201ccompromise verdict\u201d without any correlation between the grounds for BEKA\u2019s various claims for damages and the amount of damages ultimately awarded. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 735, 989 A.2d at 1219-20. Because of the lack of documentation on how the trial judge resolved the issue of damages owed under the contract, the Court of Special Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial. <em>BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. at 735-36, 989 A.2d at 1220. Notwithstanding the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s rationale for its judgment, we conclude that the judgment with respect to recoupment and \u201cdelay damages\u201d cannot stand because the County Board should have been permitted to introduce evidence on its \u201cback-charges, credits, and set-offs\u201d and the issue pertaining to an improper award of \u201cdelay damages\u201d must be fully aired.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

Neither party has briefed this Court on the particular amounts of money they deem owed under and/or as a consequence of breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>contract. BEKA\u2019s Complaint alleged 49 counts related to the County Board\u2019s nonperformance and breach of the contract. Forty-six counts for breach of contract alleged monetary amounts for proposed-change orders (PCOs) that BEKA was owed. BEKA took the sum owed by the County Board under the original contract, $361,991.47 and the amount owed under 42 PCOs, $795,062.28, to claim $1,157,053.75 in its Complaint. Throughout, BEKA claimed that it was entitled to the balance the County Board owed on the contract, $ 361,991.47. Both parties agreed that this amount was owed and it was undoubtedly awarded as part of the trial court\u2019s resolution of BEKA\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on September 18, 2008. In its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, BEKA additionally claimed that the County Board undisputably owed it certain additional amounts for PCOs that fell into two categories: 15 PCOs that had been approved in accordance with the contract procedures, but that had not been paid, $18,008.19; and 13 PCOs that the County Board had agreed to satisfy in partial amounts, that were also unpaid, $67,487.05, for a total PCO claim by BEKA of $85,495.24. When the trial court ruled on BEKA's motion, it denied the motion \"as it relates to outstanding PCOs[,]\u201d which meant that the amount the County Board would owe on the unpaid PCOs would be litigated at trial and not resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In its Amended Answer, Second Amended Answer, and Third Amended Answers, the County Board tallied its balance owing as $472,093.38 ($1,893,945.53, the original contract price plus approved changes, discounted by executed payments to BEKA of $1,421,852.15) owed on the balance of the original contract and $85,513.90 owed on the 28 PCOs identified by BEKA, for a total amount owed to BEKA of $557,607.28. Therefore, at the start of trial, the County Board believed it owed only $26,527.76 (its accounting of the contract balance and PCO payments owed, discounted by its \"credits, backcharges, and/or set-offs\u201d). Before this Court, the County Board now contends that it has paid BEKA all monies owed under the contract, except for the $531,080 that comprises its recoupment claim. The trial judge did not correlate the \"final amounts\u201d that he considered in ordering the compromise verdict, i.e., $1,215,035 for BEKA and $505,487, to either BEKA\u2019s Complaint or the County Board\u2019s Answer and persisting claim for recoupment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-13\">.

The applicability of sovereign immunity to bar a claim depends upon three factors: (1) the applicability of the doctrine of sovereign immunity to the governmental entity; (2) a legislative waiver of sovereign immunity; (3) and means to satisfy a judgment. <em>Board v. John K. Ruff, Inc., </em>278 Md. 580, 590-91, 366 A.2d 360, 366 (1976) (remanding the case for fact finding on the availability of funding to satisfy the judgment) (citations omitted). Contrary to Petitioner's assertion, these three questions remain pertinent despite the statutory scheme provided in 1976 by the enactment of the Sovereign Immunity Act, presently codified at \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 through 12-204 of the State Government Article. Petitioner asserts that it was unnecessary for the Court of Special Appeals to consider the third prong, i.e., whether there were funds or a funding mechanism available for the satisfaction of the judgment because S.G. \u00a7 12-203 provides the funding mechanism. <em>Board of Ed. v. BEKA, </em>190 Md.App. 668, 692, 989 A.2d 1181, 1195 (2010) (relying on <em>Stem, </em>380 Md. at 700-01, 846 A.2d at 1001-02, which in turn relied on <em>Ruff, </em>278 Md. at 590, 366 A.2d at 366). Conversely, the County Board contends that the <em>Ruff </em>test was not abrogated by the statute, and therefore it was still incumbent upon BEKA to prove the availability of funding in order to effect a waiver of the County Board\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">In our view, on this point, the intermediate appellate court was correct in applying the three-step test set forth in <em>Ruff, </em>278 Md. at 586, 366 A.2d at 363, and reaffirmed by our decision in <em>Stem, </em>380 Md. at 700-01, 846 A.2d at 1001-02. It was necessary for the court to consider first whether the County Board qualified for the protection of sovereign immunity, then secondly whether that protection had been waived by statute, and third whether a judgment could be funded. <em>See Stem, </em>380 Md. at 700-01, 846 A.2d at 1001-02; <em>Ruff, </em>278 Md. at 586, 366 A.2d at 363.

In its brief, the County Board contends that its Answers to Interrogatories put BEKA on notice of its intention to claim recoupment in the event of litigation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">[T]he Board provided a chart with its Answers detailing ten specific credits the Board claimed totaling $531,080, the basis for its entitlement to each credit, and the position BEBO, took with respect to each item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">Through this early warning, BEB\u00cdA was on notice, assuming prelitigation discussions and correspondence were insufficient, that the Board intended to present evidence and argue at trial that $531,080 of BEKA\u2019s lump sum contract had not been earned due to BEKA's non-performance of certain work. Thus the Board wanted to recoup the money.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">. We question whether the trial judge correctly stated the discovery time line in his ruling on the Board\u2019s Counter-Complaint and Amended Answer. The scheduling order apparently allowed \u201camendments to pleadings\u201d up until 20 days prior to the trial date. When the July 14th pleadings were filed, the case was set to commence on August 18th and so the discovery time line would not have been violated. After two postponements, trial began on October 6, 2008. Error or not, it is immaterial because, as we explain <em>infra, </em>we remand for a new trial and affirm that the issue of recoupment was raised and preserved by the Board's initial Answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">. In this Court, BEKA asserts that the trial judge found that the County Board had \"failed to follow the terms and conditions required by the contract.\u201d The record, however, does not reflect that assertion, but suggests that the trial judge concluded only that the County Board did not provide argument on the point. In our view of the record, the trial judge did not make a finding about whether the Board's actions had violated the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\">. The Comity Board filed a separate Complaint against BEKA alleging the \"same backcharges\u201d in the Circuit Court for Worcester County on September 26, 2008, just prior to the October 6, 2008 trial date in the present litigation, which complaint was dismissed on October 2, 2009 on the grounds of <em>res judicata. </em>The Court of Special Appeals heard the present case on November 4, 2009 and issued its opinion on February 26, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. A set-off claim, contrary to a recoupment claim, is a \"diminution or a complete counterbalancing of the adversary's claim based upon circumstances arising out of a transaction <em>other than that on which the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>adversary\u2019s claim is based </em>....\u201d <em>Imbesi v.

Maryland Rule 2-522(a) states that in a bench trial, \"the judge, before or at the time judgment is entered, shall prepare and file or dictate into the record a brief statement of the reasons for the decision and the basis of determining any damages.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">. The disputed PCOs, categorized by the County Board as improper \"delay damages,\u201d include: Counts 23, 40, 42, 44 and 45 of BEKA's Complaint. In a letter dated September 11, 2007, from the Architect to the County Board of Education, admitted into evidence as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 40, explanations of denials of those PCOs were given. Count 23 (PCO 86) demanded $ 27,237 for costs incurred from March 24 to April 4, 2006 while waiting for debris to be removed from a ballfield and play area, which BEKA described as \"idle costs due to suspension of work\u201d and the Architect denied as not allowed pursuant to \u00a7 8.3.1 of the contract. In Count 40 (sewer), BEKA claimed $92,473 for costs allegedly incurred from February to August 2005 waiting for \u201cchanges to sanitary sewer design,\u201d part of which was paid and part denied as not permitted under the contract. In Count 42 (PCO 104), BEKA demanded $299,081 for costs allegedly incurred from November 21, 2005 through April 4, 2006 for \"expansion of project\u201d, which was denied because of the appearance of a \"delay claim\u201d and submission as part of other PCOs. In Counts 44 (PCO 106) and 45 (PCO 107), BEKA claimed $29,558 for costs allegedly incurred waiting for direction on topsoil installation and completion of the playground, which were both denied as untimely and not allowed under the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
