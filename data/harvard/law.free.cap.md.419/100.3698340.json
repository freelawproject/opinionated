He appealed the judgments of conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, where he raised a number of claims. The Court of Special Appeals, finding merit in some of those claims, reversed the convictions. The court remanded the case for a new trial on the charges of attempted armed robbery and use of a handgun, but not the charges of second degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit second degree murder. <em>Goldsberry v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 394, 957 A.2d 1110 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We granted the parties\u2019 respective petitions for certiorari to consider whether: (1) the trial court violated Goldsberry\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to representation by his counsel of choice, by disqualifying one of Goldsberry\u2019s three privately retained attorneys; (2) the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury regarding unanimity; and (3) the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Goldsberry was improperly convicted of the \u201cnonexistent\u201d crime of second degree felony murder predicated on attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court violated Goldsberry\u2019s right to counsel of choice and the intermediate appellate court erred in its holding regarding the felony murder conviction. Because our disposition entitles Goldsberry to a new trial, we do not address the propriety of the court\u2019s unanimity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Goldsberry and his co-defendant, James Myers, Jr., were tried jointly on charges arising from the homicide of Vincent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Chamberlain. As explained in more detail <em>infra, </em>the jury-found that Goldsberry and Myers attempted to rob Chamberlain of his marijuana, and while doing so, Myers shot Chamberlain in the head, killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Goldsberry hired attorneys Andrew Jezic, Joseph McKenzie, and John Giannetti, each of a different law firm, to represent him at trial. Before trial, Myers filed a motion to sever his trial from that of Goldsberry. At the hearing on that motion, Myers, through his counsel, Janet Hart, informed the court that attorney McKenzie had spoken previously to Myers regarding the facts of the case. Ms. Hart was not certain of the exact date on which the conversation took place, the purpose of the conversation, whether McKenzie by that time had entered his appearance on behalf of Goldsberry, and whether Myers was represented by counsel at the time. Hart nevertheless alleged that the conversation between her client and McKenzie posed possible violations of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.18<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (pertaining to an attorney\u2019s duties to prospective clients) and 4.2 (concerning attorney communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>cations with a person already represented by counsel).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hart further explained that McKenzie informed her that, after the conversation with Myers, he called the District Court and learned that there was no line of appearance filed on behalf of Myers. Hart noted, however, that the District Court computer system \u201cvery often\u201d does not reflect accurately the correct date of the line of appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Hart argued to the trial court that McKenzie\u2019s actions prejudiced her client in two ways. First, Myers would be assessing throughout trial whether to testify, and the possibility of McKenzie\u2019s cross-examining him would \u201caffect[ ] [Myers\u2019s] ability to make a clear, unencumbered decision.\u201d Second, if Myers testified and McKenzie cross-examined him, it would \u201clook[ ] wrong\u201d because McKenzie had already discussed the facts of the case with him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In response, attorney Jezic explained that McKenzie had not entered his appearance for Goldsberry when he spoke with Myers and McKenzie never represented to Myers that he was a \u201cdisinterested person.\u201d Jezic also noted that the conversation took place before Myers\u2019s preliminary hearing date and, after McKenzie informed Jezic of the conversation with Myers, the two took several actions to mitigate any possible rule violations. First, McKenzie, upon learning that Myers was unrepresented, called the District Court and attempted to obtain counsel for Myers. And, second, Jezic and McKenzie never discussed \u201canything that Mr. Myers said.\u201d McKenzie supplemented Jezic\u2019s representations, adding that, although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>had discussed the facts of the case with Myers, at no time during the conversation did Myers make any admissions. McKenzie also confirmed Jezic\u2019s representation to the court that the conversation with Myers took place prior to the indictments of Goldsberry and Myers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">After hearing from both parties on the issue, the trial court found as a fact that the conversation between Myers and McKenzie took place before Myers was indicted. And, based on Jezic\u2019s and McKenzie\u2019s representations, the court further found that \u201cMr. McKenzie did not convey to Mr. Jezic the sum and substance ... or any summary, for that matter, of any conversation [Mr. McKenzie] had with Mr. Myers.\u201d The court stated: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Mr. McKenzie did not know that anybody was representing Mr. Myers when he talked to him, and the reality is there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with an attorney, who may be representing a co-defendant, trying to communicate with the other defendant if that defendant is not represented.\u201d The court denied the motion for severance and, instead, imposed restrictions on McKenzie\u2019s involvement in the trial. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Very simply, Mr. Jezic, you represent [Goldsberry], and Mr. McKenzie is not representing him anymore. The reality is that there\u2019s been absolutely no prejudice to [Goldsberry], but the reality is that\u2014you can and, Mr. McKenzie, you can step back from the trial table, but the reality is\u2014and you can consult with Mr. Jezic during the course of the trial, but we\u2019re going to keep this trial going forward wherein there\u2019s no taint whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Jezic objected. He argued that, because Goldsberry desired McKenzie\u2019s continued presence at the trial table, the restriction on McKenzie\u2019s involvement violated Goldsberry\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice. The court then modified its ruling, explaining that McKenzie could re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>main at the trial table, but was not to reveal to Jezic anything related to his conversation with Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">At that point, the State brought to the trial court\u2019s attention a second potential conflict, one that involved McKenzie and Ms. Tawanna Davis, who was scheduled to testify as a State\u2019s witness. Ms. Davis, according to the State, had testified before the grand jury that she was \u201ccoached\u201d by Goldsberry and McKenzie. The State advised the court that, if Davis \u201csomehow chang[ed] her testimony from what she had told the grand jury,\u201d \u201cthere might come a point in time where I\u2019m going to ask her if she was coached by an attorney.\u201d The court, on hearing that, ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">That\u2019s all the more reason [to disqualify McKenzie]. McKenzie put himself in the position of being a possible witness in this case. <em>So with that in mind, the Court is even more comfortable now than it was two minutes ago with telling Mr. McKenzie that he can\u2019t participate in this trial. </em>So we\u2019re not going to take any chances. Mr. McKenzie will not now be sitting at the trial table, not because [Goldsberry] does not want him to, but the reality is he could potentially be a witness in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Jezic renewed his earlier objection, arguing once again that the restriction on McKenzie\u2019s ability to represent Goldsberry violated Goldsberry\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to choice of counsel. The court responded that it believed \u201cthere\u2019s an exception if [McKenzie is] going to be a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Trial commenced on January 31, 2007. It is unnecessary, for purposes of the issues we decide here, to recount all that occurred at trial. To set the factual context within which those issues arose, we shall rely on the summary of the underlying facts set forth in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">. Wendy Braxton, an acquaintance of both Goldsberry and the victim, Vincent Chamberlain, and the sole witness to the attempted robbery and shooting of Mr. Chamberlain, gave an uncontradicted account of the events at trial. Ms. Braxton testified that sometime in March 2006, while visiting Goldsberry, she received a call from Mr. Chamberlain inviting her and Goldsberry to come to Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s house to smoke marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">On arriving at the house, Mr. Chamberlain handed Ms. Braxton some marijuana to roll and while doing so, she heard Goldsberry and Mr. Chamberlain discuss selling Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s marijuana. The three then proceeded to a field behind the house to smoke some of the marijuana. Ms. Braxton again observed Goldsberry and Mr. Chamberlain conversing as they returned from the field. Ms. Braxton then departed with Goldsberry and dropped him off at his apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">Ms. Braxton further testified that Goldsberry called her later that evening to ask questions about Mr. Chamberlain. He asked, in particular, \u201chow long she knew Mr. Chamberlain\u201d and if \u201che was cool and stuff.\u201d Ms. Braxton subsequently received a call from Mr. Chamberlain asking if she wanted to play cards and requesting that she pick him up. On arriving at Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s home at approximately 10:00 p.m., Ms. Braxton testified that she saw Goldsberry and another individual parked in front of the house. Golds-berry exited the car and spoke with Mr. Chamberlain outside the house. Ms. Braxton further testified that Golds-berry left in his car, after stating that he had to \u201cgo get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>something.\u201d On returning, Goldsberry proceeded with Mr. Chamberlain to a shed attached to the rear of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">Ms. Braxton got out of her car several minutes later and went to the shed to ask Mr. Chamberlain if she could use the bathroom. While at the rear of the house near the shed, Ms. Braxton saw Goldsberry walk towards the front of the house and return with Mr. Myers. Ms. Braxton testified that as Goldsberry and Mr. Myers entered the shed and approached the door leading to the house, Goldsberry drew a gun on Mr. Chamberlain, pointed the gun at Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s face, and said \u201cgive me the stuff.\u201d She then observed Mr. Myers pull a gun from his pocket. Goldsberry repeated \u201cgive me the stuff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">Ms. Braxton ran to hide behind a tree in the backyard, where she observed Mr. Myers chasing Mr. Chamberlain. She testified that prior to hearing the gun shot, she saw Mr. Myers pointing the gun at Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s head. Ms. Braxton then saw Goldsberry run out of the shed, Mr. Myers run around to the front of the house, and Mr. Chamberlain fall to the ground. After Mr. Myers and Goldsberry fled the scene, Ms. Braxton ran to Mr. Chamberlain and saw blood coming from his head. Unsure of what to do, Ms. Braxton got in her car and left the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">As Ms. Braxton was \u201cdriving around,\u201d Goldsberry called her, asked if she had gone to the police, and requested that they meet. When Ms. Braxton told Goldsberry \u201cI\u2019m not going to meet up with you so that you can kill me like you did Vincent,\u201d Goldsberry told her that \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. I didn\u2019t know that was going to happen. I just went there to rob him, and James got scared and he killed him.\u201d Golds-berry warned her that \u201csnitches get stitches.\u201d Ms. Braxton also testified that Goldsberry offered her money, discussed the need \u201cto make up a story,\u201d and told her to tell police he was not at the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Fearing for her safety, Ms. Braxton went to stay with a friend. Over the next 72 hours, she was called by Goldsberry \u201cfour or five times a day.\u201d During those conversations, Goldsberry asked repeatedly where she was and if she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>spoken with the police. Ms. Braxton\u2019s family, upon being told by her of what she had witnessed, convinced her that she must inform the police. Three days after the incident, Ms. Braxton went to the police station, where she identified Myers as the \u201cperson who shot\u201d Chamberlain and Goldsberry as having been present at the shooting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 400-02, 957 A.2d at 1114-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, Goldsberry moved for a mistrial, raising once again the Sixth Amendment counsel of choice argument, and noting that \u201cMr. McKenzie has not been able to participate in the entire trial\u201d and had been \u201coutside of the courtroom the entire case.\u201d The court denied Goldsberry\u2019s motion for a mistrial, stating: \u201cI have allowed [ ] Mr. McKenzie to communicate with you [Mr. Jezic] and Mr. Giannetti in terms of representing [Goldsberry], The fact that he\u2019s outside of the courtroom doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t communicate, and, obviously, I take note that, apparently, he has been communicating with you.\u201d The court further stated that Goldsberry had not been prejudiced during the trial by Mr. McKenzie\u2019s absence. Mr. Jezic reminded the court that, because McKenzie had been subject to the rule on witnesses,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> neither Jezic nor Giannetti had discussed with McKenzie anything related to the evidence adduced at trial. The court replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not what the Court ruled though. I said he could go ahead and communicate with you. The only thing he couldn\u2019t do was tell you what his conversations were with Mr. Myers.\u201d The court evidently forgot its earlier admonition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>defense counsel that Mr. McKenzie has \u201cgot to go outside because he may be a potential witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">At the close of all the evidence, the court gave the following instructions concerning felony murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Question number two reads\u2014and this is what we call felony murder. It\u2019s different from first degree premeditated murder. Felony murder can be divided into two different degrees. Question two deals with first degree felony murder. That means that each defendant is charged with the crime of felony murder. If your verdict is not guilty on question one [first degree premeditated murder], then you go onto two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">In order to prove the elements of question two, the State must prove that the defendant, or another participating in the crime with that defendant, committed or attempted to commit the underlying felony. The underlying felony in this case is question five, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. So that\u2019s a precursor to question two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">Number two, the second element, is that the defendant, or another participating in the crime, killed the victim, in this case Mr. Chamberlain. That the defendant, or another person participating in the crime, killed the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">And, number three, that the act resulting in the death of the victim occurred during the commission of the underlying felony. In this particular case, the underlying crime is the attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. So if the murder occurred during the course of the attempted robbery, that satisfies that element, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">It is not necessary for the State to prove that the particular defendant intended to kill the victim. So in the felony murder, the intent to kill is not necessary to prove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">Now, that would be the definition of first degree felony murder, question number two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">If your verdict is not guilty of question number two, then you would go to question number three, which is second degree felony murder. Second degree felony murder means that the defendant, or another participating in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>crime with the defendant, committed or attempted to commit the underlying felony, again, question five, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">Element number two, that the way in which the attempted robbery with a deadly weapon was committed or attempted under all circumstances created\u2014and here\u2019s the distinction between first degree felony murder and second degree. In second degree felony murder, that attempted robbery with a deadly weapon created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or serious physical injury likely to result in death. So that act created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or serious physical injury likely to result in death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">The third element is that, as a result of the way in which the attempted robbery with a deadly weapon was committed, Mr. Chamberlain was killed. That distinguishes second degree felony murder from first degree. But remember, the intent to kill doesn\u2019t have to be present for either one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">The court\u2019s instruction on the requirement of unanimity was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Your verdict as to each and every charge, as to each defendant, must be unanimous. Anything short of a unanimous verdict is not acceptable. Unanimous means a 12 to nothing vote. Our two alternates do not deliberate.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">During its deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court, stating: \u201c[cjould you please clarify the difference between first and second degree felony murder.\u201d The court repeated the basic elements of first degree and second felony murder, then stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Now, here\u2019s where the difference comes in. This is the second element of second degree, and this makes it different from first degree. That the way in which the attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>robbery with a deadly weapon\u2014your question five\u2014was committed\u2014or in this case attempted\u2014under all the circumstances, under all the circumstances [sic], created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">I\u2019ll repeat that one more time. That the manner in which the attempted robbery with a deadly weapon was committed, under all circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Thereafter the jury convicted Goldsberry of second degree felony murder, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Prior to sentencing, Goldsberry moved for a new trial. Goldsberry repeated his previous argument that Maryland law does not recognize second degree felony murder based upon the underlying felony of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon. Thus, in Goldsberry\u2019s view, the second degree felony murder conviction could not stand. The court rejected Golds-berry\u2019s contention as contrary to Maryland law and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The Court merged the conviction of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon with the second degree felony murder conviction, and sentenced Goldsberry to a 30-year term of imprisonment for second degree felony murder, a 20-year consecutive term of imprisonment for use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and a 30-year concurrent term of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Goldsberry raised five claims of error before the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. 394, 957 A.2d 1110. Of relevance to the issues before this Court, Goldsberry contended that the trial court committed reversible error by: (1) disqualifying McKenzie from representing Goldsberry in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice; (2) submitting to the jury the charge of second degree felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>murder; and (3) instructing the jury that only a unanimous verdict was acceptable. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 957 A.2d at 1114.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">With regard to the first of those contentions, the Court of Special Appeals, relying on its interpretation of <em>Wheat v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988), concluded that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s ruling properly balanced [Goldsberry\u2019s] qualified right to counsel against competing factors that weighed against continued unrestricted representation by Mr. McKenzie.\u201d <em>Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 421, 957 A.2d at 1124. The court reasoned that McKenzie\u2019s conduct posed two potential ethical violations: McKenzie \u201ccould have violated [Rule of Professional Conduct] 1.18\u201d when he spoke with Myers; and there was a \u201cpotential violation of [Rule of Professional Conduct] 3.7\u201d (\u201cLawyers as Witness\u201d), given the State\u2019s representation that led the trial court to believe McKenzie could be called as a witness if Tawanna Davis testified at trial, as the State anticipated she might, in a manner inconsistent with her testimony before the grand jury that she had been \u201ccoached\u201d by McKenzie. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 957 A.2d at 1126. The Court of Special Appeals, though acknowledging that Davis ultimately did not testify, reasoned that the trial court \u201cdid not have the benefit of hindsight when it made its ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 957 A.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Court of Special Appeals also emphasized that Golds-berry was not deprived of his counsel of choice when the court disqualified McKenzie because Goldsberry was still represented by attorney Jezic (and attorney Giannetti), whom he had selected. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 957 A.2d at 1126.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>held that the trial court was within its discretion \u201cin determining that [Goldsberry\u2019s] right to counsel of choice was outweighed by the countervailing interests of fairness, maintaining ethical standards, and avoiding conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 957 A.2d at 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">As for the second contention, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with Goldsberry that second degree felony murder predicated upon attempted armed robbery is a \u201cnonexistent\u201d crime under Maryland law. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 957 A.2d at 1116. Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on second degree felony murder and, presumably, sending that charge to the jury. The Court of Special Appeals held that the second degree murder conviction must be reversed without the possibility of a retrial on the charge of felony murder. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 957 A.2d at 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Court of Special Appeals began by explaining, in reliance on <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706 (2001), that the purpose of Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme, which divides murder into degrees, is to differentiate severity of punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 404-05, 957 A.2d at 1116. The Court then noted the distinction between first and second degree felony murder. First degree felony murder, explained the Court, requires a homicide that occurs in the commission, or attempted commission, of one of the felonies listed in Maryland Code (2002 Repl.Vol., Supp.2009), \u00a7 2-201 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCrL\u201d) (providing in (a), inter alia, that \u201c[a] murder is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>first degree if it is ... (4) committed in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate: ... (ix) robbery under \u00a7 3-402 or \u00a7 3-403 of this article!,]\u201d and providing in (b) that the punishment, generally, \u201cshall be ... imprisonment for life\u201d). Second degree felony murder is predicated upon a felony that, although not listed in CrL \u00a7 2-201(a)(4), is by its nature or the way in which it is perpetrated sufficiently dangerous to life. <em>Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 407, 957 A.2d at 1117 (citing <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005)); <em>see also </em>CrL \u00a7 2-204(a), (b) (providing that \u201c[a] murder that is not in the first degree under \u00a7 2-201 of this subtitle is in the second degree!,]\u201d punishable by \u201cimprisonment not exceeding 30 years\u201d). The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that, because armed robbery with a dangerous weapon is listed in CrL \u00a7 2-201(a)(4)(ix) as a predicate for first degree felony murder, it \u201cmay not also support a charge of second degree felony murder, regardless of the circumstances or manner of its commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 957 A.2d at 1118. The Court therefore concluded that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the charge of second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Court of Special Appeals found additional error in the trial court\u2019s re-instruction on the subject in response to the jury\u2019s request for further instruction distinguishing first from second degree felony murder. The trial court instructed that the difference between the two degrees was whether \u201cthe attempted robbery with a deadly weapon created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death.\u201d Citing <em>Fisher, </em>367 Md. at 250, 786 A.2d at 706, the Court of Special Appeals explained that the instruction was improper because a reasonably foreseeable risk of death is required for the felony murder doctrine to be applicable in the first place and thus has \u201cno bearing on the degree of punishment.\u201d <em>Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 407, 957 A.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Court of Special Appeals also agreed with Goldsberry that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding unanimity was coercive and erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 957 A.2d at 1124. We need say nothing more about that holding because, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>mentioned at the outset, the State\u2019s challenge to that holding, though one on which we granted certiorari, does not need to be addressed in light of our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The State petitioned this Court for further review of the judgment, as did Goldsberry, by way of cross-petition. We granted the State\u2019s petition to address two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">To the extent preserved, did the Court of Special Appeals err in reversing and remanding for a new trial on the ground that the trial court\u2019s modified unanimity instruction could have coerced the deliberative process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err by ruling that the trial court should not have given the pattern jury instruction on second degree felony murder when the felony underlying the murder is an attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We granted Goldsberry\u2019s cross-petition to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Did the lower courts deprive Goldsberry of his constitutional right to counsel of his choice by effectively disqualifying one defense attorney?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">We hold that Goldsberry is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the trial court violated Goldsberry\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to his counsel of choice by disqualifying attorney McKenzie from the defense team. We further hold, for reasons we shall explain, that the State may re-try Golds-berry on the charge of felony murder subject to the limitations (which we shall outline) that are demanded by the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">\n<em>The Sixth Amendment Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiU\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">The Sixth Amendment provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The right to counsel includes the right of a defendant, who does not require court-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>appointed counsel, to select the counsel of his or her choosing. <em>See Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692; <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>408 Md. 515, 530, 970 A.2d 908, 916 (2009); <em>McCleary v. State, </em>122 Md. 394, 400, 89 A. 1100, 1103 (1914). <em>Cf. Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932) (\u201cIt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The right to counsel of choice, however, is qualified. It is subject to the trial court\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692; <em>accord Moore v. State, </em>390 Md. 343, 405, 889 A.2d 325, 362 (2005) (stating that a defendant\u2019s right to counsel of choice \u201cwill not be permitted to frustrate[ ] the [ethical and] orderly administration of criminal justice\u201d). This right to counsel; though protected by a presumption in favor of a defendant\u2019s counsel of choice, can be overcome. <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692. The presumption can be overcome if, for example, the defendant\u2019s attorney \u201chas a previous or ongoing relationship with an opposing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692. And it can be overcome, \u201cnot only by a demonstration of actual conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The facts of <em>Wheat </em>presented the Supreme Court with the opportunity to explicate these principles. The Court had before it the question whether the federal district court had erred in refusing to permit Wheat to waive his right to conflict-free counsel and obtain representation by an attorney who represented several co-defendants. 486 U.S. at 154, 108 S.Ct. 1692. Wheat and numerous co-defendants had been charged with participating in a drug distribution conspiracy. Two of those co-defendants, Gomez-Barajas and Javier Bravo, were represented by attorney Eugene Iredale. Iredale had obtained on behalf of Gomez-Barajas an acquittal with respect to the drug distribution charges and a subsequent plea deal on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>unrelated charges that, at the time of the relevant events in Wheat\u2019s case, had not yet been accepted by the district court. Iredale also negotiated a plea deal for Bravo. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 108 S.Ct. 1692. Wheat, evidently impressed by those results, contacted Iredale to request his representation. At the conclusion of Bravo\u2019s guilty plea proceeding, Iredale informed the district court of Wheat\u2019s request to have Iredale represent him at his upcoming trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The district court, prompted by the Government\u2019s suggestion that the proposed representation would pose a potential conflict, conducted a hearing to decide the issue, one day before Wheat\u2019s trial was scheduled to commence. The Government objected on two grounds to Iredale\u2019s representation of Wheat at his trial while the plea deal for Gomez-Barajas remained pending. <em>Id. </em>First, the dual representation posed a potential conflict given the possibility that Gomez-Barajas\u2019s plea would be rejected by the district court, resulting in a trial during which Wheat might be called by the Government to testify against Gomez-Barajas. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 108 S.Ct. 1692. Should that happen, ethical strictures would prevent Iredale from cross-examining Wheat, thereby rendering Iredale\u2019s representation of Gomez-Barajas ineffective. Second, the dual representation posed a separate potential conflict because, as part of Bravo\u2019s plea deal, he agreed to testify against Wheat at Wheat\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 108 S.Ct. 1692. Given the Rules of Professional Responsibility, Iredale would be unable to cross-examine Bravo, rendering ineffective his representation of Wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Wheat responded that his right under the Sixth Amendment to counsel of his choice entitled him to waive his right to conflict-free counsel. He disputed the Government\u2019s concern as posing \u201chighly improbable\u201d conflicts that were \u201cmanufactured\u201d to disqualify Iredale. Wheat also noted that he, Gomez-Barajas, and Bravo all had waived any potential claims of conflict of interest. <em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 108 S.Ct. 1692.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The district court denied Wheat\u2019s request for substitution of Iredale as his counsel on the ground that the joint representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tion would pose an irreconcilable and un-waivable conflict. Wheat proceeded to trial, represented by his original counsel, and was convicted of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and related offenses. Wheat appealed, arguing, among other claims, that the district court\u2019s ruling deprived him of his constitutional right to counsel of choice. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the judgments. <em>United States v. Wheat, </em>813 F.2d 1399 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court began its analysis with the recognition that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes the right to choose one\u2019s own counsel. The Court explained that \u201cthe essential aim\u201d of the Sixth Amendment is to \u201cguarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692. The right to choose one\u2019s counsel nevertheless may be circumscribed by a trial court when necessary to uphold \u201cthe ethical standards of the profession\u201d and to ensure that \u201clegal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692. In other words, the right to choice of counsel is not absolute: one may not select an unbarred advocate or an attorney about whom a \u201ccourt justifiably finds an actual [or a serious potential for a] conflict of interest[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162., 108 S.Ct. 1692</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is in the latter context, noted the Supreme Court, that the \u201clikelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are notoriously hard to predict,\u201d requiring the trial court to act without the benefit of a fully developed record produced at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 108 S.Ct. 1692. For this reason, the trial court is afforded \u201csubstantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 108 S.Ct. 1692. The Court determined that the proper balance is struck when \u201cthe district court [] recognize[s] a presumption in favor of [the defendant\u2019s] counsel of choice,\u201d which \u201cmay be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but <em>by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.\u201d Id. </em>at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Courts applying <em>Wheat </em>have grappled with what that case requires of a trial court in making the important and weighty assessment presented by a choice of counsel issue. <em>United States v. Nolen, </em>472 F.3d 362 (5th Cir.2006) is illustrative. In that case, Nolen, a persistent \u201ctax protestor,\u201d was charged in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas with three counts of willfully attempting to evade federal income taxes. <em>See id. </em>at 369. After being represented by several different attorneys throughout pre-trial proceedings, Nolen hired John Green to represent him. <em>See id. </em>at 370. Green was admitted pro hac vice.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In a motion for continuance, Green referred to the magistrate judge, who had presided over preliminary matters in which Green was not involved, in a manner that, in the district court\u2019s view, implicated Texas Disciplinary Rule 8.02.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Nolen, </em>472 F.3d at 370. The district court ordered a show cause hearing and, at that proceeding, revoked Green\u2019s pro hac vice admission. <em>Id. </em>Nolen was later convicted of willful tax evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On appeal, Nolen argued successfully that the district court committed reversible error by failing to \u201cto balance the need to enforce [ethical rules] against Nolen\u2019s Sixth Amendment Right to counsel of choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371. The Fifth Circuit explained that a criminal defendant\u2019s choice of counsel may be disqualified for an ethical violation only if, \u201c \u2018in light of the interests underlying the standards of ethics, the social need for ethical practice outweighs the party\u2019s right to counsel of his choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375 (quoting <em>United States v. Kitchin, </em>592 F.2d 900, 903 (5th Cir.1979)). Therefore, \u201c[conducting such a balancing test is thus a prerequisite to disqualifying counsel of defendant\u2019s choice, <em>and explicating the process on the record is a pre-requisite to appellate review.\u201d Nolen, </em>472 F.3d at 375 (emphasis added). Turning to the district court\u2019s order revok<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ing attorney Green\u2019s pro hac vice admission, the <em>Nolen </em>Court found no indication that the district court had conducted the necessary balancing test and, accordingly, concluded that the district court abused its discretion in revoking Green\u2019s admission. <em>Id. </em>at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\"><em>Fuller v. Diesslin, </em>868 F.2d 604 (3d Cir.1989) is to like effect. Fuller was convicted of various drug-related offenses following a trial before the New Jersey Superior Court. In a pre-trial motion, Fuller requested, through local counsel, that he be represented pro hac vice by two out-of-state attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 605. That request was denied based on the trial court\u2019s belief that local counsel was competent, the \u201ccase was going to be hotly contested,\u201d and the out-of-state attorneys would create \u201cprobable delay ... so grave as to overcome the unfettered right of a defendant to counsel of his own choosing. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605-06. In his collateral attack of the convictions, Fuller maintained that the trial court arbitrarily denied him the constitutional right to counsel of choice. <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The Third Circuit agreed. That court noted that a trial court, when confronted with a choice of counsel issue, must conduct a hearing to \u201c \u2018make specific findings of fact consistent with the evidence[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608 (quoting <em>United States v. Romano, </em>849 F.2d 812, 820 (3d Cir.1988) (finding that district court\u2019s summary denial of defendant\u2019s requested counsel violated right to counsel of choice)). Looking to the trial court\u2019s denial of Fuller\u2019s request for counsel pro hac vice, the Third Circuit concluded that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s wooden approach and its failure to make record-supported findings balancing the right to counsel with the demands of the administration of justice resulted in an arbitrary denial of\u2019 the right to choice of counsel. <em>Fuller, </em>868 F.2d at 611. The <em>Fuller </em>Court was careful to explain, though, that its holding did not \u201cmilitate\u201d against the broad discretion afforded a trial court as discussed in <em>Wheat, </em>but, instead, simply made plain that only \u201c[u]pon obtaining sufficient information\u201d is the court equipped to exercise its discretion, \u201cinstinct[,] and judgment based on experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Other courts have addressed with specificity the steps to be undertaken by a trial court in assessing choice of counsel issues. The Illinois Supreme Court did so in <em>People v. Ortega, </em>209 Ill.2d 354, 283 Ill.Dec. 530, 808 N.E.2d 496 (2004). In <em>Ortega, </em>the facts of which are irrelevant for present purposes, the Supreme Court of Illinois suggested the following framework, based on <em>Wheat: </em>The trial court must first determine whether there is \u201cactual or serious potential for conflict.\u201d <em>Ortega, </em>283 Ill.Dec. 530, 808 N.E.2d at 502. If the court finds a conflict, it must then determine whether the presumption favoring one\u2019s counsel of choice is overcome by the interests of fairness and maintenance of ethical standards implicated by the conflict. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692). In conducting this balancing test, the court may consider the following, among all other factors relevant to the conflict: the likelihood that defense counsel will have divided loyalties; the State\u2019s right to a fair trial; the appearance of impropriety should the jury learn of the conflict; and the likelihood that defense counsel\u2019s continued representation will provide grounds for overturning the conviction. <em>Id. </em>Connecticut follows an approach similar to that of the Illinois Supreme Court. <em>See State v. Peeler, </em>265 Conn. 460, 828 A.2d 1216, 1225 (2003) (citing <em>Fuller </em>for this proposition and stating that \u201cthe trial court cannot vitiate [the right to counsel of choice] without first scrutinizing closely the basis for the claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We adopt the approach to this issue taken by the Illinois and Connecticut courts, as it is well-grounded in the principles announced in <em>Wheat </em>and applied in <em>Nolen </em>and <em>Fuller. </em>We hold that, before a trial court is permitted to disqualify a criminal defendant\u2019s privately obtained counsel (regardless of whether counsel is the defendant\u2019s only attorney or one of several on the defense team), the court must conduct a hearing on the matter, \u201cscrutinize closely the basis for the claim,\u201d <em>Peeler, </em>828 A.2d at 1225, and make evidence-based findings to determine, based on factors such as those outlined in <em>Ortega, </em>283 Ill.Dec. 530, 808 N.E.2d at 502, whether there is \u201cactual or serious potential for conflict\u201d that overcomes the presumption the defendant has to his or her counsel of choice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The record must reflect that the trial court contemplated relevant factors in conducting the test that balances the right to one\u2019s counsel of choice against the necessity to uphold \u201cthe ethical standards of the profession\u201d that ensure that \u201clegal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>See Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692; <em>Fuller, </em>868 F.2d at 608, 611. With this legal framework in mind, we turn to the parties\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Goldsberry argues that the evidence of the two purported ethical conflicts relied upon by the trial court to disqualify McKenzie\u2014his conversation with Myers before trial and McKenzie\u2019s alleged coaching of Davis\u2014\u201cwas too sketchy\u201d to justify disqualification under <em>Wheat </em>and its progeny. Golds-berry first directs us to the record pertaining to McKenzie\u2019s conversation with Myers, which Myers\u2019s counsel suggested posed potential violations of Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 4.2 and 1.18. Goldsberry maintains that the evidence presented to the court did not support a finding of a potential violation of either rule of professional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Goldsberry points out that Rule 4.2 prohibits an attorney, while engaged in the representation of a client, from \u201ccommunicat[ing] about the subject of the representation with a person who the lawyer knows is represented in the matter by another lawyer....\u201d He argues, based on the representations made to the trial court, all of which indicated that Myers was not represented by counsel at the time he spoke with McKenzie, that the record does not support a potential transgression of Rule 4.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Turning to Rule 1.18, Goldsberry emphasizes that the Rule applies only to a \u201cprospective client,\u201d defined as \u201c[a] person who discusses with a lawyer the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter____\u201d Goldsberry contends that there is no indication in the record that Myers and McKenzie discussed anything that would implicate Rule 1.18. To the contrary, argues Goldsberry, the only representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tions made to the trial court on this point indicate that McKenzie and Myers discussed only the facts of the case and Myers made no admissions to McKenzie.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Goldsberry next attacks the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination that there was \u201ca potential violation of [Rule] 3.7,\u201d given the State\u2019s representation that Tawanna Davis (a potential State\u2019s witness) had testified before the grand jury that McKenzie had \u201ccoached\u201d her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rule 3.7 prohibits a lawyer from representing a client in a trial in which the attorney is \u201clikely to be a necessary witness.... \u201d Goldsberry asserts that there was insufficient information presented to the trial court to allow the court to determine \u201ca compelling need\u201d for McKenzie to testify. Goldsberry argues that \u201cany scenario by which Mr. McKenzie could have become a \u2018necessary witness\u2019 [ ] as a result of \u2018coaching\u2019 Ms. Davis was a remote and speculative one.\u201d According to Goldsberry, the record before the trial court lacks the sort of inquiry necessary to decide, with regard to Rule 3.7, whether to honor a defendant\u2019s choice of counsel. Other than the \u201cconclusory\u201d representation made by the State, argues Goldsberry, there was no proffer made nor testimony taken to indicate what, if anything, McKenzie said to Davis. Moreover, the trial court did not require the State either to proffer what McKenzie\u2019s testimony would be if called as a witness or to demonstrate that \u201cthere was no feasible alternative to calling Mr. McKenzie to the stand.\u201d Goldsberry suggests that, had the trial court required the State to make these showings, the parties could have fashioned an alternative to McKenzie\u2019s being called as a witness, such as a stipulation concerning the conversation between McKenzie and Ms. Davis. Goldsberry alleges that the trial court made its decision based on a \u201cpurely hypothetical change in [Ms. Davis\u2019s] testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Goldsberry refers us to various cases, the notable ones of which we have discussed at length above, in support of his argument that the trial court failed to employ the analysis required when confronted with the decision whether to deprive a defendant of his or her chosen counsel. Goldsberry contends, in particular, that the trial court failed to conduct a sufficient threshold level of evidentiary inquiry into the alleged conflicts, which, if undertaken, would have enabled the proper balancing of Goldsberry\u2019s right to counsel of choice on the one hand, and the interests of fairness, avoidance of conflicts, and maintenance of ethical standards on the other. Because the trial court failed to conduct such an inquiry, contends Golds-berry, the presumption of counsel of one\u2019s choice was not overcome, and McKenzie\u2019s disqualification constituted structural error under <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006) (holding that the denial of counsel of choice is structural error such that prejudice is presumed).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The State, not surprisingly, urges us to affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding on this issue. The State contests Goldsberry\u2019s characterization of the record as \u201csketchy.\u201d In the State\u2019s view, the record \u201cadequately established the potential conflicts of interest and ethical violations committed by Mr. McKenzie prior to trial.\u201d The State argues that, consistent with the reasoning employed by the Supreme Court in <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. 153, 108 S.Ct. 1692, the trial court was well \u2022within its considerable discretion in finding that McKenzie\u2019s conduct posed \u201ca serious potential for conflict.\u201d (Quoting <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Turning to McKenzie\u2019s conversation with the co-defendant Myers, the State contends that, given the breadth of conduct prohibited by Rule 1.18, there was a sufficient showing of a potential violation of that Rule. This is so, argues the State, even though the record \u201cdoes not disclose the substance of that conversation.\u201d The State explains that, pursuant to Rule 1.18, a prospective client includes a person who discusses -with a lawyer the possibility of forming an attorney-client relationship with respect to a matter. The State, though it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>expressly say so, presumably contends that, based on the representations made by attorneys Hart, Jezic, and McKenzie, there was enough in the record to afford Myers the protections provided to prospective clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The State implies that prospective-client status for Myers would be significant for two reasons. First, under Rule 1.18(a), even though McKenzie and Myers never formed an attorney-client relationship, McKenzie is prohibited from using any information he learned during the consultation with Myers, absent Myers\u2019s informed consent or an applicable exception to confidentiality. Second, Rule 1.18(c) and (d) are implicated because McKenzie, who presumably obtained information harmful to Myers during their conversation, would be representing Goldsberry, whose interests are \u201cmaterially adverse\u201d to Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">With regard to McKenzie\u2019s alleged \u201ccoaching\u201d of the potential State\u2019s witness, Tawanna Davis, the State concedes \u201cthat the record does not disclose the substance of that conversation [between McKenzie and Davis].\u201d The State notes, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s representation to the trial court <em>(i.e., </em>that Davis testified before the grand jury that she was coached by McKenzie), suggests that McKenzie told Davis \u201chow to testify, including what to say and what not to say.\u201d The State contends that this representation, in and of itself, made McKenzie a potential witness in the case. For these reasons, the State argues that there was \u201ca firm foundation for [the trial court\u2019s] decision to exclude Mr. McKenzie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">We conclude that Goldsberry has the better part of the argument on this issue. The State grounds its argument on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wheat. </em>Though <em>Wheat </em>indeed supports the State\u2019s contention that a trial court is afforded discretion in deciding whether a criminal defendant\u2019s selection of counsel is permissible given a purported conflict of interest, that discretion does not excuse the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a threshold level of inquiry to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>whether there was a \u201cserious potential,\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692, that the asserted conflicts existed or would arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Moreover, the sparse record in the present case stands in sharp contrast to the facts in <em>Wheat </em>suggesting the serious potential for a conflict of counsel. In approving of the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in <em>Wheat, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the district court had been confronted, as a result of Wheat\u2019s desired substitution of counsel one day before trial, with the proposed representation of \u201cthree conspirators of varying stature in a complex drug distribution scheme.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 163-64, 108 S.Ct. 1692. Furthermore, the Government advised the district court that, at Wheat\u2019s trial, the Government intended to (and in fact did) call Bravo as a witness. <em>Id. </em>And, the district court was informed that, should Gomez-Barajas\u2019s plea deal collapse, Wheat would \u201cprobab[ly]\u201d be called upon to testify at the trial. <em>Id. </em>In either of the latter two circumstances, attorney Iredale\u2019s joint representation and corresponding ethical obligations to each client would preclude effective representation of all. <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, all of which were revealed to the district court at the \u201cconflict\u201d hearing, the Supreme Court concluded that the district court properly denied Wheat\u2019s choice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Here, the trial court, prompted by representations made first by attorneys Hart, Myers, and Jezic, and then by the State, determined <em>sua sponte </em>to deny Goldsberry\u2019s choice of counsel. Contrary to the \u201cserious,\u201d if not near-certain, potential for conflict posed by Iredale\u2019s representation in <em>Wheat, </em>the record here of a potential conflict posed by McKenzie\u2019s continued representation of Goldsberry is, using his language, \u201csketchy\u201d at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that McKenzie\u2019s conversation with Myers \u201ccould have\u201d violated Rule 1.18. <em>See Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 420, 957 A.2d at 1126. But the record developed at trial, upon which the trial court rested its decision, does not come close to revealing the \u201cserious potential for conflict,\u201d that <em>Wheat </em>requires be established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>before the trial court may exercise its discretion to deprive a defendant of his or her counsel of choice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">At the hearing on Myers\u2019s motion to have his trial severed from Goldsberry\u2019s, the trial court was presented with imprecise assertions from Myers\u2019s counsel about McKenzie\u2019s conversation with Myers. We have mentioned that there were no facts indicating that, at the time of the conversation, Myers was represented by counsel. Moreover, the only information before the trial court concerning the content of the conversation came from McKenzie\u2019s representation to the court that Myers related to him only the \u201cfacts\u201d of the case, and made \u201cno admissions.\u201d The trial court did not ask of McKenzie his intentions in meeting with Myers, ie., whether he sought Myers to solicit him as a client. Nor did the trial court request from Myers\u2019s counsel a proffer concerning the nature of the conversation. Indeed, Myers\u2019s counsel, who presumably would have put forth her strongest arguments in an attempt to sever the trials, could only say \u201cI don\u2019t know if the purpose of the meeting involves Rule 1.18 and whether it was an attempt to speak with a prospective client or whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>was to interview a co-defendant regarding facts of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AML\">Likewise, though Rule 4.2, which prohibits a lawyer from communicating with a person whom the lawyer \u201cknows is represented in the matter by another attorney,\u201d was not specifically mentioned by the trial court in its decision to disqualify McKenzie, the court explicitly rejected the possibility of the rule\u2019s violation when it found that McKenzie \u201cdid not know\u201d whether Myers was represented by counsel.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">It\u2019s clear that Mr. McKenzie did not know that anybody was representing Mr. Myers when he talked to him, and the reality is there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with an attorney, who may be representing a co-defendant, trying to communicate with the other defendant if that defendant is not represented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We consider, too, the State\u2019s representation to the trial court that the potential State witness, Ms. Tawanna Davis, had testified before the grand jury to being \u201ccoached\u201d by McKenzie. The trial court, relying solely on that representation, inferred that McKenzie could be called by the State as a witness. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the allegations may have implicated Rule 3.7. But we cannot conclude, based on the record before the trial court, that there was a showing of \u201cserious potential\u201d that McKenzie would be called as a witness. Put simply, the trial court failed to demand of the State the requisite showing to support such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>finding, before relying on it as grounds for disqualifying McKenzie. At a minimum, the court, prior to disqualifying McKenzie, should have conducted an <em>in camera </em>hearing to determine the likelihood that the State would be calling Ms. Davis as a witness<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; and, in that event, whether she would in fact testify to having been \u201ccoached\u201d by McKenzie and, if so, what she meant by the term \u201ccoach.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">To be sure, the trial court\u2019s decision to remove attorney McKenzie from the defense team was made, not with \u201cthe wisdom of hindsight after the trial has taken place, but in the murkier pretrial context when relationships between parties are seen through a glass, darkly[,]\u201d at which time, \u201c[t]he likelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are notoriously hard to predict, even for those thoroughly familiar with criminal trials.\u201d <em>Wheat, </em>486 U.S. at 162, 108 S.Ct. 1692. It remains, though, that the record provides no basis upon which to assess the legal correctness of the court\u2019s ultimate decision to disqualify McKenzie, because the court did not conduct an adequate threshold inquiry into the circumstances underlying the purported conflicts in order to assess whether there was a serious potential for conflict. <em>See Fuller, </em>868 F.2d at 611; <em>Ortega, </em>283 Ill.Dec. 530, 808 N.E.2d at 502; <em>Peeler, </em>828 A.2d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>We therefore hold that the court\u2019s failure to develop a factual record that supports its decision to take the undeniably drastic action of disallowing McKenzie as one of Goldsberry\u2019s defense attorneys denied Goldsberry his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That constitutional violation entitles Goldsberry to a new trial. <em>See Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 148, 150, 126 S.Ct. 2557 (holding that, when the court wrongly denies the defendant the \u201cright to be assisted by counsel of one\u2019s choice,\u201d structural error results and prejudice is presumed).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>The Unanimity Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Our holding that Goldsberry is entitled to a new trial on the ground that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of his choice obviates the need to address the State\u2019s challenge to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the court erred in giving a coercive jury instruction on the requirement of jury unanimity. <em>See Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 416-17, 957 A.2d at 1123-24. We therefore decline to address that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\n<em>The Felony Murder Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The State\u2019s remaining contention, that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Goldsberry was convicted of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201cnon-existent\u201d crime, <em>ie., </em>second degree felony murder based on the crime attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon (hereafter attempted armed robbery), is a different matter. <em>See id. </em>at 407-08, 957 A.2d at 1117. If the State is correct that the Court of Special Appeals erred in any aspect of that holding, then the State is not foreclosed from re-trying Golds-berry for felony murder. We therefore shall address the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The State\u2019s argument, in a nutshell, is: (1) the General Assembly\u2019s legislative determination that killing a victim during the commission of an attempted armed robbery supports a conviction of first degree (not second degree) felony murder did not foreclose the jury in this case from finding Goldsberry guilty of felony murder; because (2) the identity of the underlying felony, once proven, relates only to whether the maximum sentence is life (if a first degree felony murder), or thirty years\u2019 imprisonment (if second degree felony murder); and therefore (3) the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing, without the possibility of re-trial, Goldsberry\u2019s conviction of what that court characterized as the \u201cnon-existent crime[]\u201d of second felony degree murder predicated on attempted armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We begin our analysis of this contention with what is essentially uncontested:<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The parties seem to agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>trial court ought not have instructed the jury on the crime of second degree felony murder and sent that charge to the jury, because the facts developed at trial make out what the General Assembly has characterized as first degree felony murder, <em>ie., </em>a criminal homicide that occurred during commission of an attempted armed robbery. The parties also agree that the elements of felony murder are determined by Maryland\u2019s common law; and that CrL \u00a7 2-201 (first degree felony murder) and CrL \u00a7 2-204 (second degree felony murder), at least in the present context, have \u201cidentical elements.\u201d Where the parties part company is on <em>the effect </em>of the jury\u2019s finding Goldsberry not guilty of the charge of first degree felony murder and guilty of the charge of second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The State argues that, under the circumstances of this case, the jury\u2019s finding Goldsberry guilty of second degree murder, when, if anything, he should have been found guilty of first degree felony murder, does not absolve him of guilt of felony murder. Citing <em>Fisher, </em>367 Md. at 250, 786 A.2d at 725, the State emphasizes that \u201cthe common law of Maryland <em>alone </em>defines the elements of felony murder\u201d and \u201calone imposes culpability for felony murder.\u201d The State points out the broad description we accorded the offense in <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 226, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>867 A.2d at 1100, where we said that a person commits felony murder when the person\u2019s \u201cconduct [brings] about an unintended death in the commission or attempted commission of a felony....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Quoting 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 14.5(a) (2d ed.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The State asserts that the General Assembly\u2019s division of common law felony murder into first degree and second degree felony murder creates nothing more than a \u201cpenalty scheme.\u201d In support of that assertion, the State directs us to <em>Weighorst v. State, </em>7 Md. 442, 451 (1855), where we stated: \u201cThe design [of Chapter 138, \u00a7 3 of the 1809 Act] was to discriminate in awarding the punishment\u201d for the various forms of murder. The State also reminds us of our predecessors\u2019 description of the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting the 1809 Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cMurder\u201d is here recognized as a general denomination, including offenses differing from each other in their degrees of atrocity, but not in their nature or kind; no attempt is made to explain or modify its meaning or abridge its range. Its common law sense is left unimpaired; the measure of punishment only is sought to be graduated according to the circumstances under which it was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">.... This Act of Assembly, now codified, does not create a new crime; it neither adds to nor diminishes the class of cases which constituted murder at common law; nor does it increase the punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\"><em>Davis v. State, </em>39 Md. 355, 374 (1874). The State argues that more recent precedent of this Court, citing, inter alia, <em>Fisher, </em>also mandates its requested result. The State asserts: \u201cThis Court has explained that the felony-murder doctrine operates independently to elevate an unintentional killing to murder, only after which do Sections 2-201 and 2-204 [of the CrL] operate to assign a penaltyf.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision is contrary to the General Assembly\u2019s intent to impose a \u201ccomprehensive scheme\u201d mandating punishment for <em>all </em>felony murders; moreover, the decision is illogical, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>conflicts with the commonsensical notion that an offense that warrants a greater punishment can also warrant a lesser punishment. In that regard, the State points out the \u201ccatchall\u201d quality of CrL \u00a7 2-204(a), which provides: \u201cA murder that is not in the first degree under [CrL \u00a7 2-201] of this subtitle is in the second degree.\u201d Finally, the State concedes that the jury in the present case, by its verdict, limited the court to imposition of a penalty for Goldsberry\u2019s crime of felony murder that was not anticipated by the General Assembly. That, however, argues the State, should have only the effect of punishing Respondent to a lesser degree and not of erasing Goldsberry\u2019s culpability for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Goldsberry responds that we should affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. He agrees with that court\u2019s conclusion that the statutory scheme created by Chapter 138, \u00a7 3 of the Acts of 1809 imposed two \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d categories of felony murder. He emphasizes that the plain language of CrL \u00a7\u00a7 2-201(a) and 2-204(a) provides that certain underlying felonies serve as predicates for first degree felony murder, and that all other felonies, inherently dangerous in nature or by way of commission, support felony murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, when, as here, the facts make out <em>only </em>a charge of first degree felony murder, a trial court errs in instructing the jury on the crime of second degree felony murder. A trial court further errs, as the court did here, by sending the jury to its deliberations with a verdict sheet that presents the jury with the option of finding the defendant guilty of second degree murder. We do not agree, however, that the trial court\u2019s errors in the present ease, and the jury\u2019s verdict flowing from them, lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Goldsberry cannot be re-tried on a charge of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The State correctly identifies the effect the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of Chapter 138, \u00a7 3 of the Act of 1809 had on the common law crime of felony murder. That legislative decision, as we said as early as in <em>Weighorst, </em>7 Md. at 451, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>as recently as in <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 230-31, 867 A.2d at 1102-03, did not abrogate the common law crime of felony murder. Rather the Act divided the single, common law offense into two degrees of culpability, for penalty purposes only, dependent solely on the severity of the underlying felony. <em>See also, e.g., Jackson v. State, </em>286 Md. 430, 436, 408 A.2d 711, 715 (1979) (stating that \u201c[t]he doctrine has not been abrogated by statute in this State. The Maryland statutes with respect to murder do not create any new crime, but merely classify murder, as it was known at common law, into degrees.... [T]he common law sense is left unimpaired; the measure of punishment only is sought to be graduated according to the circumstances under which it was committed\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>Abbott v. State, </em>188 Md. 310, 312, 52 A.2d 489, 490 (1947) (same). <em>Accord Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 138, 857 A.2d 88, 100 (2004) (noting that \u201c[t]he crime of murder in Maryland remains a common law offense\u201d); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 146, 767 A.2d 844, 853 (2001) (same); <em>Fisher, </em>367 Md. at 247-54, 786 A.2d at 723-27 (reviewing the history of CrL \u00a7\u00a7 2-201 and 2-204 and concluding that the statutes created only different grades of punishment).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The extensive authority on the subject leads us to conclude that, notwithstanding the errors the court committed in its instructions and on the verdict sheet, the jury\u2019s finding that Goldsberry is guilty of felony murder should stand. The verdict unequivocally reflects the jury\u2019s finding that Chamberlain was killed during Goldsberry\u2019s commission of an attempted armed robbery. Those facts make out the crime of felony murder, and Goldsberry does not argue to the contrary. The only windfall to which Goldsberry is entitled is that, at re-trial, should the jury once again find him guilty of felony murder, the court is bound to impose a sentence no greater than 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum sentence for second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">MURPHY, J., Concurs and Dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">.

In addition to the contentions listed, the Court of Special Appeals rejected Goldsberry\u2019s claim that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to instruct the jury that it may disbelieve the uncontradicted testimony of Braxton, and granted him relief on his claim that the court erred in submitting to the jury a charge of conspiracy to commit second degree murder. <em>See Goldsberry, </em>182 Md.App. at 423, 957 A.2d at 1127.

We have two concerns with those statements: First, we read the record differently insofar as concerns the trial court\u2019s limitation on McKenzie\u2019s representation of Goldsberry. As we see it, the trial court, though going back and forth on this point, in fact disqualified McKenzie altogether when the court said \"Mr. McKenzie [ ] can\u2019t participate in this trial.\u201d Second, we disagree, for reasons that we discuss, <em>infra, </em>that Goldsberry\u2019s right to counsel of choice was not prejudiced by the disqualification of McKenzie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">.

The Dissent evidently relies on <em>Lettley v.

That authority, though, concerns the situation in which defense counsel himself or herself brings to the trial court\u2019s attention counsel\u2019s <em>own </em>potential or actual conflict of interest, which, in that attorney\u2019s view, prevents the attorney from adequately representing his or her client. It is in that context that \"judges should normally accept at face value a lawyer\u2019s assertion that a conflict of interest exists.\" (quoting Charles W. Wolfman, Modern Legal Ethics, \u00a7 8.2 at 416 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">That situation is not present in the case at bar. Neither do we believe it to be sound policy, much less constitutionally proper, to allow the <em>Wheat </em>presumption in favor of counsel of one's choice to be overcome by the trial court\u2019s accepting \u201cat face value\u201d and without further inquiry the representation of a co-defendant's counsel or prosecutor that defense counsel might have committed an ethical violation or acted in such a way that might suggest a serious potential for a conflict on the part of defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">.

Given that the record was insufficient to support a finding of \u201cserious potential conflict\u201d as required by <em>Wheat, </em>we need not analyze the case under this more stringent, \u201ccompelling need test.\u201d <em>See Flores v.

The Dissent comments that \"[t]his Court should not be focusing upon the issue of whether Mr. McKenzie had an actual conflict of interest, \u2018serious\u2019 or otherwise, with either Goldsberry or Myers.\u201d We agree with the Dissent that the focus should not be on whether McKenzie had an actual conflict, as that is not the issue the parties briefed or we decide. Rather, the issue is whether the trial court had before it a record sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of upholding the right to counsel of choice and justify the court\u2019s exercise of discretion to disqualify McKenzie. Under <em>Wheat, </em>it is not enough for the record to demonstrate a potential for a conflict of counsel; it must demonstrate a <em>\u201cserious </em>potential for conflict.\u201d 486 U.S. at 164, 108 S.Ct. 1692.

To be precise, the State does not concede that the court \"erred\u201d in giving the second degree murder instruction and sending that charge to the jury. The State admits, however, that, \"[wjhile factually generated by the case, the trial court's instruction on, and the jury's finding of, a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or injury was, legally speaking, unnecessary[.]\u201d The State suggests that the court evidently relied on the \"Notes on Use\u201d accompanying the pattern jury instruction for second degree felony murder, MPJI-Cr 4.17.7.2. The notes on use for that pattern instruction include that the trial court should give the instruction when \"the defendant is charged with second degree felony murder and the predicate felony is one that is inherently dangerous to human life because of the way in which it was committed.\u201d MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2. The State then suggests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">Justifiably discerning no incompatibility in the \u201cNotes on Use\u201d of both [the first degree felony murder and the second degree felony murder] instructions, and believing, based on the content of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>instructions themselves, that the manner of the attempted robbery's commission distinguished first from second degree felony murder, the trial court gave the jury the option to classify Goldsberry\u2019s offense in either the first or second degree. Under the instructions as given, the jury convicted Goldsberry of second degree felony murder and not first degree felony murder because the jury believed that the manner in which he attempted the armed robbery \"created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury,\u201d for that was the only content of the court\u2019s second degree felony-murder instruction not found in the first degree felony-murder instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">It was in this context that the State maintained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">While factually generated by the case, the trial court\u2019s instruction on, and the jury\u2019s finding of, a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or injury was, legally speaking, unnecessary because the General Assembly has already found as a legislative fact in Section 2-201 that attempted armed robbery is always inherently dangerous, and for that reason warrants the maximum punishment allowed by law as first degree felony murder.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b164-6\">MURPHY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">I agree with the majority that \u201cthe jury\u2019s finding that Goldsberry is guilty of felony murder should stand,\u201d but I dissent from the holding \u201cthat the trial court violated Golds-berry\u2019s right to counsel of choice.\u201d Because I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cthe trial court was well within its bounds to restrict [the Respondent\u2019s] qualified right to counsel of choice,\u201d I also dissent from the conclusion that this Court does not need to address the issue of whether the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201cmodified unanimity instruction\u201d was coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">As the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">Though the potential conflicts in this case were different from those in <em>Wheat, </em>the trial court here similarly acted within its discretion in determining that appellant\u2019s right to counsel of choice was outweighed by the countervailing interests of fairness, maintaining ethical standards, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Continued representation of appellant by Mr. Mckenzie could have violated RPC 1.18 and jeopardized Mr. Myers\u2019s right to a fair trial. In addition, Mr. Mckenzie\u2019s \u201ccoaching\u201d of Ms. Davis made him a possible witness in the case and presented a potential violation of RPC 3.7, prohibiting a lawyer from acting as an advocate in trial where the lawyer is likely to be called as a witness. Though Ms. Davis was ultimately restricted in her testimony, the trial court did not have the benefit of hindsight when it made its ruling. In addition, appellant was not deprived of his right to counsel of choice. Appellant was still represented by Mr. Jezic\u2014whom he selected\u2014and the trial court\u2019s ruling permitted Mr. Mckenzie to assist in appellant\u2019s defense by consulting with Mr. Jezic and Mr. Giannetti as long as they did not discuss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>conversation -with Mr. Myers. Thus, the trial court\u2019s ruling properly balanced appellant\u2019s qualified right to counsel against competing factors that weighed against continued unrestricted representation by Mr. Mckenzie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">Further, unlike <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>the trial court here did not err in its interpretation of the ethics rules, but instead correctly assessed that continued unfettered representation of appellant by Mr. Mckenzie created a very real possibility of violations. Also of note is that fact that in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>the defendant was deprived of his only counsel of choice, whereas here appellant was still represented by his co-counsel of choice, Mr. Jezic. Finally, the trial court\u2019s decision was not based on Mr. Mckenzie\u2019s conduct in a separate matter, as in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>but was instead based on actions <em>in this case. </em>Thus, the trial court was well within its bounds to restrict appellant\u2019s qualified right to counsel of choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">182 Md.App. at 420-22, 957 A.2d at 1126-27. (Emphasis supplied). I agree with, and hereby adopt, that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe record developed at trial ... simply does not come close to revealing the \u2018potential for serious conflict\u2019 required by <em>Wheat.\u201d </em>The record shows that the following transpired immediately before the jury was selected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">[MYERS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I was informed yesterday morning by Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Jezic that Mr. McKenzie spoke with my client, Mr. Myers, about the facts of this case on a date that cannot be determined at this point. I do know that in the District Court we entered a line of appearance on or about April 17th stating that I would represent Mr. Myers. Mr. McKenzie does not know the date on which he went to speak with Mr. Myers about the facts of the case. After speaking with Mr. Myers about the facts of the case, he then went and called the District Court to see if he was represented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>That, however, was not done before he went to speak with my client about the facts of the case. And I would note that very often the computer does not reflect the reality of the filing of the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">I don\u2019t actually know the purpose of speaking with Mr. Myers, and I don\u2019t actually know the details of the conversation. I don\u2019t know if the purpose of the meeting involves Rule 1.18 and whether it as an attempt to speak with a prospective client or whether it was to interview a codefendant regarding facts of the case. A detail I also don\u2019t know is whether Mr. McKenzie had already entered his line of appearance for Mr. Goldsberry at the time that he went to speak with Mr. Myers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">THE COURT: What relief are you asking for, [Mr. Myers\u2019 Counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">[MYERS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, I think there are a couple of things the Court can do. Of course, the Court may want to hold a hearing to sift out some more details that I don\u2019t actually, at this point, know. But, ultimately, I think this does involve Rule 4.2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">Mr. Jezic has explained that he has erected a Chinese wall, but I don\u2019t think that my client should have to worry about the foundation and endurance of that wall. I also think that it\u2019s going to create, certainly at the very least, an appearance of impropriety as my client decides whether to testify and by whom he will be cross-examined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">So for those reasons I would ask the Court to sever the Myers matter from the Goldsberry matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">THE COURT: What prejudice is there to your client at this point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">[MYERS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, the ones I just mentioned, that he has had a conversation with Mr. McKenzie about the facts of the case. As he sits here through this trial, he evaluates constantly whether he\u2019s going to testify in his own defense, whether he\u2019s going to give up that fifth amendment right or not. I think, at the very least, it certainly looks bad for him to have to make that decision in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of whether Mr. McKenzie is going to cross-examine him, knowing what he has already said about the facts of the case, the subject, the very essence of the cross-examination. So I think it affects his ability to make a clear, unencumbered decision whether to testify or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">And then the next prong, the next problem is the actual testimony. Should he decide to take the stand, at the very least it looks wrong for an attorney for a codefendant, who has already talked about the facts of the case, to cross-examine my client if he decides to take the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Those are problems my client should not have to be encumbered with because of the actions of the codefendant\u2019s counsel. He not only needs a fair trial, it needs to look like a fair trial, and I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any way to have it be fair and to look fair without separating, severing Mr. Goldsberry\u2019s case from Mr. Myers\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">THE COURT: Mr. McKenzie, what do you want to tell me? MR. JEZIC: Your Honor, may I first address the Court? THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Jezic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">MR. JEZIC: Just to give the Court more context, Mr. McKenzie had not entered his appearance, in fact, when\u2014 THE COURT: Entered his appearance in what case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">MR. JEZIC: In the Goldsberry case when he spoke to Mr. Myers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">THE COURT: Well, if I tell you that his appearance in the Circuit Court on behalf of Mr. Goldsberry was entered 6-28-06, [yjou\u2019re saying that he spoke with Mr. Myers before that date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">MR. JEZIC: He spoke to Mr. Myers\u2014what Mr. McKenzie remembers is that he spoke to Mr. Myers before the preliminary hearing date. He called me to tell me about the prospective client Mr. Goldsberry. He told me that he had spoken to Mr. Myers. I immediately said, \u201cMr. McKenzie, you\u2019ve got to call the Court to find out if a line has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>entered.\u201d As you said, he called and he was told a line had not been entered for Mr. Myers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">THE COURT: Did Mr. Myers have a substantive conversation with you, Mr. McKenzie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">MR. JEZIC: About the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">MR. MCKENZIE: What constitutes substantive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">THE COURT: Did you discuss about the chronology or facts in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">MR.

MCKENZIE: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">THE COURT: Mr. McKenzie, I would point out, participated in the suppression hearing addressing the issue of identification, as did [Mr. Myers\u2019 Counsel], on August 11th of '06. Mr. McKenzie, was there a reason you didn\u2019t advise [Myers\u2019 Counsel] at that time that you had talked with her client on a prior occasion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">MR. MCKENZIE: At that time I did not know\u2014and I didn\u2019t think that there was an obligation to disclose that to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">THE COURT: Well, clearly, you were representing Mr. Goldsberry at that point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">MR. MCKENZIE: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">MR. JEZIC: There is no malice intended here whatsoever, Your Honor. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any alleged malice. He\u2019s just a very young attorney. As a matter of fact, he took the responsibility of calling me as soon as he spoke to Myers and Goldsberry____ Clearly, it was not a good idea, but we do not believe there was any violation of the rules of professional responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-18\">THE COURT: ... [Mr. Myers\u2019 Counsel], anything else you want to tell me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>[MYERS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I think that the Rule 4.2, I don\u2019t think that you can ignore the fact that, in a first-degree murder case, this man is going to have a lawyer. You can\u2019t pretend like that\u2019s not true, and ignoring that rule because the line hasn\u2019t been in the file yet is a very fine distinction, and I think that the prejudice to my client vastly outweighs judicial economy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">THE COURT: All right. What is obviously clear from the record is that Mr. McKenzie spoke with the codefendant Mr. Myers at a date prior to his appearance and that Mr. Jezic\u2019s being entered on behalf of Mr. Goldsberry on June 28th of '06. Mr. McKenzie, do you know when you may have talked to Mr. Myers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">MR. MCKENZIE: It was probably towards the latter part of March. It was before they were indicted, possibly very early April.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">MR. JEZIC: My understanding is this can be verified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">THE COURT: The bottom line is that there had been charges initiated; he just hadn\u2019t been indicted; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">MR. MCKENZIE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">THE COURT: From the representations made, it\u2019s clear that Mr. McKenzie did not convey to Mr. Jezic the sum and substance\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">MR.

Very simply, Mr. Jezic, you represent Mr. Goldsberry, and Mr. McKenzie is not representing him anymore. Just as simple as that. This is not a problem. The reality is that there\u2019s been absolutely no prejudice to Mr. Goldsberry, but the reality is that\u2014and, Mr. McKenzie, you can step back from the trial table, but the reality is\u2014and you can consult with Mr. Jezic during the course of the trial, but we\u2019re going to keep this trial going forward wherein there\u2019s no taint whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">MR. JEZIC: Your Honor, may I put one thing on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">THE COURT: Yes, sir, Mr. Jezic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">MR. JEZIC: I apologize. It\u2019s back at the trial table. May I get my folder real quick? Have a cite to give. It will be very brief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">THE COURT: You can give that to me later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">MR. JEZIC: Just to put it on the record, my objection, Your Honor, is that the recent Supreme Court case in 2006, in June, was about the sixth amendment right to counsel. The Supreme Court ruled that the defendant has an absolute right to counsel of choice, and it did involve the judge weighing a potential violation of the rules of professional responsibility versus the sixth amendment. My client has indicated to me this morning that he would like Mr. McKenzie to remain at the trial table and that is our objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">THE COURT: Well, the reality is, if he remains at the trial table, he can remain at the trial table. I don\u2019t have a problem with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>I\u2019m just going ahead and pointing out that there should not be any communication between you, Mr. Jezic, and you, Mr. McKenzie, regarding the conversations that may have been made by Mr. Myers to Mr. McKenzie. This isn\u2019t a basis for a severance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">MR. TEFERI: A witness by the name of Tawanna Davis, who you instructed to come back today, gave grand jury testimony. If she somehow changes her testimony from what she had told the grand jury\u2014and if I have to go line by line\u2014there might come a point in time where I\u2019m going to ask her if she was coached by an attorney. She told the grand jury that she was coached by one Mr. Goldsberry and also Mr. McKenzie before she went to that grand jury. I just wanted to put that on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMz\">THE COURT: That\u2019s all the more reason. Mr. McKenzie has put himself in the position of being a possible witness in this case. So with that in mind, the Court is even more comfortable now than it was two minutes ago with telling Mr. McKenzie he can\u2019t participate in this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">So we\u2019re not going to take any chances. Mr. McKenzie will not now be sitting at trial table, not because Mr. Goldsberry doesn\u2019t want him to, but the reality is he could potentially be a witness in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">MR. JEZIC: Okay, Your Honor, we understand. We just continue the objection. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">THE COURT: I think there\u2019s an exception if he\u2019s going to be a witness. The other point, there\u2019s a motion for severance. It\u2019s denied on that basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">As to the suggestion that the Circuit Court should have required an explanation for Mr. McKenzie\u2019s visit and/or what he and Mr. Myers discussed during the visit, in <em>Lettley v. State, </em>358 Md. 26, 746 A.2d 392 (2000), this Court quoted with approval the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">[I]f the lawyer is required to supply a sufficiently detailed basis for his or her concern about the need to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>or the need to refuse to do so, that also creates a serious risk of exposing confidential communications of one or both clients. The absence of any clearly correct course of action in such a case suggests ... that judges should normally accept at face value a lawyer\u2019s assertion that a conflict of interest exists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">CHARLES W.

Moreover, in making the required \u201cthreshold level of evidentiary inquiry into the alleged conflicts,\u201d the trial court is obligated to respect all applicable privileges. In the case at bar, the Circuit Court could not (1) compel Mr. Myers to testify about his conversation with Mr. McKenzie, or (2) compel Mr. McKenzie to testify about his conversation with Mr. Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">It is of no consequence that Mr. McKenzie\u2019s potential for serious conflict was brought to the Circuit Court\u2019s attention by Mr. Myers\u2019 trial counsel.

Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) ], defense counsel represented to the trial court that he had received confidential information from one client that would interfere with his ability to examine his other clients on the witness stand. <em>See id. </em>at 476-78, 98 S.Ct. 1173. The state argued that \u201cunscrupulous defense attorneys might abuse their \u2018authority,\u2019 presumably for purposes of delay or obstruction of the orderly conduct of the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 98 S.Ct. 1173. The Court rejected this view, stating that courts should credit such representations of defense counsel. The Court observed that an attorney representing two clients \u201cis in the best position professionally and ethically to determine when a conflict of interest exists or will probably develop in the course of a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 98 S.Ct. 1173 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court commented that \u201csince the decision in <em>Glasser [v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) ], most courts have held that an attorney\u2019s request for the appointment of separate counsel, based on his representations as an officer of the court regarding a conflict of interests, should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>granted.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Attorneys\u2019 representations are trustworthy, the Court reasoned, because \u201cattorneys are officers of the court, and when they address the judge solemnly upon a matter before the court, their declarations are virtually under oath.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 98 S.Ct. 1173 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen a considered representation regarding a conflict in clients interests comes from an officer of the court, it should be given the weight commensurate with the grave penalties risked for misrepresentation.\u201d Id. at 486 n. 9, 98 S.Ct. 1173.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Id. at 46-47, 746 A.2d at 404. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The first sentence in the COMMENT to Rule 3.7 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) states: \u201cCombining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the tribunal and the opposing party and can also involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client.\u201d I am certain that, like Mr. Jezic and Mr. Giannetti, Mr. McKenzie is an ethical practitioner who would not knowingly violate any Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct. I am equally certain, however, that Mr. McKenzie\u2019s visit to Mr. Myers was more than merely \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d By discussing the \u201cfacts of the case\u201d with Mr. Myers, Mr. McKenzie created the potential for a serious conflict between himself and the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In <em>Rubin v. Gee, </em>292 F.3d 396, 401-02 (4th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, Gee v. Rubin, </em>537 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 637, 154 L.Ed.2d 523 (2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to grant federal habeas corpus relief to Lisa Joyce Rubin,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> whose murder conviction had been affirmed by this Court in <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 602 A.2d 677 (1992). The federal courts concluded that she was entitled to a new trial on the ground that she had not received \u201cconflict-free representation\u201d from two lawyers on her defense team who, \u201cto avoid criminal indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>and keep their conduct from coming to light, ... took cover as part of the defense team.\u201d 292 F.3d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">While it is clear that the case at bar is not one in which Mr. McKenzie was attempting to \u201ctake cover as part of the defense team,\u201d it is equally clear that the Respondent\u2019s right to \u201cconflict-free representation\u201d would have been impaired by the defense team\u2019s decision to employ a particular litigation strategy for purposes of reducing the chances that Mr. McKenzie might be accused of violating a Rule of Professional Conduct. The COMMENT to RPC 1.18 cautions that, \u201c[i]n order to avoid acquiring disqualifying information from a prospective client, a lawyer considering whether or not to undertake a new matter should limit the initial interview to only such information as reasonably appears necessary for that purpose.\u201d In the case at bar, however, it is clear that Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Myers discussed \u201cthe chronology or facts in this ease[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Under these circumstances, if Mr. McKenzie was acting as the Respondent\u2019s lawyer when he visited Mr. Myers, it is obvious that Mr. McKenzie was a potential witness. On the other hand, if Mr. McKenzie visited Mr. Myers to discuss the possibility of forming a lawyer-client relationship, even though no client-lawyer relationship ensued, Mr. McKenzie was prohibited by RPC 1.18(b) from revealing \u201cinformation learned in the consultation,\u201d and was prohibited by RPC 1.18(c) from representing the Respondent \u201cin the same or a substantially related matter if [Mr. McKenzie] received information from [Mr. Myers] that could be significantly harmful to [the Respondent].\u201d In <em>Lettley, supra, </em>this Court expressly rejected the argument that, \u201cbecause no other lawyer would have had access to that confidential information, there was no conflict of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 746 A.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Because I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court did not err or abuse \u201cits discretion in determining that [the Respondent\u2019s] right to counsel of choice was outweighed by countervailing interests of fairness, maintaining ethical standards, and avoiding conflicts of interests,\u201d I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>address the issue of whether the Respondent is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court delivered a coercive \u201cunanimity\u201d instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">. 128 F.Supp.2d 848 (D.Md.2001) is the citation to the opinion of the federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
