Stern, Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on June 23, 1994. On April 16, 2010, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-751(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Stern, charging numerous violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cRule\u201d), including Rule 1.2(a) (Scope of Representation),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 1.16(d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 8.1(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>(Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rules 8.4(b), (c), and (d) (Misconduct),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code (2000, 2010 RepLVol.),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rule 16-604 (Trust Account),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Rule 16-609 (Prohibited Transactions).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>According to the \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action,\u201d Stern failed to pay a physical therapy provider approximately $45,000.00 in connection with his representation of nineteen clients in personal injury cases, although the requisite assignments and authorizations had been given; he also allegedly settled a personal injury claim on behalf of a client without the client\u2019s knowledge or consent. This Court referred the matter to Judge Lawrence P. Fletcher-Hill of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for hearing, pursuant to Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>On June 8, 2010, Stern was personally served with process, to which was appended the Petition filed by Bar Counsel. Stern filed an \u201cAnswer to Petition\u201d on June 24, 2010. When Judge Fletcher-Hill held a hearing on the Petition on October 1, 2010, however, Stern neither attended nor participated, although he had been duly notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Fletcher-Hill issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which he found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Stern\u2019s conduct constituted violations of Rules 1.2(a), 1.15(d), 8.4(c), and (d), 16-604, 16-609(c), and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The initial findings concerned Stern\u2019s background, as well as his arrangement with C.J.B. Therapy Centers, Inc. (\u201cC.J.B.\u201d), whereby C.J.B., after having provided therapy services, would not bill Stern\u2019s clients directly with the expectation that Stern would pay C.J.B. from his clients\u2019 case recoveries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">1. Respondent Gary F. Stern was admitted to the bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on June 23,1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">2. Some of Mr. Stern\u2019s clients with personal injury claims received physical therapy services from C.J.B. Therapy Centers, Inc. Respondent Stern had an arrangement with C.J.B. under which C.J.B. deferred billing the clients with the expectation that C.J.B. would be paid for its services by Mr. Stern directly from personal injury recoveries received by the clients. C.J.B. had similar arrangements with other attorneys in addition to Mr. Stern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>3. C.J.B.\u2019s practice was to have patients with personal injury claims sign an \u201cAUTHORIZATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS (LIEN) TO C.J.B. THERAPY CENTER.\u201d Samples of this form were admitted at the hearing as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1. C.J.B.\u2019s practice was to have the patient\u2019s attorney also sign the Authorization and Assignment. C.J.B. personnel initiated this process and sent the forms to the attorney for signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">4. In the third paragraph of the Authorization and Assignment, the patient authorizes and directs insurance companies to make direct payments to C.J.B. for services rendered to the patient. That paragraph also contains the following sentence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">I also authorize and direct my attorney to make prompt payment to C.J.B. Therapy Center any sums which may be due and owing from the proceeds of any settlement, judgment or insurance payment including services or supplies heretofore supplied and those supplied to the time of settlement, judgment or insurance payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">5. The next paragraph of the Authorization and Assignment provides, in boldface:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">I, as the representing attorney, by also signing this authorization and Assignment of Benefits to C.J.B. Therapy Center agree to follow the aforementioned authorization and direction of my client to pay C.J.B. Therapy Center any sums due and owing from the proceeds of any settlement, judgment or insurance payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">6. The following eighteen patients signed C.J.B. Authorization and Assignment forms on the dates indicated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">Sean P.

The only Authorization and Assignment forms that were also signed by Mr. Stern as attorney are the forms for the three patients with asterisks after their names. On all of the other forms, the line for the attorney\u2019s signature is blank. C.J.B. understood that all of these patients were represented by Mr. Stern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">7. As listed, Mr. Stern was also a patient at C.J.B. He signed his own Authorization and Assignment as both patient and attorney. Denise Brown, Elrea Spurr, and Haile Stern are all either family members of Mr. Stern or individuals who were involved in the same accident with Mr. Stern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">8. An additional patient, Darion Johnson, received services from C.J.B., but the Commission did not provide an Authorization and Assignment form signed by Darion Johnson. C.J.B. understood that Darion Johnson was represented by Mr. Stern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Judge Fletcher-Hill found that Stern failed to remit payment to C.J.B. for services rendered to sixteen of Stern\u2019s nineteen clients, despite having received monies in connection with the clients\u2019 personal injury recoveries, referring to the testimony of Spencer Arrington, owner of C.J.B. Therapy Centers, Inc.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">9. Each of the nineteen patients identified above received services from C.J.B. in 2008. For each of the nineteen patients, C.J.B. sent an invoice or invoices directly to Mr. Stern itemizing the costs of the services provided to that patient. The total amount billed by C.J.B. for all nineteen patients is $74,605.68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>10. C.J.B. subsequently provided Mr. Stern with a summary of the balance owed for the nineteen patients. CJ.B.\u2019s owner, Spencer Arrington, did not provide any explanation of these reduced amounts for some of the patients. Specifically, he did not testify to any partial payments made by Mr. Stern or from other sources. For all nineteen patients, the balance due shown on the summary is $44,465.59.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">11. With respect to Mr. Stern and the three patients who are either his family members or individuals involved in the same accident with him, Mr. Arrington testified that he reached an agreement with Mr. Stern to reduce the total amount due for those four patients to $6,000. Mr. Arrington testified that Mr. Stern paid $3,000 pursuant to that compromise, but that Mr. Stern never paid the remaining $3,000 due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">12. With respect to the other fifteen patients, Mr. Stern never paid the amounts listed as due on the summary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">13. The total amounts billed by C.J.B. for the nineteen patients and the amounts remaining unpaid are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">Patient</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A86I\">Total Amount Billed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3U\">Amount Remaining Due on Summary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">Amount Remaining Due Following Compromise Involving Four Patients</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Sean P.

The Commission introduced into evidence bank records produced under subpoena and certified by a custodian of records from Bank of America N.A. to be bank statements, debits, and credits from May 2008 to May 2010 for two accounts: \u201cLaw Office of Gary F. Stern Escrow Account,\u201d account number ending in 6211, and \u201cLaw Office of Gary F. Stern General Business Account,\u201d account number ending in 7719.

This is consistent with, though not exactly consistent with, the payment of $1,901.00 made by Mr. Stern to C.J.B. on behalf of Mr. Turner. Mr. Stern received settlement proceeds for Mr. Turner from which the balance due to C.J.B. should have been paid. Ultimately, for the reasons stated in the findings below, Mr. Stern refunded the settlement amount for Mr. Turner to Travelers Insurance. Thus, although Mr. Stern failed to deliver funds promptly to C.J.B. on behalf of Mr. Turner, he has not retained any amount due to C.J.B. on behalf of Mr. Turner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">17.

This is consistent with, though not exactly consistent with, the July 10, 2008 payment of $999.19 made to C.J.B. on behalf of Ms. Brown.

With respect to sixteen of the nineteen clients included in the Commission\u2019s first claim, the Commission has proved that Mr. Stern received the proceeds of settlements on behalf of those clients; that those clients received services from C.J.B.; that C.J.B. was to receive payment for those services from the settlement proceeds; and that Mr. Stern failed to pay in full the amounts due to C.J.B. The clients for whom this was the case are Sean P. Turner, Gary F. Stern, Denise Brown, Haile Stern, Micah Tucker, Dorothy Crowder, Dennis Hall, Collyn Riggs, Anthony Hemphill, Johnny Moore, Jr., Wesley Henderson, Jr., Wesley Henderson III, Clifford Johnson, Antionette Ellis, David Blake, and Darion Johnson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">69. With respect to the remaining three clients included in the Commission\u2019s first claim, the Commission has failed to prove the allegations by clear and convincing proof, primarily because there is no clear evidence that Mr. Stern received the proceeds of settlements on behalf of those clients. The clients for whom this was the case are Elrea Spurr, Tiffany Gordon, and Bryan Moore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">Judge Fletcher-Hill then turned to Stern\u2019s representation of Sean P. Turner in connection with a personal injury claim arising from an automobile accident in the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>54. Sean P. Turner retained Mr. Stern to represent him in connection with a claim for personal injuries Mr. Turner sustained in a May 2008 automobile accident. Mr. Stern met with Mr. Turner at Mr. Turner\u2019s home approximately one week after the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\">55. Mr. Turner injured his knee, back, and chest in the accident. He received treatment from C.J.B. from May to August 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">56. Mr. Turner had $2,500 in personal injury protection coverage with USAA. He understood that any PIP payments were being made directly to Mr. Stern. Mr. Turner never received any payment of PIP benefits either directly from USAA or from Mr. Stern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">57. In about February 2009, Mr. Turner received a letter from a collection agency concerning a medical bill for $472.31 related to treatment following the 2008 accident. The bill was from a provider other than C.J.B. Mr. Turner ultimately paid this medical bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">58. Because of the outstanding medical bill, Mr. Turner began investigating the status of his claim. He tried to contact Mr. Stern, but Mr. Stern did not return his telephone calls. Mr. Turner then contacted Travelers Insurance, which insured the other driver in the accident. Mr. Turner was advised that the claim had been settled for $11,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Judge Fletcher-Hill then found that Stern had settled Mr. Turner\u2019s claim without his authorization or consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">59. Mr. Turner never authorized Mr. Stern to make a settlement demand in his case in any specific amount. He never authorized Mr. Stern to settle his claim for $11,000. Mr. Turner was not satisfied with a settlement of $11,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">60. In April 2009, Travelers provided to Mr. Turner copies of a \u201cRelease in Full,\u201d purportedly signed by Mr. Turner on September 18, 2008, and Travelers\u2019 settlement check for $11,000 dated September 19, 2008 and purportedly endorsed by Mr. Turner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>61. Mr. Turner did not sign either the \u201cRelease in Full\u201d or the endorsement on the Travelers settlement check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">62. As stated above, the Travelers settlement check was negotiated and the proceeds were deposited into Mr. Stern\u2019s escrow account on September 23, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">63. Mr. Stern did not pay to Mr. Turner any of the proceeds of the settlement from September 2008 to April 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">64. After learning that his claim had been settled, Mr. Turner retained another attorney, Joel I. Hoffman, Esquire. Mr. Hoffman succeeded in having the claim reopened by Travelers Insurance. Mr. Turner ultimately settled the claim to his satisfaction for $21,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">65. In September 2009, Mr. Stern tendered to Mr. Hoffman $ll,037.60-the $11,000.00 settlement plus $37.60 received for an x-ray bill. Mr. Stern also provided a copy of his check paying C.J.B. $1,901.00 for therapy expenses. In a letter admitted as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 10, Mr. Stern also provided his explanation of his communications with Mr. Turner and his settlement of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">66. At some point after Mr. Turner obtained the settlement documents from Travelers, he had at least one telephone conversation with Mr. Stern. Mr. Stern made statements to Mr. Turner to the effect of: \u201cOh, I had your money\u201d; \u201cMy secretary signed the documents\u201d; and \u201cI sign for my clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">67. Mr. Turner did not accept Mr. Stern\u2019s tender of the settlement proceeds. As stated above, the bank records show that Mr. Stern refunded the $11,000 settlement to Travelers on December 1, 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Judge Fletcher-Hill then determined that Stern\u2019s failure to remit payment to C.J.B. on behalf of sixteen of the nineteen clients constituted violations of Rule 1.15(d) and Rule 8.4(d), and that, with respect to at least one client, Stern also violated Rule 16-609(c) and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article by failing to maintain funds owed C.J.B. in his attorney trust account. Finally, Judge Fletcher-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Hill found that with respect to one client, Antionette Ellis, Stern also violated Rule 16-604 by depositing a settlement check received on her behalf in his general business account, rather than his attorney trust account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\">70. With respect to the sixteen clients identified in paragraph 68, Mr. Stern violated Rule 1.15(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing promptly to deliver to C.J.B., a third person, those funds from the settlement proceeds that C.J.B. was entitled to receive based on the services C.J.B. rendered to Mr. Stern\u2019s clients. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137, 163-64 [904 A.2d 557] (2006) (delay in delivering settlement funds to client and medical providers violates Rule 1.15(b), now Rule 1.15(d)); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Stolarz, </em>379 Md. 387, 400-01 [842 A.2d 42] (2004) (even inadvertent failure to pay third party from settlement funds violates Rule 1.15(b), now Rule 1.15(d)). With respect to Mr. Turner, Mr. Stem\u2019s violation of Rule 1.15(d) is one of delay only because he ultimately refunded the settlement proceeds to Travelers. With respect to the other fifteen identified clients, Mr. Stem has never paid the amounts due to C.J.B. and he has retained or otherwise disposed of the settlement proceeds from which those amounts should have been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">71. As noted above, the Commission withdrew its allegation of a violation of Rule 8.1(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct as part of its first claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">72. With respect to the sixteen clients identified in paragraph 68, Mr. Stern violated Rule 8.4(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct because his failure promptly to deliver to C.J.B. the funds from the settlement proceeds that C.J.B. was entitled to receive based on the services C.J.B. rendered to Mr. Stern\u2019s clients is conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">73. With respect to the fifteen of the sixteen clients identified in paragraph 68, excluding Antionette Ellis, the Commission has failed to prove a violation of Maryland Rule 16-604 because the Commission has not proved by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Stern failed to deposit into his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>attorney trust account settlement funds that should have been deposited there. With respect to Antoinette Ellis, the Commission has proved by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Stern violated Maryland Rule 16-604 by depositing one settlement check received on behalf of Ms. Ellis in his general business account rather than his attorney trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">74. With respect to at least one of the sixteen clients identified in paragraph 68, Mr. Stern violated Maryland Rule 16\u2014609(c). The total amount due C.J.B. for fifteen of those clients, excluding Sean P. Turner, is $29,756.49. Mr. Turner is excluded from this sum because, although Mr. Stern did not pay C.J.B. all that was due it on behalf of Mr. Turner, Mr. Stern ultimately refunded all of the Turner settlement proceeds to Travelers. If Mr. Stern did not withdraw any of these funds from his escrow account to pay them to the client or for any other purpose, then this amount would have to have remained in Mr. Stern\u2019s escrow account from the time when it had accumulated to the present. The balances in the escrow account, however, show that the total amount in the escrow account has dropped below $29,756.49 in at least eight of the eleven months from July 2009 to May 2010, even considering only the month-end balances in that account. Thus, for at least one of these clients, Mr. Stern \u201ccreate[d] a negative balance [in his attorney trust account] with regard to an individual client matter,\u201d in violation of Maryland Rule 16-609(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">75. With respect to at least one of the sixteen clients identified in paragraph 68, Mr. Stem violated Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. As found in the immediately preceding paragraph, Mr. Stern failed to maintain in his attorney trust account the balance necessary to pay in full all of the amounts due to C.J.B. on behalf of the fifteen clients, excluding Mr. Turner. Funds from a settlement due to be paid to a third party are \u201ctrust money\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, and the failure to hold those funds for the third party amounts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>using them for another purpose in violation of \u00a7 10-306. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. 124, 157 [879 A.2d 58] (2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Judge Fletcher-Hill further determined that Stern violated Rule 1.2(a), Rule 1.15(d), Rules 8.4(c) and (d), Rule 16-609(c), as well as Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article because of his settlement of Mr. Turner\u2019s case without his consent, but that Stern did not violate Rule 1.16(d) or Rule 16-604:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">76. In his representation of Sean P. Turner, Mr. Stern violated Rule 1.2(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Mr. Stern made a settlement demand and then purported to conclude a settlement on behalf of Mr. Turner, all without consulting with Mr. Turner. Mr. Stern failed to \u201cconsult with the client as to the means by which [the client\u2019s objectives] are to be pursued.\u201d By failing even to give Mr. Turner the opportunity to decide whether to settle his claim, Mr. Stern failed to \u201cabide by a client\u2019s decision whether to settle a matter.\u201d This was a violation of Rule 1.2(a) of the most fundamental order. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Thaxton, </em>415 Md. 341, 362 [1 A.3d 470] (2010) (similar conduct recognized as violation of Rule 1.2(a) in reciprocal discipline case); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 530-31 [894 A.2d 502] (2006) (same in direct discipline case).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">77. In his letter admitted as Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 10, Mr. Stern tried to explain his actions in settling Mr. Turner\u2019s claim by writing that he communicated the settlement offer to Mr. Turner and then assumed it was acceptable when Mr. Turner failed to respond to his telephone calls. Even if the Court were to consider this explanation, despite Mr. Stern\u2019s absence from the hearing, it is factually inconsistent with Mr. Turner\u2019s credible testimony that it was Mr. Stern, not Mr. Turner, who failed to return telephone calls. Moreover, even if Mr. Stern\u2019s statements were believable, his conduct still would violate Rule 1.2(a) because, by Mr. Stern\u2019s own admission, Mr. Turner never gave him specific parameters within which to settle the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>78. Although not alleged by the Commission, Mr. Stern also violated Rule 1.4(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to communicate with Mr. Turner throughout the representation. <em>See Thaxton, </em>415 Md. at 362 [1 A.3d 470].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">79. As already concluded above, Mr. Stern violated Rule 1.15(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in his representation of Mr. Turner by failing to deliver promptly to C.J.B. amounts that were due to C.J.B. after receipt of the settlement funds from Travelers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">80. Mr. Stern also violated Rule 1.15(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to pay to Mr. Turner the proceeds of the settlement that were due to Mr. Turner promptly after paying any third parties entitled to be paid from the settlement proceeds. <em>Roberts, </em>394 Md. at 163-64 [904 A.2d 557]. As found above, Mr. Stern received the $11,000 settlement amount and deposited it into his escrow account on September 23, 2008. Mr. Stern made a payment to C.J.B. on September 24, 2008, but that payment was actually the payment of PIP proceeds received from USAA on September 15, 2008. Mr. Stern did not even inform Mr. Turner of receipt of the $11,000 settlement until Mr. Turner made inquiries to him after learning of the settlement independently at least seven months later. Mr. Stern\u2019s professional obligation was to inform Mr. Turner of the settlement promptly and to disburse the funds as appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">81. Because of the incompleteness of the records introduced into evidence, the Court is unable to determine whether Mr. Stern took his own fee from the proceeds of the purported Turner settlement or otherwise improperly disbursed any of the settlement funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">82. The Commission has failed to prove a violation of Rule 1.16(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in Mr. Stern\u2019s representation of Mr. Turner because the Commission has not proved all the circumstances in which Mr. Turner terminated Mr. Stern\u2019s representation of him or what demands, if any, Mr. Turner made of Mr. Stern to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>return papers relating to the representation. Fortunately, by his own efforts, the efforts of new counsel, and the apparent cooperation of Travelers, Mr. Turner was able to re-open his claim and achieve a satisfactory settlement with Travelers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">83. As noted above, the Commission withdrew its allegation of a violation of Rule 8.1(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct as part of its second claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">84. In his representation of Mr. Turner, Mr. Stern violated Rule 8.4(c) and (d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. Mr. Stern tendered to Travelers the \u201cRelease in Full\u201d which purported to be signed by Mr. Turner when Mr. Stern knew both that it was not in fact signed by Mr. Turner and that Mr. Turner had not even authorized the settlement and release. This was both \u201cconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\u201d and \u201cconduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d It was harmful to Mr. Turner in purporting to surrender his claim for an amount he did not authorize and harmful to Travelers in purporting to resolve a matter that was not in fact resolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">85. The Commission has failed to prove a violation of Maryland Rule 16-604 in Mr. Stern\u2019s representation of Mr. Turner because the Commission has not proved by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Stern failed to deposit the Turner settlement proceeds into his attorney trust fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">86. In his representation of Mr. Turner, Mr. Stern violated Maryland Rule 16-609(c). If Mr. Stern had never withdrawn any of the Turner settlement funds from his escrow account for any purpose, then he would have maintained a balance of at least $11,000 in that account from receipt of the funds in September 2008 until he refunded them to Travelers on December 1, 2009. The balances in the escrow account, however, show that the total amount in the escrow account dropped below $11,000 in at least six of the months during that period, even considering only the month-end balances in that account. Indeed, the balance in Mr. Stern\u2019s escrow account at the end of September 2008, the month in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>which he first received the settlement proceeds, was only $3,830.76. Thus, on multiple occasions Mr. Stern \u201ccreate[d] a negative balance [in his attorney trust account] with regard to an individual client matter,\u201d in violation of Maryland Rule 16\u2014609(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">87. Mr. Stern violated Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article in his representation of Mr. Turner. As found in the immediately preceding paragraph, Mr. Stern failed to maintain in his attorney trust account the balance necessary to pay in full all of the amounts due to Mr. Turner and C.J.B. from the settlement funds. Funds from a settlement due to be paid to a client or third party are \u201ctrust money\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, and the failure to hold those funds for the third party amounts to using them for another purpose in violation of \u00a7 10-306. <em>Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. at 157 [879 A.2d 58].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Stern also did not file any exceptions nor did he appear at oral argument before this Court. As a result, we accept Judge Fletcher-Hill\u2019s findings of fact as established for the purpose of determining the proper sanction. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A). Based upon our de novo review of the record, we agree that Stern violated Rule 1.15(d) and Rule 8.4(d) regarding his failure to remit payment to C.J.B. on behalf of sixteen clients, although he had received settlement proceeds on behalf of those clients, and that with respect to at least one client, Stern also violated Rule 16-609(c) and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article by failing to maintain funds due C.J.B. in his escrow account. We also agree with the hearing judge that Stern violated Rule 16-604 with respect to Antionette Ellis by depositing a settlement check received on her behalf in his general business account, rather than his attorney trust account. Finally, based upon our de novo review of the record, we agree that Stern violated Rule 1.2(a), Rule 1.15(d), Rules 8.4(c) and (d), Rule 16-609(c), and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, but not Rule 1.16(d) or Rule 16-604, in connection with his settlement of Mr. Turner\u2019s claim without Mr. Turner\u2019s knowledge or consent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Bar Counsel recommends disbarment in the present case because Stem\u2019s misconduct \u201cwas a willful violation of the law and no mitigation of his conduct has been established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">In the present case, Stern misappropriated payments belonging to C.J.B. for services rendered on behalf of his clients, failed to keep the funds due C.J.B. in his escrow account, and also deposited the settlement check of Antoinette Ellis in his general account rather than in trust, all in violation of Rules 1.15(d), 8.4(d), 16-604, 16-609(c), and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. In addition, Stern settled Sean Turner\u2019s claim without Mr. Turner\u2019s knowledge or permission, failed to timely pay Mr. Turner, submitted a release to an insurer which bore a forged signature, and failed to maintain funds from Mr. Turner\u2019s case in trust, all in violation of Rules 1.2(a), 1.15(d), 8.4(c) and (d), 16-609(c), and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">It has long been settled that \u201can attorney\u2019s misappropriation of funds entrusted to his care, be the amount small or large, is of great concern and represents the gravest form of professional misconduct.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Palmer, </em>417 Md. 185, 9 A.3d 37 (2010), quoting, <em>Attorney Grievance v. Thomas, </em>409 Md. 121, 175, 973 A.2d 185, 218 (2009). The default sanction for ethical violations involving intentional \u201cmisappropriation, or other intentional dishonest conduct,\u201d is disbarment. <em>Attorney Grievance v. West, </em>411 Md. 3, 27-28, 981 A.2d 621, 635 (2009). Here, Stern\u2019s personal injury clients signed authorizations such that C.J.B. would be paid for physical therapy services from any recoveries in their cases. Rather than remit payment to C.J.B., however, Stern misappropriated those funds in connection with sixteen of nineteen clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We have also imposed disbarment when an attorney has settled a client\u2019s claim without the client\u2019s knowledge or consent, engaging in a pattern of deception and self-dealing. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Fox, </em>417 Md. 504, 11 A.3d 762 (2010), a client retained Fox because he had been injured in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>automobile accident. Fox failed to consult with the client regarding a settlement, settled his client\u2019s claim without notifying the client, and the client did not learn of the settlement until he hired new counsel after being sued by a medical provider, all in violation of Rule 1.2(a), as well as Rule 8.4(d). We disbarred Fox, reasoning that his failure to discuss the settlement or notify his client for a period of six years amounted to \u201cabandonment,\u201d such that he was unfit to practice law in Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 11 A.3d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Similarly, in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 894 A.2d 502 (2006), we recognized disbarment was necessary for the protection of the public when an attorney settled his client\u2019s personal injury claim without his authorization or knowledge and deposited the check in a personal account in violation of Rule 1.2(a), Rules 1.15(a), (b), and (c), and Rules 8.4(c) and (d). In imposing the gravest sanction of disbarment, we emphasized that Kapoor\u2019s misconduct of forging a client\u2019s signature on a settlement check was dishonest, deceitful, and prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Stern\u2019s conduct in the present case, misappropriating tens of thousands of dollars in client funds and settling a client\u2019s claim without that client\u2019s knowledge or consent, warrants the gravest sanction, disbarment, for the protection of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST GARY FRANCIS STERN.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-12\">.
