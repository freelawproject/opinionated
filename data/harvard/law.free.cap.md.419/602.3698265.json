The State\u2019s evidence, which was sufficient to establish that she committed those offenses on March 31, 2007, included testimony about three statements that Petitioner gave to investigating officers. The Circuit Court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s pretrial motion for suppression of those statements, and that ruling was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion. Petitioner then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in which she presented two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">1. DID COURTS BELOW ERR IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER WAS NOT IN \u201cCUSTODY\u201d FOR PURPOSES OF THE RULES OF <em>MIRANDA V. ARIZONA </em>[, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)] WHERE PETITIONER, SUSPECTED IN A MURDER, WAS PLACED IN [A] POLICE SQUAD CAR WITH BAGS ON HER HANDS TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY PLACED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN A \u201cHOLDING CELL\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">2. DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN ITS RESPONSES TO TWO NOTES FROM THE JURY IN A MANNER WHICH INTERFERED WITH THE JURY\u2019S AUTHORITY TO DRAW REASONABLE AND EXCULPATORY INFERENCES FROM THE EVIDENCE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">According to the State, Petitioner\u2019s questions should be rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">1. DID THE SUPPRESSION COURT CORRECTLY CONCLUDE THAT ROBINSON WAS NOT IN CUSTODY FOR PURPOSES OF MIRANDA WHEN SHE MADE HER FIRST TWO STATEMENTS TO POLICE AND, REGARDLESS, TO THE EXTENT ANY ERROR OCCURRED, WAS IT HARMLESS IN LIGHT OF ROBINSON\u2019S LATER STATEMENT MADE AFTER SHE WAS ADVISED OF AND WAIVED HER RIGHTS UNDER MIRANDA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">2. SHOULD THIS COURT REFUSE TO DISTURB THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS\u2019 DECISION TO DECLINE TO REVIEW FOR PLAIN ERROR THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S ANSWERS TO TWO NOTES FROM THE JURY?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cyes\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s first question and \u201cno\u201d to the State\u2019s first ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tion. As a result of these answers, the parties\u2019 second questions are moot. We shall therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and direct that Court to (1) vacate the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and (2) remand for a new trial during which only the first of Petitioner\u2019s three statements will be admissible during the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals included the following factual summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">On March 31, 2007, police were called to 6622 Knottwood Court in Baltimore City in response to a shooting. Upon arrival at 2:34 p.m., officers found Andre McBride near death. McBride had been shot three times: once in the back of the head, once in the back of the shoulder, and once in the front of the thigh. McBride was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Robinson made three separate statements to police about the shooting. The first was taken at the scene of the shooting, the second was taken the same day at the homicide unit, and the third was taken approximately five weeks after the shooting at the homicide unit following Robinson\u2019s arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">The first statement was taken by Officer Andre Godfrey. Officer Godfrey was called to the scene of the shooting. Upon arrival, Officer Godfrey saw Robinson attempting to enter a white van. Inside the van were three individuals, who were later determined to be Robinson\u2019s mother, sister, and a male companion of Robinson\u2019s mother. Because Officer Godfrey was not certain of what, if any, role these individuals had in the shooting, he detained all four individuals at the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">Officer Godfrey then asked them if they knew McBride. Robinson responded that McBride was her boyfriend, that they had been arguing all day, \u201cand then it moved upstairs and that\u2019s when she heard gunshots.\u201d This untaped statement was taken without any pressure or force from officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Godfrey, while Robinson was in her mother\u2019s van, surrounded by family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">After Robinson finished this statement, Officer Godfrey\u2019s supervisors instructed him to place bags on Robinson\u2019s hands and place her in a patrol car. These supervisors also informed Robinson and her family that there was an investigation going on and instructed them not to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">After being placed in the patrol car, with her hands and feet uncuffed, Robinson was transported to the police facility. Once there, Robinson was photographed and her hands were tested for gunshot residue. She was then placed in a holding cell. Her mother and sister, who were also transported to the police facility, were placed in an interview room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Later that evening, Robinson was moved from the holding cell to an interview room. At that time, she was questioned by Detective Joseph Phelps and Detective Sergeant Kelvin Sewell. Robinson gave a taped statement in which she admitted to being with McBride in the house at the time of the shooting, that they had been arguing throughout the day, and that their relationship had become rocky, marked by constant arguments. Robinson, however, insisted that she did not shoot McBride. She stated that the shooting occurred as she was attempting to leave the home because of an argument. Robinson further stated that she opened the front door and an unknown person fired shots into the open door. She insisted that these were the shots that struck and killed McBride. After completion of her statement, Robinson was allowed to leave without any conditions and driven to her mother\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">Robinson\u2019s third statement was taken approximately five weeks after her first two statements. This statement was taken after she had been arrested. Robinson was advised of, and waived, her <em>Miranda </em>rights. In this statement, Robinson told Detective Phelps that what she had said previously, in the recorded statement, was true. Detective Phelps could not recall what specifics he restated to Robinson when he asked her about the prior statement. He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>however, testify that he had summarized some of the details and Robinson agreed to them. Robinson\u2019s third statement was similar to the first two statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">Prior to trial, defense counsel made motions to suppress Robinson\u2019s first two statements. Those motions were based on the argument that her constitutional rights had been violated because she was in custody and not informed of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">The court first heard testimony regarding the second statement. The hearings were held in this order because Officer Godfrey[, the officer who had taken the initial statement at the scene,] was not available until after the completion of the initial suppression hearing. After hearing testimony, the suppression court rejected Robinson\u2019s motion. The court found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">And she testified that, in fact, she knew she didn\u2019t have to talk to the police and she knew that she had a right to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">I think from the totality of the facts and circumstances, I am satisfied, in fact, well, Pm satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that, in fact, the Defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary, wasn\u2019t induced, there was no threat, force. And I\u2019m also satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that the March 31st statement was not a custodial interrogation that would have required <em>Miranda </em>Because after all, she did leave.... And it was a repetition of what she had said earlier and she never asked to leave, she never asked them to stop, and she was free to leave and was free to do anything she wanted for a good month after that until she was formally charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">... she said she wanted to talk to police on both occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">So I deny your motion to suppress all statements made in this case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>During the afternoon of the first day of trial, when Officer Godfrey became available, the court reopened the suppression hearing regarding Robinson\u2019s first statement. The court again, for similar reasons, denied Robinson\u2019s motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><em>Robinson v. State, </em>No. 667, September, 2008, filed November 19, 2009, slip opinion pp. 1-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Petitioner made her post-arrest statement after she was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by a District Court Commissioner on the basis of an Application for Statement of Charges filed by Detective Phelps which, in pertinent part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">I, the undersigned, apply for statement of charges and a summons or warrant which may lead to the arrest of the above named Defendant because on or about 31 March 2007 at 6622 Knottwood Ct., the above named Defendant on 31 March 2007 @ 1445 hours Dispatcher # 87 contacted the Homicide Office and advised that 4B24 was on the scene of the shooting at 6622 Knottwood Ct. and was requesting Homicide to respond. Investigators responded to the scene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">Investigation revealed that on 31 March 2007 at 1432 hours, Northeaster District Officers were dispatched to 6622 Knottwood Ct. on. a call for a shooting. Upon arrival, Officers found the victim, Andre McBribe, M/B 21 yrs. lying inside the doorway of that location being attended to by Fire Department personnel. The victim had sustained at least one gunshot wound to the head, Medic # 18 transported the victim to Sinai Hospital where he was pronounced dead by Dr. Genute at 1539 horn\u2019s that date. The crime scene was secured and proper notifications were made. A search and seizure warrant was obtained and the crime scene at 6622 Knottwood Ct. was processed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">The victims girlfriend, Juanita Robinson, F/B 27 yrs., from 6622 Knottwood Ct. was transported from the scene to the Crime Lab processing bay where a GSR (Gun Shot Residue) Test was performed. Ms. Robinson was then transported to the Homicide Office for interview. In a tape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>statement Ms. Robinson advised that on 31 March 2007, she and the victim were involved in an ongoing dispute. Ms. Robinson advised that at some point she had attempted to open her front door and exit the dwelling, however, the victim pushed Ms. Robinson to the kitchen floor and closed the door. At that point Ms. Robinson heard a gunshot, got up and ran into the living room when she heard additional gunshots. Ms. Robinson returned to the kitchen and found the victim lying in the doorway with his head resting on interior steps. Ms. Robinson advised that she then left the dwelling and asked the neighbors for help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">On 1 April 2007 an autopsy was performed on the victim at the OCME by Drs. Mary Ripple and Jonrika Malone. The post mortem exam revealed that the victim was shot 3 times. Once to the back of the head, once to the back and once to the front of the left thigh. The doctors ruled that the cause and manner of death was Homicide by Shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">During the course of the investigation, witnesses were interviewed and advised that no one else was seen in the court except for Ms. Robinson who was calling for someone to call for help. Additionally, on 13 April 2007 the results of the GSR Test were provided by the Trace Unit. The GSR Test for Ms. Robinson was positive, meaning that her hands were immediately adjacent to a discharging firearm or were themselves used to fire the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The following standard of review is applicable to the rulings of the suppression hearing court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">\u201c \u2018[W]e view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion,\u2019 \u201d here, the <em>State. Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 403, 924 A.2d 1072, 1080 (2007) <em>(quoting State v. Rucker, </em>374 Md. 199, 207, 821 A.2d 439, 444 (2003)), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1144, 128 S.Ct. 1064, 169 L.Ed.2d 813 (2008). \u201cWe defer to the motions court\u2019s factual findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>and uphold them unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Luckett, </em>413 Md. 360, 375 n. 3, 993 A.2d 25, 33 n. 3 (2010). \u201cWe, however, make our own independent constitutional appraisal, by reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>993 A.2d at 33 n. 3 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><em>Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, 148-49, 12 A.3d 1238, 1245-46 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">While affirming the rulings of the suppression hearing court, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">A reasonable person in Robinson\u2019s position would have believed that she was not in custody for at least two reasons: [ (1) ] Robinson\u2019s status in the investigation and what occurred after she completed her statements. At no time during the day did any officer inform Robinson that she was a suspect. Officers informed her that there was an investigation and they wanted to know what happened. In all the information reports regarding Robinson on the day of the shooting, she was listed as a witness. [ (2) ]Additionally, at the completion of the interview, Robinson was driven to her mother\u2019s residence. She was free to do as she pleased until she was arrested approximately five weeks later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">We agree with the holding that Petitioner was not entitled to suppression of the statement that she made to Officer Godfrey at the scene of the shooting. We conclude, however, that the State should have been prohibited from introducing into evidence during its case-in-chief the statements Petitioner subsequently gave to Detectives Phelps and Sewell.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-11\">Petitioner first argues (in the words of her brief): Petitioner was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes when she made her initial bare-bones statement to Officer Godfrey, because Godfrey and his superiors all communicated to her that she was not free to leave, bagged her hands, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>transferred her from the refuge of her family\u2019s vehicle to the far more coercive environment of a patrol car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The suppression hearing court and the Court of Special Appeals rejected this argument. So do we. When Petitioner was originally questioned at the scene, she was a potential witness. The officers attempting to obtain information about what had occurred were entitled to (1) require that potential witnesses remain at the scene, and (2) question those witnesses without advising them of their <em>Miranda </em>rights. The record shows that Petitioner\u2019s freedom of movement was not restricted beyond what was required in order to take her statement, which she gave to Officer Godfrey while she and her family members were seated in her mother\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Petitioner next argues (in the words of her brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">... the custodial pressure increased exponentially by the time she provided the more detailed and inculpatory account of her mutually destructive relationship with McBride, as by that point she had been separated more definitively from her family, taken to a police facility, photographed, had her hands swabbed for evidence of murder, been placed for hours in a holding cell, and then taken to an interview room, where she faced two experienced detectives. She could not conceivably have felt free to terminate the interrogation and leave. No reasonable person could have done so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The State argues, however, that under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals were correct in their conclusions that Detectives Phelps and Sewell were not required to advise Petitioner of her <em>Miranda </em>rights when they questioned her in an interview room at the Homicide Unit. In the words of the State\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9j\">Robinson\u2019s freedom of movement was never restricted to the \u201cdegree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Owens, </em>399 Md. at 428 [924 A.2d 1072] (quoting <em>California v. Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125 [103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275] (1983)). She was not the only person transported to the Homicide Unit for questioning as a potential witness; there is no evidence that she was placed in handcuffs or leg irons; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>she was allowed to use the bathroom and get a drink of water; she was questioned as a witness, not a suspect; and after the interview, she was taken to her mother\u2019s house, and was not arrested until over a month later. In light of those circumstances, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">In <em>Abeokuto v. State, </em>391 Md. 289, [893 A.2d 1018] (2006), in fact, this Court held that appellant was not in custody for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>even though he was questioned and then held in a \u201csmall locked room\u201d of one police station for two and a half hours before police transported him to another police station where he waited for three hours before police questioned him again. This Court concluded that, \u201cwhile some circumstances [of appellant\u2019s questioning] hint at restraint or coercive elements,\u201d The totality of the circumstances did not rise to the level of custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. Abeokuto, </em>391 Md. at 332[, 893 A.2d at 1043]. This Court added: \u201c[t]hat the questioning occurred in a police station is not determinative of whether a custodial interrogation occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">The fact that Robinson had bags placed on her hands in advance of a test for the presence of gunshot residue is likewise not dispositive of the issue of <em>Miranda </em>custody. The Fourth Circuit considered this very issue in <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>509 F.3d 623, 629-31 (4th Cir.2007), and concluded that, while a reasonable person \u201cmight find it odd\u201d that bags were placed on his or her hands, such curiosity does not \u201clead to an inference that a reasonable person would consequently feel unable to refuse police questioning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630-31. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that bagging someone\u2019s hands would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she was a suspect in the crime being investigated, that is wholly different than conveying the message that the person is under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">Moreover, other circumstances would have led a reasonable person in Robinson\u2019s position to believe that she was free to terminate police contact. Robinson was not at the Homicide Unit alone; several people present at the scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>were taken to the police station for questioning. She was given water and permitted to use the restroom while she waited for Detective Phelps. Detective Phelps never \u201caccuse[d] [her] of doing anything wrong[,]\u201d or otherwise indicated that she was being treated as a suspect. Finally, she was driven home after the interview, and was not arrested until over a month later. All of these factors would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she is not under arrest, and is free to terminate the encounter with police. <em>See Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (Supreme Court considered that respondent left police station \u201cwithout hindrance\u201d in concluding that he was not in <em>Miranda </em>custody); <em>Owens, </em>399 Md. at 429[, 924 A.2d at 1095-96] (\u201cwhether the defendant left freely, was detained or arrested,\u201d can assist in determining whether defendant would have felt free to discontinue the questioning).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">Under the totality of circumstances, a reasonable person in Robinson\u2019s position would not have felt pressure sufficient to impair the free exercise of his or her right against self-compulsion. At no point during the evening was there a restriction upon Robinson\u2019s freedom of movement to the degree associated with formal arrest. As such, <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required. The lower court correctly denied Robinson\u2019s motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We hold that Petitioner\u2019s second statement was the product of a custodial interrogation that did not comply with the requirements of <em>Miranda. </em>This holding is based upon our independent, constitutional appraisal of the record, which clearly shows that Petitioner was subjected to custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Immediately after Petitioner made her initial statement to Officer Godfrey, she was placed in the back of a marked police car, where Tyvek bags were placed over her hands.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>same time, police informed Petitioner\u2019s family members that the investigation was \u201congoing\u201d and that they should remain at the scene. Rather than ask Petitioner any additional questions at the scene, the investigating officers transported her to the Homicide Unit, where she was photographed and her hands were tested for gunshot residue. Petitioner was then placed in a holding cell, where she remained for five hours. At approximately 10:15 p.m., nearly six full hours after she had been transported to the Homicide Unit, she was transferred to an interview room where she was questioned for approximately two hours by Detectives Phelps and Sewell.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Petitioner was never advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights until May 7, 2007, on which date she was formally arrested. She had been at the Homicide Unit for over eight hours when she gave the audio-taped statement that was introduced into evidence during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. After she gave the audio-taped statement, Petitioner was told for the first time that she was free to leave the police station, and she was driven by a police officer to her mother\u2019s home. Under these circumstances, it is of no consequence that Petitioner was released and driven to her mother\u2019s house <em>after </em>she had given a statement that had been obtained in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Based upon the undisputed sequence of events that preceded Petitioner\u2019s transfer from the holding cell to the interview room, there is no merit in the State\u2019s argument that a reasonable person who had been subjected to the same restraints would understand that he or she was a \u201cpotential witness who was free to leave\u201d when Detectives Phelps and Sewell entered the holding cell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The State argues in the alternative that, because Petitioner waived her rights and gave a voluntary statement when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>she was formally arrested, Petitioner\u2019s <em>Mirandized </em>affirmation of the earlier <em>un-Mirandized </em>statements renders \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d any impropriety in the admission of the audio-taped statement. In the words of the State\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">The Supreme Court has held that absent coercive or improper actions on the part of the interrogating officers, \u201ca careful and thorough administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 310-311 [105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222] (1985) In this case, there is no allegation of any police misconduct that would render Robinson\u2019s warned statement inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\"><em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600 [124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643] (2004), in which the Supreme Court held inadmissible statements made after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were delivered in the middle of an on-going interrogation, is inapposite. In that case, the police employed a \u201cquestion first\u201d strategy, meaning that the interrogators intentionally withheld <em>Miranda </em>warnings with the express purpose of eliciting a confession, then advising Seibert of her rights under <em>Miranda </em>and using her previous, unwarned statement to convince Seibert to repeat her confession. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 610-11 [124 S.Ct. 2601], Under those circumstances, the Court concluded, the appropriate inquiry is whether \u201cthe warnings could function \u2018effectively\u2019 as <em>Miranda </em>requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In finding that the warnings were ineffective in Seibert\u2019s case, the Court held that a reasonable person would have regarded the further questioning (post-Miranda) as \u201ca mere continuation of the earlier questions[,]\u201d in which \u201cit would have been unnatural to refuse to repeat at the second stage what had been said before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616-17 [124 S.Ct. 2601],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">In this case, there is no claim that police employed the \u201cquestion first\u201d strategy. To the contrary, over five weeks passed between Robinson\u2019s first interview with Detective Phelps and her arrest and subsequent second interview. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Even though Detective Phelps made references to Robinson\u2019s earlier statement, no reasonable person would have believed it \u201cunnatural to refuse to repeat\u201d what Robinson had said over a month earlier. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 617 [124 S.Ct. 2601]. Rather, the facts here are closer to those in <em>Elstad, </em>where the Court found that \u201ca reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes could have seen the [second interrogation] as a new and distinct experience,\u201d and thus the <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201ccould have made sense as presenting a genuine choice whether to follow up\u201d on the earlier statement. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 615-16 [124 S.Ct. 2601].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">Furthermore, Robinson did not confess during the March interview. Thus, there was no danger that Robinson believed that the \u201ccat was out of the bag,\u201d and refusing to speak further was futile. In <em>Seibert, </em>the Supreme Court noted that one of the reasons the \u201cquestion-first\u201d strategy does not satisfy the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>is that \u201c[u]pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession, a suspect would hardly think that he had a genuine right to remain silent, let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.\u201d 542 U.S. at 613 [124 S.Ct. 2601]. That is a far cry from what happened in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">A reasonable person in Robinson\u2019s position on May 7, 2007[,] would have understood her second interview with Detective Phelps as a new and distinct experience, and would have understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings as offering a choice whether to follow up on her statement from over five weeks earlier. Therefore, to the extent properly before this Court, even if Robinson\u2019s taped statement was erroneously admitted, that error was harmless because Robinson expressly adopted the taped statement five weeks later, after being advised of, and waving, her rights under <em>Miranda.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We agree with the State that <em>Elstad </em>does indeed hold that, \u201c... absent coercive or improper actions on the part of the interrogating officers, \u00a3a careful and thorough administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings serves to cure the condition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at 310-11, 105 S.Ct. at 1293-94. We are persuaded, however, that the decision to employ a \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201d strategy is precisely the kind of \u201cimproper actions on the part of the interrogating officers\u201d that cannot be \u201ccured\u201d by subsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">From our independent, constitutional appraisal of the interrogators\u2019 conduct, we reject the State\u2019s argument that these experienced detectives did not employ a \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201d strategy during Petitioner\u2019s custodial interrogation in the holding cell. It is significant to us that, as noted by the Court of Special Appeals, \u201c[i]n [her post-arrest] statement, [Petitioner] told Detective Phelps that what she had said previously, in the recorded statement, was true. Detective Phelps could not recall what specifics he restated to [Petitioner] when he asked her about the prior statement. He did however, testify that he had summarized some of the details and [Petitioner] agreed to them.\u201d If the detectives had not employed the \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201d strategy when they interrogated Petitioner in the holding cell, their post-arrest interrogation of Petitioner would certainly have included questions about whether (in the words of the Application for Statement of Charges) \u201cher hands were immediately adjacent to a discharging firearm or were themselves used to fire the firearm,\u201d and would certainly not have concluded as soon as she (in the words of the Court of Special Appeals) \u201ctold Detective Phelps that what she had said previously, in the recorded statement, was true.\u201d Under theses circumstances, the \u201cquestion first, warn later\u201d strategy that was employed in the holding cell constituted the precise kind of \u201cimproper tactics in obtaining the [audio-taped] statement\u201d that render Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement inadmissible under <em>Oregon v. Elstad.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Moreover, Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement is clearly inadmissible under <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004). Although this Court has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>previously applied that decision, Judge Barbera did so while she served on the Court of Special Appeals. Writing for that Court in <em>Cooper v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 70, 877 A.2d 1095 (2005), Judge Barbera stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\"><em>Elstad, </em>it must be remembered, dealt only with \u201ca simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309 [105 S.Ct. 1285]. The Court emphasized \u201cthat, <em>absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, </em>the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314 [105 S.Ct. 1285] (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Nearly 20 years after <em>Elstad, </em>the Supreme Court was presented in <em>Seibert </em>with the situation hypothesized in <em>Elstad: </em>the failure of police to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings under \u201c\u2018circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will.\u2019 \u201d 124 S.Ct. at 2610 n. 4 (quoting <em>Elstad, </em>470 U.S. at 309 [105 S.Ct. 1285]). The <em>Seibert </em>Court held that the two-step interrogation tactic used by the police to obtain a confession from Patrice Seibert violated <em>Miranda. Id. </em>at 2605-07.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">Seibert had a twelve-year-old son, Jonathan, who suffered from cerebral palsy. When Jonathan died, Seibert feared that neglect charges would be filed against her. She, together with two of her teenage sons and two friends, devised a plan to conceal Jonathan\u2019s death by burning the family\u2019s mobile home, with Jonathan\u2019s body inside. To make it appear that Jonathan was not alone when he died, the plan entailed leaving Donald Rector, a mentally ill teenager who was living with the family, in the mobile home when it was set ablaze. Seibert\u2019s two sons set fire to the mobile home and Rector died inside the burning structure. <em>Id. </em>at 2605-06.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Five days later, Seibert was arrested for the death of Rector. The arresting officer was instructed by Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Richard Hanrahan not to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Seibert. She was transported to the police station and was questioned by the interrogating officer for 30 to 40 minutes, who repeatedly stated to Seibert that \u201cDonald [Rector] was also to die in his sleep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2606. Seibert finally admitted that she knew that Rector was meant to die in the fire. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Seibert was given a 20-minute break during which the interrogating officer turned on a tape recorder, informed her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, and obtained from her a signed waiver of those rights. The officer resumed questioning Seibert by first confronting her with her <em>pre-Miranda </em>statements. The officer then obtained a full confession from Seibert. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">Seibert was charged with first degree murder for her part in Rector\u2019s death, and subsequently sought to have her pre- and <em>post-Miranda </em>statements suppressed. \u201cAt the suppression hearing, Officer Hanrahan testified that he made a \u2018conscious decision\u2019 to withhold <em>Miranda </em>warnings, thus resorting to an interrogation technique\u201d of question first until a confession is obtained, then advise the suspect of his or her rights, and then repeat the original question until the answer that has already been provided is repeated. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">The trial court suppressed Seibert\u2019s pre-warning statement, but allowed her post-warning statements to be admitted. On appeal, the intermediate appellate court, following <em>Elstad, </em>affirmed. The Supreme Court of Missouri reversed. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">The Supreme Court affirmed the Missouri court. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision produced four opinions: the plurality opinion (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ); two concurring opinions (Breyer, J.), (Kennedy, J.); and a dissenting opinion (O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, CJ, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ). <em>Id. </em>at 2601-02.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-9\">The plurality fashioned a multi-factored test for use in deciding whether statements made during continuing inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>rogations are admissible in light of belated <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The plurality\u2019s test looks to several factors \u201cthat bear on whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings delivered midstream could ... accomplish their object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These factors include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvG\">the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second [interrogations], the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">Applying that test to the circumstances of <em>Seibert\u2019s </em>two-step interrogation, the plurality concluded: \u201cThese circumstances must be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2613.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">Justice Kennedy wrote separately, supplying the vote necessary to make a majority. In his concurrence, Justice Kennedy eschewed the plurality\u2019s multi-factor test, which would apply to both intentional and unintentional two-stage interrogations, as a test that \u201ccuts too broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2616. Justice Kennedy set forth \u201ca narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the <em>Miranda </em>warning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 87-91, 877 A.2d at 1105-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">After explaining why Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion represents the \u201cholding\u201d of the <em>Seibert </em>Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Barbera provided the following summary of that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Justice Kennedy made clear in his concurrence that \u201c[t]he admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of <em>Elstad </em>unless the deliberate two-step strategy was employed.\u201d <em>Seibert, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2616. But, \u201c[i]f the deliberate two-step strategy has been used, postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such curative measures, Justice Kennedy explained, \u201cshould be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda </em>warning and of the <em>Miranda </em>waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He cited, as examples of curative measures, \u201ca substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the <em>Miranda </em>warning .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>A break of this sort \u201cmay suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice Kennedy posited, as a possible alternative curative measure, \u201can additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement....\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 92, 877 A.2d at 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In the case at bar, Petitioner made her audio-taped statement on March 31st and her post-arrest statement on May 7th. This \u201cbreak in time,\u201d however, was certainly not \u201cdesigned to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would understand the import and effect of the <em>Miranda </em>warning and the <em>Miranda </em>waiver,\u201d and therefore did not constitute a \u201csubstantial break in circumstances.\u201d As is shown by the fact that the investigators asked no post-arrest questions pertaining to the GSR Test results, Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest interrogation simply had not \u201ctaken a new turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">As noted above, Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement was made after she had been arrested under the authority of an arrest warrant. Maryland Rule 4-212(e), in pertinent part, provides that a defendant arrested on an arrest warrant \u201cshall be taken before a judicial officer of the District Court without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>unnecessary delay and in no event later than 24 hours after arrest.\u201d When Petitioner was arrested, however, she was transported to the Homicide Unit, where Detective Phelps merely \u201csummarized\u201d her earlier statements, and terminated the interrogation as soon as Petitioner \u201cagreed to them.\u201d We therefore hold that, under Justice Kennedy\u2019s \u201cnarrower test applicable only in the infrequent case,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement does not operate to attenuate the <em>Miranda </em>violation that renders her audio-taped statement inadmissible during the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Every one of the other relevant <em>Seibert </em>factors reaffirm our conclusion that the post-arrest warnings were totally ineffective in the case at bar. Those factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">The completeness and detail of the questions and answers during the Petitioner\u2019s custodial interrogation: The completeness and detail of the questions and answers during Petitioner\u2019s interview room interrogation were substantial. As noted above, this interrogation occurred after Petitioner had been confined to a holding cell, included a two hour \u201cpre-interview\u201d and concluded with an audio-taped statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">The timing and setting of the interrogations: Petitioner\u2019s audio-taped statement and post-arrest statement were both made in the Homicide Unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">The continuity of police personnel: It was Detective Phelps who (1) transferred Petitioner from the holding cell to the interview room, where he interrogated her without advising her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, and (2) obtained Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement after advising her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">The degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the subsequent interrogation as continuous with the prior interrogation: It is clear that Detective Phelps treated Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest statement as a continuation of her audio-taped statement. As noted above, Detective Phelps was unable to recall what details of the audio-taped statement he \u201csummarized\u201d for Petitioner, and he terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ed the post-arrest interrogation when he was satisfied with her \u201cwhat I said on tape was true\u201d response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">The overlapping content of the two statements: The \u201cincorporation by reference\u201d of the \u201csummarized\u201d audio-taped statement makes it clear that the content of the two statements was identical. After she was arrested and\u2014for the first time\u2014advised of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, Petitioner was simply asked to confirm that her <em>unMirandized </em>audio-taped statement was true. As Justice Souter stated in <em>Seibert, </em>\u201c[t]hese circumstances must be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspects\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice a about continuing to talk.\u201d 541 [542] U.S. at 617, 124 S.Ct at 2613.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">For the reasons stated above, of the statements at issue in the case at bar, we hold that only Petitioner\u2019s statement to Officer Godfrey was admissible during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. We therefore hold that Petitioner is entitled to a new trial at which the State\u2019s case-in-chief shall not include evidence of any statement made by Petitioner (1) during the interrogation that occurred after she was transferred from the holding cell to the interview room, and (2) during her post-arrest interrogation. As a result of these holdings, the parties\u2019 second questions are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\">.
