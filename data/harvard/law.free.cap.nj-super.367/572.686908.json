Boe, filed a complaint seeking a judgment declaring: 1) that an institutional lien on a parcel of real property had been extinguished upon the death of Mary Boe (decedent), plaintiffs mother; and 2) that title in the premises was vested in plaintiff entirely free of defendant\u2019s institutional lien by reason of plaintiffs joint ownership of the parcel with the right of survivor-ship. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed the complaint, declared the lien to be valid, and held that the estate of the decedent was liable for the costs of the care and maintenance furnished her by a State institution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">Before May 16, 1996, Mary Boe was the sole owner of the residential property at issue. On that date, she executed a deed transferring title in the property to herself and plaintiff \u201cas joint tenants with rights of survivorship.\u201d Also on that date, decedent and plaintiff executed a mortgage on the property securing a $10,808 loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>On September 20, 1996, the trial court entered a \u201ctemporary order for involuntary commitment,\u201d on the basis of which decedent became a patient at the Senator Garrett W. Hagedom Gero-Psychiatrie Hospital (the hospital), a State institution, on October 1, 1996. She was seventy-six years of age at the time. Over the course of the next ten-and-a-half months, between October 18, 1996 and August 15,1997, five orders were entered continuing the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">On May 19, 1997, the hospital filed a lien claim, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1, for the costs attributable to the care and maintenance furnished to decedent. The amount of the delinquent maintenance stated in the lien as of April 30, 1997 was $71,160.24. The specified rate of maintenance was $2,063.04 per week. By the time of decedent\u2019s discharge from the hospital on August 19,1997, the amount of the lien was calculated at $82,048.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A medical summary stated decedent\u2019s discharge diagnoses to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Dementia with delusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">Mild hypercholesterolemia which we did not want to intervene and do anything considering her age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">A psychiatric discharge summary recited her discharge diagnoses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">Axis I: Dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type with delusions and behavioral disturbances</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">Axis II: No diagnosis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4R\">Axis III: Hypercholesterolemia</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao_\">Axis IV: No. 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acs\">Axis V: GAF:15-20</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The reports characterized decedent as \u201cnon-ambulatory\u201d and requiring \u201ctotal nursing care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Decedent died on March 6, 2000. She was, at the time, a resident of the Perth Amboy Nursing Home (nursing home).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">On July 13, 1999, counsel, on plaintiffs behalf, had sent a letter to the Bureau of Financial Standards and Procedures noting that \u201c[a] recent title search indicates that there is an institutional lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>filed against [decedent] as a result of her confinement at the [hospital].\u201d The letter described decedent\u2019s limited resources: \u201cher one-half interest in her home____[and h]er only source of income [from] Social Security ($900 a month) and a pension from her deceased husband ($417.95 a month).\u201d Counsel enclosed a copy of the May 16, 1996 deed, noting decedent\u2019s then current residence in the nursing home and plaintiffs residence in the property. The letter also referred to an application then pending in the Superior Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">to appoint Harold Boe as guardian over the person and financial affairs of his mother, Mary Boe. As neither Mary Boe or her son, Harold, have any assets to speak of, they intend to sell the house and for the most part use the proceeds for her support and maintenance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Counsel\u2019s letter went on to inquire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">Would the Stale of New Jersey consider releasing the lien on this real estate without monetary consideration? If so, would you kindly prepare the appropriate release and forward same to our office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">Alternatively, we ask that the amount of the lien be reduced to the lowest amount acceptable to the State of New Jersey. Upon sale of the residence we will apply the sale proceeds to pay off the agreed upon lien amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">The State responded on August 11, 1999, in a letter from the Compromise Panel Chairperson and Chief, Bureau of Financial Standards and Procedures, Department of Human Services (Department). The letter noted that the total cost of decedent\u2019s care and maintenance was $85,583.98. It stated that the Department would regard counsel\u2019s proposal as a compromise offer; it described the procedures for effecting a compromise; and it referred to a \u201ccompromise offer fact sheet\u201d that was enclosed for completion. Counsel was instructed also to prepare and submit \u201c[a] separate written compromise offer, which includes the exact amount being offered in compromise, specific reasons for requesting a compromise ... and how an acceptance of the offer will benefit Ms. Boe.\u201d The letter also sought information concerning the patient\u2019s Medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">In responding with the requested data on February 22, 2000, counsel stated that plaintiff and two of his brothers were residing in the home; and that, although the property\u2019s assessed value was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>$155,200, its market value was about $120,000, subject to the mortgage and to tax liens for the years 1996 through 1999. He asserted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">that the enforcement of the [hospital] lien would create an extreme hardship for the destitute Boe brothers as well as for their sick and destitute mother. Given these circumstances we respectfully ask that the amount of the lien be waived, and that the lien be discharged. If your decision is otherwise, we ask that you set a minimal amount required to satisfy this lien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">A few weeks later, counsel advised the Department of decedent\u2019s death on March 6, 2000. The Department responded that decedent\u2019s passing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">changes any position this Department may have held in connection with the compromise offer you submitted on her behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">Please be advised that the statutory obligation of the Department of Human Services to assess charges, lien assets and make recoveries is generally inflexible. The purpose of the compromise procedure is to mitigate against the possible harmful or counter-productive effects of Departmental actions against clients and former clients (i.e. the filing of a lien claim). It is Departmental policy that persons, or entities, other than the client or her financial dependents, not be allowed to benefit from the acceptance of a compromise offer. As our former client is deceased and as there are no financial dependents, considering this case for compromise is in direct conflict with the policies and standards set by this Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">Furthermore, New Jersey Statutes establish the continuing liability of a patient\u2019s estate, specifically N.J.S.A. 30:4-74, which states \u201cA patient\u2019s estate ... shall be liable for institutional support[.]\u201d * * * Pursuant to the State\u2019s institutional lien against Mary Boe, the State of New Jersey must be reimbursed from her estate up to the amount of her institutional debt balance of $85,583.98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Counsel rejoined with a letter in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">We respectfully disagree with your position____The premises ... [were] owned by Mary Boe and her son, Harold Boe, as joint tenants prior to the time of her admission to [the hospital] and prior to the time that [the hospital\u2019s] lien attached to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">The law is clear that if a creditor obtains a lien against less than all co-tenants he may enforce the lien <em>only </em>against the interest of the debtor co-tenant. If the parties held as joint tenants and the judgment debtor predeceased the non debtor co-owner the lien will be extinguished. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">This litigation ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">In deciding the matter on the cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Pisansky, in an oral opinion, summarized the parties\u2019 positions, noting that plaintiffs argument relied on <em>Bauer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>v. Migliaccio, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 561 A.2d 674 (Ch.Div.1989), as well as <em>Baird v. Moore, </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>156, 165, 141 A.2d 324, 328-29 (App.Div.1958); and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">Defendant has filed a cross-motion for summary judgment dismissing the claim against it as well as finding that the Estate of Mary Boe is liable to the State and that the State has a valid institutional lien against Mary Boe\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The judge denied plaintiffs motion and granted defendant\u2019s motion. The result was an order dismissing plaintiffs claims, providing that the decedent\u2019s estate is liable for the care and maintenance given to her at the hospital, and decreeing that the \u201cinstitution lien held by the defendant ... is a valid lien under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1 <em>et seq.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">On appeal, plaintiff renews the arguments advanced to the trial court and contends further that the trial court, in reaching its decision, \u201cruled on matters not raised by defendant in its pleadings or at any time during the pendency of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The second point plaintiff advances provides no basis for modifying the order from which the appeal has been taken. To the extent the motion judge, in his oral opinion, referred to portions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-66, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-74, and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1 to -80.7 to establish, in the terms used in plaintiffs brief, \u201cthat the State may look to other members of the patient\u2019s family to satisfy the State\u2019s institution lien[,]\u201d nothing in the entered order disposing of the controversy directly addresses that issue. The order merely denied the relief plaintiff sought, <em>i.e., </em>confirmation of title to the property solely in him; and it recognized the validity of the State\u2019s lien against the property interests of decedent and her estate. Whether or not the State had the authority to look to resources belonging to members of decedent\u2019s family \u2014 beyond the real property that was the subject of the lien \u2014 to satisfy its lien claim, was not an issue before the trial court and, despite the motion judge\u2019s expressed views regarding statutory requirements, was not decided by the court. <em>See Do-Wop Carp. v. City of Rahway, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>191, 199, 773 A.2d 706, 710 (2001) (\u201c[I]t is well-settled that appeals are taken from orders and judgments and not from opinions, oral decisions, informal written decisions, or reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>given for the ultimate conclusion.\u201d). Accordingly, we do not address that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In opining on the parties\u2019 rights and obligations, the judge cited statutory sources, including <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-66 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-74, which address the obligations of patients, their estates, and those chargeable for the patient\u2019s support. He went on to note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abq-dedup-0\">State charitable institutions may seek a lien against property of inmates and persons chargeable with support. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">This statute provides that every charitable institution maintained by the State shall have a lien against property of persons committed by virtue of Title 30 of the Revised Statutes for the total cost of care and maintenance of the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">The lien shall be filed in the county of the property and shall immediately attach to and become binding upon all real property in the ownership of the patient or other persons chargeable under said lien in the county wherein said lien is filed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Judge Pisansky\u2019s analysis continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">In <em>State v. LeVien, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>323[, 209 A.2d 97 (1965)], the [Supreme] Court noted that the New Jersey statutes make clear the cost of maintenance of patients admitted into a charitable institution is to be borne by the financially able patient and certain members of his family. <em>[Id. </em>at] 330[, 209 A.2d at 101].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">The Court further opined that no one contends that the State should not support a needy patient whether criminally or civilly committed. But neither should the State nor its taxpayers be burdened with the cost of maintaining one who is financially able to pay. <em>[Id. </em>at] 331[, 209 A.2d at 101].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">Plaintiff argues that the State has merely docketed its judgment with the Superior Court and failed to execute on its judgment lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">Plaintiff asserts that this lien standing alone would not destroy plaintiff\u2019s right of survivorship and plaintiff takes title free and clear of the State lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">Plaintiff cites <em>Bauer v. Migliaccio, </em>[supra,] 235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127[, 561 A.2d 674] and <em>Baird v. Moore[, supra,] </em>50 <em>N.J.Super. </em>[at 165, 141 A.2d at 329,] for the proposition that the mere docketing of a judgment does not sever[ ] a joint tenancy and that title passes to the surviving joint tenant free and clear of the judgment lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">The court finds that plaintiffs argument is without merit. <em>Bauer </em>concerns a judgment creditor\u2019s right as against a debtor who holds property [as a] tenant by the entirety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-16\"><em>Baird </em>concerns a right of contribution among tenants in common for the proportional share of taxes, interest on mortgages and necessary repairs in filing a [final accounting] or [partition] action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-17\">In this matter, decedent incurred [sic] the joint tenant with right of survivorship. The lien against the property is a statutory lien and not a judgment lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>There has been no final judgment against Mary Boe and in favor of the defendant. Thus, there is no judgment to execute. Rather, defendant obtained an institutional lien against the real property as a method of collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">The lien was docketed in the Superior Court because that is the procedure the Legislature intended the State to follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">As the court in <em>New York Susquehanna and W.R.R. v. Vermuelen, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>491, 504[, 210 A.2d 214, 221] (1995 [1965]), noted, the record of a lien with the court clerk serves governmental convenience and does not give judicial power to the executive branch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">Plaintiff further relies on <em>Cunningham, The Law of Property </em>(1987), for the proposition that the docketing of a judgment against a joint tenant does not effect a severance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">However, the applicable statute clearly states that a lien shall immediately attach against the property of persons committed or upon any . . real and personal property of the person chargeable by law with support and maintenance of such persons. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1 to 80.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">Mary Boe had no husband and her closest family member, her son, obtained the bulk of the estate, the house[,] through the joint tenancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">Not only would the lien immediately attach against Mary Boe\u2019s real estate or real property but as to her son\u2019s interest in the real property as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">Such lien was perfected by the filing of the Certificate of Death with the Clerk\u2019s Office in May of 1997 and gave notice to all third parties that there existed a lien upon [the] property____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">The court finds that it is undisputed that there is an amount due and owing to the State for Mary Boe for care received at a State charitable institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">It is undisputed that the State filed and perfected its institutional lien against the real property of Mary Boe [in] May, 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">The court finds that it [is] undisputed that plaintiff, Mary Boe\u2019s son and closest family member, is the sole owner of the aforementioned property by way of the joint tenancy with right of survivorship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-16\">The bulk of Mary Boe\u2019s real property was the house.... As the State has an interest in not having itself nor its taxpayers burdened with the cost of maintaining one who is financially able to pay, the court finds the plaintiff to be a person chargeable for Mary Boe\u2019s support and the State is well within its right to look to plaintiffs interest in the home in satisfaction of the outstanding debt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">The court holds that the death of Mary Boe did not destroy the institutional lien against the property as the lien which perfected against plaintiffs real property as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">Accordingly, as there are no issues of genuine facts in dispute, the court denies plaintiffs motion for summary judgment!, 1 as [the] joint tenancy with right of survivorship of plaintiff did not terminate the institutional lien against the real property.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-19\">The State\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The court finds that the State continues to have a valid institutional lien against the aforementioned property. Plaintiffs action against defendant is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We are in substantial agreement with the basic purport of Judge Pisansky\u2019s rationale. When the statutorily authorized lien was filed against the property in the manner contemplated by law \u2014 before the decedent\u2019s death, it attached to her undivided interest in the property at the time. <em>See Gauger v. Gauger, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>538, 543, 376 A.2d 523 (1977)(observing that a joint tenant owns \u201c \u2018an undivided <em>moiety </em>of the whole\u2019 of the joint tenancy\u201d). The authorities relied upon by plaintiff for the principle that a surviving joint tenant takes free of liens against the deceased joint tenant\u2019s interest unless the lienor has executed the lien before the death of the lienee, <em>see, e.g., Newman v. Chase, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>254, 359 A.2d 474 (1976); <em>King v. Greene, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>395, 153 A.2d 49 (1959); <em>Bauer, supra, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 561 A.2d 674, dealing as they do with competing private interests, are inapplicable where a statutory lien is involved. <em>See, e.g., In re Sullivan, </em>254 <em>B.R. </em>661 (Bankr.D.N.J.2000). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.3 provides that once the hen is filed it \u201cimmediately attach[es] to and become[s] binding upon all real property in the ownership of the patient or other persons chargeable....\u201d No judicial action is required to perfect or enforce the lien. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>254 <em>B.R. </em>at 664. Thus, the relative qualities of the competing interests could not be clearer. Once filed during the lifetime of the patient/lienee, who was a joint owner of the real property, this statutory lien operated to attach the whole ownership interest of that lienee, effectively extinguishing any rights of survivorship any other joint owner might have had, to the extent of the lien claim and the patient/lienee\u2019s true interest in the property. <em>Cf. Sadofski v. Williams, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>385, 395-400, 290 A.2d 143, 149-52 (1972)(opining on the significance of donative intent where a sole ownership interest has been converted to joint ownership with rights of survivorship). In some circumstances, one joint owner might, as a result, incur a liability to the other joint owner for an appropriate share of the value taken. But such a situation is not presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Although the dispositional order in this matter does not directly address the State\u2019s rights against any obligor other than the decedent or her estate, the clearly expressed legislative purposes for creating the lien further strengthen the argument that the State\u2019s lien survived the death of Mary Boe. In enacting these statutes, the New Jersey Legislature determined that patients are liable for the care they receive at State charitable institutions. Patients and their responsible relatives are required to pay for the care and maintenance provided by the hospital, to the extent they have the financial resources. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-66; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-80.1. \u201c[T]he primary responsibility for the costs of services provided to an individual rests with him and his responsible relatives.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-24(6). The principle that the primary responsibility for costs is with the patient leads to the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend effectuation of the statutory lien it created to be frustrated by the joint tenancy in existence here at the time the lien was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
