Burke, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>480, 710 A.2d 450 (1998) <em>(Abbott V) </em>must be funded exclusively by the State. The Commissioner of Education concluded that neither the Supreme Court\u2019s mandating of preschool programs in <em>Abbott V, </em>nor the Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004, <em>L. </em>2003, c. 122, requires exclusive State funding. Instead, the Commissioner determined that the Supreme Court has only directed that he \u201censure\u201d that there be adequate funding for these programs, thus permitting the utilization of local district funds. We agree with the Commissioner and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Funding for preschool education in the Abbott districts starts with the approval by the Department of Education (DOE) of a budget based on the district\u2019s demonstrated need. The DOE then calculates the State aid available. The two components of State aid for preschool are Early Childhood Program Aid (ECPA) and Abbott Preschool Expansion Aid (PSEA). ECPA is based upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>formula contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7F-16, while PSEA is the amount obtained by subtracting the 2002-03 approved preschool plan from the 2003-04 approved plan. The difference between the approved budget for the 2003-04 preschool plan for these districts, and the ECPA and PSEA State aid components, constitute the funds at issue in these matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Each of the appellants filed appeals challenging the DOE\u2019s calculation of their PSEA awards for the year 2003-04. The appeal of the Phillipsburg Board of Education (Phillipsburg) was the first of these four matters to reach disposition. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rendered a summary decision, determining that the DOE correctly calculated the PSEA due Phillipsburg. The ALJ, however, also found that because the combination of PSEA and ECPA was insufficient to fund the entire approved preschool budget, the State was required to provide the shortfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The other Abbott districts \u2014 Pemberton, Millville and Neptune \u2014 agreed to stipulate to the essential facts and relied on the arguments raised and considered in the Phillipsburg matter. The ALJs in those matters reached similar results, thus collectively imposing upon the State the\u2018obligation to fund the shortfall in each of these districts, namely, $835,034 in Phillipsburg, $424,569 in Pemberton, $1,763,866 in Millville, and $3,768,176 in Neptune.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The DOE filed an appeal with the Commissioner of Education who, in final decisions rendered in each matter on September 25, 2003, rejected the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that the State was obligated to exclusively fund these shortfalls. The Commissioner explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201c[F]ull funding\u201d of Abbott preschool programs cannot be viewed as promises or expectations of dollar-for-dollar State funding regardless of resources available in the local district budget. Rather, they must be understood as reflections of the Department\u2019s commitment, and recognition of its obligation, to provide or secure</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Because the Commissioner concluded that the fulfillment of his obligation to \u201censure\u201d adequate funding for preschool in the Abbott districts permitted the allocation of local tax levies and other local budgetary resources to those purposes, these four Abbott districts seek our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Since the parties do not further dispute the PSEA calculations, the sole question before this court is whether the Commissioner may look to the district\u2019s funds, in whole or in part, to bear the shortfall or whether, as the Abbott districts argue, the burden for the payment of these funds rests exclusively upon the State. Resolution of this issue turns on an understanding of the Supreme Court\u2019s prior holdings and the Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004, <em>L. </em>2003, c. 122 (the Appropriations Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In considering whether the Court\u2019s prior decisions require the State to bear alone the shortfall existing after the application of the PSEA and ECPA components, we start with the recognition that the constitutional mandate that the \u201cLegislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools\u201d is expressly limited to \u201cthe instruction of all the children in the State between the ages of five and eighteen years.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VIII, \u00a7 4,\u00b6 1. Since the issue presented involves the extent of State funding for the education of three- and four-year olds in the Abbott districts, an area of education arguably beyond the scope of the constitutional mandate, we are required to carefully examine the Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Abbott V </em>and the backdrop against which it was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Holding that the Legislature had failed to remedy the constitutional violations previously found with regard to the thorough and efficient education promised by the State for children between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ages of five and eighteen,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court in <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>145, 693 A.2d 417 (1997) <em>(.Abbott IV) </em>remanded the matter to the Chancery Division, and temporarily assigned Judge Michael Patrick King, P.J.A.D., to the Chancery Division, to examine potential remedies. Adhering to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate, the Commissioner provided his recommendations to Judge King.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The Commissioner proposed that \u201cwhole-school reform\u201d be adopted in the Abbott districts. Whole-school reform constitutes \u201ca comprehensive approach to education that fundamentally alters the way in which decisions about education are made.\u201d <em>Abbott V, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 710 A.2d 450. In following Judge King\u2019s recommendations in this regard, the Court acknowledged that, in his own recommendations, the Commissioner had clearly set his sights on meeting the \u201cState\u2019s strong commitment to implementing whole-school reform,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 497, 710 A.2d 450, an approach which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">integrates] reform throughout the school as a total institution rather than by simply adding reforms piecemeal. If earned out successfully, whole-school reform affects the culture of the entire school, including instruction, curriculum, and assessment. The reform covers education from the earliest levels, including preschool, and can be particularly effective in enabling the disadvantaged children in poor urban communities to reach higher educational standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 494, 710 A.2d 450.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The Court emphasized that \u201cearly childhood education is essential for children\u201d in the Abbott districts. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 710 A.2d 450. Because early childhood education formed \u201can integral component of whole-school reform,\u201d and considering also that the parties had expressed \u201cno fundamental disagreement over the importance of pre-school education,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court required the systematic imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>mentation of whole-school reform in the Abbott districts, <em>id. </em>at 502-03, 710 A.2d 450, and set forth \u201cthe remedial measures that must be implemented in order to ensure that public school children from the poorest urban communities receive the educational entitlements that the Constitution guarantees them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 489, 710 A.2d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In requiring this and the other remedies enunciated in <em>Abbott V, </em>the Court left unresolved the question of whether the constitutional guarantee encompasses a thorough and efficient pre-school education for children ages three and four, but concluded that it was \u201cconvinced\u201d that preschool was essential for preparing children for the education promised by our Constitution upon their reaching the age of five:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">This Court is convinced that pre-school for three- and four-year olds will have a significant and substantial positive impact on academic achievement in both early and later school years. As the experts described, the long-term benefits amply justify this investment. Also, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that, in the poor urban school districts, the earlier children start pre-school, the better prepared they are to face the challenges of kindergarten and first grade. It is this year-to-year improvement that is a critical condition for the attainment of a thorough and efficient education once a child enters regular public school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">Stated conversely, because the absence of such early educational intervention deleteriously undermines educational performance once the child enters public school, the provision of pre-school education also has strong constitutional underpinning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 506-07, 710 A.2d 450.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">Thus, while recognizing a link between preschool education and the thorough and efficient education of children between the ages of five and eighteen, the Court did not reach the constitutional issue. <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, the Court concluded that the requirement that preschool be made available in the Abbott districts was a remedy necessarily imposed to redress the prior constitutional deprivation of a thorough and efficient education for children in the Abbott districts upon reaching the age of five. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 710 A.2d 450. In short, the Court crafted its requirement that preschool education be provided in the Abbott districts as \u201ca remedial measure that can create the opportunity to achieve a thorough and efficient education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 710 A.2d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Since we are satisfied that the Court\u2019s <em>Abbott </em>holdings do not include a mandate for the exclusive state funding of preschool, we likewise need not consider whether the scope of the thorough and efficient education clause extends beyond its stated age boundaries, particularly when contemplating the enormity of such a holding beyond the Abbott districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We conclude, as did the Commissioner, that the adoption of whole-school reform, with its inclusion of preschool education in the Abbott districts, was designed by the Court as a remedy for the past constitutional deprivation of a thorough and efficient education for children between the ages of five and eighteen in the Abbott districts. In so recognizing the nature of <em>Abbott V\u2019s </em>mandate, and in comparing that mandate with others rendered by the Court in this context, we also conclude that the Court did not intend to require exclusive state funding of preschool in the Abbott districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">In this vein, we observe that the Court has chosen quite emphatic language when exclusive State funding was intended. <em>See Abbott V, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 524, 710 A.2d 450 (\u201cWe conclude that any funding formula that does not fund the complete cost of remediating the infrastructure and life cycle deficiencies that have been identified in the Abbott districts or that does not fully fund the construction of any new classrooms needed to correct capacity deficiencies will not comport with the State\u2019s constitutional mandate to provide facilities adequate to ensure a thorough and efficient education.\u201d); <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>84, 88, 751 A.2d 1032 (2000) <em>(Abbott VIII) </em>(\u201cThe State is required to fund all of the costs of necessary facilities remediation and construction in the Abbott districts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Here, in requiring preschool programs in the Abbott districts to remediate the prior deprivation of the constitutional right to a thorough and efficient education for children between the ages of five and eighteen, the Court\u2019s directives take on a less mandatory tone. Instead of compelling State funding for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>implementation of all preschool programs included within whole-school reform, the Court simply imposed an obligation on the Commissioner to \u201censure\u201d that such funding is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">In directing the implementation of pre-school programs in the Abbott schools, the Commissioner <em>must ensure </em>that such programs are adequately funded <em>and assist </em>the schools in meeting the need for transportation and other services, support, and resources related to such programs. The Commissioner may authorize cooperation with or the use of existing early childhood and day-care programs in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\"><em>[Abbott V, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 508, 710 A.2d 450 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">It is the Court\u2019s direction in <em>Abbott V </em>that the Commissioner \u201censure\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d which has informed the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and our affirmance of that decision, that other resources, including funds existing at the district level, may be allocated for these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">In pursuing the difficult question put to us as to how we should consider the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Abbott V </em>regarding the funding of preschool programs in the Abbott districts, we further observe that we do not view the present dispute as exalting the grammatical or syntactical form of the Court\u2019s words over the substance of what the Court intended to convey. Instead, in light of the Court\u2019s clarification of <em>Abbott V </em>in <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>95, 104, 748 A.2d 82 (2000) <em>(Abbott VI), </em>we can rest assured that the Court meant precisely what it said since the Court, in clarifying the Commissioner\u2019s obligations, simply reiterated the passage from <em>Abbott V </em>which we quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Accordingly, in answering the single question posed by this appeal, we follow the Court\u2019s prior holdings and conclude that the Court has only directed the Commissioner to \u201censure\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d in the \u201cadequate funding\u201d of preschool programs in the Abbott districts. We are satisfied that the Court\u2019s wording of this obligation \u2014 particularly when viewed against the Court\u2019s determination not to declare that a preschool education is constitutionally mandated \u2014 falls significantly short of requiring exclusive State funding for preschool programs in the Abbott districts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We also agree with the Commissioner that the Appropriations Act does not contain an obligation to fund any aspects of preschool education in the Abbott districts other than through the funding which comes from PSEA and ECPA. The Abbott districts argue that the Governor\u2019s 2004 Budget Message illuminates the legislative intent to exclusively fund all preschool aspects of whole-school reform. While we acknowledge that the comments of a governor may be considered in ascertaining the intent underlying particular legislation, <em>State v. Sutton, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>471, 483, 625 A.2d 1132 (1993), we conclude that the Appropriations Act which the Legislature ultimately enacted deliberately limited the scope of funding which the Governor\u2019s message appears to have proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In urging the significance of the Budget Message, plaintiffs rely specifically upon the Governor\u2019s following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">The amount appropriated hereinabove for Additional <em>Abbott v. Burke </em>State Aid will provide additional resources to \u201cAbbott districts\u201d to meet the State\u2019s obligation to fully fund parity <em>and the approved early childhood operational plans.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">[emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The legislation proposed at the time of the Governor\u2019s Budget Message expressed in the same way the scope of funding available for preschool education in Abbott districts. However, the Legislature modified the relevant provision so that instead of stating its intent to provide \u201cadditional resources ... to meet the State\u2019s obligation to fully fund ... <em>the approved early childhood operational plans,\" </em>the Legislature stated that it was providing \u201cadditional resources ... to meet the State\u2019s obligation to fully fund ... <em>approved \u2018Abbott\u2019 preschool expansion.\" </em>(emphasis added). This modification presents little question but that the Legislature in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tended to limit State funding to PSEA, ECPA and the funding for facilities remediation and construction compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Abbott v. Burke, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>84, 88, 751 A.2d 1032 (2000) <em>(Abbott VII).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Appropriations Act does not contain any provision for the State\u2019s exclusive funding of all aspects of preschool education in the Abbott districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Since the Supreme Court has not mandated exclusive State funding for all aspects of preschool education in the Abbott districts and since the Legislature has not provided for the funding of preschool beyond the funding components of PSEA and ECPA, we agree with the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the State is not mandated to exclusively fund preschool in the Abbott districts and that local resources, if available, may be allocated for such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\"> In the Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003, <em>L. </em>2002, <em>c. </em>38, the Legislature provided PSEA in the total amount of $142,400,000. The Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004 provided the same amount, <em>L. </em>2003, <em>c. </em>122, even though only $112,400,000 of the 2003 PSEA was expended. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>additional State funds to the full degree necessary to support approved programs where local budgetary resources, including formula aids, local levies and monies realized through economies, efficiencies and reallocations, are found inadequate for this purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> In <em>Abbott IV, </em>the Court held the Comprehensive Education Improvement and Financing Act (CEIFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7F-1 to -34, to be unconstitutional, finding that CEIFA did not assure funding parity with the wealthier districts and failed to fully provide for the special needs of Abbott students. 149 <em>N.J. </em>at 176-77, 185-86, 693 A.2d 417. <em>See Abbott V, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 710 A.2d 450.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-9\"> The Court also observed that in enacting CEIFA, the Legislature had \"recognized the necessity of early childhood education for three- and four-year olds in the poorest school districts.\" <em>Abbott V, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 505, 710 A.2d 450.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b455-11\"> We also reject the Abbott districts' contention that the following general comment made by the assistant commissioner, in a letter advising of various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>aspects of state funding, prohibited the Commissioner from rendering the decision now under review: \u201cThe state will meet its obligation to fully fund parity and preschool programs for Abbott districts.\u201d Much of what followed in that letter undercut the significance of this comment. Moreover, we fail to see how the Commissioner would be bound to comply with such a general statement in the particular context in which it was rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
