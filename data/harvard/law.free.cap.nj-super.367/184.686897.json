The record establishes that Moss knowingly violated regulations that control the prescription of Schedule II narcotic drugs. Three significant issues are raised by these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The first issue, common to both appeals brought on behalf of Moss, is whether a physician\u2019s knowing violation of the regulations is merely evidence of professional negligence, or whether the violation establishes negligence as a matter of law. The second issue, relating only to the appeal in A 5053, is whether the physician\u2019s conduct constitutes \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d as contemplated by the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:1-1 to 59:12-3, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14, as a matter of law. The third issue, also relating solely to A-5053, is whether the verbal threshold established by the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d, shields the physician from liability for non-economic damages despite the non-exoneration provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Both appeals arise out of Warnebold\u2019s medical malpractice action against his former physician, Moss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Warnebold alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Moss wrote post-dated and undated prescriptions for several Schedule II narcotic drugs, contrary to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:65-7.5(a) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:65-7.9,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> regulations enacted pursuant to the New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-1 to-53.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wamebold claims that Moss\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of his addiction to narcotics and resulting damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">After a confusing history of orders on several dispositive motions filed by various parties, the Law Division Judge granted partial summary judgment \u201con liability\u201d in favor of Warnebold, holding that Moss\u2019s willful violations of the administrative regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>tions constituted negligence as a matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge also held that Moss\u2019s actions constituted willful misconduct pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-14 and deprived defendant of any protection otherwise available under the Tort Claims Act, specifically, the verbal threshold set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2d. We granted Moss\u2019s motions for leave to file these interlocutory appeals and now affirm in both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">A brief summary of the facts will be sufficient for purposes of these appeals. Warnebold\u2019s medical history, specifically his use of addictive narcotic drugs, apparently began in 1987 with Percocet prescribed for headaches. His drug use continued through 1990, when he underwent a lumbar laminectomy, but he went through a hospital-based detoxification program in 1991. In March 1997, while Moss was employed as a physician for HIP/Pinnacle Medical Group, Warnebold first became his patient. Over the next four years, Moss repeatedly provided Warnebold with post-dated and undated prescriptions for narcotic drugs known as Percocet and Tylox, as well as for a muscle relaxant known as Soma.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Pursuant to an agreement between Moss and Warnebold that neither disputes, Moss wrote prescriptions for those drugs for Warnebold for months at a time. Moss also instructed Warnebold not to present an undated or post-dated prescription to any pharmacy. In April 1999, Moss became an employee of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (\u201cUMDNJ\u201d), a public entity, where he continued to treat and prescribe for Warnebold until some time in the first half of 2001.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Moss testified in depositions that he knew that Schedule II narcotics required a prescription, and that the drugs he prescribed for Warnebold had the potential for being addictive. Moss admitted that Warnebold was \u201cpain medication dependent,\u201d meaning that his \u201ccomplaints may exceed the usual medication schedule.\u201d Moss also knew that the law prohibited doctors from writing prescriptions to authorize refills for narcotic drugs. He also testified that he believed that it was acceptable medical practice to write undated or post-dated prescriptions for Schedule II narcotics and that at no time did he deviate from what he presumed to be the standard of care owed to his patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">When questioned about limits on the permissible quantity of such medications to be prescribed, and confronted with prescriptions he wrote that bore dates three or four days apart, each for quantities of 80 or 120 pills, filled at several different pharmacies, Moss answered that the amount would depend upon the patient\u2019s need and one should not prescribe \u201ca ridiculous\u201d amount. The record supports Warnebold\u2019s experts\u2019 descriptions of an excessive quantity and frequency of prescriptions written for him by Moss, far in excess of the quantity that would be medically supportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">There is no dispute that Warnebold was already addicted to prescription narcotic drags when he came to Moss, asking for prescriptions for Percocet and Tylox, a fact Wamebold\u2019s expert, Kevin E. Bell, M.D., noted in his report. Nothing in the record contradicts Dr. Bell\u2019s statement that the recommended dosage for those drags is a maximum of two tablets, four times a day for \u201cshort term\u201d pain relief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The record reflects, for example, that in the seven-month period from January 24, 2001 through July 7, 2001, Moss provided Warnebold with prescriptions for 840 Tylox plus 2,920 Percocet, for a total of 3,760 units. Moss alleges that he provided prescriptions for a larger supply to accommodate Warnebold, for whom it was difficult to make frequent trips to the doctor\u2019s office. He presented no expert opinion, however, that Warnebold\u2019s condition and the amounts of Schedule II drugs he prescribed for Warne-bold were within the limited exception provided by <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:35-7.6(c) (See Appendix A to this opinion). Moss actually saw Warnebold in the office only about once every three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The procedural history of this case is unusual. On October 28, 1999, Taglieri filed a malpractice complaint against Moss and various pharmacies for the negligent death of Mark Yatrofsky. The complaint alleged that Moss negligently prescribed narcotics which caused Yatrofsky to become addicted, and that as a result of his addiction, Yatrofsky was under the influence of a narcotic drug when he fell down a flight of stairs and sustained fatal injuries. Moss raised the defense of comparative negligence and filed a third-party complaint against Warnebold, seeking indemnification and contribution on the basis of Warnebold\u2019s alleged negligence in violating a duty to his friend, Yatrofsky.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Warnebold filed an answer along with a fourth-party complaint against Moss, alleging that Moss committed professional negligence by unlawfully providing him with excessive prescriptions for narcotic drugs. Moss\u2019s answer to Warnebold\u2019s fourth-party claim included defenses under the Tort Claims Act for the period when he was employed by UMDNJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Moss moved for partial summary judgment dismissing Warne-bold\u2019s medical malpractice claim with respect to the period after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>April 1, 1999 on the grounds of the Tort Claims Act verbal threshold. By cross-motion, Warnebold moved to bar the testimony of Moss\u2019s expert witness, Dr. George Mellendick, as a net opinion. The judge initially granted Moss\u2019s summary judgment motion, although he later reversed himself. The judge did not decide .the cross-motion to bar Moss\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Shortly after Moss\u2019s deposition, Warnebold moved for summary judgment against Moss for the period prior to April 1, 1999, when he was in private practice. On November 21, 2002 Warnebold also moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment previously entered in favor of Moss (based on the Tort Claims Act) for the period after April 1,1999, as well as to bar Moss from offering Dr. Mellendick\u2019s testimony at trial. The motion judge initially denied Warnebold\u2019s motion for reconsideration, but on March 17, 2003, the judge heard what he described as Wamebold\u2019s \u201ccontinuation ... of the motion for reconsideration\u201d of the order granting Moss summary judgment. During that argument, the judge described his reason for granting summary judgment to Warnebold against Moss for the private practice period (before April 1,1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">Because I \u2014 I remember I felt very strongly that the \u2014 and I\u2019m very reluctant to grant summary judgment, but I remember clearly saying that there was a clear violation of the administrative code or something on this and that \u2014 and this that clear violation was adequate for summary judgment to be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The judge then granted partial summary judgment to Warne-bold and later issued an order vacating the prior order in favor of Moss, holding that as a matter of law the doctor had breached the required standard of care in relation to Warnebold.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The court further held that because Moss\u2019s misconduct was willful, the verbal threshold provision of the Tort Claims Act did not bar Warnebold\u2019s action. On April 7, 2003, the judge issued an order granting Warnebold partial summary judgment for both periods, that is, for the periods when Moss was a public employee as well as when he was privately employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In explanation of the partial summary judgment against Moss \u201con liability,\u201d the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>[T]he willful misconduct here is the fact that he says, I knew what the law was, there is a statute that says you\u2019re not allowed to \u2014 to write refills ... I will go and I will violate the administrative code, which he knew about, which is where the legislature codified the statute in order to keep doctors from doing the conduct which .. Dr. Moss was engaged in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">I think he stated in his deposition testimony that he was aware of the administrative code regulation. I think he stated somewhere else that he \u2014 that he continued to prescribe this ... drug and if you just put the two sentences together, then you see \u2014 you can draw the conclusion that there was a violation of \u2014 without him formally admitting it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">I thought that the administrative code was the protocol for which at least one of those series of departure from the standard of care was premised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">If the protocol was there, and the protocol might\u2019ve been a hospital protocol as opposed to an AC, administrative code, ... but my recollection is [cases] have been premised by the expert throwing a dart at the defendant saying there\u2019s a protocol, there\u2019s something in the administrative code and that also constitutes a departure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">[T]his <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:]3-14 clearly \u2014 clearly contemplates an ex the fact that summary judgment should be granted . . [T]he way I read it, willful misconduct means from what I\u2019ve heard of the testimony, ... Dr. Moss was aware of the administrative code provisions and yet he continued to prescribe. So based upon that I will grant summary judgment on the issue of liability only. The issue of proximate cause is gonna be harsh for everybody! [<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The net result of all of the proceedings on motions was that the judge entered partial summary judgment against Moss and in favor of Warnebold, holding that Moss deviated from the applicable professional standard of care owed to Warnebold and that the Tort Claims Act did not insulate Moss from liability for any damage proximately caused by his deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The standard applicable to a motion for summary judgment is clearly set forth in <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). The same standard is applicable on review of a trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Dong v. Alape, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 111, 824 A.2d 251, 254 (App.Div.2003). [A portion of Part I has been omitted for purposes of publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">II. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Whether the violation of these regulations is admissible as evidence of a deviation from the applicable standard of care, or establishes a deviation as a matter of law, the evidence here is so one-sided that partial summary judgment in favor of Warnebold on the issue of Moss\u2019s deviation must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">[The balance of Part II has been omitted for purposes of publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">III. Willful Misconduct and the Tort Claims Act</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Moss\u2019s appeal in A-5053, in addition to the same negligence issue addressed in A-5052, challenges the partial summary judgment in favor of Warnebold dismissing Moss\u2019s Tort Claims Act defense based upon the determination that Moss\u2019s conduct in writing the prescriptions constituted \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d as contemplated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14, leaving him personally liable to Warnebold for damages proximately caused by such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">a. Nothing in this act shall exonerate a public employee from liability if it is established that his conduct was outside the scope of his employment or constituted a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">b. Nothing in this act shall exonerate a public employee from the full measure of recovery applicable to a person in the private sector if it is established that his conduct was outside the scope of his employment or constituted a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Moss contends not only that there is a material issue of fact on the issue of willful misconduct, but also that Warnebold cannot invoke that section of the Tort Claims Act to support a claim for non-economic damages because he cannot meet the verbal threshold set forth at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We address those arguments in reverse order, first considering the relationship between these two sections of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Moss contends that irrespective of whether his actions respecting the prescriptions he wrote for Warnebold are deemed to be \u201cwillful misconduct,\u201d he is entitled to the protection of the verbal threshold set forth by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d because Warnebold cannot establish \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or dismemberment.\u201d In other words, Moss contends that the threshold established by the Tort Claims Act as a barrier to non-economic damages serves to bar recovery against a public employee even \u201cif it is established that his conduct was outside the scope of his employment or constituted a crime, actual fraud, actual malice or willful misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Statutory interpretation requires attention to the Legislature\u2019s intent, which is to be sought initially in the plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>statute. <em>Frugis v. Bracigliano, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>250, 280, 827 A.2d 1040, 1058 (2003). The plain language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-14 is beyond dispute. <em>\u201cNothing </em>in this act shall exonerate\u201d such an employee. (Emphasis added). We see no indication in the Act and no evidence that the Legislature intended anything other than what it said. The Legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the relationship between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 and the verbal threshold provision of the Act is evidenced in the 1972 Task Force Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14: \u201cIt is the intent of this provision that a public employee guilty of outrageous conduct cannot avail himself of the limitations as to liability <em>and damages </em>contained in this act.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Similarly, in <em>Delacruz v. Borough of Hillsdale, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 838 A.2d 498, 2004 <em>WL </em>32662 (App.Div.2004), we recently held that the verbal threshold provision of the Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d, does not apply where the public employee defendant is subject to the non-exoneration provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That provision uses language strikingly similar to the language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-14 to articulate the Legislature\u2019s intention that the Tort Claims Act not relieve public employees of liability for certain egregious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We also note that in addressing a conflict between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 and the notice of claim provisions of the Tort Claims Act, two recent decisions by different panels of this court have taken opposite views of the question whether failure to file a timely notice bars recovery against a public employee for \u201ccrime, actual fraud, actual malice of willful misconduct.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A</em>. 59:3-14. <em>Compare Velez v. City of Jersey City, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 239-40, 817 A.2d 409, 417-18 (App.Div.) (public employee accused of assault and battery is not entitled to the protection of the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>claim provisions of the Tort Claims Act), <em>certif. granted, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>224, 827 A.2d 291 (2003), <em>with Bonitsis v. New Jersey Inst. of Tech., </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 833 A.2d 679 (App.Div.2003) (failure to meet the notice of claim requirements of the Act bars recovery against the individual employee charged with an intentional tort as well as the public entity).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Specifically referring to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 in <em>Velez, </em>we invoked the principle that the plain language of the statute controls unless it is inconsistent with apparent legislative intent. 358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 817 A.2d at 418. By contrast, the rationale expressed in <em>Bonitsis </em>was that holding the injured party to the notice requirement, even in a case alleging an intentional tort for which the entity would not be vicariously liable, was consistent with the legislative intent because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">affords the public entity an opportunity to correct the practices which gave rise to the claim, ... to investigate the claim[ ], and take disciplinary or other appropriate action to rectify inappropriate behavior or flawed practices, if necessary, regardless of whether the State is liable for damages.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axy\">[363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 521, 833 A.2d at 688.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Irrespective of whether <em>Velez </em>or <em>Bonitsis </em>prevails with respect to the relationship between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 and the notice of claim provisions, the rationale of <em>Bonitsis </em>does not apply to the verbal threshold provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2d. Contrary to Moss\u2019s argument on that issue, the verbal threshold does not bar suit entirely, as does the failure to file a timely notice of claim; the threshold merely limits the recoverable damages. And <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14b plainly states that \u201cnothing\u201d in the act \u201cshall exonerate a public employee from the full measure of recovery applicable to a person in the private sector\u201d if the employee has committed acts of \u201cwillful misconduct.\u201d Thus <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2d does not protect Moss, and we affirm the judgment of the Law Division insofar as it holds the verbal threshold inapplicable to Warnebold\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>[For purposes of publication, we have omitted the discussion of willful misconduct under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14b. We concluded that Moss\u2019s conduct unquestionably constituted willful misconduct, and summary judgment dismissing Moss\u2019s Tort Claims Act defense was entirely appropriate.]</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Affirmed as to both A-5052 and A-5053.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:35-7.6, enacted by the Board of Medical Examiners, provided as follows prior to the amendment to section c on June 10, 2003:</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">(a) When prescribing, dispensing or administering controlled substances, a practitioner shall ensure that a patient\u2019s medical history has been taken and physical examination accomplished, including an assessment of physical and psychological function, underlying or coexisting diseases or conditions, any history of substance abuse and the nature, frequency and severity of any pain.

A practitioner managing pain in a patient with a history of substance abuse shall exercise extra care by way of monitoring, documentation and possible consultation with addiction medicine specialists, and should consider the use of an agreement between the practitioner and the patient concerning controlled substance use and consequences for misuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">(g) The practitioner shall keep accurate and complete records including that information required by (a) above as well as:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">1.

For the 120 dosage unit limitation, the practitioner follows a treatment plan designed to achieve effective pain management which has been tailored to the needs of a patient who is suffering pain from cancer, intractable pain or terminal illness. The treatment plan shall state objectives by which treatment success is to be evaluated, such as pain relief and improved physical and psychological function, and shall indicate if any further diagnostic evaluations or other treatments are planned. The practitioner shall discuss the risks and benefits of the use of controlled substances with the patient, guardian or authorized representative; and</p>\n<p id=\"b229-22\">2. With regards to the 30-day supply limitation, a practitioner may prescribe the use of an implantable infusion pump which is utilized to achieve pain management for patients suffering from cancer, intractable pain or terminal illness. A prescription for such an implantable infusion pump may provide up to a 90-day supply as long as the physician evaluates and documents the patient\u2019s continued need at least every 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">35 <em>N.J.R. </em>2935(a); 34 <em>N..J.R. </em>3441(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-14\"> Defendant Albert Moss is represented by two law firms, each of which is defending Moss and pursuing an appeal with respect to claims arising during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>separate time period. Prior to March 31, 1999, Moss was employed by a private entity, HIP/Pinnacle Medical Group, and insured under a policy issued by the Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange. The law firm of Sharp &amp; Brown represents Moss with respect to that period (Docket No. A-5052-02T5). As of April 1, 1999, Moss became an employee of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (\"UMDNJ\"), a public entity. The law firm of Post, Polak, Goodsell, MacNeill &amp; Strauchler represents Moss with respect to liability arising after that date (Docket No. A-5053-02T5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-9\"> For purposes of publication, we have omitted our discussion of the first two issues, as noted under Parts II and III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b217-10\"> The original complaint against Moss alleging medical malpractice was filed by William Taglieri, as Executor of the Estate of Mark F. Yatrofsky. The Estate has joined in Warnebold's brief, although the February 25, 2003 partial summary judgment in favor of the Estate was not included in Moss's motions for leave to appeal. (We do not address at this time the legal significance of that omission or of the Estate's participation in these appeals). Moss named Warne-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>bold as a third-party defendant, and Wamebold then filed a counterclaim against Moss alleging medical malpractice. It is Warnebold\u2019s counterclaim that is the subject of these appeals. Moss also named Taglieri individually and Barry Sherwin as third-party defendants. Moss\u2019s third-party complaint was dismissed against Wamebold, and against Sherwin, and those dismissals have not been appealed. Sherwin did not participate in these appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">The record before us does not include the disposition of the claims against defendants Eckerd Drugs (the successor to Boyt\u2019s Pharmacy) or Prudential Property and Casualty Ins.
