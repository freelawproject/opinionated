As a result of that injury, the employee underwent surgery for a herniated cervical disc in November, 1979. After the operation, he developed chest pains and was diagnosed as having suffered a heart attack. The insurer, American Mutual Liability; contested liability for any disability resulting from the heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">On June 18, 1985, after a hearing, an administrative judge ruled that the heart attack was related to the cervical surgery and therefore any disability resulting from the heart attack was compensable. The employee collected temporary total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, until they were exhausted, and then began collecting permanent disability benefits pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A. On February 27, 1995, the employee died as a result of another myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The employee\u2019s widow, Elizabeth Benson (claimant), sought widow\u2019s benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, claiming that the employee\u2019s death was related to his December 19, 1978, industrial accident. At the conference concerning her claim held pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, the parties disagreed as to whether an impartial medical examiner should be appointed in the event that either party appealed from the conference order. The claimant maintained that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(5) (1993)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not allow the appointment of an impartial medical examiner in death payment cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The insurer disagreed and claimed that because the matter involved a dispute over a medical issue, the appointment of an impartial medical examiner was dictated by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The administrative judge ordered the insurer to pay G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, benefits to the claimant and the insurer appealed. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A(3). Subsequently, an impartial medical examiner was appointed to conduct a \u201crecord review,\u201d pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">At the hearing held pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, the administrative judge, over the claimant\u2019s objections, admitted the record review of the impartial medical examiner, adopted the opinions in the report as prima facie evidence, and denied the claimant her widow\u2019s benefits. He found that the employee\u2019s fatal heart attack in February, 1995, was not causally related to the employee\u2019s December 19, 1978, industrial accident. The claimant appealed to the reviewing board which summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The claimant has appealed. She contends that the administrative judge committed error in ordering an impartial medical examiner to make a review of the employee\u2019s medical records. In view of our decision on this issue we do not reach the claimant\u2019s additional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">In concluding that the appointment of an impartial medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>examiner is required in widow\u2019s claims under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, the administrative judge ruled that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(5) <em>(supra </em>at note 1) conflicted with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), and therefore the statute prevailed. <em>Pinecrest Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacMillan, </em>425 Mass. 70, 73 (1997) (\u201cto the extent that there is a conflict, the statute must prevail over the administrative regulation\u201d). However, we disagree with the administrative judge\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), and hold that there is no conflict because the statute does not require the appointment of an independent medical examiner in matters similar to those at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cWhen any claim or complaint involving a dispute over medical issues is the subject of an appeal of a conference order pursuant to section ten A, the parties shall agree upon an impartial medical examiner from the roster <em>to examine the employee </em>and submit such choice to the administrative judge assigned to the case within ten calendar days of filing the appeal, or said administrative judge shall appoint such examiner from the roster. . . . The impartial medical examiner, so agreed upon or appointed, <em>shall examine the employee </em>and make a report at least one week prior to the beginning of the hearing, which shall be sent to each party.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">\u201c[I]n construing a statute, its words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning according to the approved usage of language.\u201d <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 747 (1945). Here, the statute states that where an aggrieved party\u2019s claim involves a disputed medical question, the impartial medical examiner\u2019s role is to examine the employee in order to \u201cevaluate [his] condition and set forth his or her findings in a report.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 16, 21 (1996). The statute is silent as to the role of the impartial medical examiner where the employee is not available to be examined because of death. We cannot add words to a statute that the Legislature \u201cdid not see fit to put there.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The administrative judge further ruled that even if 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(5) were read so that it did not conflict with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), he still had discretion to order an impartial medical examination in the form of a record review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>We disagree with the administrative judge\u2019s interpretation of the statute. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), speaks only of conducting an examination, and we hold that the administrative judge had no discretion to order a record review in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Because the administrative judge had no authority to order the appointment of an impartial medical examiner, the impartial medical examiner\u2019s report should be struck from the record. The decision of the reviewing board is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Department of Industrial Accidents for a hearing de novo pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, during which the parties should be allowed to introduce their own medical evidence in support of their respective claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Title 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(5) states in relevant part: \u201cNo impartial physician shall be required in disputed matters concerning [G. L. c. 152,] \u00a7 31 (death of employee).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-11\">The phrase \u201cimpartial medical examiner\u201d appears in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, while 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(5) (1993) employs the phrase \u201cimpartial physician.\u201d The difference between \u201cmedical examiner\u201d and \u201cphysician\u201d is immaterial for purposes of this discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
