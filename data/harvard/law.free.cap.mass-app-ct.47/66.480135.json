He appealed his termination to the Plymouth County retirement board (board) pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board found that Smith\u2019s dismissal contravened G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was not justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>fled because \u201cit was arbitrary, unreasonable and not manifestly supported by the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Upon review of an action in the nature of certiorari filed by the chief of the department, Ryon T. Pratt, in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, a Superior Court judge determined that the board did not make any substantial errors of law that would adversely affect material rights of the plaintiff, and that the board\u2019s decision was reasonable and grounded upon a tenable legal basis. There was ample evidence before the board to support its findings, which in turn justified its conclusion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Here is a brief scenario of the relevant events. An application for a criminal complaint was filed against Smith in the Brock-ton District Court by the department on June 19, 1995, alleging that on July 18, 1994, Smith had committed an indecent assault and battery on a person.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the complaint was filed against him, Smith was placed on administrative leave by Fire Chief Pratt. On April 18, 1996, Smith admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty and the case was continued without a finding until April 15, 1997.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, as appearing in St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">On April 23, 1996, Chief Pratt notified Smith that a hearing would be held on May 3, 1996, to determine whether Smith\u2019s conduct relative to the criminal complaint was \u201cconduct unbecoming and misconduct or gross misconduct affecting your work environment . . . .\u201d On May 4, 1996, Smith requested a two-week postponement so that he could obtain legal counsel and prepare his defense. Smith further requested a list of the offenses, a list of witnesses, incident reports and departmental records pertaining to his employment from July 1, 1994, to the present, and copies of any documents that would be used against him in the proceedings. On May 6, 1996, Chief Pratt responded to Smith, denying his request for a postponement, and informing him that he (Smith) was the prime witness and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>prime document was Smith\u2019s statement to the police regarding his alleged criminal conduct. The hearing was held the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">After the hearing, Smith was notified by registered mail on or about May 17, 1996, that his employment was terminated, effective immediately, for conduct unbecoming.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On June 6, 1996, Smith filed a request with the board for a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On June 25, 1996, the board held a justification hearing. The board admitted in evidence East Bridgewater\u2019s purported fair summary of the facts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board heard the testimony of Chief Pratt and Smith and afforded the parties an opportunity to submit legal memoranda prior to the board\u2019s next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On July 9, 1996, East Bridgewater\u2019s counsel submitted a brief in support of the town\u2019s position. The board received a letter from Smith on July 26, 1996, informing it that he could not be present at the next meeting. The board met on July 31, 1996, to evaluate the evidence and consider the matter. The board addressed two questions to determine whether Smith\u2019s termination was justified: \u201c(a) was a fair summary of the facts filed with the Board, in compliance with the procedure for delivery of copies and notice set forth in M. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(1) and (b) if the proper procedure was followed, was the termination justified, i.e. supported by the evidence considered by East Bridgewater when it made its decision to terminate Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In its findings and decision the board found, upon a review of the record evidence, that a fair summary of the facts had been filed in conformity with c. 32, \u00a7 16(1). The board made specific findings based on the evidentiary record limited by the scope of review prescribed under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), the board concluded that \u201cSmith\u2019s dismissal was not justified, as it was arbitrary, unreasonable and not manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>supported by the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compare <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 300, 303 (1997) (\u201cA decision is arbitrary and capricious when it lacks any rational explanation that reasonable persons might support\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">I. <em>Standards for judicial review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>A. General Laws c. 249, \u00a7 4. </em>Chief Pratt, being aggrieved by the board\u2019s decision rendered pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), filed an action against the board and Smith in the nature of certiorari in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe relief sought in an action in the nature of certiorari is \u2018to correct substantial errors of law apparent on the record adversely affecting material rights.\u2019 <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 84, 90 (1975), quoting from <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives, </em>331 Mass. 135, 139 (1954).\u201d <em>Cambridge Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 587 (1979). \u201c \u2018[T]he standard of judicial review under the certiorari statute takes its color from the nature of the administrative action that is being examined.\u2019 <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, M.C.I., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 445 (1985), citing <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 300 (1985).\u201d <em>Superintendent of Public Works of Attleboro </em>v. <em>Attleboro Contributory Retirement Bd., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 133 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">B. <em>General Laws c. 30A. </em>We decided in <em>Georgetown </em>v. <em>Essex County Retirement Bd., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 272 (1990), that \u201c[t]he \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 test makes sense when it is applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>to evaluate articulated subsidiary findings against the evidentiary record that was . . . the basis for them \u2014 a process that is normally the crux of judicial review of adjudicatory decisions under the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 11(8) and 14(7)(e).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. \u201cThus, in these circumstances the issue on review in this court is simply whether the [board\u2019s] findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Cambridge Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., supra </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">II. <em>The board\u2019s decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We review the board\u2019s bases for rejecting Chief Pratt\u2019s contentions. First, the board found that Chief Pratt\u2019s reason for terminating Smith was not supported by the department\u2019s rules.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he Rules relating to prohibited conduct . . . pertain to conduct <em>while on duty or in uniform. . . . </em>Since Smith\u2019s actions did not occur while he was on duty or in uniform, the department cannot invoke the rules regarding conduct unbecoming as a basis for terminating Smith.\u201d The \u201cconduct unbecoming a member\u201d that by the department rules may be deemed \u201cprohibited conduct\u201d is specifically limited to acts and activities \u201cwhile on duty or in uniform.\u201d Thus, the board rightly found that Chief Pratt\u2019s conclusion that Smith had violated the department\u2019s rules of conduct lacked justification. Compare <em>School Comm, of Brockton </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 486 (1997) (private sexual conduct is not conduct unbecoming a school janitor absent a nexus to his work). Contrast <em>School Comm, of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 263-264 (1984) (agency\u2019s decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>improperly based upon de novo review, and therefore \u201cmade upon unlawful procedure\u201d). An appointing authority is bound by its own regulations. Cf. <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 76 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Second, the board rejected Chief Pratt\u2019s assertion that Smith\u2019s admission to sufficient facts rose to the level of conduct unbecoming because it was equivalent to his pleading guilty.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The board correctly determined that Smith\u2019s admission was not akin to a guilty plea and, further, that if Smith completed his probationary period without violating the terms of his probation or committing another offense, all charges against him would then be dismissed and he would have no criminal conviction on his record.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 666, 670 (1998). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyles, </em>423 Mass. 717, 721-722 &amp; n.7 (1996). Contrast <em>Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>421 Mass. 415, 418 n.6 (1995). Based on the dual premises that the charges could be dismissed and the offense was not committed while on duty or in uniform, the board concluded that Chief Pratt had not produced sufficient evidence to support a finding that Smith\u2019s alleged criminal acts rose to the level of conduct unbecoming under department regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Third, the board determined that Chief Pratt\u2019s claim that Smith was unable to work with other firefighters was without merit. The board noted that the offense occurred on July 18, 1994, the complaint was issued on June 19, 1995, and during the intervening year, Smith performed his duties without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The board\u2019s decision was correct. The board acted within its authority under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), in basing its decision on the evidence presented at the hearing on July 31, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">HI. <em>The Superior Court\u2019s decision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>On judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u201c[a] decision of [a retirement board] may be set aside only if based upon an error of law or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 636 (1985). The Superior Court\u2019s review of the board\u2019s decision entails a review for error that the board may have committed under one of the sections of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). The court found no error. Contrast <em>Georgetown </em>v. <em>Essex County Retirement Bd., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 274-275. We likewise discern no error, applying the circumscribed review permitted us under the substantial evidence standard. See discussion in <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 695-696 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We do recognize that \u201calthough \u2018a crime arising from an employee\u2019s off-duty conduct is not generally considered misconduct in office .... [t]here are . . . circumstances where the crime charged, no matter where or when performed, is so inimical to the duties inherent in the employment that an indictment for that crime is for misconduct in office.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>McHatton, </em>428 Mass. 790, 793 (1999), quoting from <em>Dupree </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 537 (1983). That is not the case here. In <em>McHatton, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court referred to case law construing \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d as it appears under statutory provisions and in the Massachusetts Constitution respectively, governing the removal of members of housing authorities and regarding the impeachment of State officers. <em>McHatton </em>and other cases decided by the Supreme Judicial Court and this court upholding the discharge of police officers for inappropriate behavior \u201cwhile off duty\u201d (collected in <em>McHatton, supra </em>at 794) are distinguishable because they turn on conduct that brings \u201cpublic distrust of law enforcement personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-15\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), was abolished on November 7, 1996, pursuant to \u00a7 19 of chapter 306 of the Acts of 1996, a few months after the board\u2019s hearing in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-16\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), as amended through St. 1967, c. 826, \u00a7 22, provided, in pertinent part, \u201cThe removal or discharge of any member in service classified in Group 1, Group 2 or Group 4 who ... is a veteran and has completed ten or more years of creditable service, shall not become effective unless and until a written notice thereof containing a fair summary of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>facts upon which such action was based has been filed with the board. . . .

L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(2), the board properly may \u201cfind arbitrary and unreasonable a removal based on findings that manifestly lack support in the appointing authority\u2019s evidentiary record.\u201d <em>Georgetown </em>v. <em>Essex County Retirement Bd., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 272, 275 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The board also determined that Chief Pratt was unreasonable and acting in bad faith when he denied the continuance that Smith requested. \u201cGiven the short notice of the hearing and that Smith had been on an unpaid administrative leave for over a year, East Bridgewater would not have been unduly prejudiced by such a continuance. It is also disingenuous for the Department to argue that a postponement would have cost the town more money, since Smith requested a continuance two days prior to the scheduled hearing, which was more than enough time to postpone the hearing without the Department suffering financial harm. We . . . find . . . [the] Department\u2019s claims of jeopardizing public safety by granting Smith\u2019s request for a continuance a bit perplexing, given that the Department had apparently been functioning adequately for a year without Smith\u2019s services. Finally, Smith was previously represented by counsel who had withdrawn from the matter just prior to the hearing; equity and fairness would have warranted a continuance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u201cNo right of judicial review lay under G.
