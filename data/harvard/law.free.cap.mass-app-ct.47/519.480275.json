(foundation), appeals from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) which affirmed the decision of the board of assessors of North Attleborough denying the foundation\u2019s applications for abatement of real estate taxes for the years 1996 and 1997. The issue on appeal is whether the foundation is entitled to the charitable exemption provided by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">Although the case was before the board under the formal procedure, and the board issued findings and rulings, the foundation has not provided us with a copy of the transcript, and it is precluded from arguing that the board\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, </em>368 Mass. 745, 749-751 (1975). Ultimate findings of the board may be set aside, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>nevertheless, if they are not supported by the board\u2019s subsidiary findings. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Center </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>353 Mass. 35, 39 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The foundation, which the town of North Attleborough (town) concedes is a charitable organization, leased eighty-two per cent of a two-story wood frame building it owned (property) to Sturdy Memorial Associates, Inc. (corporation).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The foundation is entitled to a charitable exemption with respect to that portion of the property only if the corporation is also a \u201ccharitable organization\u201d and occupies the property for its charitable purpose. G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third. The foundation formed the corporation because Sturdy Memorial Hospital, which the foundation sponsors and assists financially, had been unable to recruit new doctors to the town.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board concluded that the corporation was not a charitable organization occupying the property for charitable purposes and affirmed the decision of the board of assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The restated articles of organization of the corporation provide that (i) the corporation shall not do anything that would interfere with its exempt status for purposes of Federal income tax, (ii) \u201c[n]o part of the net earnings of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any private individual,\u201d (iii) \u201cno officer or employee of the corporation shall receive . . . any pecuniary profit\u201d other than \u201creasonable compensation for services in effecting one or more of its purposes,\u201d and (iv) upon dissolution, its assets shall be distributed to the foundation or if the foundation no longer qualifies for exemption from Federal income tax under the tax code, then to one or more other exempt organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The board made the following findings of subsidiary facts. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the corporation employed six physicians who were neither corporate officers nor members of the board of directors of the corporation. Five of the physicians were paid a salary the amount of which was determined by the three non-physician members of the compensation committee of the board of directors of the corporation. One physician employed by the corporation worked part-time and was paid on an hourly basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The physicians\u2019 malpractice insurance, medical supplies, equipment, and staff were paid for or provided by the corporation. The corporation paid all start-up expenses of the physicians it employed, and it paid all the expenses of the operation of the corporation including rent due the foundation for space leased from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The physicians employed by the corporation saw patients on an appointment-only basis and did not provide \u201cwalk-in\u201d service. In 1996, the physicians attended to 18,000 patient visits and probably more in 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All the medical services were provided on the space leased from the foundation. Any \u201cfree care\u201d provided by the corporation was a result of charges that were not collected. This amounted to less than one per cent of the annual gross income of the corporation. The board noted that no medical research or education was conducted by the corporation. The board also noted that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the services of the corporation were \u201cprovided at a less than average cost to patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The board made no finding that the compensation paid the physician employees was unreasonable, or that the payment of salaries was \u201ca mere device for securing to the beneficial owners the profits which may accrue,\u201d <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>384 Mass. 536, 541 (1981), quoting from 4 Scott, Trusts \u00a7 372.1 (3d ed. 1967), or whether the corporation realized any net earnings in any year, or whether the net earnings of the corporation, if any, inured to the private benefit of the physician employees or any other individual, or the extent to which the physician employees were providing health care services to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>On the basis of the subsidiary findings of fact it did make, the board made the ultimate finding that \u201cthe dominant purpose of [the corporation] was to benefit its physician members.\u201d The board emphasized its findings that all physician expenses were paid by the corporation, there were no \u201cwalk-in\u201d patient visits, that there was no evidence that the services were provided at less than average cost to patients, and that the free care arose only because charges to some patients had not been paid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The board promulgated its decision on November 17, 1997. On or about December 2, 1997, the foundation filed a motion for additional findings of fact. The motion stated that there was uncontradicted evidence that (i) the corporation operated at a deficit, and that the foundation paid the funds needed to cover the losses, (ii) that the salaries of the physician employees were \u201cless than the salaries of comparable physicians and are not related to the income that each physician generates on behalf of the [corporation],\u201d and (iii) \u201c[a]bout 25% of the patients of the [corporation] are referred to the Sturdy Memorial Hospital and are generally high risk and certain sub-specialty cases such as neurosurgery. All other patients are treated by the [corporation].\u201d The motion was denied without comment on December 16, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The board\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact do not support its ultimate finding of fact. The charitable nature of a group practice of medicine must satisfy two requirements: (i) there is an absolute prohibition against private inurement \u201cwhere, for example, the physicians \u2018employed\u2019 by it serve on its board or otherwise exert control over its finances . . . [or] \u2018if the payment of salaries is a mere device for securing to the beneficial owners the profits which may accrue,\u201d\u2019 <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>384 Mass, at 541, quoting from 4 Scott, Trusts \u00a7 372.1, and (ii) the persons benefiting from the operation of the group practice are a \u201csufficiently large or indefinite class so that the community is benefited by its operations.\u201d 384 Mass, at 543. See <em>id. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">As to the first requirement, the physicians employed by the corporation are not members of the board of directors or officers of the corporation, do not participate in the determination of their compensation, and have no control over the finances of the corporation. Unless the payment of salaries to the physicians is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a device to divert all or substantially all of the profits of the corporation to the physicians \u2014 which we discuss below \u2014 the payment of physician salaries and expenses does not necessarily violate the rule against private inurement. As to the second requirement, the 18,000 visits per year, when translated into the probable number of patient visits per day seen by each physician, result in a very substantial daily work product for each physician. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Unless these 18,000 patient visits are confined to a carefully selected and insignificant group of patients, which we discuss below, there is no failure of performance for the benefit of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">However, even if we were to conclude that the board\u2019s ultimate finding is not substantiated by its subsidiary findings, the foundation\u2019s appeal does not necessarily succeed, for it is well-established that \u201ca party claiming exemption bears a grave burden of proving the claim.\u201d <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc., </em>384 Mass, at 543. The foundation cannot meet its heavy burden of proof by relying solely on the board\u2019s subsidiary findings, even if those findings based on erroneous conceptions of the applicable law are eliminated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There would still remain the issues of the reasonableness of the physician salaries and the community benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We noted above that following the promulgation of the board\u2019s finding, the foundation filed a motion requesting the board, under Appellate Tax Board Rule 1.29, 831 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.29 (1996),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to make additional findings of fact based on \u201cuncontradicted evidence.\u201d Those findings would be to the effect that the corporation operates at a deficit, and the foundation is required to contribute the funds needed to meet that deficit; that the salaries of the physician employees are less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the salaries of comparable physicians; and that twenty-five per cent of the patients of the corporation are high-risk patients who are referred to Sturdy Memorial Hospital, the balance of patients being undifferentiated patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">These requested findings, if supported by the \u201cuncontradicted evidence\u201d as alleged, would establish (i) the absence of any private inurement: there is no profit generated by the enterprise, and in any event, the salaries are below market, and (ii) that the 18,000 patients in 1996 (and \u201cprobably more\u201d in 1997) are a large and \u201cindefinite class of persons\u201d in the service area of Sturdy Memorial Hospital, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>served by six physicians. See <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Center </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>353 Mass, at 44. The fact that twenty-five per cent of the patients are referred to Sturdy Memorial Hospital (whose charitable character is not questioned by the board) is a function of the seriousness of the illness of the patients seen by the physicians; the charitable character of the work of the corporation is not jeopardized by what is certainly in the best interest of the patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It appears, then, that the board\u2019s reasoned disposition of the requested findings would be critical to the outcome of the abatement application. If, as alleged, the findings are based on uncontradicted evidence, it may appear that the abatement application should be allowed. If the findings are not supported by the uncontradicted evidence, then the foundation may not have carried its burden of proof. For this reason, the board\u2019s rejection of the motion, without explanation, is, in our view, an abuse of the board\u2019s discretion. The opportunity to apply late for requests of findings of fact \u2014 which the board\u2019s rule 1.29 expressly contemplates \u2014 is presumably intended to provide the litigants as well as the board with the opportunity to correct inadvertent errors. Here, if the foundation\u2019s motion is accurate in its representation regarding the evidence, it would be a miscarriage of justice in a matter of public concern to reject the motion out-of-hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded to the board for the purpose of reconsidering its denial of the foundation\u2019s motion for additional findings of fact, and issuing its opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The foundation concedes in its brief that it did not present sufficient evidence to the board to warrant a finding that the remaining eighteen per cent of the property is exempt under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Third.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The corporation\u2019s purpose is set forth in its restated articles of organization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cThe corporation is organized and shall be operated exclusively for the benefit of the Sturdy Memorial Hospital, Inc., and its affiliated organizations, charitable corporations organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and qualified as- exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and in furtherance thereof <em>shall render medical services and provide health education to persons in the Hospital\u2019s service area\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Assuming a forty-eight week working year, and a five-day work week, the 18,000 patient visits found by the board translates to approximately 13.6 patients per work day for each of the 5.5 physicians employed by the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The board characterized this factual configuration as a \u201cturn-key\u201d private medical practice for the group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The fact of \u201cappointment only\u201d service is merely an efficient management arrangement which, so far as we can determine, has not been identified by our courts as a factor in the equation of charitable immunity. No one would suggest, for example, that waiting hours in a physician\u2019s office to see a physician would be a preferable method of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The fact that free care is limited to unpaid bills is irrelevant. See <em>Harvard Community Health Plan, Inc., </em>384 Mass, at 543 (\u201calmsgiving\u201d is not necessary to qualify for the exemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Providing services at below-market charges is not essential to the exemption. See <em>id. </em>at 540-541.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The Appellate Tax Board rule appearing in 831 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.29 provides that requests for findings of fact and rulings of law may be filed after argument if leave to do so is given by the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
