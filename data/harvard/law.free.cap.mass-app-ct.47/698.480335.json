After failing to revive Shannon, Piccirillo sat in her car for a time, then dressed, pulled up Shannon\u2019s pants, and drove to Shannon\u2019s house, where he lived with his family. There she sat in her car at the curb for perhaps ten minutes trying to decide what to do, including whether to call an ambulance, get Shannon\u2019s mother, or take Shannon to the hospital. She finally decided that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>opened the passenger door of her car, said \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and pushed Shannon\u2019s body out into the gutter in front of his house. As she did so, she \u201cthought about ... the effect it [the fact that Shannon\u2019s body had been so discarded] would have on the people that loved him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Upon learning of the circumstances of the discovery of her son\u2019s body (apparently by her landlord) while at the hospital where the body had been taken, the plaintiff, Cynthia Richardson, suffered a nervous breakdown. As a result, she required hospitalization, experienced insomnia, appetite loss and panic attacks, confined herself to her home for a year, and for many years thereafter regularly took medication for anxiety and depression. In August 1994, she commenced the underlying action against Piccirillo for wrongful death and for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">At the time of the actionable event, Piccirillo was insured under a \u201cdeluxe homeowners policy\u201d issued by Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Liberty) that provided a limit of $100,000 coverage for \u201ceach occurrence\u201d giving rise to liability under the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Liberty assumed Piccirillo\u2019s defense. The plaintiff demanded $200,000 under the policy on the ground that Shannon\u2019s death and Piccirillo\u2019s disposal of his body constituted two separate and distinct occurrences. Liberty rejected this demand, maintaining that the events allegedly triggering liability arose from a single occurrence. The plaintiff and Liberty eventually settled the wrongful death claim for $100,000 on the condition that the question whether the disposal of Shannon\u2019s body warranted an additional payment would be submitted to the Superior Court for declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The plaintiff subsequently amended her complaint to name Liberty as a defendant and to state a cause of action for declaratory relief. She also filed, pursuant to the terms of the settlement, a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice as to the remaining counts of the complaint. Liberty answered and raised several affirmative defenses, which included an assertion that exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sions under the policy, including one for \u201cbodily injury or property damage . . . which is expected or intended by the insured,\u201d precluded coverage for Piccirillo\u2019s conduct. The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The plaintiff continued to argue in her motion that Liberty was liable for an additional $100,000 because her son\u2019s death and Piccirillo\u2019s disposal of his body were two occurrences which arose from independent causes. Liberty maintained that the $100,000 settlement satisfied its obligation to the plaintiff because the wrongful death and emotional distress claims stemmed from a single occurrence \u2014 Shannon\u2019s death. Liberty also contended that Piccirillo\u2019s conduct with respect to the body fell outside the scope of the term \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined under the policy as an \u201caccident\u201d (which was not defined), because she had acted intentionally. In any event, Liberty asserted, coverage was unavailable under the exclusion barring payment for \u201cexpected or intended\u201d injury caused by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">A Superior Court judge, acting on a stipulated statement of facts, first ruled that Shannon\u2019s death and Piccirillo\u2019s disposal of his body constituted two distinct occurrences separated by time, space and reflection. The judge then addressed the question whether the exclusion barring coverage for \u201cexpected or intended\u201d injury applied. Relying on <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81 (1984), he noted that the term \u201cexpected\u201d under a homeowner\u2019s policy required evidence that the insured knew to a substantial certainty that injury would result from her conduct. The judge determined that Piccirillo, after an extended period of contemplation, had made a conscious decision to leave Shannon\u2019s body in front of the plaintiff\u2019s home. He found that Piccirillo subjectively knew that her actions would have negative consequences for Shannon\u2019s family. Based on these findings and the special status under the law accorded to bodies of deceased persons,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judge concluded that Piccirillo knew and appreciated to a substantial certainty that someone would be injured as a result of her leaving Shannon\u2019s body in front of his home. He therefore allowed Liberty\u2019s motion for summary judgment, on the ground that coverage for the second occurrence is precluded under the exclusion for injuries expected or intended by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the judge\u2019s ruling that the policy does not cover the second occurrence (disposal of the body), arguing (for the first time) that there was insufficient record evidence to determine whether Piccirillo intended to harm Shannon\u2019s family or knew to a substantial certainty that such harm would result.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserts that the judge erroneously focused on the nature of Piccirillo\u2019s acts rather than on her state of mind, which she contends was a genuine issue of fact in dispute. She argues that the circumstances of this case fall outside the small category of cases of egregious conduct in which the intent to injure may be inferred from the conduct itself as matter of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The limited state of mind evidence in the summary judgment record does not, she contends, support the conclusion that Piccirillo acted intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\u25a0Whether the callous dumping of a corpse in a place where it was highly likely to be discovered by the deceased\u2019s immediate family is conduct so extreme and outrageous as to warrant an inference of intent to harm as matter of law is a novel question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Without addressing it, however, and without assessing the sufficiency of the state of mind evidence on this record (the substantive issues to which the parties devote their briefs), we conclude that summary judgment for the insurer was appropriate, because the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress was not a \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The section of the Liberty policy entitled \u201cLiability Coverages\u201d provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u201cCoverage E \u2014 Personal Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an <em>insured </em>for damages because of <em>bodily injury . . . </em>caused by an <em>occurrence </em>to which this coverage applies, we will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">1. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the <em>insured </em>is legally liable ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">\u201cCoverage F \u2014 Medical Payments to Others</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">We will pay the necessary medical expenses that are incurred or medically ascertained within three years from the date of an accident causing <em>bodily injury. </em>...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The policy further states that Coverages E and F do not apply to bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d A \u201cbodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services and death that results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">We recognize that \u201cwhen construing the language of an insurance policy, it is appropriate \u2018to consider [whether] an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nashua Corp. </em>v. <em>First State Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 196, 200 (1995), quoting from <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990). We also acknowledge that \u201can insured is entitled to the most favorable interpretation of the policy language when there is more than one rational interpretation of the policy language, or where the policy language is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, however, those principles do not avail the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d as used in an insurance policy is a narrow and unambiguous term. It includes only actual physical injuries to the human body and the consequences thereof; it \u201cdoes not include humiliation and mental anguish and suffering.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>401 Mass. 654, 656, 658 (1988). \u201cBodily injury imports harm arising from corporeal contact. In this connection \u2018bodily\u2019 refers to an organism of flesh and blood. It is not satisfied by anything short of physical, and is confined to that kind of injury.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>228 Mass. 191, 196 (1917). The words \u201cbodily injury\u201d in an insurance policy do not comprehend nonphysical harm to the person, such as mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>suffering not connected with or arising out of physical injuries. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>401 Mass, at 656-658. Those words \u201cexclude the coverage of mental pain.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>414 Mass. 129, 138 n.9 (1993). In short, \u201cemotional distress is not a bodily injury\u201d for insurance coverage purposes. <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>420 Mass. 587, 590 (1995) (no second \u201cper person\u201d bodily injury claim for plaintiff who witnessed decedent daughter\u2019s injuries at automobile accident scene and as a result suffered emotional distress that exacerbated his diabetic condition and led to his developing an ulcer).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Compare <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>261 Mass. 183, 187-188 (1927) (mental suffering of plaintiff injured by defect in road could properly be considered in determining his damages award).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Superior Court judge, therefore, properly allowed Liberty\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because the plaintiff did not suffer a \u201cbodily injury\u201d within the meaning of the Liberty policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The policy provided coverage for \u201coccurrences\u201d only when they caused \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage.\u201d See <em>infra </em>at 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Subject to their rights to appellate review, the parties agreed that Liberty would pay the plaintiff an additional $100,000 if the Superior Court determined that further coverage existed under the policy; if the court determined that no such coverage was available, however, Liberty would make no additional payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b726-7\">See <em>Burney </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>169 Mass. 57 (1897); <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>327 Mass. 275 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The plaintiff is, of course, content with the judge\u2019s determination (which Liberty does not contest) that two distinct occurrences arose on the day of the incident.

There is no merit to Liberty\u2019s contention. See <em>Basch &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>392 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1984); 10A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2720, at 327-335 (3d ed. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Our appellate courts have thus far inferred intent to injure as matter of law in only three situations: setting fire to a building, <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Krasnigor, </em>404 Mass. 682, 687-688 (1989); sexual abuse of a minor, <em>Worcester Ins.
