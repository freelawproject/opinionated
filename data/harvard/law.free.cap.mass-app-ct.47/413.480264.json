The question on this appeal is whether the judge erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction due to the failure of the plaintiff to comply with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 3C, which is set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the action should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The accident occurred on January 26, 1994, and the complaint was filed on December 30, 1996. Although the plaintiff served the registrar of motor vehicles on January 10, 1997, he did not give the defendants notice as provided in either paragraphs one or two of \u00a7 3C. He neither mailed the defendants notice of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>having served the registrar nor did he have the defendants served by a public officer. Instead, on March 27, 1997, a legal-assistant in the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s office wrote a letter to Arthur Venditelli\u2019s insurer, Peerless Insurance Company, informing that an action had been filed and that service had been made on the registrar on behalf of the Venditellis pursuant to c. 90, \u00a7 3A. Previously, on July 8, 1994, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had notified the insurer that he represented the plaintiff in a claim for personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On April 15, 1997, the defendants, arguing that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction because the plaintiff had failed to comply with \u00a7 3C, filed a motion to dismiss. The plaintiff, claiming \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Mass.R.Civ.P. 6(b), 365 Mass. 747 (1974), and pointing out that the ninety-day time limit of Mass.R.Civ.P. 4(j),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as amended, 402 Mass. 1401 (1988), had only expired on March 31, 1997, countered with a motion to enlarge time in which to perfect service of process. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit of counsel stating that counsel had been ill between March 12 and March 25, 1997. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion, finding excusable neglect on the part of counsel, and noted that because the defendant\u2019s insurer received actual notice of the action approximately ninety days after the action had been brought, the defendants were not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The defendants sought relief from a single justice of this court and an interlocutory appeal was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In upholding the Massachusetts statute providing for service on nonresidents, the Supreme Court in <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Pawloski, </em>274 U.S. 352, 356 (1927), noted that c. 90 requires that the nonresident \u201cshall actually receive and receipt for notice of the service and a copy of the process.\u201d While the statute was amended by St. 1937, c. 387, to provide that the defendant\u2019s return receipt shall be filed only \u201cif received by the plaintiff,\u201d both proper and \u201cforthwith\u201d notice to the defendant continue to be critical requirements under our cases. The plaintiff has satisfied neither. Nor has he shown that the failure to receive notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>was due to the acts of the defendants as in <em>Crete </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>353 Mass. 725, 730 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">We need not decide whether actual notice would relieve the plaintiff from complying with the statute, although that proposition is most doubtful since the giving of the statutory notice is a \u201cmatter of substance essential to personal jurisdiction of the defendant.\u201d <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Spehr, </em>358 Mass. 658, 662 (1971).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Fades, </em>342 Mass. 194, 200 (1961). See <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>273 F.2d 265, 268 (10th Cir. 1959) (construing Kansas law).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In any event, the evidence of actual \u201cforthwith\u201d notice is weak. Unlike <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>278 Mass. 432, 436 (1932), where the deviation from the statute, if any (service by a deputy sheriff instead of notice by registered mail), provided the defendant with \u201can indubitable and actual notice of the proceedings with every opportunity to protect his rights,\u201d in this case there is a far cry from such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The only basis relied on by the plaintiff to prove notice to the defendant is that the defendant\u2019s insurer had knowledge of the claim against its insured in July, 1994, and also received notice of the action on March 27, 1997. There is no indication in the record that the insurer informed the defendants, let alone of what it informed them or when. Its interest may not have coincided with those of the insured. Moreover, the letter to the insurer, which was mailed more than two and one-half months after service on the registrar, was itself not sent \u201cforthwith.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letters to the insurer did not serve as a valid substitute for service on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">We turn- next to the propriety of the extension given by the judge, purportedly under Mass.R.Civ.P. 6(b). Passing the dubious excuse of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to show excusable neglect \u2014 a fourteen-day sickness in March, a period long after any period of time which could be considered \u201cforthwith\u201d \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>judge was without discretionary power to issue an order of notice under rule 6(b). In <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>342 Mass, at 199, the court viewed \u00a7 3C as providing \u201cthe exclusive procedure for notice,\u201d and held that G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 84, which gives discretionary power to a judge to allow the service of new process where there is insufficient service of process, could not be used where another statute, that is \u00a7 3C, sets forth an exclusive procedure for giving notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement could not be avoided by resort to \u00a7 84. The Legislative purpose of the \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cto secure, as nearly as may be, to a non-resident defendant against whom jurisdiction is attempted under the statute, the same opportunity to defend before trial that he would have if personal service had been made upon him in this State. Opportunity to defend includes timely notice, in order that the testimony of witnesses, which by delay might be lost, may be obtained. The contents of the notice and the time of transmission are matters of substance affecting the validity of the process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Nickerson, supra </em>at 199-200, quoting from <em>Webb Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>39 Del. 22, 29-30 (Super. Ct. 1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Spehr, </em>.358 Mass, at 659, the plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to rely on another statute, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, to extend the time for service. The plaintiffs\u2019 action had been discontinued because no notice had been sent \u201cforthwith\u201d to the defendant by registered mail, as required by \u00a7 3C. They sought to invoke G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32, a statute that permits an action dismissed \u201cfor any matter of form\u201d to be brought again within a year after the dismissal. See <em>id. </em>at 659 n.l. The court held that timely notice was a matter of substance and not a matter of form and that \u00a7 3C requires \u201ca reasonable and <em>substantially immediate </em>attempt to give the defendant by registered mail actual notice of the litigation ... to afford the nonresident timely opportunity to defend ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 661-662. Permitting the plaintiff to obtain personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 3C on a nonresident defendant \u201cis a privilege which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>must be carefully exercised in the manner specified in \u00a7\u00a7 3A-3C. These sections are designed to ensure full compliance with the requirements of due process, and particularly to give the nonresident defendant reasonable and timely notice of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663-664. Thus, the action which had been discontinued because of a failure to send the registered mail notice \u201cforthwith\u201d was not abated \u201cfor any matter of form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664. A new action could not be brought under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Similarly here, the judge did not have discretion under rule 6(b) to avoid the \u201cforthwith\u201d requirement in \u00a7 3C, as that statute provides the exclusive method for giving notice and obtaining personal jurisdiction on nonresident defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Accordingly, the order allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion to enlarge the time for service of process is vacated, and an order dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action shall be entered on the docket of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 3C, as amended by St. 1980, c. 572, \u00a7 33, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201cService of process under section three A or three B shall be made by leaving a copy of the process ... in the hands of the registrar, or in his office, and by giving the defendant notice in either the manner provided in paragraph (1) or in that provided in paragraph (2) hereof, and such service shall be sufficient service upon a defendant who has under either of said sections appointed the registrar or his successor his true and lawful attorney therefor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">\u201c(1) If the defendant is known by the plaintiff to be the holder of a motor vehicle registration or operator\u2019s license issued by another state or country, notice of such service upon the registrar as attorney for the defendant and a copy of the process shall <em>forthwith </em>be sent by registered mail, with return receipt requested, by the plaintiff to the defendant at his address of record in the office from which such registration or license was issued. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of compliance herewith, and the defendant\u2019s return receipt, if received by the plaintiff, shall be filed in the case on or before the return day of the process or within such further time as the court may allow. If the defendant has no motor vehicle registration or license known to the plaintiff, such notice and copy shall be sent in the same manner to the last address of the defendant known to the plaintiff, and affidavit of compliance herewith, and the defendant\u2019s return receipt or other proof of actual notice, shall be filed in the case within the time above provided. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-10\">\u201c(2) Notice of such service upon the registrar and a copy of the process shall be served upon the defendant, if found within the commonwealth, by a sheriff or deputy sheriff of any county of this commonwealth, or, if found without the commonwealth, by any duly constituted public officer qualified to serve like process in-the state or jurisdiction where the defendant is found, and the officer\u2019s return showing such service to have been made shall be filed in the case on or before the return day of the process or within such further time as the court may allow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">\u201c(3) The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Rule 4(j) provides that if service has not been made within ninety days after filing of the complaint and no good cause'for such failure has been shown, the court upon its own initiative shall dismiss the action without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Although <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Spehr, </em>358 Mass, at 661, suggested that the decision in <em>Hardy </em>v. Green, 277 F. Supp. 958, 961-962 (D. Mass. 1967), held the notice sufficient even though it did not comply precisely with the statutory requirements \u201cbecause the defendants had actual knowledge of the pendency of the case seasonably,\u201d the <em>Hardy </em>case can also be read as holding that the omission was of little consequence, as the notice given was adequate and complied substantially with the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\">The July, 1994 letter that a claim was being made was not the statutory notice \u201cany more than <em>it could be </em>said that the <em>fact </em>that the accident occurred was sufficient notice of the action.\u201d <em>Heinert </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>319 F.
