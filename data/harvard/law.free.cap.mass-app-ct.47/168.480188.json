Rose and Hazard both contend that the judge\u2019s instructions on malice and intoxication were faulty. Hazard contends that the cumulative effect of the claimed errors created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\"><em>Commonwealth\u2019s case.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>April 15, 1994, about 3 p.m., four men \u2014 Scott Rose and Richard Hazard (defendants) and two others, Michael Reaves and Michael Coull \u2014 came to Magnet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Park (outside the United Front housing project in New Bedford) in Rose\u2019s gray Lincoln Town Car. Hazard came up to Joseph Correia, eighteen years old, and asked if he had any dope (meaning heroin) for sale. Correia and Hazard then walked toward Hazard\u2019s companions \u2014 Rose, Reaves, and Coull \u2014 who were waiting near the Lincoln car. Correia\u2019s friends, Michael Santos and Shane and Landon Amum, were nearby. Reaves drew out $80 or so and asked for the drags. Correia grabbed the money and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t sell no drugs out here. Leave.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reaves turned to Landon Amum, whom he knew, and asked Landon to tell Correia and his friends, \u201cI ain\u2019t no punk. I\u2019m from the old school.\u201d Then he asked for his money. Santos urged Correia, \u201cJust give him the money back. It\u2019s his first time coming here. He didn\u2019t know there was no drags here.\u201d Correia handed the money to Reaves and said, \u201cAll right. You got your money. Just leave. Now you know there ain\u2019t no drags here.\u201d Reaves said, \u201cIf you want to rob me, do it right,\u201d and pulled more cash out of his pocket and started waving it about, and began taunting Correia, walking toward him, repeating, \u201cCome on, do it right.\u201d Correia was backing away.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Shane Amum stepped in, saying there was no problem, and Reaves should leave. Soon Reaves and Shane began arguing. In the midst of it, Shane threw a punch. It hit Reaves in the jaw and knocked him senseless to the ground. Rose picked Reaves up and commenced carrying him to the car. Correia testified he heard Rose say, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d Rose put Reaves in the back seat, and the other three got into the car (Rose to drive). One of them, presumably Rose, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back to spray it up.\u201d One said, \u201cWho got the strap [street lingo for a handgun]?\u201d As the car drove off, there was a collective yell, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back. We\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Two hours later, about five o\u2019clock, the four appeared at a house in Taunton that Patricia Chaney shared with William Watson. Chaney and Watson knew Rose well. In front of his companions and Chaney, Rose said to Watson, \u201cI need a favor from you.\u201d Rose and Watson entered the parlor alone and, Watson testified, Rose said, \u201cI need one of your guns, man, all my friends are packing and I need one of your weapons. I don\u2019t got one.\u201d Rose also told Watson that one of his friends got beat up pretty badly and he wanted to take care of the people who beat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>up his friend. And, \u201cI need one of your weapons to go straighten out a situation that one of my boys got themselves into earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Watson said he opened his gun cabinet and drew out a Winchester twelve-gauge pneumatic pump shotgun that held six shells.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hazard entered the parlor and asked whether the gun was twelve-gauge; he knew how to load that, he had handled twelve-gauge shotguns before. Hazard said he probably had shells to fit the gun. Watson handed the gun and some green shells to Rose. The men put the gun and a broom in a trash bag<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and drove off in the Lincoln, Rose driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">About seven that evening, Joseph Correia was in Magnet Park with his brother Daniel, fourteen years old, and other friends. It was still light outdoors. The brothers were leaning on a white car, talking. Joseph Correia testified he heard tires screeching and looking up saw the Lincoln driving past on Middle Street. The driver\u2019s side faced toward him. He saw a big pistol coming out of the rear driver\u2019s side window, heard shots, and saw flashes from both driver\u2019s side windows. He saw Rose, the driver, leaning back in his seat as he drove. Joseph and Daniel started to run when they heard the shots. As they took off, Joseph was hit. He dived behind the white car, landing beside Daniel, and at the same time heard Daniel yell, \u201cI got hit. I got hit.\u201d Joseph had been struck in the leg, Daniel in the heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Steven Pina, a visitor to the project, was standing by his car parked on Cedar Street near the park when he saw the Lincoln drive up Middle Street swerving and making noise. The car slowed as it passed the park, and Pina saw a gun coming out of the back window. At first'it looked like someone showing the gun, then he heard shots from the car. Landon Arnum, who knew Reaves, said the shooter in the back of the Lincoln was Reaves. Pina said the driver leaned hard into the back of the seat, with only his left hand on the steering wheel; then Pina saw the barrel of a shotgun coming out the driver\u2019s window, across the driver\u2019s body. Santos testified he heard the screeching tires and gunshots, then saw the driver lean back and ejected shells going by the driver\u2019s face. Chevalier saw the front seat passenger, identified by him as Hazard, point a shotgun across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the driver, while the driver leaned back and \u201cscrunched down.\u201d Chevalier also saw a handgun being fired from the rear window.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Lacy Gomes, an emergency medical technician, heard the commotion from his apartment in the project. He saw the car screeching away and many people in the park picking themselves up from the ground, yelling, screaming, crying, hugging. Go-mes called the police and went downstairs. He saw Daniel Correia lying on the ground, without breath or pulse. As Gomes started mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR, an ambulance came and took the brothers to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. A bullet had entered Daniel\u2019s heart from front to back and downward through the right side, lodging near his kidney. He was dead at 7:55 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Meanwhile, the Lincoln sped toward Taunton on Route 140, followed by police. Andrea Comeau, in the same direction on Route 140, saw a dark object being thrown from the passenger rear window of the Lincoln. The car chase, which at times involved speeds over 100 m.p.h., ended in Taunton where the route narrows, as the car crashed into a police cruiser. Coull was thrown partway out of the car and hung unconscious from the left rear window. Hazard threw a shotgun from the front passenger window, then got out and ran. Officer Troy Madeiros blocked Hazard\u2019s path with his car, then followed on foot and tackled him. The shotgun was identified by Watson as the one borrowed from him that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Police later found in the area indicated by Comeau a nine millimeter handgun (two serial numbers obliterated) and next to it a fifteen-round magazine containing three live rounds. Near the Lincoln, police found the shotgun with two live rounds. On the driver\u2019s front floor was a green spent shotgun shell; on the floor near the front passenger\u2019s seat, a knife in a sheath, and a used red shotgun shell. Three used nine millimeter cartridge casings were taken, one from the rear seat, one from the rear seat floor, another from the space between the front passenger seat and door. A police chemist found (consistent with firearms\u2019 discharge) traces of lead residue on the dashboard, steering column, window base, and armrest on the driver\u2019s door, and the driver\u2019s side rear door.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Daniel Correia had been shot with the nine millimeter gun thrown from the Lincoln in the Comeau-indicated area during the chase. The three spent cartridges had been fired from the discarded gun. The two spent shotgun shells (one red, one green) found in the Lincoln had been fired from the shotgun thrown from the car at the end of the chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The Correia boys were the only persons shot in the escapade. Bullets from the nine millimeter gun struck a parked car of Christie Reberio; two shotgun pellets lodged in the third-floor walls of 343 Middle Street (part of the project), and there were bullet holes in the door of that house. A window frame of an apartment at 341 Middle Street held one bullet (it could have come from the nine millimeter).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Defense case. </em>Debra Cordeiro, Hazard\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, testified that about 1 p.m. that day she dropped Hazard off at a bar in Taunton and forty-five minutes later saw him outside the bar drinking malt liquor with Coull and Reaves. Between 5:30 and 6 p.m. the four men came to her apartment: \u201c[Tjhey were all drunk, as far as I was concerned\u201d but \u201cnot staggering, not falling down.\u201d Hazard stayed, the others left. Five minutes later, Rose returned, asked to speak with Hazard who had been on the bed, shirtless, watching television. After talking to Rose, Hazard dressed and left with Rose.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The defendants called John Burgos, HI, an eight year old at the time of trial. On some day in April, 1994, the witness said, he heard gunfire near Magnet Park, and five to ten minutes later he saw three men walking in the park carrying a gun pouch. Officer Debra Binning testified Burgos told her he heard shots on April 15 and saw three men running through the woods, one carrying a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The defense called investigating officers as witnesses to impeach Landon Amum, Joseph Correia, and William Watson by statements these men originally gave the police inconsistent in particulars with their testimony for the prosecution at trial. In cross-examination of Commonwealth witnesses to the drive-by shooting, the defense had tried to show contradictions in their stories.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">1. <em>Joint venture. </em>Hazard, arriving with the others in the Lincoln, participated in the first scene at Magnet Park \u2014 indeed initiated it by asking Joseph Correia whether he had dope for sale. He witnessed the altercation that left Reaves on the ground. He heard and probably joined vocally with the others in the promises to return, meaning a return to save face and to inflict more than equal damage and to achieve retribution or revenge. Within short hours thereafter Hazard is found with his companions on a visit to Watson, who in Hazard\u2019s presence is solicited to provide a weapon for Rose; the precise use to which the lethal equipment will be put is plain enough, and Hazard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>indicates he knows how to work the shotgun that is supplied, and probably has available shells to fit. Again within a couple of hours the four men, joining with a single object in mind and enough armament to carry it out, enter the Lincoln automobile. Hazard is in the front passenger seat. The car reaches the designated turf and lays on speed and confusion of movement and the men commence the \u201cspray\u201d earlier foretold. Hazard is an actor in the shootout \u2014 probably, as in Chevalier\u2019s testimony, he shot across Rose, the driver, as Rose drew back to allow the maneuver. Hazard discards the shotgun in his hands as the police close in, and it is possibly his own red shells that are found in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We have here the classic pattern of a joint criminal venture for which the participants are all responsible even if they contribute individually to the criminal goal in different or unequal ways. The judge was right to deny defense motions at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the end for required findings of not guilty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For Hazard \u201cwas (1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass. 771, 779 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>402 Mass. 482, 486 (1988). The Commonwealth had to show that Hazard shared with the others the mental state required to encompass the crime of murder, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pucillo, </em>427 Mass. 108, 112 (1998), and here the jury could well \u201cinfer the requisite mental state from the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances and subsequent participation in the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). If Hazard himself intentionally fired a gun in the direction of other persons, as evidently he could be found to have done, malice aforethought on his part could readily be inferred (the so-called third prong of malice), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>423 Mass. 288, 290 (1996), but so could it be inferred from his presence in the car and his earlier participation in the criminal enterprise, even though the intentional shooting was done by his companions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>427, 435 (1993). Hazard argues that the proof against him fails because there was no evidence that he knew Reaves had, and planned to use, the nine millimeter gun that killed Daniel Correia, but such particularized knowledge or complicity is not needed to base joint-venture liability: it is enough that Hazard could expect, and acquiesced in, behavior of that type from any of the companions. The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>420 Mass, at 779, cited by Hazard, is not to the contrary; the evidence there suggested that the defendant acted alone; there was no principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">2. <em>Rose\u2019s extrajudicial statements. </em>Hazard argues essentially that Rose\u2019s statements to Watson should have been excluded under the familiar <em>Bruton </em>principle, see <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 135-136 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>416 Mass. 55, 58 (1993) \u2014 the matter was so serious that the trial should have been severed to begin with, as Hazard argued unsuccessfully pretrial. We shall assume, though the point is debatable, that Rose\u2019s statements so powerfully implicated Hazard as to raise the <em>Bruton </em>question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 298 (1999). <em>Bruton </em>is altogether irrelevant if the existence of a joint venture is sufficiently established by other admissible evidence, and the statements are made in the pendency of the venture and in furtherance of its goal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 340 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nascimento, </em>421 Mass. 677, 680-681 (1996). Whether these predicates existed should have been submitted to the jury under a proper instruction, but counsel did not adequately raise the point.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We think, however, that the omission did not threaten a serious defect in the conviction because the venture was, in our judgment, already underway at the time, and thus the jury could properly consider evidence of the statements, like admissible evidence generally, for what it might be worth. Going even to the end of the line and granting for purposes of argument that the evidence was inadmissible because uttered before the venture was fairly started, we think ' the assumed error of admitting it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the substance of the whole case, and would not have contributed to vitiating the verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 872 (1987). There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>enough to convict Hazard (and Rose as well) if, disregarding most of what happened earlier, we look at the four men as they enter the Lincoln, with equipment, headed for the drive-by shooting at Magnet Park. To convict for participation in this joint venture, the Commonwealth need not have proved an \u201canticipatory compact\u201d \u2014 it was enough that the men acted together with consciousness of the criminal goal at the moment of their setting forth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 513 (1997).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">3. <em>Instructions on malice. </em>After remarking that \u201cmalice\u201d in ordinary speech <em>differed in </em>meaning from malice in a legal context, the judge in his main charge and response to jury questions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> defined malice in terms of the three \u201cprongs\u201d of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.l (1987), and accurately represented the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. The court suggested in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995), that judges should charge in <em>Grey </em>terms \u201cwith such additional explanations as may be appropriate to the understanding of those concepts.\u201d Besides his introduction, the judge added to <em>Grey </em>a reference to \u201ckilling of a human being without justification or excuse.\u201d Both defendants argue that this shifted the burden improperly, but in the light of the basic charge assigning the burden we think the criticism is overdrawn, and the wording indeed not unhelpful. Further, the defendants single out the judge\u2019s statement that malice \u201cincludes\u201d the three prongs and suggest that the jury would then consider themselves free perhaps to invent and find the facts to support a prong of their own. We think this highly unlikely; the judge made it clear that the Commonwealth must prove one or another of the three distinct propositions. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>417 Mass. 592, 597-598 (1994), the judge\u2019s instructions upheld by the court were substantially as in the present case with the phrase \u201cmalice aforethought includes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">4. <em>On intoxication. </em>There was some evidence through Debra Cordeiro\u2019s testimony that the defendants may have been drunk at the time of the drive-by. The defendants sought instructions on how the jury could use this evidence in relation to intent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>premeditation. Although conceding that parts of the judge\u2019s charge were sound, they now argue other remarks were confusing or incorrect. The jury were told that the actor\u2019s intoxication could not serve as a justification or excuse for a killing, but it could bear on whether the Commonwealth had proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt: if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s use of alcohol made him incapable of forming malice aforethought, of acting with malice aforethought, you may not find him guilty of murder.\u201d The judge also said the level of intoxication \u201cmust be substantial\u201d before it could negate the defendant\u2019s \u201ccapacity to form the intent necessary for murder.\u201d We do not agree that these instructions would induce the jury to disregard evidence of intoxication in considering the issue of intent. On the contrary, the instructions were compatible with the jury\u2019s job to \u201cconsider credible evidence of the effects of the defendant\u2019s consumption of drugs [or alcohol] in deciding whether the Commonwealth had met its burden of proving the defendant\u2019s state of mind beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 300 (1992). (The remark that the level of intoxication must be substantial, etc., was not a happy one, but it may pass, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>423 Mass. 880, 882 [1996].)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The judge said, \u201cIf you find, not that they were just drunk but if they were so drunk that they could not form an intelligent intent to join in the criminal enterprise, of course, then you should find them not guilty.\u201d The defendants object that this \u201cfinding\u201d language improperly laid a burden on them. In truth there is no burden of proof on either side regarding intoxication, rather, intoxication is a subsidiary factor in the evaluation of whether the Commonwealth has proved a requisite state of mind beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>422 Mass. 792, 805 (1996). \u201cFinding\u201d language has thus been disfavored, but it has not called for stronger measures where, as here, the instructions have demanded proof of each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>ibid. </em>The misprision, in any event, \u201cis not as prejudicial as is parallel finding language in the case of \u2018complete, malice-negating defenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purcell, </em>423 Mass, at 882, quoting from <em>Waite, supra. </em>The defendants, we may add, did not object at the time to the instructions about intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The defendants Rose and Hazard stood trial on indictments charging them with murder, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, firearms charges (possession of firearms without a license, possession of a shotgun without identification card, possession of a firearm with removed serial number, and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling). Rose was indicted in addition for failing to stop for a police officer and operating a motor vehicle to endanger.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for required findings of not guilty of possession of a firearm with removed serial number. The defendants were found guilty of all the other crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The judge sentenced the defendants to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, to a concurrent from three to five year term for unlawful possession of a firearm, and to a from three to five year term, from and after the murder sentence, for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.
