Westgate walked up behind Mrs. Labens, grabbed the purse strap, and attempted to slide it off her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>arm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Labens caught the strap in her hand and a brief struggle ensued, during which Westgate pushed or pulled her to the pavement, seriously injuring her knee. She continued to hold on, and he freed the purse only after pulling her along the ground.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Labens underwent surgery the next day to repair her dislocated kneecap. Blood clots developed as a complication of the surgery, which led to her death by coronary embolism six days after the purse snatching. The defendant, charged with unarmed robbery of a person age sixty-five years or older and involuntary manslaughter, was tried as a joint venturer and convicted on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The defendant does not appeal from his conviction of unarmed robbery. As to the involuntary manslaughter conviction, the defendant makes two arguments: (1) that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof was insufficient as to one element of the crime, namely that the purse snatching \u201cwas undertaken with knowledge of facts that would cause a reasonable person to know that a danger of serious harm existed,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 302 (1992); and (2) that the manslaughter indictment was submitted to the jury on two theories of liability, one of which was inapplicable to the evidence, so that, because it is impossible to know on which theory the jury acted in reaching its general verdict, the conviction cannot stand. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>422 Mass. 634, 635 (1996), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">1. We reject the first argument, which is predicated on a statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 651 (1982), that \u201c[u]narmed robbery is not inherently dangerous to human life. Purse snatching can be robbery, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>362 Mass. 83, 89 (1972), but it need not be dangerous to life.\u201d The <em>Moran </em>case concerned felony-murder. The point being made was that a robbery, if the perpetrator is unarmed, does not by its nature pose a substantial risk to life; so that, in order to sustain a charge of felony-murder, the Commonwealth would have to prove that special circumstances of which the perpetrator knew or should have known did in fact pose a serious risk to life that the perpetrator chose to disregard. <em>Ibid. </em>This case involves not felony-murder, but involuntary manslaughter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>which only requires \u201ca high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass. 779, 789 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 399 (1944). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass, at 304 n.14. That test was met. Any robbery from the person, with the possible exception <em>of </em>pickpocketing, involves a substantial likelihood that the victim will resist and that a struggle may ensue. Where the victim is elderly, years removed from the rough and tumble of the playground and contact sports, and with the impaired resilience of bone and sureness of balance that age entails, any resistance will lead predictably to falls and a high likelihood of injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is a matter of common experience, that any fall of an elderly person \u2014 particularly a rough fall on a hard surface, as here \u2014 is a source of serious concern, as are the anxiety of the occasion and the exertion of resistance, which pose dangers to the elderly that might not be expected in younger victims. A robber who subjects an elderly victim to a highly predictable risk of serious injury cannot escape responsibility merely because he hoped that the victim would docilely yield up a purse or wallet without resisting. It is immaterial that the defendant and Westgate might not have anticipated the danger. The legal test is the danger that a reasonably prudent person would apprehend. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, 427 </em>Mass. 100, 104, 106 (1998). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenner, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 763, 773-774 (1987) (victim\u2019s flight, and injuries therefrom, foreseeable), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 362-363 (1983), and <em>id. </em>at 374-375 (Liacos, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">2. Picking up on a suggestion made in the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>brief, the defendant in his reply brief makes an argument not raised earlier either in this court or below: namely, that the judge, who instructed the jury on both the wanton and reckless aspect of involuntary manslaughter and on the battery-causing-death aspect of that crime, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass, at 789, erred because the battery-causing-death aspect of involuntary manslaughter is inapplicable where the battery occurs, as it did here, in the commission of a felony (i.e., unarmed robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument is predicated on decisions since <em>Catalina </em>that both parties read as having held that the non-felonious character of the defendant\u2019s underlying crime is, in effect, an element of battery-manslaughter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On its face the defendant\u2019s contention seems counterintuitive: that he can, in effect, defend against manslaughter liability for the unexpected death of Lucille Labens on the basis that his crime against her was felonious rather than merely unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Under the law prior to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matchett, </em>386 Mass. 492 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, supra, </em>the general rule was that an unintended death caused by the commission of a crime malum in se was murder if the crime was a felony and manslaughter if the crime was a misdemeanor only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>352 Mass. 387, 397-399 (1967) (headlock that strangled victim, if done with intent simply to quiet her down, was a simple battery, and the death manslaughter; but if done with intent to rape her, was felonious, and the death was murder). The <em>Matchett </em>decision narrowed the application of felony-murder by requiring the Commonwealth to prove that the felony that caused the unexpected death was by its nature one that threatened grievous injury \u2014 armed robbery, for example \u2014 or, alternatively, that the manner of its commission showed a \u201cconscious disregard of the risk to human life.\u201d 386 Mass, at 507-508. The <em>Catalina </em>decision narrowed the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tion of unlawful act-manslaughter to deaths that occur as a result of (1) a battery that (2) \u201cis done with such violence that [physical] harm [is] likely to result.\u201d 407 Mass, at 784 n.6, 789, incorporating by reference the judge\u2019s charge to the jury in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>404 Mass. 774, <em>777 </em>(1989). After <em>Matchett </em>and <em>Catalina, </em>therefore, felony-murder and battery-manslaughter could be differentiated according to the inherent danger posed by the defendant\u2019s conduct. The danger necessary for battery-manslaughter, restated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 394 (1992), as \u201ca high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another\u201d (quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass, at 399), \u201cexpresses a level of risk of physical harm below those levels that must be shown for \u00e1 conviction of murder in the first degree (a) on the theory of felony-murder <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matchett, [supra </em>at 508]) (\u2018conscious disregard of the risk to human life\u2019) and (b) on the basis of third-prong malice <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, [supra </em>at 303]) (\u2018plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the act\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">If, as appears to be true, the perceptible degree of danger posed by the defendant\u2019s conduct marks the dividing line between murder liability and manslaughter liability for unintended deaths occurring in the commission of another underlying crime, the earlier felony-misdemeanor dividing line no longer serves a purpose if it refers to the legal status of the underlying crime. Indeed, its retention would create a legal no man\u2019s land in a case such as this where the underlying crime \u2014 unarmed robbery \u2014 is a felony but the defendant\u2019s conduct poses a foreseeable risk of physical injury only, not death; and a factor \u2014 the felonious nature of the defendant\u2019s conviction \u2014 that operated under the earlier law as one of aggravation would become one of exoneration from any legal responsibility for the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The cases since the <em>Matchett </em>and <em>Catalina </em>decisions that have referred to felonious and non-felonious batteries<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> have all done so, not in relation to an underlying crime, but in relation to the battery itself. Batteries by the use of a gun or a knife have typically been classified as felonious batteries, while those involving punches or other weaponless violence are non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>felonious batteries, subject to the qualification that, if carried on with such violence that the threat to life is obvious, even a simple battery can be a basis for murder. Under this interpretation of the cases, there is no reason why the law should not treat as manslaughter an unintended death caused during the commission of a felony by a non-felonious battery, at least in the range of felonies that are not deemed inherently hazardous to life. Contrast armed robbery and armed assault, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevenal, </em>401 Mass. 225, 230 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Padgett, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 367 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">If this reading of the <em>post-Catalina </em>decision is incorrect, and it was error to charge the jury on battery-manslaughter, nevertheless any error was harmless. Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>involuntary manslaughter has two aspects: a battery aspect, and a wanton, reckless behavior aspect. The battery aspect requires the Commonwealth to prove that the battery was done \u201cwith such violence that [physical] harm is likely to result [to the victim].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>404 Mass, at <em>777, </em>discussed in <em>Catalina, supra </em>at 784 nn. 5 &amp; 6. That degree of culpability was differentiated, at least verbally, from the degree of culpability required for the wanton and reckless aspect of involuntary manslaughter, see <em>id. </em>at 784 n.5, which was stated, in the words of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass, at 399, as \u201ca high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u201d See <em>Catalina, supra </em>at 789. Any differentiation disappeared with the subsequent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass, at 394, which amended the formulation of <em>Catalina </em>and <em>Sheppard, </em>see <em>Sneed, supra </em>at 394 n.5, such that, henceforth, the <em>Welansky </em>test of culpability would apply as well under the battery aspect of involuntary manslaughter. \u201cThus the same standard of proof is applicable to both types of involuntary manslaughter . . . .\u201d <em>Sneed, supra </em>at 394. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>In a charge more favorable to the defendant than was required, the judge in this case instructed the jury that a battery, for purposes of involuntary manslaughter, \u201coccurs when the [perpetrator] is aware or should be aware that the battery he is committing endangers human life.\u201d Thus, even if the jury conceived of its verdict as battery-manslaughter, it necessarily found the elements of wanton, reckless manslaughter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the wanton, reckless aspect of involuntary manslaughter, the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>battery was in aid of a felony rather than a misdemeanor is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The defendant suggested the snatch, and Westgate agreed to do the act when the defendant promised to do the next one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The defendant and Westgate then fled, went to the defendant\u2019s residence, divided up the cash, and threw the purse into a dumpster.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">There was ample evidence from which the jury could properly infer that, before Westgate actually knocked the victim down, the joint venturers must have been aware that the victim was an elderly person. First, the incident began when they observed Mrs. Labens from across the street and discussed which one would grab the purse. Second, although Westgate approached her from behind, it is a matter of common experience that one can get a sense of a person\u2019s age even from such a vantage point \u2014 particularly here, where Westgate walked rather than ran up behind her, giving him ample time to observe her,, and where he came up directly adjacent to her, within arm\u2019s reach. Third, the jury could infer that, in his initial struggle with her and before he knocked her down, Westgate observed the victim and knew she was an older person, yet chose to disregard that fact in his pursuit of her property. (There was testimony from a good Samaritan who happened by after the incident that the victim was elderly in appearance. A photograph of the victim was also put in evidence.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The cases cited are <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass, at 302 n.10; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>422 Mass. 349, 353 (1996); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>427 Mass, at 104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The rule was applied with limitations. \u201cWe [i.e., the Supreme Judicial Court] require, for example, that a homicide committed in the course of a felony or attempted felony, be the natural and probable consequence of the act.
