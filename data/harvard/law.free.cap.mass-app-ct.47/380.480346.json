Tarpey, a vigorous woman until her last illness, died in November, 1990, at age 72. When hospitalized, Tarpey was diagnosed with hypercalcemia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and elevated levels of vitamin D in her blood stream. She was placed on prednisone therapy which allegedly compromised her immune system and led ultimately to her death from pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Her executor, the plaintiff, brought suit in July, 1991, against Crescent Ridge Dairy, Inc. (Crescent Ridge), which produced and distributed dairy products including milk, and various other parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Crescent Ridge fortified its milk with vitamin D concentrate, but during the relevant period (1990) it did so with up to five hundred times the amount of vitamin D allowed by law. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 541.002 (1986). The plaintiff claimed that Tarpey usually drank two or three full glasses of Crescent Ridge milk daily, and her ingestion of large amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of vitamin D in the Crescent Ridge milk was the cause of her hypercalcemia which, as we have said, allegedly led to her death. The expert for Crescent Ridge, on the other hand, testified that Tarpey\u2019s death was related to factors other than her consumption of Crescent Ridge milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">In response to special questions, the jury found that Crescent Ridge had breached the warranties of fitness and merchantability, that it was negligent in its addition of vitamin D to its milk, but not grossly negligent, that Robert Parrish, the president of Crescent Ridge, individually was negligent, and that such negligence amounted to gross negligence, and that Crescent Ridge and Robert Parrish had caused Tarpey\u2019s injuries but <em>not </em>her death. The jury awarded damages in the amount of $125,000 for Tarpey\u2019s injuries, and punitive damages in the amount of $150,000 against Robert Parrish, which was later vacated because of the absence of a finding that Parrish\u2019s conduct caused Tarpey\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On the c. 93A claims against Crescent Ridge and Robert Parrish (defendants), see note 4, <em>supra, </em>the judge assessed damages caused by the defendants\u2019 breaches of warranties of merchantability and fitness in the amount of $250,000 which, the judge particularly stated, \u201cincludes and is not in addition to the $125,000 awarded by the jury.\u201d Still later, the judge entered an order which stated that \u201c[t]he damages which I assessed . . . were <em>not </em>multiple damages. . . . The interest shall run on the sum of $250,000.\u201d The plaintiff also was awarded his costs, attorney\u2019s fees and their costs, expert witness fees, and interest on $250,000 from the date of the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Timely notices of appeal were filed by Crescent Ridge and Robert Parrish (as appellants regarding various issues arising under c. 93A and other procedural matters), and by the plaintiff (as cross-appellant regarding the admission in evidence, over his objections, of the opinion testimony of the defendants\u2019 expert, Andrew Rosenberg, M.D.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and regarding allegedly inconsistent verdicts), all as more particularly described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">We discuss first the plaintiff\u2019s claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">1. <em>The admission of Rosenberg\u2019s opinion testimony. </em>First, the qualifications of Rosenberg. Rosenberg is a board certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>pathologist employed by the pathology department of the Massachusetts General Hospital, an associate professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School, and the author of approximately one hundred articles in scientific journals. His specialty is anatomy pathology, which is the study of disease using human tissue. His particular field of interest is in the surgical pathology of diseases of the skeleton \u2014 a difficult field with few physicians having the necessary expertise. Rosenberg\u2019s credentials are not in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We summarize Rosenberg\u2019s testimony. There are various causes of hypercalcemia, the most common being cancer. Cancer causes hypercalcemia by destroying the bones which contain calcium which is then released into the bloodstream. The cancer produces a parathyroid hormone related protein known as PTHrP. PTHrP causes the skeleton to release calcium in the blood, and cancer cells which secrete PTHrP are the most common cause of hypercalcemia. The size of the tumor does not determine the amount of PTHrP produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Numerous tests had been conducted to determine whether Tarpey had cancer, but no cancerous growth was identified. Rosenberg was given the court\u2019s permission to review the slides of Tarpey\u2019s lung tissue which had been obtained in the autopsy and thereafter properly preserved. Rosenberg\u2019s examination of the slides revealed a type of cancer in Tarpey\u2019s lung tissue. Rosenberg gave this new information to Dr. Godleski, who had previously reviewed Tarpey\u2019s autopsy at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital where Tarpey was last treated. Godleski prepared twelve or fourteen slides of Tarpey\u2019s tumor and submitted them to Dr. Ronald A. DeLellis, a pathologist at the Tufts New England Medical Center, to test for the presence of PTHrP using polyclonal antibodies. This type of study, known as immunohistochemistry, is used by pathologists to determine whether a particular substance is present in tissue. It is not disputed that the use of antibodies to identify PTHrP molecules is a recognized and accepted technique within the field of immunohistochemistry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">After completing his PTHrP antibody tests, DeLellis\u2019s test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>slides were delivered to Rosenberg. Rosenberg is an expert in immunohistochemistry. He has worked with immunohistochemistry tests \u201cas much as probably anybody in the country.\u201d \u201e Rosenberg examined the slides and concluded that the immunohistochemistry test performed by DeLellis to identify the PTHrP molecule, using polyclonal antibodies, \u201cdid not work . . . everything, the tumor, and the lung, and everything else on the slide stained positively. And that\u2019s called non-specific staining . . . tissues on the slide that should not contain PTHrP were staining indicating there was false staining . . . therefore [it was] impossible to come to a conclusion regarding the results based on that slide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Of the slides sent to Rosenberg by DeLellis, six were unstained; they had not been subject to testing by DeLellis. Once Rosenberg was assured that these slides of Tarpey\u2019s lung tissue showed a tumor, he sent the slides to Dr. Leonard Deftos in California for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">At this point in Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s testimony, and prior to his expressing any opinion, the judge called for a voir dire.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The following is a summary of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Rosenberg had reviewed the \u201cmedical literature from the different laboratories in this country that have antibodies to PTHrP, [and found that] Dr. Deftos\u2019s lab used the most stringent criteria in his testing, and in his development of the antibodies. . . . [Rosenberg] wanted the best lab to work with the tissue and as far as [he] was able to determine [Deftos\u2019s laboratory] was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>best lab to do it.\u201d Deftos\u2019s laboratory generated monoclonal antibodies which \u201crecognized\u201d the PTHrP molecule and nothing else. However, these particular antibodies are not available at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and Rosenberg had decided to use the Deftos-developed antibodies and no other.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The slides went forward to Deftos. He performed the tests required to determine whether the tumor cells in Tarpey\u2019s tumor contained PTHrP, following which the stained slides were returned to Rosenberg. Rosenberg examined the test results \u2014 the stained slides \u2014 processed by Deftos\u2019s laboratory, and he determined that Tarpey\u2019s tumor cells were producing PTHrP. On cross-examination within the voir dire, the defendant established that the antibodies produced by Deftos were used only by his laboratory, and that Rosenberg had never before used the antibody developed by Deftos. The plaintiff did not make any inquiry regarding the difference, if any, between the <em>polyclonal </em>antibody used by DeLellis and the <em>monoclonal </em>antibody used by Deftos,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor regarding any of the other bases for objection raised in his motion in limine. Rosenberg\u2019s voir dire terminated at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Based on Rosenberg\u2019s voir dire testimony, the plaintiff argued that the conditions for admissibility imposed by <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531-532 (1986), had not been satisfied. That case holds that where an expert is basing his opinion on facts or data not admitted in evidence, those facts, or data, must be \u201cindependently admissible,\u201d and they must be \u201cof the sort that experts in that specialty reasonably rely on in forming their opinions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the defendant was offering the opinion testimony of Rosenberg based on the Deftos test results without producing Deftos or any of his staff involved in the test procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The judge concluded that the requirements of <em>A Juvenile </em>were satisfied, and Rosenberg would be permitted to express his opinion. The plaintiff\u2019s motion in limine was denied. Rosenberg thereupon testified in detail and at length, giving his opinion that the PTHrP secreted by Tarpey\u2019s lung tumor \u2014 not the vitamin D \u2014 was the likely cause of her hypercalcemia,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>that the actual causes of Tarpey\u2019s death were unrelated either to her high levels of vitamin D or to the prednisone therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On cross-examination, the plaintiff established that the antibody used by Deftos in his testing procedures was monoclonal, while the antibody used by DeLellis was polyclonal, and that Rosenberg did not know whether any other laboratory used monoclonal antibodies to test for PTHrP. On the basis of Rosenberg\u2019s testimony as just summarized, the plaintiff now argues that the Deftos test is neither \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d in the scientific community under the <em>Frye </em>test (applicable at the time of trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>346 Mass. 266 [1963], adopting <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 Fed. 1013 [Ct. App. D.C. 1923]), nor valid or reliable under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, 419 </em>Mass. 15 (1994). <em>Lanigan </em>was decided after the trial of this case; the decision is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The plaintiff acknowledges in his brief that the use of <em>poly-clonal </em>antibodies to test for the presence of PTHrP (as performed by DeLellis) was generally accepted in the scientific community, but he argues there was no evidence that the use of <em>monoclonal </em>antibodies to test for the presence of PTHrP (as performed by Deftos) was generally accepted in the scientific community. He further reasserts the other arguments in his motion in limine (see note 7, <em>supra). </em>Thus, the argument continues, the judge made a critical error in admitting Rosenberg\u2019s opinions \u2014 an error that so materially affected the outcome of the case that he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We disagree. We find that this case falls within \u201cthose cases which accept expert testimony based on personal observations, clinical experience, or generally accepted scientific techniques without application of the possibly more rigorous analysis set out in <em>[Frye/Lanigan\\ . . . </em>.\u201d <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>428 Mass. 1, 15 &amp; n.15 (1998) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The argument that the use of monoclonal antibodies for immunohistochemistry testing is outside the circle of general acceptance lacks an evidentiary foundation. In spite of ample opportunity to cross-examine Rosenberg, both during his voir dire and later before the jury, regarding the importance of any differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ence between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, the plaintiff made no such inquiry. The plaintiff called two expert rebuttal witnesses, Michael Horlick, M.D., and Leonard Gottlieb, M.D. Again, no inquiry was made of either expert regarding any important difference between monoclonal and poly-clonal antibodies in immunohistochemistry testing for PTHrP. There is simply nothing in the record before us which suggests that Deftos did anything more than improve the immunohistochemistry technique of testing for PTHrP, nor is there anything in the record which suggests that this modification in technique was based on a new scientific theory calling for evidence of general acceptability.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The plaintiff cannot rely only on unsupported assertions in his motion in limine and his brief to propose that the use of monoclonal antibodies to test for PTHrP is a new \u201cscientific theory\u201d requiring independent evidence of general acceptability. When, as in this case, the plaintiff has acknowledged the general acceptance of antibodies as acceptable vehicles for testing for PTHrP, it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to press the issue of whether the particular variation developed by Deftos is based on a new scientific theory requiring independent evidence of general acceptance. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 741 (1992) (less favorable standard of review where defendants neither sought voir dire nor objected to expert\u2019s testimony on basis of <em>Frye </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Even assuming that Deftos\u2019s substitution of monoclonal for polyclonal antibodies was a new scientific theory, we nevertheless conclude that the evidence offered by the defendant was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of <em>A Juvenile, </em>the decision upon which the judge correctly relied. There the court held that an expert is permitted to base an opinion on facts or data not in evidence \u201cif the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\u201d 398 Mass, at 531. This rule, wrote the court, will eliminate the need for producing exhibits and witnesses \u201cwhose sole function is to construct a proper foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>At the time of trial, the leading Massachusetts case regarding the admissibility of a new \u201cscientific theory\u201d was <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>346 Mass, at 269 (\u201cJudicial acceptance of a scientific theory or instrument can occur only when it follows a general acceptance by the community of scientists involved.\u201d). <em>Fatalo </em>relied on <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>293 Fed. 1013 (Ct. App. D.C. 1923), the leading Federal case, which involved the admissibility of the results of a polygraph test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Recent decisions have emphasized the underlying rationale of <em>Frye/Fatalo. </em>Two days after the jury announced its verdict in this case, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993). The \u201cbasic reasoning\u201d of the <em>Daubert </em>opinion has since been adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court \u201cbecause it is consistent with our test of <em>demonstrated </em>reliability\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass, at 26.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court in <em>Lanigan </em>reviewed the Massachusetts decisions regarding the admissibility of expert testimony based on scientific knowledge. Those decisions have focused on the <em>Frye </em>test: \u201cwhether the community of scientists involved generally accepts the theory or process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 222 (1991). The court pointed out, however, that <em>\u201c[t]he ultimate test ... is the reliability of the theory or process underlying the expert\u2019s testimony\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Ibid. </em>Continuing its discussion of <em>Frye, </em>the court wrote, \u201cPerhaps the relevant scientific community has not yet digested and approved the foundation of the theory or process, but the theory or process is <em>so logically reliable that evidence should be admitted even without its general acceptance by involved scientists\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the <em>Frye </em>test, seen retrospectively, could not, as of the time of the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>be taken as an inflexible rule of evidence even when applied to a new scientific theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As to the case at hand. The judge admitted Rosenberg\u2019s opinion testimony. Implicit in the judge\u2019s decision was his judgment, after considering the plaintiff\u2019s carefully prepared motion in limine, and after an extensive voir dire of Rosenberg\u2019s testimony, that the Deftos test results could .provide the basis of Rosenberg\u2019s opinion. Rosenberg\u2019s engagement of the Deftos laboratory was undertaken only after a careful search through the literature, and assurances that the Deftos laboratory \u201cused the most stringent criteria . . . [and] was the best lab\u201d to do the required immunohistochemistry test. Moreover, the plaintiff does not seriously argue that Rosenberg was not qualified to render an opinion interpreting the results of the Deftos, or similar, tests. The heart of the defendant\u2019s case, as we have said, was Rosenberg\u2019s expert opinion testimony. The plaintiff had already put on his expert in support of his theory of the case. Rosenberg\u2019s expertise was unusual. There are not many people in the world, Rosenberg testified, who specialize \u201cin the surgical pathology of diseases of the skeleton.\u201d He had worked in the field of immunohistochemistry \u201cas much as probably anybody in the country.\u201d There was ample justification for the judge\u2019s finding that Rosenberg\u2019s opinions, based on the Deftos test results, were plainly reliable if not entirely persuasive, and his ruling permitting the admission of Rosenberg\u2019s opinion testimony was not error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>422 Mass. 816, 842 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">2. <em>The allegedly inconsistent verdicts. </em>The plaintiff claims that the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 negligence did not result in Tarpey\u2019s death is inconsistent with their conclusion that the defendants\u2019 negligence caused Tarpey\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> More specifically, the argument is that, since the defendants were found liable for negligently causing Tarpey\u2019s injuries, that conclusion had to have been based upon her ingestion of Crescent Ridge milk with the grossly excessive vitamin D. Since there was <em>no </em>evidence, the argument runs, of any injury produced <em>solely </em>by vitamin D intoxication, the injuries Tarpey suffered could only have been caused by her hypercalcemia (the alleged product of the vitamin D intoxication) which, according to the plaintiff, was the condition that led to her death. Thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>events of Tarpey\u2019s injury and death were intertwined and could not be separated, the plaintiff argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">This claim of inconsistent verdicts, made only on appeal (according to the transcript of the trial before us), comes too late. <em>Uloth </em>v. <em>City Tank Corp., </em>376 Mass. 874, 884 (1978) (having failed to present a motion raising the issue of inconsistency in the verdict before the dismissal of the jury, defendants may not argue inconsistency on appeal). <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 104 (1987) (late claim of inconsistency may not be raised in a motion for a new trial). See <em>Vassallo </em>v. <em>Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>428 Mass, at 11 (\u201cin civil cases . . . issues not . . . raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal\u201d). In any event the argument has no merit. The jury and the judge may well have inferred that Tarpey\u2019s vitamin D intoxication alone caused her pain and suffering, justifying the award of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The plaintiff also claimed below, as he does in this court, that there was an inconsistent verdict regarding punitive damages. The jury first found that Parrish was grossly negligent (question 11), but then found that Parrish\u2019s negligence did not cause the decedent\u2019s death (question 12). The trouble arises a little further on. Without objection from the plaintiff, the verdict slip for question 15 (regarding the amount of punitive damages) instructed: \u201cIf you found gross negligence [was] committed by Crescent Ridge Dairy or Robert Parrish or Freeman Industries, answer question 15 only as to that person or entity which you found committed gross negligence.\u201d This statement omitted the key instruction, which the judge had earlier clearly given to the jury, that punitive damages were available only if the defendant\u2019s gross negligence was the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The result, not surprisingly, was the jury\u2019s punitive damage award of $150,000 against Robert Parrish because they had found his conduct to be grossly negligent. Thus the trouble was not with the answer to question 15, but rather with the verdict slip for that question, which erroneously allowed the jury to award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>punitive damages for gross negligence, even if they did not find that said negligence caused the decedent\u2019s death. There was no \u201cinconsistent verdict\u201d on this branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In the end, what occurred worked no prejudice to the plaintiff. As we pointed out in <em>Footit </em>v. <em>Monsees, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 173, 181 (1988) (Cutter, J.), \u201c[w]here an answer to one special question is dispositive of the case and renders immaterial the answer to another special question, the dispositive answer is controlling.\u201d When the jury found that Parrish\u2019s conduct was not the cause of the decedent\u2019s death, that answer controlled the disposition-of the punitive damages question and rendered the jury\u2019s answer to question 15 immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We turn, now, to the defendants\u2019 claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">1. The defendants claim that the judge erred in allowing the plaintiff to amend his complaint to add c. 93A claims, there having been no demand letter prior to the commencement of the action in July, 1991. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3). Subsequently, the plaintiff did serve a demand letter dated September 14, 1992. The letter carefully described the events giving rise to the claim as well as the full reach of the claim under 93A. See <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 704 (1975). The letter solicited a settlement offer within thirty days. On October 14, 1992, counsel for Crescent Ridge responded with a $250,000 offer to settle all claims against that defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to file a second amended complaint (reciting the service of the 93A demand letter and the response thereto) was filed on November 13, 1992, and allowed on November 18, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">There was no error. One purpose of the demand letter requirement is to encourage negotiation and settlement. See <em>ibid. </em>Crescent Ridge submitted a substantial offer in response to the demand. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertions, the fact that the demand letter did not specify the dollar amount demanded is not decisive since, as noted above, the letter was otherwise comprehensive and detailed. Compare <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Rosenblatt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 716-718 (1996) (93A demand letter adequate even though damages claimed grossly exceeded amount justified by the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The thirty-day requirement is not necessarily jurisdictional. See <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>369 Mass. 157, 163 (1975) (\u201c[T]he thirty-day requirement ... is not jurisdictional in the sense that a party cannot waive it... . Demand before suit is often a fruitless ceremony.\u201d). Further, in such cases, dismissal does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cordinarily bar a suit brought after the thirty days ha[ve] run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164. See <em>Fredericks, supra </em>at 716-717 (rejecting \u201cjurisdictional\u201d argument for 93A demand letter and citing <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">On the facts of this case, we see no basis upon which the plaintiff\u2019s 93A claim may, or sho\u00fald be, nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">2. The defendants claim that the judge\u2019s award of damages was beyond his authority. This argument is based on the fact that the jury awarded the plaintiff $125,000 and the judge, on the plaintiff\u2019s 93A claim, awarded him $250,000. Since, the argument continues, the judge made no finding of wilfulness, doubling of the award was beyond the judge\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This argument fails to take account of the judge\u2019s subsequent order in which he stated that the 93A damages assessed by him \u201cwere <em>not </em>multiple damages.\u201d There was no error. See <em>Chamberlayne Sch. </em>v. <em>Banker, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 353-355 (1991) (judge substituted his own 93A findings on damages for those of the jury; held, no error).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">3. <em>The award of attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The amount of the award for attorney\u2019s fees is within the \u201cbroad discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 106 (1983). The judge, who was the trial judge, acting on the motion for fees, held an evidentiary hearing in which the entire matter of fees was reviewed. Following the hearing, the judge issued his memorandum of decision in which he carefully described his findings, which were consistent with <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979), and he explained his rulings. We disagree in one respect only.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s 93A claim was not included in the complaint until November 18, 1992. While the 93A claim, and the evidence in support thereof, was entirely parallel with the negligence claim (breach of warranty), see <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 189 (1990), still, only a 93A claim in this case would permit the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. However, we see no basis upon which the plaintiff may recover attorney\u2019s fees on his 93A claim for the period prior to November 18, 1992, when the 93A claim was added to the case. Since the judge properly limited the award of fees to the period ending with the date of the rejection of the defendants\u2019 reasonable offer of settlement, see c. 93A, \u00a7 9(4), namely, October 14, 1992, the plaintiff is not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The same analysis applies to the award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>4. <em>Defendants\u2019 rule 67 motion. </em>Finally, the defendants claim the judge erred in denying their rule 67 motion to deposit the sum of $200,000 into court to avoid the accrual of statutory interest. Mass.R.Civ.P. 67, 365 Mass. 835 (1974). The judge\u2019s denial of the motion was not an abuse of his discretion. See Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 67.2 (1981) (where would-be-depositor denies liability, the court will probably withhold leave to deposit). Contrast cases where the depositor is a mere stakeholder, or does not contest liability to at least someone among two or more claimants, or denies liability only in part. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">For the reasons stated above, the amended judgment is to be modified to strike the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.

The presence of PTHrP is determined by staining or dyeing the slide to identify the PTHrP antibody.\u201d More simply still: the slide, with tissue, is stained to identify the PTHrP antibody, and if not flushed off, what the PTHrP antibody sticks to is the PTHrP molecule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b410-13\">The plaintiff had previously filed a detailed motion in limine to exclude any opinion testimony by Rosenberg. In the motion, he argued that Rosenberg\u2019s testimony about the results of Deftos\u2019s test should be excluded because the test was not \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d in the relevant scientific community and was not reliable, as evidenced by the fact that Deftos\u2019s test, and the antibodies it employed, were not available commercially and were used only in his laboratory; Rosenberg knew of no one else who used monoclonal, as opposed to polyclonal, antibodies in such a test; DeLellis\u2019s test had been negative for PTHrP; only one of the two Deftos tests performed was positive, and Deftos himself said that, although he believed the result was positive, \u201cthe poor quality of the tissue makes interpretation difficult\u201d; and the Deftos test occasionally stained non-tumor cells positive for PTHrP. Lastly, the motion argued that Rosenberg was not qualified to testify as to the reliability or general acceptance of the Deftos test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In immunohistochemistry, monoclonal refers to a protein from a single clone of cells; polyclonal refers to proteins from more than a single clone of cells.

This occurs, Rosenberg opined, when PTHrP is secreted into the blood stream.
