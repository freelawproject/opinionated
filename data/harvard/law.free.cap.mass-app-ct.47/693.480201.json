The claims were filed against (1) Aetna as the insurer of the employer, (2) Aetna as the insurer of Rafter-Gabler Properties, Inc. (RGP), the alleged general contractor of the employer, (3) the Trust Fund in the event that the employer was, in fact, uninsured, and (4) American Mutual, naming RGP as the employer under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">At a conference held pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, the employee\u2019s claims were denied, except for his claim against the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund appealed (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10A &amp; 11), and at the hearing the employee withdrew his claim against American Mutual and proceeded with the other three claims. On October 21, 1991, the administrative judge denied and dismissed the claims against Aetna, and ordered the Trust Fund to pay disability benefits to the employee pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The Trust Fund then appealed to the reviewing board pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, arguing that Aetna was liable because it had failed to follow the proper procedures for cancelling the employer\u2019s insurance policy under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B, and, in the alternative, that Aetna was hable under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, because it insured the employer\u2019s general contractor. The reviewing board (in a two-to-one decision) reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, ruling that the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>judge had committed error in determining that Aetna\u2019s cancellation of the employer\u2019s policy was effective and that the Trust Fund was responsible for compensating the employee. The reviewing board did not reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On appeal, Aetna argues that the administrative judge\u2019s decision was supported by the evidence, untainted by error of law and not arbitrary or capricious, and accordingly should not have been reversed by the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We summarize the facts, noting at the outset that the parties do not dispute that the employee was disabled as a result of the accident, and therefore entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Aetna issued a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy to the employer for the period covering May 13, 1988, to May 13, 1989. The policy was an \u201cassigned risk\u201d policy; the Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau of Massachusetts had assigned it to Aetna pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In 1987, the employer\u2019s business was located at 135 Mention Street, Blackstone. However, two applications for insurance filed on behalf of the employer mistakenly listed an address of 130 Mention Street, which was a vacant lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On November 8, 1988, the employer signed a document addressed to Aetna, notifying it that the company had changed its name to Town and Country Carpentry, Inc., and that its new address would be 117 Mention Street. The employer\u2019s insurance agent forwarded the document to Aetna on November 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Meanwhile, however, on November 14, 1988, Aetna sent a notice to the employer at 130 Mention Street stating that the policy would be cancelled effective November 28, 1988, if a payment of $1,090.55 was not received by that date. The letter, which was sent certified mail, was returned unclaimed on December 1, 1988. Aetna did not send any other notice, and never attempted to re-bill the employer at the correct address (117 Mention Street), although it received that address six days prior to the effective date of the cancellation, and despite having the original letter returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">On January 10, 1989, Aetna notified the DIA that the employer\u2019s policy had been cancelled on November 28, 1988, for nonpayment of the premium. There was nothing in the DIA\u2019s records demonstrating that it had approved of the cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">When Aetna issued the employer\u2019s insurance policy on May 13, 1988, the applicable version of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201cIf, after the issuance of a policy under section sixty-five A, it shall appear that the employer to whom the policy was issued is not or has ceased to be entitled to such insurance, the insurer, with the approval of the department, may cancel such policy in the manner provided in this chapter; provided, that any insurer desiring to cancel such a policy shall give notice in writing to the department and the insured of its desire to cancel the same. The department may approve such cancellation unless the employer shall within ten days after the receipt of such notice file with the department objections thereto . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B, as amended by St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Before a policy issued pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65A, can be cancelled, the statute requires two steps: (1) written notice must be sent to both the insured employer and the DIA concerning the insurer\u2019s desire to terminate the policy; and (2) the DIA must approve of the cancellation, although the employer shall have ten days from the receipt of notice to file an objection. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65B. These steps must be complied with before a policy termination is valid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Here, Aetna sent notice via certified mail to the employer at the wrong address; it was returned unclaimed on December 1, 1988. In the interim, however, the employer had forwarded an unrelated notice to Aetna indicating a change of name and address. Aetna never attempted to send an additional notice regarding the impending cancellation to the new address (or any other address on file). Consequently, one of the requirements under \u00a7 65B was not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Moreover, the DIA was not sent notice of the intended termination until January 10, 1989 \u2014 approximately six weeks after Aetna \u201ccancelled\u201d the policy. The plain language of the statute requires that the DIA receive notice prior to the cancellation (\u201cany insurer desiring to cancel such a policy shall give notice in writing to the department <em>... of its desire to cancel the </em>same\u201d [emphasis supplied]). In addition, there is no evidence that the DIA actually approved the cancellation, which is also required by \u00a7 65B.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Thus, Aetna failed to meet the requirements of the statute, rendering its attempted cancellation ineffective. Accordingly, because it did not comply with the statutory notice requirement, Aetna is responsible for the payment of compensation benefits to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The decision of the reviewing board of the DIA is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-13\">In <em>Frost </em>v. <em>David C. Wells Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 306-309 (1982), we interpreted G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 63, which sets out the guidelines for terminating all policies of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We stated that because \u201c[workers\u2019 compensation insurance is compulsory, and noncompli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>anee carries with it severe penalties [,]\u201d coverage continues despite expiration of the policy where there has been no compliance with the statutory notice requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 307-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Therefore, although the accident in this matter happened after the expiration date of the policy, the reviewing board held that it was covered because of Aetna\u2019s lack of compliance with the notice requirement. Aetna argues only that it effectively cancelled its policy and does not contest the reviewing board\u2019s determination that absent effective cancellation, the coverage of the policy continued after its expiration date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 18, provides, in part: \u201cIf an insured person enters into a contract, written or oral, with an independent contractor to do such person\u2019s work, or if such a contractor enters into a contract with a subcontractor to do all or any part of the work comprised in such contract with the insured, and the insurer would, if such work were executed by employees immediately employed by the insured, be liable to pay compensation under this chapter to those employees, the insurer shall pay to such employees any compensation which would be payable to them under this chapter if the independent or sub-contractors were insured persons.\u201d See <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Roumeliotis, </em>38 Mass.
