Grace, Chairman; Joel Soucy, Vice Chairman; Emmy Cutler, Secretary; and Barbara Scoppa, Treasurer.\u201d The four officers of the association were identified in the complaint as Gloucester residents. On removal to the Federal District Court, the judge analogized the case to a ten-taxpayer action under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53, and ruled that the association and its members had no standing to challenge the 1994 consent decree that called for Gloucester to implement the STEP sewer project described in the opinion because the plaintiffs had failed to raise its ten-taxpayer challenge before the city had obligated itself to undertake the project. See <em>Kapinos </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>334 Mass. 196, 198 (1956). The Federal judge expressly declined to reach the issue of whether the nearly completed STEP sewer project had been designed and constructed in violation of city charter provisions calling for a designer selection committee and a city building committee and, if so, whether those violations would bar the city from defraying a portion of the construction costs through betterment assessments on the affected homeowners. The Federal judge remanded the case to the Superior Court for determination of the points he had not decided. On remand, the plaintiffs were permitted to amend the complaint to add other affected homeowners \u201cindividually and collectively as taxable inhabitants of . . . Gloucester under G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53,\u201d as well as to add the city council and several city officials and boards as defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b44-7\">Armstrong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">In 1992 the mayor of Gloucester entered into a consent decree in the Federal District Court to resolve an action brought by the Federal government against the city to enforce the Federal Clean Waters Act. One provision of the decree, as amended in 1994, called for the city to construct a STEP sewer system, described in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to abate water pollution from roughly seventy-five houses in North Gloucester. On obtaining easements from the homeowners, the city would install STEP system septic tanks, and maintain them as well as the sewer system to which the tanks were connected. The cost would be borne by the city but would be defrayed in part by betterments assessments to affected homeowners. The plaintiffs, who were affected homeowners, feeling that the technology involved was inordinately costly compared to other methods of resolving any pollution problem, brought this action to oppose the implementation of the decree, contending that construction of the system was illegal because of violations of the city charter. These illegalities, they claimed, relieved them of any responsibility for paying sewer betterments assessments that the city proposed to commit to the tax collector. On removal by the city to the Federal District Court, several points in contention were resolved in the city\u2019s favor and what remained of the action was remanded to the Superior Court. A judge of the latter court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to assert that implementation of the project had violated the city charter and that, alternatively, the city charter Was not violated. Accordingly, the judge declined to enjoin the city from committing the betterments assessments for collection and, by way of limiting the effect of the judgment, declared that homeowners against whom the betterments were assessed retained the right to challenge those assessments through the abatement process on the traditional grounds of disproportionality and excessiveness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>From a judgment to that effect,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs brought the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Because doing so does not affect the substance of our decision, and because of the possibility that the individual plaintiffs could assert the alleged charter violations in later applications for abatements (see <em>Bowditch </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Sts. of Boston, </em>168 Mass. 239 [1897]; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Street Commrs. of Boston, </em>181 Mass. 6 [1902]; <em>Crofts </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors of N. Adams, </em>261 Mass. 191, 204-205 [1927]), we pass over the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 standing and proceed directly to consider their contention that the city, by failing to appoint a designer selection committee to select the architects and designers of the STEP system and a city building committee to oversee its construction, violated \u00a7\u00a7 5-4 and 5-5 of the city charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The relevant sections of the city charter are set out in the margin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as they appeared before and after amendments that were adopted in 1985 on the recommendation of a 1984-1985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>charter commission. Before the city proceeded with the North Gloucester sewer project, the mayor sought and received an opinion from the city\u2019s general counsel that \u00a7\u00a7 5-4 and 5-5 applied to building construction, not \u201cpublic works\u201d construction, as those terms are used in the statutory schemes differentiating between the two for public bidding purposes (G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44I, for public building projects, and G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, for public works projects otherwise), see <em>J. D\u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 112, 113-116 (1984), and that sewer construction projects fell within the \u201cpublic works\u201d category (see <em>Deary </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>343 Mass. 192, 194 [1961] [sewer not a building]; <em>Modem Continental Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 838-839 [1984]) and thus did not require the appointment of a designer selection committee or a city building committee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The city sought and received a verification of this advice from the Attorney General\u2019s office. The Superior Court judge concurred in this view, reasoning that the sections of the charter appeared to reflect the requirement of State law, G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 38K, that cities and towns establish designer selection procedures comparable to those employed for State building construction projects under G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 38Al\u00e1 - 380, inclusive. It is not disputed that \u00a7 38K applies only to building projects, not public works projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">If we were restricted to looking at \u00a7\u00a7 5-4 and 5-5 without the benefit of their historical background or of the State statutory scheme that calls for openness in designer selection and public bidding projects, we might be hard put to limit the bare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>text of the charter sections to so-called building projects. Little thought appears to have been given by the draftsmen of either of those sections or their predecessors to defining precisely their scope. But some sense of scope is ascertainable from the subject matter and the text. Looking first to the predecessor sections, we note that they spoke only of \u201carchitects,\u201d a term which one usually associates with \u201cvertical\u201d construction projects rather than sewer systems; and the insistence of \u00a7 5.4 (designer selection committee) on representation of architects, but not engineers, suggests primary concern with construction that has a visual or aesthetic aspect rather than construction that is purely functional. In both the present and prior charter sections, the \u201ccity <em>building </em>committee\u201d (emphasis added) would oversee construction of a \u201cfacility,\u201d see \u00a7 5-5(a), a word that carries overtones from related State law, see G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 <em>38AViQ)), </em>incorporating G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 <em>39A(f), (g), (gV2) </em>&amp; <em>(h), </em>wherein \u201ccapital facilities\u201d are defined in terms that suggest vertical construction, such as buildings or other structures, and the systems (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, etc.) within them, and pointedly exclude from the jurisdiction of the State designer selection board, G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 38C, \u201cbuildings or structures which are required to be constructed as integral parts of the development of sewer . . . systems.\u201d G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 <em>39A{gVi), </em>as inserted by St. 1984, c. 484, \u00a7 7. There is thus a fair basis for the understanding that the predecessor charter sections, \u00a7\u00a7 7-17 and 7-18, applied exclusively to the selection of architects to design, and the appointment of \u201cbuilding committees\u201d to oversee the construction of, public buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The plaintiffs effectively concede that this is a correct reading of the pre-1985 charter, but argue that the very purpose of the 1985 revisions was to expand the charter sections beyond what was required by G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 38K, and, in particular, to extend coverage to public works construction projects like the North Gloucester STEP sewer construction project. In assessing this argument, we look primarily to the major textual changes effected by the 1985 amendment, which were threefold: (1) the addition of the phrase \u201cfor each new project\u201d in \u00a7 5-4; (2) the addition of \u201cor designer\u201d after \u201carchitect\u201d in both sections; and (3) the addition of a registration requirement in \u00a7 5-4 for both designers and architects.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Regarding the first change, we note that the principal support for the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the revisions broadened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>charter to reach public works projects is an affidavit to that effect by the plaintiff Joseph R. Grace, who is the chairman of the Cape Ann Citizens Association and was an elected member of the charter commission. The affidavit, which is contradicted by affidavits from either city officials or charter commission members, would carry little weight in any event because \u201c [statements of individual legislators as to their motives concerning legislation are an inappropriate source from which to determine the intent of legislation.\u201d <em>Boston Water &amp; Sewer Commn. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>408 Mass. 572, 578 (1990). Significantly, the affidavit is belied by the minutes of the charter commission, in which it appears that Grace proposed to add the phrase \u201cfor each new project\u201d to \u00a7 5-4 for a different purpose: specifically so that, rather than being a standing committee as in the past, the design committee would be appointed on a project-by-project basis (as the city building committee always had been) to maximize expertise as to the particular building being constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Regarding the second change in charter language, little support for the plaintiffs\u2019 position can be inferred from the addition of the words \u201cor designer\u201d after architect, as G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 38K, which is limited to building contracts, is itself expressed not in terms of architectural services but in terms of \u201cdesign services.\u201d The term \u201cdesign services\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 <em>3&amp;AV2(b), </em>as appearing in St. 1984, c. 189, \u00a7 5, as particular, itemized services rendered \u201cin connection with any public <em>building </em>project\u201d (emphasis added). A more plausible inference than that urged by the plaintiffs would be that the addition of \u201cdesigner\u201d was intended to bring the terminology of the charter into conformity with the State law of building contracting, an inference bolstered by the third aspect of the 1985 charter amendment, the simultaneous addition of the registration requirement, which also precisely mirrors the State building contracts law. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>38AViQ)) </em>&amp; 38K.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In sum, we see nothing in the 1985 amendments to suggest that the purpose of those amendments went beyond including designers with architects, and changing the designer selection committee from standing to ad hoc.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That appears to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>been the broad understanding of responsible officials at the time and in 1991 when legal opinions were sought from the city counsel and the Attorney General. It would not be appropriate for a court, nearly fifteen years after the charter amendments, to divine that they had a purpose, obscure at best from their text, that would change the understanding that was widely shared and acted on in the intervening years. Where the view of the responsible officials represented a fair reading of the old and new charter provisions, we see no reason to depart from their construction. It follows that the North Gloucester STEP sewer project did not require the appointment of a designer selection committee and of a city building committee, and that the proposed betterments assessments were not invalid for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">A STEP sewer differs from a conventional sewer in that it requires special septic tanks and mechanical pumps to be installed on homeowners\u2019 properties.

The amendment has no bearing on the general distinction drawn between public building construction and public works construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\">One would typically expect clearer indicia of such a sweeping change.

Another example might be the inclusion of a definition of the term \u201cproject\u201d that plainly embraces both public buildings and public works. The terms \u201cdesigner\u201d and \u201cproject,\u201d although used in the predecessor sections, were not defined there, and were left undefined by the 1985 charter amendment, suggesting that their pre-1985 meanings did not change.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
