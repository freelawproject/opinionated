L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, and denying Schultz\u2019s subsequent motions for reconsideration and enlarge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>ment of time. Schultz contends in essence that the \u00a7 6G appeal was timely because the ten-day appeal period triggered by receipt of the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion brought under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, was stayed by virtue of Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974), during the pendency of a motion for reconsideration of the \u00a7 6F decision which Schultz brought in the trial court. We affirm the decisions of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\"><em>Background. </em>Schultz\u2019s appeal is the latest episode of a long-simmering controversy involving a series of lawsuits among various parties over a period of sixteen years concerning the right, title, and interest to a certain condominium unit in Boston. A Land Court judge granted Schultz\u2019s summary judgment motion in plaintiff-appellee Sheri Ben\u2019s suit to clear title to the unit. The trial court judge concluded that the issues Ben raised were compulsory counterclaims not brought in a previous suit and were therefore precluded by principles of res judicata. Judgment entered on that decision on February 6, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Eight months later, on October 24, 1997, well after the period when Ben could have brought an appeal, Schultz, an attorney appearing pro se, filed a postjudgment motion for attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and Mass.R.Civ.P. 11, 365 Mass. 753 (1974). The trial court judge denied the motion on November 10, 1997, concluding that he did not find Ben\u2019s action to have been \u201cwholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\u201d On November 17, 1997, Schultz filed a motion to reconsider that order. Reconsideration was denied on December 5, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Schultz received notice of denial of his motion to reconsider by mail on December 8, 1997. He filed a notice of appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, on December 16, 1997. That appeal was dismissed as untimely by the single justice on December 31, 1997. On January 5, 1998, Schultz filed two motions, one captioned a \u201cMotion to Reconsider and Vacate Order Dismissing Appeal and to Reinstate Appeal,\u201d the other a \u201cMotion to Enlarge Time to File Notice of Appeal Pursuant to Mass. R.App.P. 14(b).\u201d Each was denied by the single justice on January 7, 1998. On January 9, 1998, Schultz timely filed his appeal from those three orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>Schultz filed in the trial court a postjudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>motion under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides, in part, for an award of counsel fees, costs and expenses upon \u201ca separate and distinct finding\u201d that a claim or defense on which a judicial determination has been made is \u201cwholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\u201d Appeal from a decision concerning a \u00a7 6F motion is pursuant to \u00a7 6G,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which prescribes an expedited process requiring notice of appeal to be filed within ten days after receiving notice of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Schultz did not file an appeal from the trial court judge\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 6F motion within ten days after receiving notice of that decision. Instead, within ten days of receiving the denial of his \u00a7 6F motion, Schultz filed in the trial court a motion to reconsider that decision. He received notice that the motion for reconsideration was denied on December 8, 1997, and filed a notice of appeal to the single justice of this court pursuant to \u00a7 6G eight days later on December 16, 1997. Only if the ten-day period set forth in \u00a7 6G were stayed by virtue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>pendency of the motion for reconsideration in the trial court would Schultz\u2019s appeal be timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Schultz contends that his motion to reconsider was a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(e) and, therefore, stayed the appeal period pursuant to Mass. R.A.P. 4(a), as amended, 395 Mass. 1110 (1985). In order for Schultz\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of his \u00a7 6F motion to be a rule 59(e) motion, and to stay the statutory appeal period of \u00a7 6G, that denial must be a judgment within the scope of rule 59(e). Rule 54(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, 365 Mass. 820 (1974), defines \u201cjudgment\u201d as \u201cthe act of the trial court finally adjudicating the rights of the parties affected by the judgment.\u201d <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Biotti, </em>404 Mass. 112, 114 (1989). The question we must resolve on appeal implicates whether the trial court judge\u2019s denial of the \u00a7 6F motion was such an act.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Schultz argues that <em>Manzaro </em>v. McCann, 401 Mass. 880 (1988), is controlling. In <em>Manzaro, </em>the defendant-tenant in a summary process action brought pursuant to G. L. c. 239 counterclaimed under both G. L. c. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 18, and G. L. c. 93A, and was awarded attorney\u2019s fees based on findings of violations of those statutes. The landlord did not file a notice of appeal within the ten-day period prescribed by G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 5, but instead timely filed a rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment, apparently as to those aspects of the judgment that awarded the tenant relief on her counterclaims. The rule 59(e) motion was denied and, within ten days of entry of that decision, the landlord filed a notice of appeal from the judgment awarding damages on the counterclaims. The Supreme Judicial Court held that the landlord\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment stayed the statutory appeal period and that the landlord\u2019s appeal was timely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\"><em>Manzaro </em>does not control the result here for several reasons. First, unlike <em>Manzaro, </em>where the landlord filed a motion to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>or amend a judgment which itself included an award of counsel fees, Schultz\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of his G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, motion was not a motion to alter or amend any part of the judgment in the underlying case. The \u00a7 6F motion had not been asserted in the underlying action either as an affirmative defense or as a counterclaim but was filed eight months after final judgment had entered, well outside the ten-day period set forth in rule 59(e), and well after th,e appeal period had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Second and more importantly, in <em>Manzaro, </em>the judgment itself contained an award of damages, including counsel fees, expressly allowed in the same statutes (G. L. c. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 18, and G. L. c. 93A) that establish the proscribed acts giving rise to liability. Appeal was from the entirety of the judgment and was to a panel of the appellate court. Schultz, in contrast, moved for attorney\u2019s fees under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Appeal from the allowance or denial of such a motion is governed by the provisions of- G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, which states that, \u201cif the matter arises in the superior, land, housing or probate court, the appeal shall be to the single justice of the appeals court.\u201d The mechanism devised by the Legislature for appeals from actions on \u00a7 6F motions (which can be asserted either during the course of litigation or following entry of judgment) is one that is separate and apart from the appeal of the judgment in the underlying litigation. \u201cThe appeal from the judgment, which comes before a panel, affords no review of an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 6F.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Shriberg, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 283 (1991). While an award of counsel fees under \u00a7 6F may be entered as part of the.judgment (not the case here), the appeal as to the findings and fee award made under \u00a7 6F is not to the full panel of the appellate court which will consider the remainder of the judgment but rather to a single justice. See <em>id. </em>at 283-284; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 645 (1996). The period in which the appeal of the remainder of the judgment may be taken is set forth in Mass. R.A.P. 4(a) and is not restricted to the shorter period set forth in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">, The language of Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(e) is substantially the same as that of Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). \u201cWhere there is an identity of the language and no compelling reason to do otherwise, our practice is to adhere to judicial constructions of the Federal rule in construing our similar State rule.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Brockton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>Agrie. Soc., </em>390 Mass. 431, 434 n.3 (1983), citing <em>Rollins Envtl. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 174, 179-180 (1975). We do well in this context to examine how Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) has been applied to motions for attorney\u2019s fees under Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The Supreme Court has held that, \u201cas a general matter, at least, we think it indisputable that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees is not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain.\u201d <em>Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., </em>486 U.S. 196, 200 (1988). The Court affirmed and expanded the application of its previous holding that \u201c \u2018a request for attorney\u2019s fees under [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988 raises legal issues collateral to\u2019 and \u2018separate from\u2019 the decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, quoting from <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Sec., </em>455 U.S. 445, 451-452 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In reaching that decision, the <em>White </em>Court observed that \u00a7 1988 provides for awards of attorney\u2019s fees only to prevailing parties, and, regardless of when they are requested, the inquiry into such an award may not commence until the decision on the merits has been made. Similarly, a motion for fees under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, may not commence until there has been \u201ca finding, verdict, decision, award, order or judgment\u201d on the disputed claim or defense, presumably in favor of the party against whom it was made. The Court also noted that \u201cthe attorney\u2019s fees allowed under \u00a7 1988 are not compensation for the injury giving rise to an action [and their] award is uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial.\u201d 455 U.S. at 452. Attorney\u2019s fees awarded on a motion under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, are likewise not compensation resulting from the injury giving rise to the cause of action but are compensation for the effort of defending against that cause of action; indeed, they are only available to the party defending against the disputed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In addition to the case law under the counterpart Federal Rule 59(e), the statutory scheme of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6F and 6G, and cases construing these provisions support the conclusion that a motion brought under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, is not part of the merits of the underlying action but is collateral to the judgment entered in that action. In <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeToumeau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880 (1981), the plaintiff appealed from a decision pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, arguing that the single justice should have made an independent determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>facts. We held that the function of the single justice hearing the appeal is to conduct a \u201creview on the basis of the <em>subsidiary facts as found by the trial judge.\u201d Id. </em>at 882 (emphasis added). In a \u00a7 6G appeal, the single justice looks only to the subsidiary facts found by the trial court judge in the \u00a7 6F proceeding. The facts that are pertinent to a \u00a7 6F determination are not exclusively or necessarily the same as the facts on which the determination of the claims or defenses in the underlying action were based. The \u00a7 6F proceeding requires a separate finding of facts, corollary to the decision on the merits in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Indeed \u00a7 6G makes clear that \u201c[t]he payment of any award made pursuant to [\u00a7 6F] shall be stayed until the completion of all appeals relating to the civil action in which the award was made.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G. A finding under \u00a7 6F may be made and affirmed under \u00a7 6G, but any award granted has no freestanding effect until all appeals of the underlying judgment are completed. Where an award pursuant to \u00a7 6F is made but the underlying judgment is reversed, the \u00a7 6F award is also reversed. See <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Herrick &amp; </em>Smith, 396 Mass. 783, 791-792 &amp; n.8 (1986). \u201c[Ijmplicit in our reversal on the merits is a finding that [the] action was not \u2018insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith\u2019 within the meaning of c. 231, \u00a7 6F.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791 n.8. Although a motion under \u00a7 6F may not attack the underlying judgment, a finding and any award made under \u00a7 6F nonetheless depends on the vitality of that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In view of what we have said, we conclude that a \u00a7 6F motion is not a distinct cause of action resulting in a judgment that \u201cfinally resolves the rights of the parties\u201d but instead is a sui generis and collateral proceeding, separate from but not entirely independent of the judgment. A motion for counsel fees under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, is thus not a judgment within the scope of rule 59(e). Schultz\u2019s motion to reconsider the judge\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 6F motion was accordingly not a motion to alter or amend the judgment and did not stay the appeal period prescribed by G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Schultz argues in the alternative that, even if his appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, were untimely, he has shown good cause to enlarge the appeal period pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 14(b), and that the single justice abused his discretion in denying Schultz\u2019s motion to enlarge the time to file his appeal. Rule 14(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure, as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), states that \u201c[t]he appellate court or a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>justice for good cause shown may upon motion enlarge the time prescribed by these rules.\u201d However, \u201c[ajppellate rule 4(a) also states that a notice of appeal must be filed within the time limits prescribed by any applicable statute.\u201d <em>Manzaro </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>401 Mass, at 882. Section 6G prescribes that a notice of appeal of a \u00a7 6F decision is to be filed \u201cwithin ten days after receiving notice of the decision thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>427 Mass. 1009 (1998), the petitioner failed to file a notice of appeal of a decision denying free-of-charge production of his plea colloquy transcript within the statutory period prescribed by G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 27D, and a single justice of this court denied the appeal as untimely. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court held that this court \u201chad no authority to grant an extension of time for filing.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>at 1010. \u201c[A] statutory appeal period . . . cannot be overridden by a contrary rule of court when the manner and time for effective filing of an appeal are delineated in the statute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 665 (1993). The single justice thus lacked jurisdiction to enlarge the time period for Schultz to file an appeal under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, and did not abuse his discretion in denying Schultz\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Finally, and perhaps unsurprisingly in view of the longevity of the controversy, Ben requests double costs for this appeal pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 25, as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under rule 25, \u201c[a]n appeal is frivolous \u2018[wjhen the law is well settled, when there can be no reasonable expectation of a reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 930 (1997), quoting from <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 455 (1993). The appeal before us concerns an interpretation of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6F and 6G, which had heretofore not been well settled. Schultz\u2019s appeal was not frivolous under the standard of Mass.R.A.P. 25, and Ben\u2019s request for double costs is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The December 31, 1997, and January 7, 1998, orders of the single justice are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, as inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[u]pon motion of any party in any civil action in which a finding, verdict, decision, award, order or judgment has been made by a judge or justice or by a jury, auditor, master or other finder of fact, the court may determine, after a hearing, as a separate and distinct finding, that all or substantially all of the claims, defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, whether of a factual, legal or mixed nature, made by any party who was represented by counsel during most or all of the proceeding, were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.
