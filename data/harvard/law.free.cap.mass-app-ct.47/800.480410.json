L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, par. IB, when he was not reappointed for the 1992-1993 academic year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">The case was submitted to the jury on special questions as to liability and damages. The jury returned a verdict in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s favor finding that he was discharged because of his age and awarded him $132,000 in damages. Wellesley moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The plaintiff filed a motion for an order reinstating him to employment with the town\u2019s high school. The judge denied the town\u2019s motion for a judgment n.o.v. or a new trial and the plaintiff\u2019s request for reinstatement. The town filed a notice of appeal and the plaintiff filed a cross-appeal for review of the order denying his reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The issues in this age discrimination case are whether the trial judge erred in (1) denying the town\u2019s motion for directed verdict and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial; (2) precluding the town from having one of the plaintiff\u2019s former colleagues testify as a rebuttal witness; and (3) denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reinstatement to his former teaching position.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">1. <em>The facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The plaintiff began his teaching career in 1964. He had a master\u2019s degree in mathematics from Wesleyan University, with thirty credits beyond that degree. He worked as a high school math teacher for eleven years. In 1980 he accepted a nonteaching job in the private sector; however, he returned to teaching in 1985. After being laid off as a high school math teacher, the plaintiff taught math at a middle school, but returned to teaching at the high school level in 1987. After two years at Hull High School, the plaintiff was interviewed for a position at Wellesley High School (Wellesley High) teaching advanced calculus to seniors and other math courses.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">At the time, the plaintiff realized that the position was a one-year position. His salary was $48,000 to $49,000 for the 1989-1990 academic year, and the head of the math department, Jim Sullivan, gave the plaintiff very positive feedback. The plaintiff proceeded to teach a second year (1990-1991) at Wellesley High on a reduced schedule, for three-fifths of the salary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">During the plaintiff\u2019s second year teaching at Wellesley High, Sullivan left Wellesley High and was replaced by Dr. Steve Rumsey, who, at one point, told the plaintiff that he was doing a very good job.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>In a written evaluation of the plaintiff\u2019s work performance in January, 1991, Rumsey wrote that the plaintiff \u201cdoes not always agree with administrative policies and decisions which is his prerogative. I have noted frustration on his part not only related to this, but also related to some of the actions of his colleagues. While these frustrations do not seem to disrupt his classroom performance, Jeff needs to work to promote greater collegiality with department members. He has much to contribute . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">During his second year teaching at Wellesley High, the plaintiff complained to Rumsey about a teacher who worked as the plaintiff\u2019s assistant. The plaintiff testified that he \u201cthought that the place to go was to Mr. Rumsey [to discuss this] because [Rumsey] was [his] superior.\u201d The plaintiff also complained to Rumsey that another math teacher, with whom he shared the responsibility for making up exams, had created an exam that contained typographical errors and other problems. At the time, Rumsey did not tell the plaintiff that this discussion about the plaintiff\u2019s colleagues was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">At the end of the second year, the plaintiff was laid off when the number of classes did not support his employment. In November, 1991, Dr. Paul Ash, the assistant superintendent, discussed the plaintiff\u2019s recall rights with him over the telephone. The plaintiff testified that Ash assured him that even though the school system was not obligated to extend recall rights to him that they felt he had done a good job and there was a very likely possibility that a job would be opening soon because another teacher, Gerard Wichura, would be requested to leave mid-semester.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">When the position to teach again at Wellesley High was offered to the plaintiff in December, 1991, he had to sever, prematurely, his ties with Middlesex Community College, where he had been teaching, rather than risk losing the job at Wellesley High. The plaintiff took over Wichura\u2019s classes and Rumsey subsequently informed him that he did a good job taking over a class mid-year. In March, 1992, three months after the plaintiff took over for Wichura, both the Wellesley High principal, Mary Hayes, and Rumsey, informed the plaintiff that he would not be granted tenure and that his appointment would not be renewed. The reason they gave for not calling him back was that he \u201cwould have been tenured if [he] came back, and [he] had not been there long enough for them to make such an important decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>The plaintiff received a letter in April stating that he would not be reappointed.. At the time that the town failed to renew the plaintiff\u2019s appointment for the 1992-1993 school year, the plaintiff was fifty years old. That term would have been his fourth year working for the town and, in the eyes of the school administrators, would have made the plaintiff a tenured teacher. Hayes and Rumsey met with the plaintiff in June and they told him that they did not feel comfortable with him. They did not say that he had done anything wrong other than what they had already told him. The plaintiff looked for another job and was hired to work as a math teacher at Lynn Classical High School earning approximately $36,000 - $37,000. He worked there four years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The plaintiff was replaced at Wellesley High by Kim More-head, a woman who was thirty-five years of age. She was paid approximately $20,000 less than the plaintiff was receiving.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rumsey recommended Morehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">2. <em>Judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">\u201cThe standard for reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is \u2018whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d \u2019 <em>Boothby </em>v. <em>Texon, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 468, 470 (1993), quoting from <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). This standard calls for a presentation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \u2018without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence. . . .\u2019 <em>Bavuso </em>v. <em>Caterpillar Industrial, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 694, 695 n.l (1990).\u201d <em>Brownlie </em>v. <em>Kanzaki Specialty Papers, Inc., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 408, 409 n.l (1998). See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 312 (1993); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 712, 730 n.20 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">3. <em>Age discrimination claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">In analyzing claims of discrimination brought under the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, we look to the familiar three-stage order of proof paradigm articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>792, 802-804 (1973). See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 134-137 &amp; n.5 (1976). For a recent articulation of the standard by the Supreme Judicial Court, see <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 128 (1997). See also <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 6 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">\u201cIn stage one, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. In stage two, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Finally, in stage three, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s articulated reason is not the true reason, but rather a pretext\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 660-661 (1997). \u201c[I]f successful in stage three, \u2018the plaintiff is entitled to recovery for illegal discrimination under G. L. c. 151B.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661 (footnote omitted), quoting from <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 437, 444-445 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">A. <em>Prima facie case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The plaintiff met his initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. See <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass, at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The plaintiff showed that (1) he was a member of a class protected by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (he was fifty when he received a letter informing him that he would not be reappointed in Wellesley); (2) he performed his work at an acceptable level; (3) he was not reappointed; and (4) there was testimony that the town sought to hire another individual with similar qualifications to fill the plaintiff\u2019s position. (On cross-examination, Rumsey testified that he did not have any idea of the sex or age of the person who would replace the plaintiff.) The plaintiff presented sufficient evidence on each of the required elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">B. <em>Town\u2019s articulated reason.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">The town asserts that the plaintiff was not reappointed because of concerns about the plaintiff\u2019s ability to work with his colleagues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (On cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>that he had criticized certain teachers to his peers within the mathematics department and admitted that discussing one colleague\u2019s shortcomings with other colleagues was \u201cnot a proper way to handle\u201d the problem.) The town also presented evidence that the plaintiff was not reappointed because he did not meet the \u201cpreponderance of merit\u201d standard used to decide tenure cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">C. <em>Evidence of pretext.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In order to prevail at this final stage, the plaintiff \u201cmust persuade the fact finder by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the [town\u2019s] asserted reasons were not the real reasons [for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge].\u201d <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 443, quoting from <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engr. Corp., </em>413 Mass. 698, 700 (1992). Contrast <em>Handrahan </em>v. <em>Red Roof Inns, Inc., 'A3 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 13, 17 (1997) (even where the evidence of handicap discrimination was slim, the jury could have found the town\u2019s asserted reason to be a pretext). The \u201callocation of evidentiary burdens presuppose^] that the evidence of unlawful discrimination would be circumstantial.\u201d <em>Johansen </em>v. <em>NCR Comten, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 294, 298 (1991). See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Boston Financial Data Servs., Inc., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 138 (1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Here, the jury heard testimony that Rumsey praised the plaintiff for his work as a math teacher; Rumsey could not remember what specifics he shared with the plaintiff concerning strategies to \u201cvent his frustrations\u201d; Hayes could not recall the specifics of any conversations she had with other teachers about working with the plaintiff; two of the three teachers tenured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>during the same period were under age forty<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; and a younger woman, who commanded a much lesser salary than the plaintiff, was hired to teach math at Wellesley High.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only other high school teacher in Wellesley who had taught for three years and who was denied tenure during 1990-1992 was Carol Devendorff, who was a music teacher in her middle forties.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">\u201cThe employer\u2019s reasons need not be wise, so long as they are not discriminatory and they are not pretext.\u201d <em>Tardanico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 448 (1996). See <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass, at 137 (chapter 151B does not protect against \u201cpoor managerial judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">We think the instant circumstances are controlled in material respects by the reasoning of <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Abdow Corp., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 665, 671-673 (1999). Other than the undisputed fact that the plaintiff was over age forty at the time he was discharged, there was no showing that the town was concerned about the plaintiff\u2019s age. See <em>id. </em>at 671-672. See also <em>LeBlanc </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 </em>F.3d 836, 848 (1st Cir. 1993), cert, denied, 511 U.S. 1018 (1994). Contrast <em>Blare </em>v. <em>Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </em>419 Mass, at 446-447, where the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that conflicting evidence of satisfactory performance, combined with remarks about Blare\u2019s ability to do his work and evidence that younger workers were not similarly disciplined, was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to discrimination. Here, unlike <em>Blare, </em>\u201cthere are no remarks concerning age and no apparent connection between the evaluations and the plaintiff\u2019s age.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Abdow Corp., supra </em>at 672. See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass, at 314-315 &amp; n.7. Contrast <em>Brownlie </em>v. <em>Kanzaki Specialty Papers, Inc., </em>44 Mass App. Ct. at 413-416. For example, in 1990-1991 when neither the plaintiff nor Rumsey expected the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>be returning to Wellesley High, Rumsey communicated in writing to the plaintiff his concern about the collegiality issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rumsey reiterated the same concern in the plaintiff\u2019s 1991-1992 evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In summary, the plaintiff\u2019s proffer of evidence to support his claim of discrimination consists of (1) his age (fifty) at the time of the adverse decision and \u201creplacement\u201d by a thirty-five year old woman and (2) statistical evidence that in the three years he was employed by the town, two teachers were denied tenure, himself and a forty-four or forty-five year old woman, and three teachers were granted tenure, two thirty-six year old persons and a forty-four year old. On this evidence the jury could not reasonably have concluded that age was a factor in Wellesley\u2019s failure to reappoint the plaintiff, let alone that the town\u2019s reasons for doing so were a pretext,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and \u201cnot the real reasons for the action.\u201d <em>Brunner </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engr. Corp., </em>413 Mass, at 700. See and compare <em>Tardanico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 450. Contrast <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith </em>Co., 42 Mass. App. Ct. at 662. The plaintiff did not satisfy his burden of presenting sufficient evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could have found that Wellesley\u2019s articulated reasons for not reappointing him \u201clack reasonable support\u201d or are \u201cwholly disbelievable.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Tardanico </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 448, quoting from <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Area II Homecare for Senior Citizens, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 761, 765 (1986).
