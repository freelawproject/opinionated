We write briefly to confirm that, obedient to the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, </em>425 Mass. 787, 796-798 (1997), we have reviewed de novo the methods employed by the expert, and, reaching the same conclusion as the judge below and for similar reasons, we reject the expert\u2019s opinion and affirm the summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">On August 19, 1993, at dusk, the plaintiff Victoria Hicks was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>driving her car in a northbound lane of Interstate 495 in the neighborhood of Lawrence. At the same time, Richard S. Morse was in a southbound lane, driving a 1989 Ford F-250 pickup truck towing, a tandem axle trailer that carried a stock car. The trailer broke free of the truck, crossed two southbound lanes and a median strip, and crashed into Ms. Hicks\u2019s car. The injuries to Ms. Hicks were severe; she has been left in a vegetative condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On June 22, 1994, Israel Hicks for his daughter Victoria commenced the present action alleging negligence resulting in personal injuries and property damage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Named as defendants were Morse, truck operator; W.B. Chisholm Corporation, truck owner; and Kevin T. Fletcher, trailer owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Morse was deposed in pretrial discovery on November 21, 1994. Morse stated that just before the accident, while traveling south on Interstate 495 at a speed of 50-55 m.p.h., he heard and felt the truck make a \u201chorrendous bang.\u201d He attributed this to the truck\u2019s striking, straight on, a five-inch lip or height differential where the road surface changed from \u201cground down\u201d to \u201cnormal pavement.\u201d The bang or bump, according to Morse, came about one-half mile before the events of the accident which occurred just after the truck passed the exit for Route 114. Morse\u2019s testimony would place the bump at about the Massachusetts Avenue bridge deck, which had been cold planed (a grinding process) to remove the existing pavement, and was then awaiting repaving, and it could be surmised that the five-inch difference<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had not been alleviated by a ramp or an adequate ramp from the planed surface to a steel expansion joint in the bridge deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Not unexpectedly in the light of Morse\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff Hicks amended his complaint on April 7, 1995, to add as a defendant Brox Industries, Inc. (Brox), the contractor responsible for the repaving project. (Also added were Bardon Trimount, Inc., subcontractor; John G. Shea, Jr., trailer maker; and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One could speculate that the bump, supposedly occasioned by Brox\u2019s negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>had broken or severed the hitch connecting the trailer to the truck, and the trailer was thus released to collide with the northbound traffic. Relevant circumstances were these. Brox had undertaken to repave some 5.5 miles of Interstate 495, which included the southbound side of the Massachusetts Avenue bridge. The southern end of the project was about 1,200 feet south of that bridge (at about the Shawsheen River bridge). The uncoupling of the trailer is taken by Morse\u2019s testimony to have happened some 3,200 feet south of, and about forty seconds of travel time distant from, the Massachusetts Avenue bridge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The judge held, we think correctly, that the question whether Brox was negligent in respect to the Up was the kind of question a jury could decide intelligently without the aid of experts. For summary judgment purposes, therefore, negligence on Brox\u2019s part (including the feature of the five-inch difference) was to be assumed. An unaided jury could also qualify to decide whether a bump could cause the immediate uncoupling of a load or weight like that of the trailer plus stock car. But, on the question of a link \u2014 a causal relation \u2014 between the bump and an uncoupling at a distance as above mentioned, a jury could make no sensible progress without expert advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The plaintiff offered Edward D. Petrow, a mechanical engineer, as his expert. Petrow, deposed on November 3, 1995, assented, under examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, that \u201c[i]n terms of probabilities, you believe any discontinuity that would be a factor in this case occurred within a hundred feet to ten feet before the separation of the trailer and the truck . . . ?\u201d Answer: \u201cThat\u2019s what I would judge to be most probable.\u201d While a one mile distance from the bump \u201cwould be approaching the threshold of what I think is reasonable\u201d in considering any influence on a separation, ten to one hundred feet was \u201cthe most probable range\u201d in effecting the separation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the discontinuity (bump) preceded by ten to one hundred feet the separation of the trailer from the truck, a point fixed at 3,200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>feet south of the Massachusetts Avenue bridge, then it would follow that Brox was free of liability, for the project ended at the Shawsheen River bridge, 2,000 feet north of the separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendant Brox moved for summary judgment on December 22, 1995, basing itself in part on Petrow\u2019s deposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Petrow swore an affidavit in opposition on January 13, 1996. Now, he said, with an opportunity to read the depositions in the case, he was prepared to state that \u201cthe distance between any causal surface discontinuity and the separation point of the truck and trailer ranges between ten feet and one mile\u201d \u2014 this in marked contrast to his own deposition testimony that \u201cthe most probable range\u201d was ten to one hundred feet. As to the causation issue, the affidavit \u201canticipated\u201d that the affiant\u2019s opinion would be \u201csupported by scientific method\u201d and \u201cwill be further supported by mathematical calculations and modeling\u201d which would \u201cshow exactly how the subject hitch components were caused to separate by the road conditions on 1-495 within the boundaries of the construction project.\u201d This appeal to scientific method in the abstract, with a promise of future vindication (incidentally attempting to shift away from the bump on the Massachusetts Avenue bridge), would not do, and left the record in a condition requiring summary judgment for the defendant. The judge characterized Petrow\u2019s opinion, correctly, as amounting to \u201cinadmissible conjecture\u201d and allowed the summary judgment, with a cogent memorandum of decision, on March 21, 1996.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">On March 28, 1996, the plaintiff moved for leave to file a supplemental affidavit dated March 27, 1996 (revised March 29, 1996), and for reconsideration of the order of March 21, 1996. In our view, the judge would have been justified in denying out of hand the motion to file, where the plaintiff had made no case and could not and did not complain of lack of time to make it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>before judgment entered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, while expressing reluctance to receive the supplemental affidavit, the judge did so out of sympathy for the victim if not for the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In his late affidavit the expert concluded that the causal discontinuity probably occurred at the Shawsheen River bridge location. This would conveniently place Brox\u2019s supposed fault within, although at the tail end of, the repaving project, while narrowing somewhat the supposed distance between the discontinuity and the separation. For the purpose, the expert boldly transferred the five-inch discontinuity from the Massachusetts Avenue bridge to the Shawsheen River bridge. At the same time the expert, out of some unavoidable regard to the fact that Morse\u2019s testimony implicated the Massachusetts Avenue bridge deck, offered, as a <em>lesser </em>probability, that the bang of discontinuity occurred there.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">These results were arrived at by methods of the vaguest description using ill described computer models that used input variables several of which were \u201cunknown.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the judge remarked in his second memorandum of decision, \u201c[t]he origin, source, prior use, testing, general acceptance and foundation of and for the models is not even footnoted in Mr. Petrow\u2019s affidavit.\u201d The affidavit did not improve the plaintiff\u2019s feckless situation on the merits. Accordingly, carrying out a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d role, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 24, 26 (1994); <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 589 (1993), and following the rule of the <em>Vao Sok </em>case, <em>supra, </em>we hold the expert\u2019s opinion as last expressed<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was invalid and unreliable. The judge properly declined upon reconsideration to change the order allowing summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We take note, finally, of a contention by the plaintiff that <em>Lanigan/Daubert </em>should not apply to opinions of an engineer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ing type, in which practical experience plays a part, as contrasted with opinions that are strictly scientific. For this proposition the plaintiff cited <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Subaru of America, Inc., </em>82 F.3d 1513 (10th Cir.), cert, denied, 519 U.S. 1042 (1996). It is not clear how the plaintiff would be advantaged in the end if such a distinction were taken, but in any event the attempted distinction was recently discredited in <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Israel Hicks claimed also in his own behalf for breach of his consortium interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The five-inch estimate would exceed substantially the margin ordinarily expected from this cold planing, say three-quarters of an inch or one inch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\">It is understood that all claims in the action have been resolved except the claim against Brox.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">These estimated distances were used by the plaintiff and the judge. The defendant suggests that the southern end of the project (at about the Shaw-sheen River bridge) was 1,310 feet south of the Massachusetts Avenue bridge; the Route 114 bridge 2,890 feet south of the southern end of the project; and the accident scene 3,430 feet south of that point. In the end the discordances in the estimates do not much matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Petrow testified at some length about the hitch connecting the trailer. He thought it defective and indicated the separation would not have happened if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the hitch had been properly manufactured, designed, and used. However, he also thought the hitch was secure up to the time of the bump.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\">It is not doubted that the defendant\u2019s submission on the motion for summary judgment sufficed as a predicate calling upon the plaintiff, with the burden of proof, to show some reasonable expectation of being able to establish that it was more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s actions contributed causally to the accident. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b132-11\">As to attempts to solder deposition testimony by later offered affidavits, compare <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Precise Engr., Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 937 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The expert had been retained by the plaintiff by September 8, 1994, his testimony was given on November 3, 1995, and the close of discovery was set for December 31, 1995. The plaintiff had not applied for further time under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(f), 365 Mass. 825 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Curiously, the expert now relied on data in a deposition by a defense witness that he had previously scorned as invalid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The plaintiff tendered a further affidavit by the expert dated July 12, 1996, commenting on a videotape recently discovered by the defendant and disclosed to the plaintiff. The expert suggested that the tape supported his opinion about the occurrence of the discontinuity at the Shawsheen River bridge, but we think the case was unchanged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
