The defendants claim that the terms of the injunction were not clear; their activities did not violate the injunction; the plaintiff failed to prove lost profits; there was no basis for return of the noncompetition payments; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>evidence regarding the plaintiff\u2019s legal fees was insufficient. We affirm the judgment, except for the matter of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees, which we remand to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>The following factual background is not in dispute. The plaintiff, Eldim, Inc. (Eldim), designs, develops, and manufactures metal foil honeycomb products for a variety of industries. These products are light but very strong. The products are custom made and contain proprietary technology. Starting on July 1, 1990, if not before, the defendants, Stephen J. Mullen and his company, SJM Engineering, Inc., of which Stephen Mullen is the only employee (collectively, Mullen), served as \u201c[ejngineering [mjanager for [Eldim\u2019s] activities in the areas of design, production and manufacturing of honeycomb products\u201d pursuant to a consulting agreement. At one time, Stephen Mullen also held the title of acting general manager of Eldim. During the time Stephen Mullen worked at Eldim, he was the primary contact person between Eldim and its largest client (the client), a multinational corporation. He developed a program for collaboration between Eldim and the client based on a concurrent engineering system, and he also wrote reports relating to that program. The client accounted for fifty to eighty per cent of Eldim\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The written consulting agreement (agreement) between Eldim and Mullen contained a \u201c [noncompetition [ajgreement\u201d that \u201csurvive[d] termination of [the consulting] [ajgreement . . . and end[ed] 18 months after such termination.\u201d The noncompetition agreement provided that Mullen would not provide services to Eldim\u2019s competitors or \u201cotherwise compete with [Eldim] in the areas of design, production and manufacturing of honeycomb products during the term of [the] [ajgreement without the written consent of [Eldim].\u201d The parties agreed to arbitrate any dispute arising under the agreement. Upon Mullen\u2019s departure from the company, in July, 1994, Eldim, in order to invoke the noncompetition agreement, continued to pay Mullen\u2019s monthly consulting fees as provided for in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">2. <em>The court orders. </em>In February, 1995, seven months after leaving Eldim, Mullen made a presentation and submitted a written proposal and samples for certain updated honeycomb products to the client. The next month, Eldim filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking injunctive relief to preserve the status quo pending arbitration, as provided for in the agreement. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>April 6, 1995, a Superior Court judge issued a \u201ctemporary injunction\u201d that \u201cenjoin[ed] . . . the . . . [defendants] ... to desist and refrain from engaging in activities directly or indirectly in competition with Eldim in the areas of the design, production and manufacturing of \u2018honeycomb\u2019 products through and until January 13, 1996.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On September 6, 1995, the arbitrator issued her award, which, among other things, enjoined the defendants \u201cfrom engaging in activities directly or indirectly in competition with Eldim, Inc. in the design, production and manufacturing of any product composed of . . . \u2018honeycomb\u2019 material or having \u2018honeycomb\u2019 components for [the client and another customer,] through and including January 13, 1996.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s award also provided that Eldim could stop making payments to Mullen under the noncompetition clause of the agreement, \u201cexcept that any past due payments . . . must be made for any period of non-competition while the Superior Court\u2019s temporary injunction has been in place.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s award purported to vacate the temporary injunction. On Mullen\u2019s motion, the Superior Court confirmed the arbitrator\u2019s award as a final judgment on September 20, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Six months later, on March 8, 1996, Eldim filed a complaint for civil contempt in Superior Court, alleging that Mullen had violated the final judgment entered by the court. After a jury-waived trial, a judge of the Superior Court found Mullen in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">3. <em>Findings of fact and conclusions of law. </em>The trial judge found that, in the fall of 1995, Mullen sent the client engineering graphics and specifications regarding a new honeycomb concept that Mullen initially presented to the client in February, 1995, and that Mullen provided engineering services and critical information to the client relating to the development of the new concept. Mullen also sent the client \u201ca testable sector of the . . . design . . . between October 1995 and December 1995.\u201d The judge further found that \u201c[o]n December 15, 1995 [Mullen] approved the contents of the RFQ [request for quotations] to be sent by the [client] to suppliers. . . . The RFQ also incorporated design specifications which [Mullen] provided during the injunction period.\u201d On December 18, 1995, Mullen sent the client a facsimile providing suggestions and specifications concerning a related project. Finally, Mullen sent quotations in response to the RFQ to the client on January 3 and 4, 1996, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>explicitly indicated that Mullen could not accept purchase orders until after January 13, 1996. On January 13 or 14, 1996, the client awarded the RFQ to Mullen.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The trial judge concluded that Mullen\u2019s conduct \u201cconstituted a clear and unequivocal violation of [the] [c]ourt\u2019s injunction.\u201d The judge limited relief to remedial damages, concluding that \u201cenjoin[ing] the defendants from performing the contract with the [client] would be unfair to both the [client] and the marketplace. \u201d He awarded Eldim lost profits of $158,800, legal fees of $80,000, and reimbursement of $45,440.80 for p\u00e1yments made under the noncompetition agreement, \u201cbecause Mullen competed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">4. <em>Contempt. </em>\u201cTo find a violation of an injunction sufficient to justify an order of contempt, there must be a \u2018clear and unequivocal command and an equally clear and undoubted disobedience.\u2019 \u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Markets, Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 565 (1997), quoting from <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>342 Mass. 462, 464 (1961). On appeal, Mullen argues that the command was not clear and unequivocal and that Mullen did not engage in clear and undoubted disobedience. There is no merit to either of these arguments. The terms of the noncompetition orders in the injunction were taken essentially verbatim from the consulting agreement that the parties agreed upon at the outset of their business relationship, at least four years before Mullen\u2019s departure from Eldim. At the very least, Mullen was \u201con notice that certain actions could constitute the basis for contempt.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Markets, Inc., supra </em>at 567. Indeed, it was Mullen who filed the motion to convert the arbitrator\u2019s award to a judgment. \u201cWhere an injunction is in effect, the party bound by the order is responsible for ascertaining whether any proposed actions are among the proscribed activities. \u2018[I]t is not the plaintiff\u2019s obligation to police the decree but the defendant\u2019s obligation to make certain he does not violate it. Thus if the defendant saw the decree as ambiguous on the point in question, he could have sought clarification from the court before he engaged in the questionable conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, quoting from <em>Coyne Industrial Laundry of Schenectady, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>359 Mass. 269, 275 (1971). Given Eldim\u2019s persistent efforts to enforce the underlying agreement, and Mullen\u2019s obvious interest in contacting the client, this obligation is especially appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">As to Mullen\u2019s conduct, there is more than adequate support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>in the record for the judge\u2019s findings of fact. In particular, the judge\u2019s finding that Mullen sent a quotation to the client for the client\u2019s project before January 14, 1996, is not clearly erroneous, see <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Markets, Inc., </em>424 Mass, at 569, especially since it was based on his finding that Mullen\u2019s testimony on this subject, as well as others, was not credible. See <em>J.A. Sullivan Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>397 Mass. 789, 797 (1986) (credibility of witnesses for judge to determine). Moreover, the judge allowed Mullen to submit additional evidence on this point at a subsequent hearing on Mullen\u2019s motion to amend the findings or, in the alternative, for a new trial. On receiving the evidence, the judge reiterated that his finding was \u201cbased and rooted largely in credibility\u201d and, accordingly, he denied the motion. Given his findings of fact, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the conduct constituted contempt was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Mental Retardation (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 443 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">5. <em>Damages. </em>\u201cThe purpose of civil contempt proceedings is remedial,\u201d and the formulation of the remedy is within the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Markets, Inc., </em>424 Mass, at 571. Here the judge awarded lost profits, reimbursement of noncompetition fees, and attorney\u2019s fees. Mullen objects to all three awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">a. <em>Lost profits. </em>In awarding damages for \u201cthe contracted twelve rings and a set of spares reasonably anticipated based on past contracts with the [client],\u201d the judge implicitly found that, had Mullen not violated the court order, Eldim more likely than not would have received the contract for those materials. There was evidence in the record to support this finding. The RFQ provided a short period of time during the Christmas season for Eldim and any other bidders to respond by January 2, 1996, to the new approach Mullen had developed in collaboration with the client during the noncompetition period. Eldim had received contracts with the client for similar products for the last six years. In these circumstances, lost profits reflecting lost opportunity are an appropriate measure of damages. See <em>Coyne Industrial Laundry of Schenectady, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>359 Mass, at 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The judge was entitled to credit Eldim\u2019s evidence, which was based on previous contracts with the client for similar products, regarding the extent of its damages. Although lost profits are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>often difficult to prove with precision, <em>Arch Med. Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bartlett Health Enterprises, Inc., </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 407 (1992), \u201c \u2018uncertainty in the assessment of damages is not a bar to their recovery\u2019 . . . [especially] where . . . [any] \u2018difficulties in determining damages arise in large part from [the defendant\u2019s conduct].\u2019 \u201d <em>National Merchandising Corp. </em>v. <em>Leyden, </em>370 Mass. 425, 430 (1976) (citations omitted). \u201cA reasonable approximation will suffice.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Air Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>347 Mass. 613, 627 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">b. <em>Reimbursement for noncompetition payments. </em>The judge ordered Mullen to reimburse Eldim for the noncompetition payments Eldim made to Mullen pursuant to the agreement. Mullen argues here, as they did at the hearing on their motion to amend findings and for new trial, that the judge had no authority to order these damages, because the payments were made prior to the court order at issue here. Mullen claims that Eldim received the value of these payments because Eldim made sales to the client during the period of the payments. The trial judge\u2019s response to this argument was to amend the pleadings sua sponte, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 15, 365 Mass. 761 (1974), to include the period covered by the earlier temporary injunction. We need not decide whether such amendment was permissible, because the judge did not abuse his discretion in requiring the reimbursement even without the amendment. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Markets, Inc., </em>424 Mass, at 571. The judge stated that he was requiring the reimbursement of the noncom-petition fees \u201cbecause Mullen competed.\u201d It was Mullen\u2019s activities during the period of the injunction that deprived the plaintiff of the value of the noncompetition payments it had previously made. Eldim was entitled to be made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">c. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>\u201cAs matter of law, the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is an appropriate element of a successful civil contempt proceeding.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Markets, Inc., supra. </em>Here the judge awarded the plaintiff $80,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, which he found were \u201creasonable.\u201d The basis for this award was a document entitled \u201cEldim damage summary\u201d setting legal fees at that sum. Eldim\u2019s general manager testified that Eldim had already paid \u201cat least half\u201d of the $80,000, that he expected to pay the other half on receipt of an invoice, and that the amount was substantially less than he had paid for the arbitration proceedings and seemed reasonable. On appeal, Mullen argues that without evidence of hourly rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and number of hours worked, there was no basis on which to award attorney\u2019s fees. They are correct. See <em>Mclnerney </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound Assn., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 339, 352 (1971), for other \u201crelevant considerations\u201d in determining attorney\u2019s fees. On the other hand, Mullen did not address this issue at trial and only briefly argued at the hearing on their posttrial motion that \u201cthere was little, if any, scrutiny [in] the amount of attomey[\u2019]s fees . . . [concluding] that\u2019s an issue we can take up on appeal.\u201d Eldim complains that Mullen waived this issue for failing to comply with the requirements of Mass.R.A.P. 18(b), as amended, 425 Mass. 1602 (1997), but then fails to include any additional materials in a supplemental appendix or otherwise demonstrate prejudice. We therefore remand the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Superior Court for further consideration consistent with <em>Mclnerney </em>v. <em>Massasoit Greyhound Assn., Inc., supra </em>at 352, and cases cited. See <em>First Natl. Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Brink, </em>372 Mass. 257, 265-267 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Finally, Eldim seeks attorney\u2019s fees for this appeal. The cost of the appeal is part of the \u201cpecuniary injury\u201d Eldim suffered as a result of Mullen\u2019s disobedience of the court order. See <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>378 Mass. 758, 763 n.7 (1979). The authority to award attorney\u2019s fees for civil contempt \u201cwould ring hollow if it did not necessarily include a fee for the appeal.\u201d <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>412 Mass. 612, 614 (1992) (G. L. c. 93A action), quoting from <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 19 (1989). Having for the most part prevailed on appeal, Eldim \u201cmay . . . submit [its] petition for [appellate] fees together with the necessary back-up material and details as to hours spent, precise nature of the work, and fees requested,\u201d see <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, supra </em>at 20, within fifteen days of the issuance of the rescript in this case. Because Eldim did not prevail on appeal on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees for the contempt proceeding, no fees will be allowed for presentation of its appellate argument on this point. See <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra </em>at 614. Mullen will be given fifteen days to respond to Eldim\u2019s petition. <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>6. Conclusion. </em>The portion of the judgment awarding the plaintiff lost profits and reimbursement for the noncompetition payments and interest thereon is affirmed. The portion of the judgment composed of legal fees and associated interest is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>further action consistent with this opinion. The order denying Mullen\u2019s motion to amend the findings, or for a new trial, is affirmed. Attorney\u2019s fees for this appeal will be awarded as set out above and according to the procedure set out in <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
