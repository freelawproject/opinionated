This case has its genesis in the Boston police commissioner\u2019s revocation of that license on September 11, 1995, and in the notice the commissioner sent Robinson of that revocation. Under the pertinent provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, then in effect,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the commissioner was required to send <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Robinson written notice of the revocation and his reason for revoking it. That notice was to be delivered \u201cby hand or any other means necessary to effectuate notification to the licensee.\u201d The commissioner sent notice by certified mail on September 11, 1995, which was returned to him unclaimed about a month later. In response to an inquiry Robinson\u2019s attorney had made earlier in 1995, he was informed on January 30, 1996, that Robinson\u2019s license had been revoked and of the commissioner\u2019s effort to serve Robinson by certified mail in September and October of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Robinson appealed from the revocation on February 29, 1996. The pertinent portion of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, provides that a person whose license has been revoked may file a petition for judicial review in Boston Municipal Court \u201cwithin forty-five days of notification of said revocation.\u201d If the date of notification was either the day the commissioner sent notice by certified mail, September 11, 1995, or the last date delivery was attempted, October 10, 1995, Robinson\u2019s appeal was untimely. If, however, Robinson was not notified until January 30, 1996, his appeal was timely. The Boston Municipal Court judge ruled that notification occurred on January 30, 1996. The Superior Court judge reviewing the matter pursuant to an action brought by the commissioner in the nature of certiorari disagreed, concluding that notification had occurred in the fall of 1995 and that Robinson\u2019s appeal was untimely. That is the nub of the matter now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\"><em>Background. </em>Robinson, at the time a sixty year old long time Boston homeowner and security guard, held a license to possess and carry firearms for the purpose of target practice from 1985 until February 13, 1995, when he was arrested by Boston police officers for gun related offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Robinson left his Roslindale home that day planning to go target shooting in Braintree. While in his driveway inspecting damage to his truck, Robinson was confronted by a local gang member, Miguel Montanez. Robinson suspected Montanez of having damaged the vehicle after Robinson ordered Montanez the previous evening to leave the first floor apartment in Robinson\u2019s home. Montanez barraged Robinson loudly with threats to his home and family and refused to leave the Robinson yard. Police arrived to find Robinson pointing his handgun at Montanez.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>The criminal charges against Robinson were subsequently dismissed by a judge of the West Roxbury District Court, who ordered police on May 8, 1995, to return Robinson\u2019s gun and license; only the gun was returned. Four months later, on September 11, 1995, the commissioner\u2019s licensing unit revoked Robinson\u2019s license because he was determined not to be a \u201csuitable person\u201d to carry a firearm. Notice was sent that day by certified mail and was returned to the licensing unit on October 16, 1995, the envelope indicating that the letter was unclaimed, with delivery having been attempted on September 13 and October 10, 1995. On January 30, 1996, counsel for the commissioner responded to written inquiry from Robinson\u2019s lawyer earlier in 1995 concerning the license, informing Robinson\u2019s lawyer that the license had been revoked on September 11, 1995, and copying him with the written notice, unclaimed envelope and receipt for certified mail attached to that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Robinson filed a petition for judicial review in Boston Municipal Court on February 29, 1996. The commissioner moved to dismiss the petition as untimely. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge issued written findings of fact and rulings of law. He denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that the commissioner had not presented \u201cany credible evidence to show that [Robinson] was ever notified of the revocation of his license before January 30, 1996.\u201d As to the merits of Robinson\u2019s petition, the judge ruled that Robinson had produced substantial evidence to show that he was a proper person to hold a license to carry a firearm, that the police investigation was inadequate to support an informed decision to revoke Robinson\u2019s license for cause, that there was no reasonable ground for the revocation of that license, and that the commissioner\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious. The judge reinstated Robinson\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The commissioner sought review in the Superior Court by means of an action in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. His complaint alleged that the judge had erred as matter of law in denying the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss and in finding that the license revocation was arbitrary and capricious. The commissioner also claimed error in the judge\u2019s exclusion of hearsay evidence offered to contradict Robinson\u2019s account of the February, 1995, incident. The Superior Court judge stayed the Boston Municipal Court judgment, and ordered the commissioner to file a record of the proceedings before the Municipal Court sufficient to determine the issue of excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>hearsay evidence within thirty days. The commissioner failed to comply. Based on the record that was before him, the Superior Court judge subsequently concluded that Robinson had notice of the attempts at service made upon him by certified mail in the fall of 1995 and that the commissioner had thereby satisfied the statutory notice requirement for license revocation set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131. Robinson\u2019s appeal was accordingly untimely and, in light of this ruling, the judge did not reach the merits, including the commissioner\u2019s allegation concerning improperly excluded hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Robinson appeals from the Superior Court judgment, asserting error in two respects. First, he claims that the Superior Court judge exceeded the scope of an action in the nature of certiorari, either because he reversed a fact finding made by the Boston Municipal Court judge or because any error of law by the Boston Municipal Court judge was insubstantial and did not adversely affect material rights. Second, he contends that notice sent by certified mail and returned unclaimed to the sender is insufficient to satisfy the statutory notice requirement for license revocations set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We need not linger long over Robinson\u2019s contention that the Superior Court judge exceeded the scope of an action in the nature of certiorari. It is certainly true that the function of a court acting pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, is \u201cnot to reverse or revise findings of fact but to correct errors of law.\u201d <em>Johnson Prods., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Medford, </em>353 Mass. 540, 541 n.2, cert, denied, 392 U.S. 296 (1968). The reviewing judge is limited to what is contained in the record of proceedings below, and it is settled that \u201c[t]he standard of review in an action in the nature of certiorari is \u2018to correct substantial errors of law apparent on the record adversely affecting material rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>MacHenry </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 634 (1996), quoting from <em>Commissioners of Civil Serv. </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>369 Mass. 84, 90 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">To the extent that Robinson suggests that the commissioner may not seek, by means of an action under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, judicial review of a judgment entered pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u2022 \u00a7 131, ordering a firearms license to be restored to an individual whom the commissioner thinks unsuitable, Robinson is incorrect. See <em>Chief of Police of Shelburne </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 543 (1983). While it is true that \u201c[a] writ of certiorari will not issue for errors \u2018which have not resulted in manifest injustice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>to the petitioner or which have not adversely affected the real interests of the general public,\u2019 \u201d <em>W.J. Manning, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Traffic &amp; Parking Commn., </em>350 Mass. 24, 26 (1965) (citations omitted), the real interests of the public may very well be adversely affected when a firearms license is erroneously reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\u201c \u2018The goal of firearms control legislation in Massachusetts is to limit access to deadly weapons by irresponsible persons.\u2019 <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 258 (1984). Among the principal measures adopted in furtherance of that goal are the provisions of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, governing the licensing of persons to carry firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 258-259.\u201d <em>MacNutt </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 635 (1991). Robinson\u2019s contention that an erroneous reinstatement of a firearms license to an unsuitable person does not adversely affect material rights flies in the face of the goal of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, i.e., \u201cto limit access to deadly weapons by irresponsible persons,\u201d see <em>ibid., </em>and is accordingly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The question before us, then, is whether the Superior Court judge erred in reversing the Boston Municipal Court judgment on the basis that Robinson\u2019s appeal of his license revocation to the Boston Municipal Court under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, was untimely. In concluding that the appeal was untimely, the Superior Court judge determined both that a revocation notice sent by certified mail meets the statutory notice requirement of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the revocation notice sent to Robinson by certified mail, but returned to the commissioner as unclaimed, satisfied that notice requirement. Robinson claims on appeal that each determination was error as matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>We consider each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 131, sets forth four separate and increasingly more stringent notice requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, an applicant for firearms license or renewal must be notified by the licensing authority of its decision in writing. Second, the authority must send notice of license expiration and a renewal form to the licensee by first class mail. Third, the license holder must notify named authorities of any change of address in writing by certified mail. Fourth, the requirement that concerns us here, the licensing authority must notify a license holder whose license is being revoked of that action \u201cby hand or any other means necessary to effectuate notification to the licensee and executive director of the criminal history systems board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">If notice of license revocation is not to be made by hand, presumably the epitome of means sufficient to effectuate notification, it must be made by other means sufficient \u201cto effectuate notification.\u201d \u201cEffectuate\u201d is defined as \u201cto bring about; effect.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 439 (2d ed. 1982). We think the statutory phrase \u201cother means necessary to effectuate notification\u201d means that the licensee must receive the written notice and not just that the commissioner send it. \u201cIn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the absence of express provision to the contrary, a notice is not given until received by the person to be notified.\u201d <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 443 (1975), quoting from <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ref Co., </em>304 Mass. 353, 354 (1939). Unless a statute provides expressly for other means of giving notice, such as mailing within a limited time period regardless of the time of receipt, notice is not given or effectuated without receipt. We note in this regard that of the four notice requirements set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, the first three do not require receipt but instead expressly require mailing by specified means within a time limited. It is only the fourth requirement which differs, contemplating in hand or comparable receipt of notification, an eminently sensible requirement in view of its dual purpose: notifying licensees that and why they are no longer licensed (and inferably that they must cease their use of firearms) and triggering the appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We agree with the Superior Court judge that certified mail can be a legitimate means of satisfying the statutory notice requirement for license revocations set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, but only if received by the licensee. The obvious virtue of certified mail is that it ordinarily provides proof of delivery and receipt of notice. See <em>Gerson Realty Inc. </em>v. <em>Casaly, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 875 (1974); <em>Cinder Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Schena Constr. Co., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 929 (1986). See also <em>Computune, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tocio, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 493 (1998). Here, however, there was no proof of receipt. Indeed, quite the contrary was the case, since the commissioner knew on October 16, 1995, that the notice letter was unclaimed and unread. The commissioner suggests, however, that the Superior Court judge was correct in ruling that the statutory notice requirement was nonetheless satisfied, calling our attention to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 938 (1988), and to cases holding that one who wilfully evades service will be deemed to have received constructive notice. Neither avails him here.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>involved a criminal prosecution for unlicensed possession of a firearm. The defendant raised the defense of a valid license and, pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7, bore the burden of proving that she held such a license. Hampton\u2019s license, however, had previously been seized and suspended because of earlier criminal involvement. The Commonwealth showed that notice of the license revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>tion had been sent to her by certified mail but had been returned unclaimed, presumably because she had moved'twice without notifying authorities of her change of address as required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131. In these circumstances, given Hampton\u2019s own failure to comply with statutory requirements, we held that Hampton had constructive notice of her license suspension and was accordingly neither deprived of due process of law nor entitled to a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><em>Hampton </em>does not control the result here. To be sure, it suggests that there are instances when parties\u2019 own conduct will result in their being deemed to have received constructive notice. In this regard, <em>Hampton </em>is consistent with what a number of our cases hold.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">\u201cIt is settled that the party to a transaction, whose rights are liable to be injuriously affected by notice, cannot wilfully shut his eyes to the means of acquiring knowledge which he knows are at hand and thus escape the consequences which would flow from the notice had it been actually received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-7\"><em>Conte </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Methuen, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 605 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, 369 </em>Mass. 62, 69 (1975). In <em>Conte, </em>for example, a school principal claimed that his contract was not effectively terminated because he was not notified in writing by the date prescribed by statute. The evidence, however, including testimony as to the plaintiff\u2019s evasive actions and his apparent knowledge of the notice requirement, demonstrated that he had avoided delivery of notice sent by certified mail. He was accordingly held to have been constructively notified that the contract was terminated. See 4 Mass. App. Ct. at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">This line of authority would only assist the commissioner had he offered proof at the Boston Municipal Court permitting the judge to find that Robinson had purposefully or wilfully evaded notice of license revocation sent to him by certified mail. The record of proceedings before the Superior Court judge, however, is devoid of such evidence. All that is known is that delivery was attempted on two dates and that the letter was returned unclaimed. There was no evidence, for example, as to Robinson\u2019s whereabouts in that time period, and no evidence that Robinson was even aware, prior to his lawyer\u2019s receiving notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>on January 30, 1996, that delivery of the commissioner\u2019s certified mail letter had been attempted, let alone that Robinson evaded delivery and wilfully failed to claim the letter. Indeed, the Superior Court judge does not refer to the record in this regard but states in his decision only that \u201c[i]n his memorandum, Robinson appears to admit that he received notice of certified mail, but did not claim that mail.\u201d This is insufficient. The memorandum he refers to is not part of our record on appeal, nor was it part of the record of proceedings before the Superior Court judge. \u201cOn a writ of certiorari, the court\u2019s review \u2018is confined to the record . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Bielawski </em>v. <em>Personnel Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admn., </em>422 Mass. 459, 464 (1996), quoting from <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>408 Mass. 292, 297 (1990). The mere fact that a certified letter was unclaimed, absent evidence of awareness and ability to claim it or evidence of wilful disregard of it, does not permit the conclusion that the intended recipient wilfully evaded notice that his license was revoked. It does not warrant the conclusion that Robinson received constructive notice of the license revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The Superior Court judge accordingly erred in concluding that the commissioner had satisfied the statutory notice requirements and that Robinson had received notice in the fall of 1995. Robinson\u2019s appeal was timely and it was error for the Superior Court to reverse the Boston Municipal Court judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The commissioner requests that, should we conclude as we have that Robinson\u2019s appeal was timely, we remand the case to the Superior Court for findings on his claim that the Municipal Court judge committed error by excluding hearsay evidence. We decline to do so. The commissioner did not file with the Superior Court a record of the Boston Municipal Court proceedings pertinent to this claim as he had been ordered to do. Only had he done so could the Superior Court judge have ascertained whether the commissioner had preserved the point by making an offer of proof in the Boston Municipal Court. See <em>H.H. Hawkins &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Robie, </em>338 Mass. 61, 65 (1958). Nor does the record before us indicate any prejudice the commissioner might have suffered by the exclusion of the disputed hearsay evidence. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the commissioner failed to preserve the issue for review in both the Superior Court and this, court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-17\">As amended by St. 1996, c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 327 and 328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">UnlawfuI possession of a firearm and assault by means of a dangerous weapon.
