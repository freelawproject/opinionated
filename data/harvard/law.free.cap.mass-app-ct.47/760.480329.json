The issues presented are whether the board\u2019s letter to Maurice to appear at an investigatory hearing was sufficient to give him notice that his refusal to appear could result in his dismissal and whether Maurice\u2019s good faith reliance on the advice of his at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>torney not to appear at the hearing barred the board from discharging him. We conclude that Maurice received adequate notice and that Maurice\u2019s good faith reliance on the advice of his attorney did not bar his discharge. We, therefore, reverse the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of an order reversing the action of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><em>The facts. </em>On or about November 2, 1988, the chairman of the board received information that a female probationer had alleged at a probation revocation hearing that Maurice had secured permission for her absence from a residential counseling program she had been ordered to attend, and that, on one occasion, Maurice had allegedly brought her to a secluded area and assaulted her. The chairman was also informed that Maurice had allegedly misrepresented certain facts to a probation officer about his conduct relating to this probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">As a result, the chairman sent Maurice a letter ordering him to appear on November 4, 1988, at an investigative interview relating to his having \u201cto appear as a witness on behalf of [the probationer] in the matter of her probation surrender hearing . . . .\u2019\u2019In that letter, the chairman advised Maurice that \u201c[he had] the right to remain silent, although [he could] be subject to disciplinary action by the Parole Board in the form of a discharge for [his] failure to answer material and relevant questions relating to the performance of [his] duties as an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Maurice did not appear at the interview. Maurice\u2019s attorney, however, called the board to inform them that Maurice would not appear at his direction. The attorney also wrote a letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the board outlining the following reasons for Maurice\u2019s refusal to appear: (1) the board had no authority to conduct an investigatory interview; (2) the board\u2019s failure to adopt procedures for the conduct of such an interview violated Maurice\u2019s right to due process under Federal and State constitutions; (3) the board gave less than twenty-four hour notice of the hearing to Maurice; (4) the board had no authority to grant use immunity to Maurice; (5) the board had no authority to advise Maurice that he could be prosecuted for making a false statement; and (6) Maurice\u2019s refusal to answer questions under the circumstances did not constitute insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">As a result of Maurice\u2019s refusal to appear at the interview, the commission held a discharge hearing at which Maurice was present with counsel. Following this hearing, the board discharged Maurice for his failure to appear and cooperate with the investigatory interview in defiance of the chairman\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Maurice appealed the board\u2019s dismissal to the commission. An administrative magistrate found that the board did not have just cause to terminate Maurice because his refusal to appear was not meant to defy or undermine the chairman\u2019s authority, but was \u201ca good faith attempt to assert his constitutional rights.\u201d The commission adopted the findings of fact contained in the magistrate\u2019s decision. It then ruled, based on its interpretation of <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass. 604 (1988), that the board did not have just cause to terminate Maurice because he was within his constitutional rights in declining to participate in the investigatory interview absent a grant of transactional immunity pursuant to article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. The board appealed the decision to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>A Superior Court judge ruled that the commission erred in concluding that Maurice had the right, by reason of his privilege against self-incrimination, not only to refuse to answer specific questions, but also to refuse to appear. The judge reasoned that, where the employee fails to appear and consider the questions propounded to him, there is no basis on which to decide whether his claim of privilege is legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Notwithstanding this ruling, the judge did not reverse the decision, but remanded the case to the commission to determine whether Maurice\u2019s discharge was proper in light of the magistrate\u2019s finding that his refusal to appear was not an act of defiance, but an act based on his good faith reliance on his attorney\u2019s advice that he had a constitutional privilege to refuse to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Upon remand, the commission affirmed its prior decision to reinstate Maurice on the grounds that Maurice\u2019s good faith reliance on his attorney\u2019s advice that he had a constitutional right not to appear, coupled with the board\u2019s failure to inform him that his failure to appear could result in a discharge, did not warrant his dismissal. The commission also noted that had \u201c[Maurice] been informed of the consequences of a failure to appear and then voluntarily elected not to present himself at the required place and time,\u201d the board would have had just cause to terminate him. The board appealed this decision to the Superior Court. A different Superior Court judge affirmed the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Notice. </em>The board argues that the notice to appear at the investigatory interview was sufficient to advise Maurice of the disciplinary consequences of noncompliance as it informed him that if he did not answer material and relevant questions pertaining to the performance of his duty, he could be discharged. The judge noted in her decision that if you do not appear, you cannot answer. Nevertheless, relying on the <em>Carney </em>decision, she concluded that the notice was deficient because it failed to inform Maurice that he could be discharged for his refusal to appear and did not contain an offer of transactional immunity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">We think the judge\u2019s reliance on the <em>Carney </em>decision is misplaced. In <em>Carney, </em>the court held that a public employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>who, during an investigation, compels answers from an employee <em>\u201cat the time of the </em>interrogation\u201d must specify the precise repercussions that will result if the employee fails to respond (emphasis supplied). <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass, at 609. Here, no interrogation had yet occurred and, unlike the employee in the <em>Carney </em>case, Maurice had not been furnished with a list of questions to which his response was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The letter to Maurice specified that the area of inquiry the board would pursue concerned Maurice\u2019s precise involvement in the matter of the female probationer\u2019s surrender hearing. It is not self-evident from that letter that the board would have asked Maurice any questions that would have triggered his right to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination, which we assume is the constitutional right being asserted by Maurice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Certainly, the board would have had the right to ask him questions relating to his alleged role in securing the probationer\u2019s absence from a counseling program and Maurice would not have had any right to refuse to answer those questions. <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>368 Mass. 33, 37-38 (1975), cert, denied, 423 U.S. 1048 (1976); <em>Patch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, </em>397 Mass. 454, 455 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">With respect to any questions about the probationer\u2019s allegation of assault, Maurice could have invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. As to these questions, the board could not have compelled Maurice\u2019s answers under a threat of discharge absent a grant of transactional immunity, nor could the board have discharged him for refusing to waive his immunity. <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>403 Mass, at 610-611; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dormady, </em>423 Mass. 190, 193-194 (1996). There is a real difference between refusing to answer a specific question during a proceeding and a blanket refusal to answer all questions before a proceeding has advanced to a level of specificity in which the competing concerns of the employer and the employee can be addressed in a meaningful way. <em>Gulden </em>v. <em>McCorkle, </em>680 F.2d 1070, 1076 (5th Cir. 1982), cert, denied, 459 U.S. 1206 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">In sum, we do not construe the <em>Carney </em>decision to permit an employee to circumvent an investigatory proceeding by claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ing generalized constitutional rights prior to the time the inquiry has advanced to a level of specificity where the claim can be properly evaluated in a particularized context. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>354 Mass. 81, 83-84 (1968). Further, because the inquiry had not yet advanced to a level of specificity in which the competing concerns of immunity could be evaluated, the board had no obligation as a matter of law to tender an offer of transactional immunity to the employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Contrary to the commission\u2019s decision, we conclude that the notice received by Maurice was sufficient as a matter of law to advise him of the consequences of his refusal to appear. In the letter from the chairman to Maurice, the chairman informed him that he could \u201cbe subject to disciplinary action by the Parole Board in the form of a discharge for [his] failure to answer material and relevant questions relating to the performance of [his] duties as an employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d In our opinion, the failure to appear is tantamount to a refusal to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">2. <em>Reliance upon the advice of his attorney. </em>Relying upon <em>Silverio </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of Boston, </em>355 Mass. 623, 630-631, cert, denied, 396 U.S. 878 (1969), the board argues that Maurice\u2019s reliance on the erroneous advice of his attorney that he had a constitutional right not to appear and answer questions did not bar his discharge. In <em>Silverio, </em>the court concluded that the discharge of a public employee was not barred because the public employee relied upon the erroneous advice of his attorney that he had a legal right not to answer certain questions. The court noted, however, that there was no finding that the employee relied in good faith on the advice of his attorney. In this case, the board argues that it does not matter whether Maurice acted in good faith because, just like Silverio, he defied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>superior in refusing to appear and to answer questions about his job performance on the erroneous advice of his attorney. The board contends that, in doing so, he ran the risk that there was nothing in the ground asserted and that no constitutional privilege would protect him.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">To rule that good faith reliance upon the erroneous advice of one\u2019s attorney should excuse noncompliance with an order of a superior appears to run counter to a legal principle that, ordinarily, a person is held accountable for the conclusions of his attorney to the extent that one accedes to those conclusions or permits counsel to act in one\u2019s stead. <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 633-634 (1962). See <em>Weston </em>v. <em>United States Dept. of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev., </em>724 F.2d 943, 951 (Fed. Cir. 1983). To permit an employee to mitigate his penalty because he relied in good faith upon the advice of counsel that proved erroneous would seriously jeopardize efficient internal surveillance and quality control by government agencies and would place any employee who hires a lawyer at a distinct advantage over one who does not. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we decide that Maurice\u2019s good faith reliance on the advice of his attorney did not preclude his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and a new judgment shall enter reversing the decision of the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The full text of the letter reads as follows: \u201cI recently became aware that on or about October 31, 1988, you were scheduled to appear as a witness on behalf of [the probationer], in the matter of her probation surrender hearing at Cambridge District Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">\u201cAs your precise involvement in this matter is unclear, I require your presence, participation, and cooperation in an interview to be conducted at the Parole Board\u2019s Central Office at 27-43 Wormwood Street, Boston, Massachusetts, on November 4, 1988 at 10 A.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">\u201cThe interview will be solely administrative in nature.
