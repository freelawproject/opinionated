L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, the plaintiffs (employees) filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the defendant (employer) seeking to recover back pay based on the alleged failure of the employer to pay them the prevailing wage rate set by the Department of Labor and Industries for work performed under a public construction project at the Logan International Airport. The employer filed an answer denying the claim and made a request for a jury trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The employees moved to strike the request for a jury trial. A Superior Court judge allowed the motion on the ground that she would not imply a right to trial by jury in the absence of a legislative directive where the cause of action was statutory in nature. The employees\u2019 claims were tried jury-waived before another Superior Court judge. That judge found that the employer had violated the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, and awarded the employees back pay, punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On appeal, the employer alleges several errors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consider only one because it is dispositive of this appeal, namely the employer\u2019s claim that it was wrongfully denied a jury trial. Relying on <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220 (1994), the employer contends that a cause of action under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, is analogous to a contract action and the relief sought, compensation and punitive damages, is legal in nature; thus, its claim to a jury trial was wrongfully denied. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">As noted in the <em>Dalis </em>case, it is not a question whether, in the absence of a legislative directive, we should imply a right to a jury trial, but, rather whether, under the Massachusetts Constitution, we should preserve and protect the right to a trial by jury on claims under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Under the broad language of art. 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the right to a trial by jury is preserved \u201c[i]n all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been other-ways used and practiced . ...\u201d An action under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27, is certainly a suit \u201cbetween two [or more] persons which clearly sets forth a controversy concerning property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. We must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff\u2019s claim is analogous, in either subject matter or remedy sought, to cases within the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction, as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At common law, parties were entitled to a jury trial to establish, or defend against, a debt. <em>Stockbridge </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>215 Mass. 415, 418 (1913). See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>180 Mass. 334, 344-346 (1902). The subject of this action is the establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>of a debt due for services rendered and, as such, is legal rather than equitable in nature. Its underpinnings lie in the employment contract between the parties and, thus, this suit is analogous to an action for breach of contract, which ordinarily lies outside the scope of the court\u2019s equity jurisdiction. Cf. <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 312-313 (1983) (no entitlement to jury trial for violation of G. L. c. 93A which does not sound in contract or tort). In addition, the relief sought, back pay and punitive damages, is legal in nature. <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass, at 226. That \u00a7 27 also provides for injunctive relief and that it requires the initial filing of a complaint with the Attorney General before filing suit do not invalidate the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 224-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Having concluded that the employer was entitled to a trial by jury on the employees\u2019 claim, we must also decide whether the denial of this right was prejudicial to it. <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>NYNEX Information Resources Co., </em>419 Mass. 792, 797 (1995). In <em>Whalen, </em>the court concluded that the erroneous denial of a jury trial was not prejudicial because the record clearly established that the plaintiff was not a \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d who could bring a cause of action for handicap discrimination in employment, the subject matter of the suit. This case does not involve the resolution of a similar threshold legal issue but, instead, requires the evaluation of conflicting evidence by the fact finder. The employees presented evidence they had not been paid for all of their work on the Logan Airport project at the prevailing wage rate. The employer challenged the employees\u2019 claims on several alternate grounds by presenting evidence that (1) the bulk of the work for the completion of the public contract required off-site work fabricating insulation material which did not require the payment of the prevailing wage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (2) the employee Croteau had initially prepared the estimate for the bid on the project, and his labor costs were far less than those now claimed by the employees for the project, allegedly casting doubt on the employees\u2019 claims; and (3) the employees had been paid at the prevailing wage rate for all their work on the project, off and on site, because they worked only part-time on this project. The employer also presented evidence challenging the employees\u2019 credibility. While we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>well understand the result reached by the judge in this case, we conclude that the employer should have had the conflict in the evidence resolved by a jury to which it was entitled under the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We need not discuss the employer\u2019s other claims of error which are not likely to arise upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The employer claims that the judge erred in allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for sequestration of witnesses; in denying its motion \u201cfor a required finding\u201d; and in denying its request for a hearing on attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It is noteworthy that the employer failed to present any payroll records demonstrating that the employees had been paid a nonprevailing wage for this off-site work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
