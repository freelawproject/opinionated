The notice of appeal, identifying the parties filing the notice as \u201cClaudette Niles-Robinson, &amp; others\u201d and \u201cClaudette Niles-Robinson, et al.,\u201d failed to comply with the requirement of Mass.R.A.R 3(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 927 (1979), that the notice \u201cshall specify the . . . parties taking the appeal.\u201d See <em>Filio s </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>415 Mass. 806, 807 n.2 (1993), cert, denied, 511 U.S. 1030 (1994); <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 347-349 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-15\">The Brigham Medical Center, Inc., and Partners Healthcare System, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-13\">Laurence, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">The plaintiff, Claudette Niles-Robinson, sustained serious physical and mental injuries (principally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>multiple chemical sensitivity, or MCS) as a consequence of faulty ventilation and other environmental problems to which she and many other employees of defendant Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Inc. (hospital), were exposed during construction activities at the hospital in 1995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She filed for and, after being found disabled by the Department of Industrial Accidents (department), was awarded worker\u2019s compensation benefits on account of her injuries. Thereafter, she commenced a multicount tort action against the hospital<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for monetary damages claimed to have resulted from those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The hospital moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). The hospital asserted that the worker\u2019s compensation act was the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy for the claimed workplace injuries, by virtue of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that her claiming and accepting worker\u2019s compensation benefits had constituted a release of all the asserted claims, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court agreed with those contentions and allowed the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On appeal from the dismissal, the plaintiff asserts that she is not barred by the worker\u2019s compensation act because her MCS is not a compensable \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the act. She relies on the act\u2019s definition of the term: \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 includes infectious or contagious diseases if the nature of the employment is such that the hazard of contracting such diseases by an employee is inherent in the employment.\u201d G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), as inserted by St. 1941, c. 437. Since the risk of contracting MCS is not inherent in her employment at the hospital (so she alleges in her complaint), she should be entitled to proceed with her tort claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The parties devote substantial portions of their briefs to the meaning and scope of the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d as partially elucidated by the purpose and historical development of G. L. c. 152 and the relatively few judicial decisions that have involved the term\u2019s meaning.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That interesting issue need not detain us, however, because of the procedural context of this controversy. The outcome-determinative factors here are that the plaintiff filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits with the department for the very injuries set forth in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>complaint; those injuries were determined to be compensable injuries under G. L. c. 152; she was determined to be disabled for purposes of receiving the claimed worker\u2019s compensation benefits; she was awarded and has received payment of such benefits for those injuries; and no appeal from that award decision was taken.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of those facts, the plaintiff is precluded from asserting her purported common-law right of action, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">1. <em>Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion. </em>The most pertinent issue in this case \u2014 whether the plaintiff\u2019s MCS is a compensable injury under G. L. c. 152 \u2014 was determined by the prior final adjudication at the department. The plaintiff there maintained that she had suffered a compensable injury for which she was entitled to worker\u2019s compensation benefits. That issue was essential to, and was determined adversely to the hospital in, a valid final, unappealed department award order. That determination is conclusive between the parties in this subsequent litigation. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ring, </em>401 Mass. 59, 60-62 (1987) (noting that the doctrine of collateral estoppel \u201cis particularly apt in the workmen\u2019s compensation context\u201d); <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Bologna, </em>415 Mass. 20, 22 (1993). Compare <em>Tuper </em>v. <em>North Adams Ambulance Serv., Inc., </em>428 Mass. 132, 134-136 (1998). The plaintiff, accordingly, may not relitigate that issue. On that narrow basis, the hospital is correct in asserting that the plaintiff is foreclosed from maintaining an action at law by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23. See <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 153-154 (1943); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Stackpole Fibers Co., </em>403 Mass. 360, 362 (1988); <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>408 Mass. 614, 619-620 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">2. <em>Judicial estoppel. </em>This is \u201cthe doctrine under which \u2018a party is bound by his judicial declarations and may not contradict them in a subsequent proceeding involving [the] same issues and parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Correia </em>v. <em>DeSimone, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 601, 603 (1993), quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 761 (5th ed. 1979). In particular, a party who has successfully asserted a certain position under oath in an adjudicatory proceeding may not in a later proceeding \u201cassume a position relative to the same subject that is directly contrary to that taken at the first\u201d proceeding. <em>Paixao </em>v. <em>Paixao, </em>429 Mass. 307, 309, 311 (1999), quoting from <em>East Cambridge Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Wheeler,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>422 Mass. 621, 623 (1996). Assuming a contrary and inconsistent position to that taken before the department with respect to the applicability of the worker\u2019s compensation act to her MCS is precisely what the plaintiff has attempted to do in her civil action. It cannot be countenanced in the interests of fairness and judicial integrity. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The facts set forth herein are from the .plaintiff\u2019s complaint, read in the light most favorable to her, <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 321-322 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>428 Mass. 684 (1999), and the undisputed facts recited in the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The other appellees were named as nominal defendants only, and the plaintiff agreed to dismiss her complaint against them if the hospital\u2019s motion to dismiss was allowed, as it was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Section 24 of G. L. c. 152, as amended through St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 35, states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]n employee shall be held to have waived his right of action at common law ... to recover damages for personal injuries, if he shall not have given his employer, at the time of his contract of hire, written notice that he claimed such right. . . . \u201d No such notice was provided in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 23, as amended through St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 34, relevantly provides that an employee\u2019s acceptance of worker\u2019s compensation benefits \u201con account of personal injury under this chapter . . . shall constitute a release to the insured [i.e., the employer] of all claims or demands at common law . . . arising from the injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The hospital argues at length, citing numerous authorities, that MCS is a questionable and highly debatable \u201cinjury\u201d which has not been deemed a valid medical condition or a form of disability under Federal law. Such assertions are matters outside the pleadings, were not relied upon by the motion judge, and are irrelevant to the question of the validity of the judgment appealed from as well as to our analysis herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The plaintiff also argues the so-called \u201cdual persona\u201d doctrine, i.e., even if an employee injured on the job is normally confined to her worker\u2019s compensation remedy, she may also maintain a civil action against her employer when the employer\u2019s liability for the injury derived from a separate legal status independent from and unrelated to its status as an employer. Here, the plaintiff sees that separate status as the hospital\u2019s having itself (or through its parent corporation) managed the construction project. The doctrine has not, however, been explicitly adopted in the Commonwealth (as the plaintiff recognizes), and we decline her invitation to do so in this case, for the reasons, if no other, that she failed to raise the issue below, see <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Rockland, </em>423 Mass. 690, 701-702 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>ELM Med. Labs., Inc., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 81 (1992), and that no facts relevant to the substance of her contention are alleged in the complaint. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Peabody Constr. Co., </em>386 Mass. 121, 134 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The parties are in essential agreement in recognizing that there exists no comprehensive definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under G. L. c. 152, no helpful legislative history shedding light on its intended meaning, nor any judicial pronouncement of direct relevance to this case. See generally, for discussions bearing on the issue of the scope of the term, <em>Hurle\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 223 (1914); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>London Guar. &amp; Acc.
