After several years of appointments with specialists to diagnose the problem and recommend appropriate treatment, Green had corrective surgery to realign her jaws in Fort Worth, Texas, in June, 1992. Her medical insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (BCBS), paid less than one-third of the charges for the surgery, leaving her responsible for the balance. In response, Green brought an action in District Court against BCBS, for violations of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 17.6D, breach of contract, and misrepresentation. After a five-day bench trial conducted between March 17 and July 26, 1995, the judge found for BCBS. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment and dismissed the appeal. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>argues that certain of the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, that the judge misapplied the law to the facts, and that the trial judge erred in striking her requests for rulings of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">1. <em>Factual background, </em>a. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy. </em>The plaintiff is a long-term individual subscriber to a BCBS managed major medical indemnity health insurance plan. Under the terms of her policy, insofar as relevant here, BCBS pays for services it determines to be medically necessary and within the scope of benefits set out in the subscriber certificate. BCBS determines medical necessity based on a review of the medical records describing the subscriber\u2019s condition and treatment. It pays eighty per cent of the usual and customary charge set under the contract. Out-of-State services are reimbursed at Massachusetts rates, but out-of-State providers may charge subscribers for the difference between the provider\u2019s charge and the BCBS payment, a practice called balance billing. Generally, neither dental care nor cosmetic surgery is covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">b. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s surgical procedure. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s surgery involved cutting the jaw bone in two places (a LeFort osteotomy and a horizontal osteotomy), pushing it into a new position, and fashioning a dental implant (an osseointegrated implant). Months before the date scheduled for her surgery, the plaintiff made numerous telephone calls to BCBS to find out whether BCBS would cover the surgical procedures proposed to correct her problem. In connection with these efforts, Dr. Bruce Epker, the Texas surgeon who was to perform the surgery, twice submitted to BCBS a letter dated March 2, 1992, setting out the procedures he intended to perform, the medical necessity for the procedures, the code numbers for the procedures, and the estimated charge for each. On April 6, 1992, BCBS gave the plaintiff authorization for the hospitalization associated with the surgery. Later that month, still having heard nothing about coverage for the surgery itself, Green filed a complaint with the State\u2019s Division of Insurance seeking information about her coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">After consulting various officials at BCBS, the investigator for the Division of Insurance wrote the plaintiff a short handwritten memorandum. The memorandum said that BCBS would pay for the LeFort osteotomy based on medical necessity, and that the horizontal osteotomy \u201ccould be considered \u2018cosmetic\u2019 so will require surgeons\u2019 statements to the contrary which would be .reviewed by the Review Board.\u201d The memo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>also informed Green that because she was having the surgery performed out-of-State, she would be responsible for any difference between the Texas charges and Massachusetts \u201creasonable and customary charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Green had the surgery performed in Texas as planned. Dr. Epker\u2019s charges for the surgery were consistent with his letter, except that an additional procedure, a bone graft augmentation, was performed, for which the charge was $1,500. Several months after the surgery, after continued inquiries from Green and apparently another call to the Division of Insurance, BCBS paid eighty per cent of the BCBS \u201cMassachusetts allowed amount\u201d for three of the procedures: $1,246.45 of the $4,500 for the LeFort osteotomy; $1,152.95 of the $2,700 for the implant and the horizontal osteotomy; and $536.80 of $1,305 for the anesthesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">c. <em>The judge\u2019s findings. </em>Two months after the conclusion of the trial, the judge issued five pages of \u201cfindings.\u201d On appeal, the plaintiff claims the following findings are clearly erroneous: (1) \u201cPlaintiff made no inquiry into the area of pricing of procedures\u201d; (2) \u201cPlaintiff contended from the start that she desired \u2018individual consideration\u2019 \u201d; (3) \u201cThe Blue Cross computer pricing system could not give [the plaintiff] boilerplate prices because she herself requested individual consideration\u201d; (4) \u201cThe Department [sic] of Insurance . . . informed Green that out-of-state service providers would be reimbursed at the Massachusetts \u2018usual and customary\u2019 rate\u201d; and (5) \u201c[P]laintiff had been informed . . . that this procedure was not generally covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s legal responsibilities, the judge found that she had \u201ca duty ... to make inquiries in good faith on coverage as well as pricing\u201d; \u201ca duty to obtain the insurer\u2019s approval and extent of coverage to a closer degree of certainty than she relied upon\u201d; and in view of her choice to go out of State for a medical procedure of a dental nature, \u201can added duty to firm up the scope of benefit coverage as well as individual consideration reimbursement.\u201d He concluded that BCBS did not violate G. L. c. 93A \u201cbecause there was no actual breach of contract or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We address first the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff never asked about the \u201cpricing of procedures.\u201d There is no dispute that Green made numerous telephone calls to BCBS and talked to various BCBS employees, inquiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>whether the proposed surgery would be \u201ccovered.\u201d In addition, her doctor notified BCBS of his proposed charges and requested a reply, which he never received. Although the testimony of Marilyn Rouse, the information consultant in the nongroup customer service department of BCBS, that the plaintiff never asked about pricing, if taken literally, may be sufficient to support the judge\u2019s finding, we are convinced that this finding is clearly erroneous, because it does not make sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In reviewing a matter in which the trial judge acts as fact finder, we \u201caccept the judge\u2019s findings of fact as true unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass. 619, 620 (1992). A finding is clearly erroneous when \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Springgate </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Mattapoisett, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 309-310 (1981), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. </em>364, 395 (1948). Although an insured is interested first in whether a procedure is covered at all, the mere fact of coverage, without information about the likely extent of coverage, is of little utility. It is the amount of coverage that a patient would regard as critical. It is apparent from the record that Green was not looking for an advance promise that the procedure was covered as a medical necessity; she was confident the records would support such a finding. Since she knew she would be responsible for balance billing, she wanted to know what BCBS would pay, so that she could determine what her share was likely to be. When an insured makes repeated inquiries as to whether an admittedly unusual procedure is covered, has her physician submit his proposed charges, and files a complaint with the Division of Insurance when her insurer fails to answer her questions, a finding that she has not sought pricing information is inconsistent with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">But even if the finding that Green did not ask about price is not clearly erroneous, the judge\u2019s determination of the relative duties of the parties was inconsistent with well-established legal principles. \u201cWe scrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Selvaggio, </em>413 Mass, at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The plaintiff claims that the judge \u201cmisunderstood and misapplied\u201d G. L. c. 93A and c. 176D to the facts of her case. She argues that BCBS knew Dr. Epker\u2019s charge for the LeFort os<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>teotomy was $4,500 because Dr. Epker so informed them; that BCBS also knew its usual allowance for that procedure was $1,558.06, the amount they in fact contributed toward her surgery; and that therefore their failure to disclose the usual allowance constituted misrepresentation. Although her argument is not a model of appellate advocacy, she sufficiently raised and argued the issue of whether BCBS had a duty under G. L. c. 93A to disclose the information she was obviously seeking to warrant our review of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">While the insured has a responsibility to be informed about the terms of her policy and to make reasonable inquiry as to those terms, her attempts to obtain the information about her medical benefits should not require the utterance of a secret word (i.e., price), if the nature of the inquiry is reasonably clear. It has long been established, even before the passage of chapters 93A and 176D, that an insurer has an obligation to act in good faith, to \u201cexercise common prudence to discover the facts as to liability and damages upon which an intelligent decision may be based.\u201d <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., </em>339 Mass. 184, 187 (1959) (duty of insurance company in the exercise of its discretion regarding settlement). \u201cThe insurer will not be held to prophesy, but it will not be excused for indifference.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). The Consumer Protection Act, G. L. c. 93A, which applies to the insurance industry even in the areas in which it overlaps with c. 176D, <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 75-78 (1977), was a legislative attempt \u201cto regulate business activities with the view to providing proper disclosure of information and a more equitable balance in the relationship of consumers to persons conducting business activities.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 238 (1974). Chapter 93A \u201cis a statute of broad impact which create[d] new substantive rights.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>West-wood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 693 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">There is no binding definition of what constitutes an unfair practice under c. 93A. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass, at 241. \u201cThe existence of unfair acts and practices must be determined from the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242. Part of the duty of enforcing consumer protection legislation \u201cis to discover and make explicit those unexpressed standards of fair dealing which the conscience of the community may progressively develop.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>Standard Educ. Soc., </em>86 F.2d 692, 696 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>1936), rev\u2019d in part, 302 U.S. 112 (1937). In the circumstances of this case, placing on Green the entire burden of obtaining information that BCBS said it could not and would not provide, puts the policy holder in an untenable position and is inconsistent with the policy behind c. 93A. An obligation to deal with the insured with \u201ccandor and fairness\u201d is inherent in any contract of insurance. <em>Sarnafil, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peerless Ins. Co., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 248, 254\u2019(1993), quoting from <em>Trempe </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 455 (1985). We consider particularly odd the judge\u2019s suggestion that Green\u2019s inquiry into pricing should have included \u201cfollow[ing] up with the [Division] of Insurance or Dr. Epker [on] exactly how much of the charges she would be responsible for or the state to state difference in pricing.\u201d We also reject BCBS\u2019s argument that the patient should have asked the Massachusetts surgeon she consulted, who did not perform the surgery, what her share of the charges would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">First of all, neither the Division of Insurance nor the doctor was a party to the certificate of insurance the plaintiff had with BCBS. There is no basis in the evidence for the suggestion that either of them could have answered her questions. Indeed, she did seek help from each of them, as evidenced by Dr. Epker\u2019s letter and the Division of Insurance memo, and was still lacking the information it later turned out that she needed. Second, it was not the State-to-State difference that was significant in this case; it was the usual and customary Massachusetts charge that Green needed and that BCBS did not provide. While we are mindful of the testimony that there was no price for Green\u2019s procedure \u201con the [BCBS] system\u201d and of BCBS\u2019s apparent concern that giving exact prices could appear to be a promise to pay that amount, the insurer at least could have responded to Green\u2019s inquiries with the warning that coverage in similar cases was substantially less than the amount set out in Dr. Epker\u2019s letter. The testimony and the documentary evidence demonstrate that BCBS was able to compute their payment share easily enough when called upon to do so. Finally, the judge\u2019s finding that there was no violation of G. L. c. 93A because \u201cthere was no actual breach of contract or misrepresentation\u201d is incorrect as matter of law. \u201c[T]he statutory words \u2018unfair and deceptive practices\u2019 . . . are not limited by traditional tort and contract law requirements.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass, at 693, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass, at 244 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because we conclude that BCBS committed a breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing under G. L. c. 93A, we do not reach the plaintiff\u2019s claims of breach of contract and misrepresentation. See <em>Wolfberg </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>385 Mass. 390, 401 (1982) (where damages are awarded under c. 93A on facts intended to support concurrent claims for damages under other theories, recovery under the other claims would be duplicative). There is support in the record for the judge\u2019s findings regarding Green\u2019s G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), claims. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 366, 372 (1996) (determination of what constitutes unreasonable delay is ordinarily left to the trier of fact). We do not address the question whether the trial judge abused his discretion in striking Green\u2019s requested rulings of law. His findings provide us with the \u201cthought processes which led to his decision,\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Nashawaty, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 315 (1981), and therefore are sufficient for the purposes of review on appeal. Although there is no support in the record for the judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff requested individual consideration, there is considerable support for a finding that this was the appropriate process in the circumstances. None of the other findings of which the plaintiff complains is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the appeal is vacated. A new judgment shall enter for the plaintiff on her claim pursuant to G. L. c. 93A. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on the issue of damages and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. The judge may reopen evidence for this purpose or may act on the existing record. See <em>Sidney Binder, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jewelers Mut. Ins. Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 459, 467 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
