Alleging violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.05(1) and 3.16(2) (1993),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by sending misleading and deceptive solicitations to consumers for listing in a yellow page directory unconnected with a telephone company, the Attorney General brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>an action against the defendants under c. 93A, \u00a7 4. On the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court determined that the defendants had violated c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2(a), </em>at least 2,345,000 times and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Commonwealth on the issue of liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following an assessment of damages hearing, a final judgment entered which included a permanent injunction against the defendants\u2019 solicitations, an award of restitution to those persons (nine) who had filed affidavits setting forth the amount paid to the defendants, an assessment of civil penalties of $1,000,000 jointly and severally against the defendants, and an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Commonwealth of $26,415.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In their appeal, the defendants claim that (1) the Attorney General\u2019s regulations and the judge\u2019s decision are not in accord with current interpretations of the Federal Trade Commission, contrary to the requirements of c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>and 2(c), see note 2, <em>supra; (2) </em>the granting of summary judgment was error in the face of the minimal number of complaints and an affidavit from the defendants\u2019 expert stating that the defendants\u2019 conduct was not deceptive; (3) the civil penalty was improperly assessed as the Commonwealth presented no evidence of actual harm from the defendants\u2019 deceptive acts; and (4) the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees was unsupported by the evidence. We affirm the judgment, as modified in accordance with this opinion, for substantially the reasons set forth by the judge in his careful and well-reasoned memoranda of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">1. <em>Summary judgment materials. </em>In support of its motion, the Commonwealth submitted the solicitation packages of the defendants,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> decisions of the United States Postal Service finding that the defendants had engaged in conduct violating Federal law by seeking money by means of false representations through the mail,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> interrogatories answered by the defendants, and affidavits, including nine from persons who stated that they had believed that the solicitation had come from the local phone company and would not have returned the solicitation had they known its source. The defendants produced affidavits and other material showing that other companies publish directories which are not affiliated with any telephone company, that both the term \u201cyellow pages\u201d and the \u201cwalking fingers\u201d logo are in the public domain, and that the defendants had obtained from the Massachusetts Secretary of State trademarks for \u201cThe Massachusetts Yellow Pages,\u201d \u201cThe New England Yellow Pages,\u201d and \u201cThe Yellow Pages of Massachusetts.\u201d They also presented an affidavit of Edward T. Popper, a business school dean and a former consumer research advisor to the Federal Trade Commission, which stated that he had \u201cconducted and reviewed results of a survey of potential mailing . . . recipients\u201d of the defendants \u2014 the affidavit gives no further details as to this survey \u2014 and concluded that \u201c[Reasonable recipients of th[e]se <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>mailings are likely to understand the nature of those mailings, the source of the mailings, and the nature of the directory listing being promoted\u201d and, hence, are not deceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">a. <em>Proper standard for determining deception. </em>The defendants base their argument that summary judgment was improperly granted on two grounds. We treat first their claim that the standard for determining deception set forth in the Attorney General\u2019s regulations, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>is contrary to the mandate contained in c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>and <em>(c), </em>see note 2, <em>supra, </em>and that this incorrect standard was applied by the judge. Section <em>2(b) </em>of c. 93A states the legislative intent that courts, in construing which acts are deceptive, are to be \u201cguided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts\u201d to the analogous Federal statute, and \u00a7 2(c) provides that the rules and regulations of the Attorney General \u201cshall not be inconsistent with the rules, regulations and decisions of the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts.\u201d See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The defendants argue that 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.05(1), see note 3, <em>supra, </em>which prohibits a representation which \u201chas the capacity or tendency or effect of deceiving buyers,\u201d establishes an outmoded standard in view of the new criteria set forth in <em>Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., </em>103 F.T.C. 110, 164-165 (1984). That case found \u201cthis approach to deception [tendency or capacity to deceive] and violations of Section 5 [the Federal analogue to c. 93A, \u00a7 2,] to be circular and therefore inadequate to provide guidance on how a deception claim should be analyzed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164. The Federal Trade Commission then articulated what it believed to be \u201ca clear and understandable standard for deception.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>An act or practice will be found deceptive \u201cif, first, there is a representation, omission, or practice that, second, is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances, and third, the representation, omission, or practice is material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The decision, however, noted that these elements articulate the factors actually used in most earlier cases even if couched in terms of \u201ca tendency and capacity to deceive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165 (citation omitted). Thus, the \u201clikely to mislead\u201d requirement, the Federal Trade Commission noted, reflects the long-established principle that actual deception need not be proved. That the effect be on \u201cconsumers acting reasonably under the circumstances\u201d is likewise not a new requirement; an advertise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ment would not have been considered deceptive if unreasonably misunderstood by an unrepresentative class of persons. <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, the third element, materiality, that is, a representation or omission that \u201cinvolves information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product,\u201d was usually one of the factors considered in the deception cases. <em>Id. </em>at 165-166.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In refuting the defendants\u2019 argument that the two regulations, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>were inconsistent with the standard articulated in <em>Cliffdale, </em>the motion judge correctly concluded, based on Massachusetts law, that the newly articulated standard \u201cdid not represent a radical change in policy\u201d and that the \u201cnew test is rooted in established precedent and does not affect the validity of the Attorney General\u2019s regulations.\u201d He pointed to <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 156 (1985),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which requires the \u201ctendency to deceive\u201d standard to be construed in the context of a reasonable consumer, and that the misrepresentation be material. See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, <em>111 </em>(1980) (practice may be deceptive if it reasonably could be found to have caused the plaintiff to act differently than he or she otherwise would have acted). Lest there be any doubt that he was applying the correct standard,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the judge specifically adopted the <em>Cliffdale </em>test in interpreting both regulations, stating, \u201cFor purposes of this case, each of these regulations use[s] different words to express the same prohibition; namely, a solicitation package is deceptive if it contains mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>rial misrepresentations or omissions wMch are likely to mislead the recipients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">b. <em>Deception as matter of law. </em>Equally without merit is the defendants\u2019 contention that it was error to grant summary judgment because there were disputed issues of material fact concerning whether the defendants\u2019 solicitations were deceptive. The judge, based upon his review of the solicitation packages, concluded that they were deceptive as matter of law without resort to extrinsic evidence. We agree with his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Whether the defendants had the right to use the words \u201cyellow pages\u201d and the \u201cwalking fingers\u201d logo is not the issue; rather, the question is whether their use in the context of the solicitation as a whole was misleading. In some cases, whether a representation is deceptive within the meaning of c. 93A, \u00a7 2(a), may be determined as a matter of law. See <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass, at 156-157. In such cases, including those in which the representations are implied, the deceptive meanings can be determined \u201cthrough an examination of the representation, including an evaluation of such factors as the entire [solicitation], the juxtaposition of various phrases in the document, the nature of the claim, and the nature of the transaction.\u201d <em>Cliffdale, </em>103 F.T.C. at 166. While sometimes extrinsic evidence is required to show that reasonable consumers interpret the implied claims in a certain way, ibid., it is unnecessary here \u2014 the implied claims by the defendants are self-evident. The judge, within his discretion, properly could determine that neither expert opinion nor a public survey was called for. See <em>Kraft, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commn., </em>970 F.2d 311, 319 (7th Cir. 1992), cert, denied, 507 U.S. 909 (1993). See also <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>Amy Travel Serv., Inc., </em>875 F.2d. 564, 572-573 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 493 U.S. 954 (1989). As the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe defendants\u2019 use of the word \u2018yellow pages\u2019 and the \u2018walking fingers\u2019 logo was not, in and of [itself], deceptive. However, the conspicuous use of the \u2018walking fingers\u2019 logo and the words \u2018yellow pages,\u2019 together with the use of a local return address [], the promise of a \u2018free white-page listing,\u2019 the reference to an account or reference number and a directory representative combine to give a strong impression that the solicitation package was sent to an existing customer by the publisher of the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>telephone company \u2018yellow pages\u2019 directory. The defendants\u2019 solicitation packages, taken as a whole, were likely to mislead business consumers, acting reasonably under the circumstances, to believe that they were sent by the publisher of the local \u2018yellow pages\u2019 directory and that by responding to the solicitation package, the recipients were renewing an existing listing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">That the Commonwealth produced only nine affidavits does not show, as the defendants contend, that \u201cthis infinitesimally small number of complaints creates a strong inference that any confusion in the mind of this small number of consumers is immaterial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The affidavit from the defendants\u2019 expert did not create a genuine question of material fact. It improperly stated the ultimate fact and conclusion of law. See <em>Dolloff v. School Comm, of Methuen, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 502, 505-506 (1980); <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>Amy Travel Serv., Inc., </em>875 F.2d at 573. The expert\u2019s partial reliance on a survey cannot in this case be viewed as competent evidence. He provided no details as to the number of consumers who were questioned, what questions they were asked, who they were, or where the survey took place. Even in the absence of a motion to strike, a judge may disregard material in an affidavit that would not be admissible in evidence. See <em>Baptiste </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 119, 126 (1993). Since no questions of material fact were presented, and the issue was properly a matter of law, the judge was warranted in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Quite rightly, the judge determined the disclaimer referred to in note 5, <em>supra, </em>too inconspicuous to be sufficient. See <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Read Magazine, Inc., </em>333 U.S. 178, 185-186 (1948); <em>Removatron Intl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Trade Commn., </em>884 F.2d 1489, 1497 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">2. <em>Damages and attorney\u2019s fees. </em>At the special hearing on damages, the defendants did not contest the issuance of the injunction; they had already ceased doing business in Massachusetts. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>On appeal, they also do not challenge the restitution damages awarded to the nine businesses on whose behalf affidavits had been filed. The defendants focus on the civil sanction penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>In awarding $1,000,000 against the defendants, the judge relied on the defendants\u2019 acknowledgment that they had, between 1990 and 1994, sent approximately 2,345,000 solicitation packages to businesses in Massachusetts. The judge correctly noted that each deceptive solicitation may be viewed as a separate statutory violation for which a judge may, under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 4, impose a separate civil penalty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 313-314 (1991). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc., </em>662 F.2d 955, 966 (3d Cir. 1981), cert, denied, 455 U.S. 908 (1982). Any penalty actually imposed is, however, subject to the limitation of judicial discretion. 662 F.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In exercising his discretion, the judge considered the factors set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass, at 311 (quoting from the <em>Reader\u2019s Digest </em>case at 967), namely, \u201c(1) the good or bad faith of the defendants; (2) the injury to the public; (3) the defendant\u2019s ability to pay; (4) the desire to eliminate the benefits derived by a violation; and (5) the necessity of vindicating the authority of the [Commonwealth]\u201d (in original, \u201cvindicating the authority of the FTC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The defendants fault the judge for using the <em>Fall River Motor Sales </em>factors, as that case involved a party who had violated a consent decree, a party considered more culpable as . can be seen from the fourth paragraph of c. 93A, \u00a7 4, which imposes a $10,000 penalty for each violation by persons who violate the terms of an injunction or other order issued under \u00a7 4. While the defendants are correct that the <em>Fall River </em>case involved a party who violated a consent decree, essentially the same factors apply when a consent decree or other court order is not involved. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>ELM Med. Labs., Inc., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 84 n.16 (1992). Thus, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(m)(l)(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>(1994) provides, \u201cIn determining the amount of such a civil penalty [for violating the analogue to c. 93A \u00a7 2], the court shall take into account the degree of culpability, any history of prior such conduct, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, and such other matters as justice may require.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>J.B. Williams Co., </em>498 F.2d 414, 438 (2d Cir. 1974) (\u201csize of the penalty should be based on a number of factors including the good or bad faith of the defendants, the injury to the public, and the defendants\u2019 ability to pay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In addition to the nine affidavits of the complaining businesses, the affidavit from the Attorney General\u2019s office setting forth that it had received seventy-five complaints, and an affidavit relating to attorney\u2019s fees, two other affidavits were submitted from employees of that office: on&amp; indicating that the employee had counted 2,616 Massachusetts companies listed in the \u201c1992 New England Yellow Pages\u201d; the second that another employee had counted 1,322 Massachusetts companies listed in \u201c1994 Yellow Pages, National Edition.\u201d The Commonwealth also calculated that approximately 10,000 Massachusetts business consumers advertised in the defendants\u2019 directories from 1990 to 1994, and that since each had paid at least $147 (the defendants had charged amounts from $147 to $196 annually for a listing), damages amounted to $1.47 million. Noting that the United States Postal Service had filed an administrative complaint on April 15, 1991, against the defendants, and that he had found that advertisers had derived little or no benefit from a listing in the defendants\u2019 directories, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cThe defendants have known since at least 1991 that their solicitations were in fact misleading consumers. Indeed, it is reasonable to infer that this was their objective. There is no evidence in the record of the defendants\u2019 ability to pay a penalty. The defendants refused to produce discovery showing the income realized from Massachusetts consumers. It is reasonable to infer that a conservative estimate of the losses incurred by Massachusetts consumers who were deceived by the defendants exceed one million dollars. In order to punish the defendants and to deter them as well as others from engaging in similar schemes in the future to bilk Massachusetts consumers, a civil fine equal to the conservative estimate of the damages sustained by Massachusetts consumers is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>within the court\u2019s discretion to impose, particularly where the defendants have not been required to pay any significant restitution. For these reasons, the court will impose a civil penalty of one million dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Accepting the rationale of the judge, we consider a modification of the award to be in order. The Commonwealth\u2019s number of 10,000 advertisers over the period 1990-1994 appears to be derived by taking an approximate average (2,000) of the two figures of 2,616 and 1,322 contained in the affidavits of the employees of the Attorney General and multiplying that figure by five. Since the judge attributed knowledge to the defendants from at least the time of the administrative complaint of the United States Postal Service (April 15, 1991), caution suggests that advertisements prior to that time should not be counted. Accordingly we reduce the civil sanctions to $733,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defendants\u2019 contentions concerning the award of legal fees of $26,415 are without merit. The judge took into account the proper factors, and the award was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">As modified herein, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2, as inserted by St. 1967, c. 813, \u00a7 1, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201c(a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201c(b) It is the intent of the legislature that in construing paragraph (a) of this section in actions brought under sections four, nine and eleven, the courts will be guided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to sections 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), as from time to time amended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201c(c) The attorney general may make rules and regulations interpreting the provisions of subsection 2(a) of this chapter.
