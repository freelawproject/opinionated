L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, set out below at note 5, requires a private company, under contract with a municipality to provide refuse collection and disposal services, to pay wages at \u201cprevailing rates\u201d (as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [commissioner]) to the trash collectors who load and operate the compacting machinery at the backs of typical trash trucks. The cases arise out of contracts held by the defendant Vining Disposal Service, Inc. (Vining), to provide trash collection services to a number of municipalities, including the defendant town of Burlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In 97-P-1087, the plaintiffs are nondriver employees of Vining whose work includes collecting the trash, dumping it into the hopper at the back of the trash trucks, and activating the compacting equipment. Known as \u201cshakers\u201d due to the nature of their work, they claim that Vining unlawfully paid them wages at less than the prevailing rates mandated by the statute. A judge of the Superior Court entered summary judgment for Vining, reasoning that the plaintiff \u201cshakers\u201d were not \u201coperators\u201d of \u201cequipment\u201d under section 27F because \u201cequipment\u201d refers only to automotive items and \u201coperators\u201d refers only to persons controlling the direction and speed of such items, that is to say, the drivers. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In 97-P-1728, the plaintiff is the Attorney General,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who sought a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1, that Vining\u2019s contract with the town of Burlington is governed by section 27F and is therefore void for failing to contain a copy of the applicable prevailing wage rate schedule. Another judge of the Superior Court ruled (contrary to the judge in the shakers\u2019 action) that section 27F was applicable to the shakers, but that the contract was not void because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>contained a provision incorporating \u201call terms required to be included by [cjhapter 149,\u201d thus satisfying the mandatory \u201cstipulation requiring prescribed rates of wages\u201d under section 27F. Summary judgment was entered ordering Vining to comply with section 27F and pay the prevailing rates. We consolidated Vining\u2019s appeal from that judgment with the shakers\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The dispute centers on the meaning of portions of three phrases in the first sentence of section 27F that determine its scope.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One issue concerns the phrase \u201cpublic works,\u201d which Vining contends does not encompass the municipal collection of refuse. Another concerns Vining\u2019s assertion that a contract for services is not an \u201cagreement of lease, rental or other arrangement, [or] order or requisition.\u201d The final issue \u2014 the one deemed pivotal by the judge in the shakers\u2019 action \u2014 concerns whether the shakers are \u201coperators\u201d of \u201cequipment\u201d as those terms are used in the first sentence of \u00a7 27F.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">1. <em>\u201cPublic works\u201d </em>The term \u201cpublic works\u201d has not been comprehensively defined in our decisional law. See, e.g., G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 39M-P; G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27F; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>223 Mass. 109, 113 (1916); <em>Andover Consultants, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 158 n.4, 160 (1980); <em>Modem Continental Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>391 Mass. 829, 831-835, 838-839 (1984); <em>J. D\u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 112, 113-114 (1984); <em>Thorn Transit Sys. Intl., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 652-656 (1996). The reason is doubtless that the meaning of the phrase is somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>elastic, expanding or contracting with the statutory context. The core concept of \u201cpublic works,\u201d in Massachusetts and elsewhere, is commonly expressed as involving the creation of public improvements having a nexus to land, such as a building,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> road, sewerage or waterworks facility, bridge, or park. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lynn, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>281 Mass. 402, 403 (1933); <em>Andover Consultants, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra; J. D \u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra; Carter </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of Denver, </em>114 Colo. 33, 37-38 (1945); <em>Demeter Land Co. </em>v. <em>Florida Pub. Serv. Co., 99 </em>Fla. 954, 963 (1930); <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Common Council of Grand Rapids, </em>123 Mich. 567, 569 (1900); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1606 (6th ed. 1990); Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1836 (1993). A second category of activities sometimes associated with \u201cpublic works\u201d includes the work of maintaining or repairing such facilities. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 69D (by-law may vest town board of public works with power over \u201cmaintenance and repair of town buildings and property\u201d); G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27D (painting of public works and public buildings subject to prevailing wage law); <em>Felix A. Marino Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>426 Mass. 458, 459-461 (1998) (road repairs are \u201cconstruction of public works\u201d under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>W. Barrington Co., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 416 (1977) (street sweeping contract was for \u201cpublic works\u201d under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F); <em>Thorn Transit Sys. Inti., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 652-656 (upgrade of transit fare collection system is \u201cpublic work\u201d under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M). See also <em>Gaston </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>274 N.Y. 359, 363 (1937) (subway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>maintenance); <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>307 N.Y. 62, 67-68 (1954) (boiler repair); <em>Sewer Envtl. Contractors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goldin, </em>98 A.D.2d 606, 606 (N.Y. 1983) (sewer cleaning); <em>Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>143 Pa. Commw. Ct. 264, 267-269 (1991) (phone system replacement); <em>Probst </em>v. <em>Menasha, </em>245 Wis. 90, 91, 93-94 (1944) (sidewalk repair).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Finally, legislatures have at times used \u201cpublic works\u201d still more broadly to include activities with no immediate connection to fixed public improvements. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>316 U.S. 23, 27-30 (1942) (construction of private university library with public funds was \u201cpublic work\u201d under Miller Act); <em>Flying Tiger Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Landy, </em>370 F.2d 46, 49 (9th Cir. 1966) (contract between air carrier and United States Air Force to transport military personnel to Vietnam was \u201cpublic work\u201d contract under Defense Base Act); <em>Lelande </em>v. <em>Lowery, </em>26 Cal. 2d 224, 227 (1945) (publication of tax notices under contracts with county was \u201cpublic work\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>178 Mo. 272, 305-317 (1903) (municipal refuse collection is a \u201cpublic work\u201d). Significant for our purposes is G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 69D, which allows a town to create a board of public works, the role of which may under local law include the \u201ccollection and disposal of garbage and refuse\u201d \u25a0\u2014 a function that \u00a7 69D describes as one \u201creasonably related to the duties and responsibilities of a board of public works.\u201d See <em>Board of Pub. Works of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Wellesley, </em>377 Mass. 621, 621-622 (1979) (town board of public works was responsible for refuse disposal). Here, Burlington\u2019s superintendent of public works, having a supervisory role over the execution of the contract, has approval authority over changes in the collection schedule, the placement of dumpsters, and special collections. In construing \u201cpublic works\u201d in section 27F, we give weight to the role of boards of public works with respect to the activity in question. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>W. Barrington Co., 5 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Legislature\u2019s broad use of \u201cpublic works\u201d to include refuse collection and disposal dates at least to the 1953 enactment of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 69D (see St. 1953, c. 101, \u00a7 1) and thus preceded and was available to inform the later enactment of \u00a7 27F in 1960. See St. 1960, c. 795. We note also that, at least as early as 1975, the department was taking the position that \u00a7 27F required it to set prevailing wage levels for nondriver trash collection workers. Although at various times ascribing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the source of its authority to. \u00a7\u00a7 27B and 27C, sections which Vining argues persuasively are restricted to construction contracts, rather than to \u00a7 27F, the department has nevertheless been consistent in asserting that municipal trash collection contract workers must be paid prevailing wages, and, accordingly, has consistently issued wage rate schedules for municipal trash hauling contracts. While we do not give pivotal weight to the department\u2019s view, see <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), and cases cited, we agree with its position that the non-driver trash collection workers in these cases are entitled to receive prevailing wages as determined by the department. Here, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>W. Barrington Co., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 421, \u201cwe see no occasion for invoking the principle that an ambiguous penal statute is to be strictly construed against the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">2. <em>Service versus rental contract. </em>We similarly reject Vining\u2019s argument that a contract (such as this) for the services of an independent contractor falls outside of section 27F because it is not a \u201clease, rental or other arrangement, [or] order or requisition.\u201d Relying on a decision of only marginal relevance,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Vining asserts that because the term \u201cother arrangement\u201d (which alone is broad enough to encompass the instant contract) follows the specific words \u201clease\u201d and \u201crental,\u201d the former is limited by the doctrine of ejusdem generis to arrangements similar to a lease or rental. That canon of construction is not to be applied mechanistically whenever a string of terms is separated by commas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>369 Mass. 193, 195-198 (1975) (read broadly and in context, income from a partnership falls within the ambit of \u201csalary, wages or other compensation\u201d). Rather, it is designed to narrow broad language when the literal meaning of that language does \u201cnot fairly come within [a statute\u2019s] spirit and intent.\u201d <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 295 (1943). Here, we cannot say that the extension of the prevailing wage laws to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>certain service contracts is not fairly intended by a statute which, as we have already decided, similarly expands \u201cpublic works\u201d for prevailing wage purposes beyond the traditional realm of the construction of fixed improvements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See part 1, <em>supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>W. Barrington Co., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 419-420.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Vining also relies on the title of the Act creating \u00a7 27F \u2014\u25a0 \u201cAn act requiring payment of determined wages to operators of trucks and other equipment rented for use on public works,\u201d St. 1960, c. 795 \u2014 as reflecting that only contracts in the nature of a rental are within its scope. The title cannot here be treated as a reliable interpretive guide to the substantive provisions. Confining the section to rentals would ignore the broader connotation of the terms \u201corder\u201d and \u201crequisition,\u201d violating the maxim that \u201c[n]o portion of the statutory language may be deemed superfluous.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 354 (1974). The bill that culminated in \u00a7 27F was at first simply entitled \u201cAn act requiring payment of determined wages to operators of trucks and other equipment on public works,\u201d with no reference to rentals. See 1960 House Doc. No. 2407. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>were no amendments to the body of the bill prior to its passage, implying that at no point did the bill\u2019s meaning change. See 1960 Bulletin of the Committee Work 495. The title of the bill was altered to its final form by the Committee on Bills in the Third Reading (see 1960 Senate Journal 1260), \u201cwhose consideration is primarily concerned with draftsmanship rather than substantive policy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kraatz, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 201 (1974). The recaptioning, under the circumstances, must be regarded as inartful. \u201cIn any event the \u2018title to . . . [a] statute . . . cannot limit its operation to a field more narrow . . . than that established by the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Krasner, </em>358 Mass. 727, 730 (1971), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tilley, </em>306 Mass. 412, 417 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We also find no support for Vining\u2019s position in the fact that the statute applies only when vehicles or equipment are \u201cto be engaged in public works by the commonwealth or by a county, city, town or district.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F. Vining argues that this language must mean that the public works are conducted directly \u201cby\u201d the government, i.e., not by independent contracting. It is, however, no less natural to read the preposition \u201cby\u201d as modifying the verb \u201cengaged,\u201d so that the focus of the quoted language is the utilization of vehicles or equipment on public works at the behest of the government, whether directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">3. <em>\u201cOperators\u201d of \u201cequipment.\u201d </em>Contrary to Vining\u2019s argument, the reference to the \u201coperator\u201d of \u201ca truck or any automotive or other vehicle or equipment\u201d does not limit the application of \u00a7 27F to the drivers of such vehicles. That construction fails to give effect to the word \u201cother,\u201d which grammatically modifies both \u201cvehicle\u201d and \u201cequipment.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass, at 354. We are satisfied that a natural reading of \u201coperator\u201d of \u201cother vehicle or equipment\u201d is broad enough to include a shaker as the one who operates the truck\u2019s compacting equipment, which is, after all, the business part of the truck\u2019s function. This interpretation is not a stretch; it accords with the statute\u2019s plain language. See <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 910, 911 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">4. <em>Other issues. </em>Vining makes several technical arguments that we reject. One is that the shakers\u2019 action should be dismissed because a jurisdictional prerequisite was not observed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>namely, notice to the Attorney General at least ninety days prior to filing. Another is that, because \u00a7 27F is a criminal statute, it was error for the judge in the Attorney General\u2019s action to order injunctive relief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stratton Fin. Co., </em>310 Mass. 469, 472-474 (1941); <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Aucella, </em>369 Mass. 138, 146-147 (1975). Section 27F is primarily a remedial statute. The criminal penalty is specified only to encourage compliance with a civil duty. As such, it is properly treated as merely incidental and not as precluding the injunctive relief normally available to enforce legal duties. As the remedy sought in the shakers\u2019 action can be given in the Attorney General\u2019s action, a dismissal of the shakers\u2019 action now would serve no purpose but delay. Both actions are pending in the same court and involve the same issue. They should be consolidated on remand for the entry of a judgment that includes computation of the back wages owed to the shaker plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The judgment in the shakers\u2019 action (97-P-1087) is reversed, and the action on remand is to be consolidated with the Attorney General\u2019s action (97-P-1728) for further proceedings consistent herewith. The judgment in the Attorney General\u2019s action is affirmed but is to be enlarged to afford the relief sought by the plaintiffs in the shakers\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\">By St. 1996, c. 151, \u00a7 366, the Department of Labor and Industries became known as the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">The Department of Labor and Workforce Development (department), see note 3, <em>supra, </em>was the agency originally charged with enforcing the statute, but that duty was transferred to the Attorney General by St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7\u00a7 177, 390.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The statute, with the disputed phrases italicized, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201cNo <em>agreement of lease, rental or other arrangement, and no order or requisition </em>under which a truck or any automotive or other vehicle or equipment is to be engaged in <em>public works </em>by the commonwealth or by a county, city, town or district, shall be entered into or given by any public official or public body unless said agreement, order or requisition contains a stipulation requiring prescribed rates of wages, as determined by the commissioner, to be paid to the <em>operators of said trucks, vehicles or equipment. </em>Any such agreement, order or requisition which does not contain said stipulation shall' be invalid, and no payment shall be made thereunder.

A public building is not a \u201cpublic work\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, which requires competitive bidding for a contract for \u201cthe construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling or repair of any public work.\u201d Such contracts are instead governed by a separate public bidding statute. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-H; <em>J. D\u2019Amico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 113-114, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">By contrast, under the prevailing wage laws, a contract for the construction of a public building would seem to involve a \u201cpublic work.\u201d See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 26; \u00a7 27B (employer\u2019s statement of compliance must identify the \u201cbuilding or project\u201d on which its employees are working); \u00a7 27C (referring to \u201cpublic building or other public works\u201d). See also <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus, </em>v. <em>Lawrence Hous. Authy., </em>358 Mass. 202, 206-207 (1970); <em>Thorn Transit Sys. Intl, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp.

The case for ejusdem generis here is weakened by the fact that only two words precede \u201cother arrangement,\u201d which is then followed in close proximity by \u201corder or requisition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We find unpersuasive a theory advanced by Vining that the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting \u00a7 27F was to plug a previously existing \u201cgap\u201d in the prevailing wage laws (here, Vining refers to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27D) that allowed their circumvention if a government entity \u201crented\u201d operators and equipment for its own use on public works rather than hired a contractor to perform the same services. This theory has no support in the legislative history and in any event fails to explain the broadening of \u201cpublic works\u201d in \u00a7 27F to endeavors outside of the traditional arena of construction of fixed improvements, as well as the \u00a7 27F penalty provisions which are at variance from those in \u00a7 27C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Our reading of the <em>W. Barrington Co. </em>opinion convinces us that the contract in that case was for street sweeping services to be \u201cperformed by private contractors using their own employees and equipment,\u201d and not, as Vining contends, for the mere \u201crental\u201d of street sweeping machines with operators to be supervised by municipal personnel. See 5 Mass. App. Ct. at 417, 418 n.2, 419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> Vining\u2019s stance also assumes that the words \u201crequisition\u201d and \u201corder\u201d can refer only to physical items and not to the provision of services, a position which, according to accepted definitions and statutory usages, is debatable. See G. L. c. 8, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 16, \u00a7 4A; G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7\u00a7 29-31, 50; G. L. c. 28, \u00a7 4B; G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 13; G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11; G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 32. See also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1929, 1588 (1993) (defining \u201crequisition\u201d in part as \u201cact of formally requiring or calling upon someone to perform some action\u201d; defining \u201corder\u201d in part as \u201ca formal written authorization to deliver materials, perform work, or to do both\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We agree with the judge in the Attorney General\u2019s action that the contract was not void under \u00a7 27F, because the contract provision incorporating the requirements of chapter 149 necessarily included the prevailing wage stipulation required by that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
