The defendants\u2019 asphalt roof allegedly was installed in violation of certain restrictions contained in an instrument filed by the plaintiff with the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds in 1976. After a bench trial, the trial judge found for the plaintiff, and the defendants appealed from the final judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The defendants argue that the judgment requiring them to remove and replace their roof should be reversed for a variety of reasons, each of which is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We take the facts from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision, from documents admitted in evidence, and certain undisputed facts. In the mid-1970\u2019s, the plaintiff purchased a sixty-acre parcel of land in Sandwich to be developed under the name \u201cJacob\u2019s Farm Village\u201d (village). His plan was to create a village of eighteenth century style houses. To establish and maintain uniformity throughout the parcel, he selected a number of restrictive covenants, which he set forth in a document entitled \u201cDeclaration of Covenants, Restrictions and Reservations For Jacob M. Atwood, East Sandwich, Barnstable County, Massachusetts, Land Court Plan #13895C and #13895D\u201d (restrictions). The document was duly filed with the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Article 3.1 of the restrictions provides that \u201c[t]he rights, restrictions and reservations set forth in this Article III shall be enforceable by the Developer [i.e., the plaintiff].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Article 3.2 of the restrictions provides that \u201c. . . no alteration to the exterior of any structure shall be made unless complete plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved by the Developer.\u201d However, article 3.2 also provides that if no suit shall have been commenced by the developer within three months of the completion of any unapproved \u201calteration to the exterior of any structure,\u201d the developer\u2019s approval shall be deemed to have been granted. In addition, article 6.2 provides that \u201c[t]he Developer may waive or amend any of the covenants, restrictions, and agreements or charges herein contained but such waiver or amendment in any instance shall not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce any of such covenants, restrictions, agreements or charges thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Consistent with the restrictions, the plaintiff also created a specification sheet that he distributed to all potential buyers and builders. The specification sheet provided that the deed to the buyer will include a covenant that the developer reserves \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>right to approve in advance of construction, home designs . . . .\u201d The specification sheet also provided that \u201c[hjouses must have wooden roofs made with shingles or shakes.\u201d Thus, the defendants\u2019 house was originally constructed with a wood shingle roof which could not be altered under article 3.2 without the approval of the plaintiff as the developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s corporation, Jacob\u2019s Farm Village, Inc., owns lot 12, which is located at 2 Karla Lane. The plaintiff constructed and maintains a house on lot 12, which is called the General Brattle House (Brattle House).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Brattle House is located in a heavily wooded area. The plaintiff also continues to own fourteen or fifteen lots in the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Over the years, the plaintiff experienced numerous problems with the Brattle House. An excessive amount of moisture caused the paint to peel, and the house was required to be repainted virtually every other year since 1982. The wooden roof rotted, as did other parts of the house, such as the window sills, comer boards, clapboards, and fascia boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The underlying difficulty, according to the plaintiff, was that when the plaintiff\u2019s wife \u201cwas siting the foundation to this house she was very ill, and she goofed up a bit. . . . The foundation ended up being tucked back in a hole so you couldn\u2019t put a house on top of it. So to solve that, we poured another full foundation at the back of the house so there was two foundation heights tall, so it was literally [e]mbedded in the hillside.\u201d The house is approximately twenty to thirty feet below street level.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In an effort to mitigate these problems, the plaintiff consulted with a builder and an architect. He was advised that \u201cit would be silly to put another wood roof on there, it would rot away on very short order . . . .\u201d The construction of the house started in 1979 and the roof was replaced \u201cin the mid to late 80\u2019s . . . .\u201d As a result, the plaintiff implicitly waived the restrictions for his own benefit and installed an asphalt shingle roof on the house. He also removed fifty to sixty trees from lot 12 in an attempt to alleviate the moisture and rotting problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The defendants purchased lot 49, which is located at 6 Tarragon Drive, in 1987. The plaintiff had approved the plans that were submitted by the builder, and a wood shingle roof had been installed on the house. On December 12, 1991, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>defendants wrote to the plaintiff requesting permission to replace the wood shingles with asphalt, three dimensional, architectural shingles. The defendants wrote that they had noticed that the plaintiff had replaced his roof with asphalt shingles, and that the defendants\u2019 wood shingle roof \u201cis deteriorating after only 6 years.\u201d They also wrote that they needed to install an asphalt shingle roof on their house because their house \u201cis in a hollow, surrounded by trees and not conducive to the use of wooden cedar roof shingles.\u201d The plaintiff replied by letter dated January 28, 1992. He wrote, \u201cI have carefully reviewed your request in your December 12, 1991 letter to me and I am afraid that your requests are all made with \u2018tongue in cheek.\u2019 The circumstances that permitted an exception on Lot 12 certainly do not exist at your home, and hopefully we can all spend more time addressing our concerns at Jacob\u2019s Farm without being facetious.\u201d On May 21, 1992, defendants\u2019 counsel repeated the request for permission to install asphalt shingles, and again permission was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Notwithstanding the refusal of permission from the plaintiff, the defendants proceeded to install an asphalt shingle roof on their house beginning on or about September 23, 1994. The plaintiff brought suit against the defendants on September 29, 1994, to compel them to comply with the restrictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a bench trial, the defendants were ordered to replace their asphalt shingle roof with a wood shingle roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">1. <em>Enforcement of the restriction pursuant to G. L. c. 184, \u00a727. </em>The restriction sought to be enforced is contained in article 3.2 of the Declaration of Covenants, Restrictions and Reservations: \u201cno alteration to the exterior of any structure shall be made unless complete plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved by the Developer.\u201d The defendants challenge the plaintiff\u2019s application of this restriction to their choice of roofing material. They argue that the judgment issued against them should be reversed because the plaintiff failed to prove that he is entitled to enforce the restrictions pursuant to G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 27. Section 27 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cNo restriction imposed after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred and sixty-one[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] shall be enforceable:\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">(a) unless the person seeking enforcement (1) is a party to the instrument imposing the restriction and it is <em>stated to be for his benefit </em>or is entitled to such benefit as a successor to such party . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The defendants argue that the plain language of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 27(a), requires any person seeking to impose a restriction on real property to state explicitly that the restriction is for his or her \u201cbenefit.\u201d Since the instrument created by the plaintiff in this case does not actually contain the word \u201cbenefit,\u201d the defendants argue that they cannot be ordered to comply with the restrictions set forth therein. We do not construe the statute so strictly; to do so would defeat the legislative intent of limiting the enforceability of restrictive convenants to the party who is the intended beneficiary of the covenants. No particular formula of words is required by the statute. See <em>Whitinsville Plaza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kotseas, </em>378 Mass. 85,- 98 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Here, the instrument in which the restrictions are set forth is entitled \u201cDeclaration of Covenants, Restrictions and Reservations <em>For Jacob M. Atwood, </em>East Sandwich, Barnstable County, Massachusetts, Land Court Plan #13895C and #13895D\u201d (emphasis added). Article 3.1 of the restrictions provides that the article 3 restrictions \u201cshall be enforceable by the Developer [i.e., Jacob M. Atwood],\u201d and not by any lot owner, as is the case with violations of article 2 restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In these circumstances, the plaintiff comes within the requirements of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 27(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">2. <em>Enforcement of the restriction pursuant to G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 30. </em>The defendants also argue that the restriction should not be enforced because the evidence does not support the conclusion that the restriction provides an actual and substantial benefit to the plaintiff. This contention is based on G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 30, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">\u201cNo restriction shall in any proceeding be enforced or declared to be enforceable . . . unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>determined that the restriction is at the time of the proceeding of <em>actual and substantial benefit </em>to a person claiming rights of enforcement\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We must accept the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Here, the trial judge found that the plaintiff was actually and substantially benefited by the restriction at the time of trial. The judge found that \u201c[t]he purpose of the declaration in this case is to create and preserve the aesthetic qualities and values of the Jacob\u2019s Farm Village which benefit both the plaintiff and all other homeowners in the subdivision .... The restrictions embodied in the declaration are of actual and substantial benefit to the plaintiff by ensuring that the quality and unique character of Jacob\u2019s Farm Village is maintained.\u201d After reviewing the record, we cannot say that this finding of fact is clearly erroneous. Cf. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Fall River Hous. Authy., </em>364 Mass. 492, 499-500 (1974) (restriction intended \u201cto assure the orderly and mutually beneficial development of [an] entire area\u201d was of actual and substantial benefit to the plaintiffs); <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Rosenshein, </em>420 Mass. 319, 321 (1995) (\u201c[t]o be \u2018actual,\u2019 the benefit must come from the existence and enforceability of the restriction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 30, further provides that even where an actual and substantial benefit is found to exist, a restriction shall not be enforced or declared to be. enforceable if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cchanges in the character of the properties affected or their neighborhood, in available construction materials or techniques, in access, services or facilities, in applicable public controls of land use or construction, or in any other conditions or circumstances, reduce materially the need for the restriction or the likelihood of the restriction accomplishing its original purposes or render it obsolete or inequitable to enforce except by award of money damages. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The trial judge found \u201cno credible evidence of changes in the character of Jacob\u2019s Farm Village which would obviate the need to have the plaintiff approve any proposed changes to the exterior of the homes or reduce the likelihood that such approval will accomplish its purpose.\u201d She found that because the development of the village is not yet complete, the plaintiff\u2019s approval of changes to the homes continues to be necessary to achieve the unique characteristics of the subdivision. These findings, too, are not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendants also argue that enforcement of the restriction is prohibited by another provision of G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 30, which states that no restriction determined to be of actual and substantial benefit shall be enforced or declared to be enforceable if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cin case of a common scheme the land of the person claiming rights of enforcement is for any reason no longer subject to the restriction or the parcel against which rights of enforcement are claimed is not in a group of parcels still subject to the restriction and appropriate for accomplishment of its purposes \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The defendants claim that because the plaintiff has retained the right to enforce as well as waive the restrictions, none of the plaintiff\u2019s land \u201cis <em>effectively </em>subject to the plan approval restriction (nor any other restriction)\u201d (emphasis added). This argument has no merit for the reasons described below regarding the appropriate remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 30, also provides that no restriction determined to be of actual and substantial benefit shall be enforced or declared to be enforceable if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">\u201ccontinuation of the restriction on the parcel against which enforcement is claimed or on parcels remaining in a common scheme with it or subject to like restrictions would impede reasonable use of land for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>purposes for which it is most suitable, <em>and </em>would tend to impair the growth of the neighborhood or municipality in a manner inconsistent with the public interest or to contribute to deterioration of properties or to result in decadent or substandard areas or blighted open areas . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The defendants argue that the installation of a wood shingle roof would impede the reasonable use of their land because a wood shingle roof is more expensive to install than an asphalt shingle roof. The trial judge found that \u201c[ejxpense alone does not impede the reasonable use of land.\u201d The judge was not clearly in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In conclusion, we find that neither G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 27, nor G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 30, precludes the enforcement of the restrictions in this case. Thus, the restriction found in article 3.2, which provides that \u201cno alteration to the exterior of any structure shall be made unless complete plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved by the Developer,\u201d is valid and enforceable by the plaintiff as applied to the defendants\u2019 choice of roofing material.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">3. <em>The plaintiff\u2019s remedy. </em>Although we have determined that the restriction is enforceable by the plaintiff, there remains the question whether he is entitled to injunctive relief. The defendants claim that the trial judge improperly ordered them to remove the asphalt shingle roof from their house and replace it with a wood shingle roof. They argue that pursuant to G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 30, the most the plaintiff was entitled to receive was monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 30, provides in part that no restriction determined to be of actual and substantial benefit shall be enforced or declared to be enforceable, except in appropriate cases, by the award of money damages unless the \u201cconduct of persons from time to time entitled to enforce the restriction has rendered it inequitable to enforce except by award of money damages,\u201d or, unless enforcement \u201cis for any other reason inequitable or not in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The defendants argue that the conduct of the plaintiff bars him from receiving injunctive relief in this case. They claim that the plaintiff should not be permitted to exempt himself from the restrictions while forcing other homeowners in the development to comply with them at the same time. They submit that the plaintiff\u2019s installation of an asphalt shingle roof on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Brattle House and his subsequent refusal to approve the installation of a similar roof on their home precludes him from obtaining any relief other than monetary damages. The trial judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s reasons for denying the defendants\u2019 request to install an asphalt shingle roof were neither arbitrary nor capricious. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 30, is consistent with prevailing law. Courts will refuse to enjoin the violation of a restriction, which the plaintiff has previously violated, by invoking the equitable doctrine of \u201cunclean hands,\u201d see 9 Powell, Real Property \u00a7 60.09, at 60-130; \u00a7 60.10[1], at 60-136 (1999), or \u201cbreach of corresponding promise.\u201d See Restatement of Property \u00a7 560 (1944). Decisional law in Massachusetts follows this rule. See <em>Loud </em>v. <em>Pendergast, </em>206 Mass. 122, 124 (1910) (\u201cWhere a plaintiff has violated the very restriction he seeks to enforce to substantially the same extent and in the same general way as has the defendant, and there is no material difference in kind or degree between them, a court of equity will not ordinarily interfere\u201d); <em>Balcolm </em>v. <em>Normile, </em>255 Mass. 186, 188 (1926) (equitable relief denied where plaintiff\u2019s conduct \u201cof the same character as the alleged breach ... by the defendant\u201d). \u201cIf the plaintiff\u2019s violation is insignificant and the defendant\u2019s violation is substantial, courts will grant injunctive relief. If, however, the plaintiff\u2019s breach is substantial, even though not as pronounced as the defendant\u2019s, injunctive relief will be denied.\u201d 9 Powell, Real Property \u00a7 60.10[1], at 60-136 \u2014 60-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Restatement of Property addresses this issue in \u00a7 560, entitled Breach of Corresponding Promise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cThe continuing violation of the obligation arising out of a promise respecting the use of land by one who is entitled to enforce a corresponding promise against another disables the one so violating the promise from securing injunctive relief against substantially like violations of the corresponding promise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In this case, the \u201ccorresponding promises,\u201d as defined in comment b<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of \u00a7 560, are the promises that were made by both the plaintiff and the defendants to install wood shingle roofs on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>their houses. The defendants\u2019 violation of the corresponding promise is \u201csubstantially like\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s violation, as the defendants constructed their roof with the same type of material utilized by the plaintiff on the Brattle House, and for substantially the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Applying c. 184, \u00a7 30, and other authorities cited above, we conclude that the plaintiff is not entitled to injunctive relief. The plaintiff\u2019s difficulties, as the plaintiff admitted, were of his own doing: the plaintiff and his wife had inappropriately sited their house in a wooded hollow twenty to thirty feet below street level. The consequence was that the plaintiff would have to replace a wood shingle roof every ten years or so, as he had done in the \u201cmid or late 80\u2019s.\u201d This was only about one-half the expected life of a wood shingle roof.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To extricate himself from the situation he had created, the plaintiff proceeded to install an asphalt roof on his house, the sole purpose of which was to save the plaintiff expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The defendants are equally at fault. Confronted with poor workmanship by the builder from whom they purchased the house, coupled with the fact that the house was sited in a hollow surrounded by trees, they installed an asphalt roof, without the necessary permission, solely to save expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Both parties are bound by the restrictions each willingly and knowingly accepted, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>and there is nothing in the restrictions, explicitly or implicitly, that provides relief by waiver or otherwise simply on the ground that there is an unwanted cost of complying with those restrictions. That was the risk both parties assumed by accepting the restrictions. The unchallenged evidence at the trial makes it clear that the plaintiff\u2019s violations of the restrictions are fully equal to the defendants\u2019 violations. Both parties should be held to the bargain they made. The case is similar to <em>Tehan </em>v. <em>Security Natl. Bank, </em>340 Mass. 176, 182-185 (1959) (plaintiff required to remove their own encroachment of the easement \u201cas a condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>precedent to ending the [defendant\u2019s] similar encroachment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Accordingly, the amended judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court. At the election of the plaintiff, and upon his application to the Superior Court within ten days of the date of the rescript, the defendants may be ordered to remove their asphalt roof and to install a wood shingle roof upon the condition that the plaintiff is ordered to remove his asphalt roof and install a wood shingle roof. If the plaintiff does not so elect, the case shall forthwith be dismissed with prejudice and without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b534-16\">The original judgment ordered the defendants to comply with the restrictions. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to amend the judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>requesting that the court specifically order the defendants to replace their asphalt shingle roof with a wood shingle roof. This motion was allowed, and a new judgment was entered on February 6, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Article II of the restrictions, which contains the more customary restrictions regarding residential developments, is enforceable by the owner of any lot in the subdivision, including the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The plaintiff makes no claim that his house was free of the restrictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The plaintiff was denied a preliminary injunction against further construction by the defendants on October 20, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The restriction at issue was imposed in 1976 and thus is governed by \u00a7 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-8\">General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 30, also provides that \u201c[tjhere shall be a presumption that no restriction shall be of such actual and substantial benefit except in cases of gifts or devises for public, charitable or religious purposes, if any part of the subject land lies within a city or town having a population greater than one hundred thousand persons . . . .\u201d The trial judge found that the population of the town of Sandwich is less than one hundred thousand persons and that the presumption therefore does not apply.
