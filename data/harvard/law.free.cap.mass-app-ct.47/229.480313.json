The Commonwealth claims that the judge\u2019s findings of fact were not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the evidence and that the judge erred in concluding that the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We summarize facts found by the motion judge, with amplification from uncontested facts in the record, including the judge\u2019s oral findings of fact. Thomas L. Birch, an investigator with the department, was assigned to investigate a report filed pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A. The report alleged that the defendant had sexually abused his ten year old daughter and her ten year old friend. In October, 1996, Birch and Officer Reichert of the Sharon police department observed, via a two-way mirror, a \u201cSAIN\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> interview with the friend conducted by a representative of the Norfolk County district attorney\u2019s office. Birch testified, and the judge found, that at the conclusion of the \u201cSAIN\u201d interview they determined that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a criminal investigation. They decided that Birch rather than Officer Reichert should interview the defendant because Birch would be able to obtain more evidence than a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On October 24, 1996, Birch went to the defendant\u2019s home. He told the defendant that, as a result of a report of possible sexual abuse of the defendant\u2019s daughter\u2019s friend, he was there to conduct a social services interview for the benefit of the children, the family, and the department. Birch also told the defendant that, because this was not a criminal investigation, he was not accompanied by a police officer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and did not need to advise the defendant of his Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">During the course of the interview, the defendant made incriminating statements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Concerned about how intently Birch had been listening to him, the defendant asked Birch whether he should have an attorney present. Birch responded that it was \u201cone of his rights, [but that] it wasn\u2019t necessarily necessary at that point in time.\u201d Toward the end of the interview, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>defendant had incriminated himself further, Birch told the defendant that his conduct was criminal and that evidence of potentially criminal acts \u201ccould\u201d be given to the district attorney. At the end of the interview, Birch told the defendant that the investigation would continue and that he would be in further contact with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The judge found, and the defendant conceded, that the defendant did not make his statements as a result of a custodial interrogation, and that <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), was therefore inapplicable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426, 432 (1999), quoting from <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990) (\u201cMiranda warnings are only necessary where one is the subject of \u2018custody and official interrogation\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>407 Mass. 37, 41 (1990) (defendant not in custody during interview by the department\u2019s investigator to substantiate a 51A report and therefore not entitled to Miranda warnings).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The judge discredited parts of Birch\u2019s testimony and found that Birch\u2019s characterization of the interview as a \u201csocial service interview\u201d was a contrivance to advance prosecution interests and obtain evidence against the defendant; that Birch and the police officer decided that Birch would be able to obtain more evidence than the officer; and that Birch lulled the defendant into a false sense of security regarding the nature and purpose of the interview by placing him \u201cin a mental frame of mind so that he felt free to speak without fear of incriminating himself.\u201d The judge concluded that a \u201csufficient degree of mental coercion\u201d existed such that the defendant \u201cresponded with information he otherwise would have refused to provide had he been aware of the criminal nature of the interview,\u201d and suppressed the statements as involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201cIn reviewing whether a statement was made voluntarily, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact unless not warranted by the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 144-145, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). The judge\u2019s ultimate findings, while open for review, are afforded \u2018substantial deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Although the <em>Miranda </em>decision was not implicated here,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cthe admissibility of [the defendant\u2019s] statements at trial is governed by the due process standard of .voluntariness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 679 (1975), cert, denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 376 (1964). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>407 Mass, at 41-42 (question at motion to suppress statements made to department social worker is voluntariness of statements). \u201c \u2018Due process requires the Commonwealth to persuade the judge . . . that the statement was voluntary before it is admitted at trial,\u2019 and Massachusetts\u2019s \u2018humane practice\u2019 requires that the Commonwealth prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt, first to the judge, and, if the judge finds the statement voluntary, the jury, too, must be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement is voluntary. Otherwise it must be disregarded.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 203 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass, at 151-152. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 9.1 (6th ed. 1994 &amp; Supp. 1999). The same analysis applies to statements made to private individuals as to police officers. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bandy, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 331 n.l (1995), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>395 Mass. 448, 456 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>410 Mass. 506, 511 (1991) (\u201cA confession [or admission], whether made to police or to a civilian, is admissible only if it is voluntarily made\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201cThe test for voluntariness of a confession is \u2018whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was overborne to the extent that the statement was not the result of a free and voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>428 Mass. 478, 483-484 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass, at 395. See <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739 (1969). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass. 381, 387-388 (1996). \u201cThere is no easy acid test for voluntariness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass, at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The traditional factors indicating voluntariness or lack thereof, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986) (\u201cpromises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency [whether the defendant or the police], and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings\u201d), are of little relevance to our discussion. In considering the totality of the circumstances of the interview, the judge properly relied on Birch\u2019s failure to inform the defendant that incriminating evidence would be passed on to the police, particularly Birch\u2019s mischaracterization of the interview as a \u201csocial services\u201d interview. While the judge made no finding that Birch intentionally failed to tell the defendant that incriminating evidence would be relayed to police, the judge was entitled to consider the effect on the defendant of Birch\u2019s misrepresentation, intentional or not. Birch testified, and the judge found, that he was legally obligated, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B(4), and 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.50-4.53 (1993), to inform the police of any incriminating evidence obtained during the interview. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>407 Mass, at 38 (if a 51A report is substantiated, department files a 51B report with the office of the district attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u201cMisinformation by the police does not necessarily render a confession involuntary,\u201d but it is a factor to be considered. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass, at 395. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, 377 </em>Mass. 552, 563 (1979), cert, dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980) (\u201cTaken alone, the misinformation would not, we think, suffice to show \u2018involuntariness\u2019 . . . but the judge could view it as a relevant factor in considering whether the defendant\u2019s ability to make a free choice was undermined\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magee, </em>423 Mass, at 389 (\u201cpolice deception regarding the facts of a particular crime or the existence of evidence linking the defendant to the crime [does] not, by itself, render a confession involuntary\u201d). The significance of the distinction here is that the misleading information went to the nature of the interview, not the facts or evidence involved in the case. Birch aggravated his misrepresentation by stressing that he was not required to give Miranda warnings, implying that anything the defendant said would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>be used against him. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 663 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>426 Mass. 168 (1997) (the use of \u201cnonexistent incriminatory information\u201d is not enough to tip the scale to a finding of involuntariness), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass, at 393, citing <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Spring, </em>479 U.S. 564, 576 (1987) (the defendant \u201cmust not be tricked or coerced into abandoning [Miranda] rights\u201d), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, ill </em>Mass. 319, 325-329 (1979) (where police \u201cpursue a course of conduct aimed at improperly convincing a defendant to relinquish the right to remain silent,\u201d statement should be suppressed). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, 377 </em>Mass, at 564-565 (statement suppressed as involuntary where, inter alia, police misled defendant about the consequences of a confession).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">While \u201c[t]he presence of one or more factors suggesting a statement may have been made involuntarily is not always sufficient to render the statements involuntary,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass, at 664, on these facts the judge did not err in suppressing the statement. Based on Birch\u2019s representation to the defendant that the interview was not a criminal investigation and that he (Birch) did not need to give the Miranda warnings, that he (defendant) did not need an attorney, and his (Birch\u2019s) failure to inform the defendant until the end of the interview that any incriminating evidence would be relayed to the police or district attorney, the judge was warranted in concluding that the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that the defendant\u2019s will was overborne in that he was lulled into a false sense of security. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>407 Mass, at 42 (statements made to department social worker admissible where judge found them prompted not by coercion but \u201cthe defendant\u2019s decision that his cooperation would best serve his own interests\u201d). The judge\u2019s subsidiary findings were supported by the evidence and his ultimate finding of involuntariness was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant raises for the first time on appeal the requirements of 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.27(5) (1993), which provides that \u201c[a]t the time of first contact with parent(s) or caretaker(s), the investigator shall deliver to said individual a statement of rights which shall include written notice that a 51A report has been made, the nature and possible effects of the investigation, and that information given could and might be used in subsequent court hearings.\u201d While the regulation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>not before the judge, the judge was evidently concerned that the defendant was not advised of the ramifications of his conversation with Birch.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had the departmental regulation been an issue at the motion hearing, Birch\u2019s violation of it would have been another factor for the judge to consider in evaluating whether the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary. It would not, in itself, mandate suppression. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caze, </em>426 Mass. 309, 311-312 (1997) (where defendant is intentionally deprived of his right to make a telephone call pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A, evidence obtained as a result should be suppressed; the same rule has not been extended to unintentional deprivations). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass, at 567 (police officer\u2019s failure \u201caffirmatively to comply with [G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 33A,] is a factor in deciding whether a confession, vulnerable on other grounds, should be suppressed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The order suppressing the defendant\u2019s statement is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Sexual Abuse Investigation Network.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Birch testified that he also had told the defendant at the outset that he (defendant) did not have to speak with him, but the judge made no finding on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\"><em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The content of the statements is not clear from the record. Birch testified that the defendant told him that his daughter\u2019s friend spent a lot of time at his home, including overnights; that the defendant acknowledged being \u201cvery affectionate\u201d with his daughter and her friend, including kissing and hugging the girls; and that Birch and the defendant had discussed whether the defendant had offered his daughter\u2019s friend money for anything, including hugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Even if not required, whether Miranda warnings were given is a factor to be considered under the due process standard of voluntariness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Thus, whether Birch was an agent of the police, as the defendant claims, is not controlling. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>402 Mass. 275, 278 (1988) (where a private citizen was functioning as an instrument of the police and the defendant was in custody, the defendant was entitled to Miranda warnings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\">After the court inquired of Birch what his duty would be regarding law enforcement following an initial investigation, the judge observed that, even though <em>Miranda </em>was inapplicable, \u201c[the defendant] should have been given some kind of notice, I think. I think I\u2019d want [some authority] that says that he\u2019s not to be advised \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have to be advised that what he says is going to be used against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
