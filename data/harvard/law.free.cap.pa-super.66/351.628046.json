He conveyed this real estate \u201cunder and subject\u201d to the mortgage to a person whom he described in his statement of claim as a \u201cstraw man.\u201d The latter conveyed the land to the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Subsequently the association foreclosed the mortgage, and the sheriff\u2019s sale did not realize enough to pay the water rent for two years, the taxes for three years, and portion of the mortgage. The association entered up judgment on plaintiff\u2019s bond, and plaintiff in his own relief paid the amount of the association\u2019s claim. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the mere averment that the plaintiff believed and expected to be able to prove that his grantee was a \u201cstraw man\u201d is not such an averment of fact as would entitle plaintiff without further proof to a judgment for a portion of the mortgage unpaid; (2) that defendant was not liable for the water rent; (3) that plaintiff was entitled to recover for the taxes inasmuch as he was subrogated to the rights of the association against the defendant as to the taxes.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-4\"><em>Deeds </em>\u2014 \u201cUnder <em>-and Subject\u201d </em>\u2014 Mortgage\u2014Straw <em>man.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-5\">Where a deed is made under and subject to a mortgage, and it is the intention of the parties that the grantee therein named shall be a \u201cstraw man\u201d who will immediately convey the property to another person, the grantee of the straw man assumes no personal liability for the payment of the mortgage.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b394-6\">Argued Dec. 11,1916.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkX\">Appeal, No. 348, Oct.

The statement further averred that \u201cplaintiff is informed and believes and expects to be able to prove at the trial of the cause, that the said I. Clarence Pennington had no financial interest in said conveyance, but that said-conveyance was made to him as a \u2018straw man\u2019 and in trust to be immediately conveyed to the said Robert Neely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">September 21,1916, the defendant moved for judgment for want of a sufficient statement of claim. September 23,1916, the plaintiff moved for judgment for want of an answer. The court discharged defendant\u2019s rule and made absolute that of the plaintiff. Prom this action we have the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">A rule of the Municipal Court, as appears from appellee\u2019s paper book, provides that rules for judgment for want of a sufficient statement must be filed within five days after service thereof, and, as the docket entries show that defendant\u2019s motion Avas not made until fifteen days after service, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The second assignment avers error in the entry of judgment for want of an answer. None was filed. Nevertheless, the statement of claim must be sufficient to support the judgment or it must fall. A statement must be self-sustaining; it must set forth in clear, concise terms, a good cause of action; such averments of fact as, if not controverted, would entitle him to a verdict for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>amount that is claimed: Chestnut St. Nat. Bank. v. Ellis, 161 Pa. 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The plaintiff is seeking to recover for three separate items. 1. Water rent for the years 1915 and 1916\u2014 134.40. 2. Taxes for 1914, 1915, and 1916 \u2014 $279.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">3. The balance on the judgment obtained by the mortgagee against O\u2019Donnell not produced by the property sold with costs of suit and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The averment that plaintiff believes that Pennington was a \u201cstraw man\u201d is not such an averment of fact as, if not controverted, would entitle him without further proof to a judgment. Even if properly averred, and admitting that Pennington was a \u201cstraw man,\u201d the inference is not clear that the implied covenant, resulting from the use of the words \u201cunder and subject,\u201d arises. Clearly the intention of the parties was that it should not arise. In Aronson v. Heymann, 56 Pa. Superior Ct. 501, the same course of procedure was pursued and this court said, Porter, J. (506) : \u201cThe words in the agreement (straw bond) meant that this defendant should not be required to assume a direct liability to Carrie Gansman for the payment of the amount of the bond, nor should he be required to furnish a bond made by a party who was financially satisfactory to her.\u201d In either event, the plaintiff\u2019s statement is not sufficient to warrant judgment for any liability arising from the use of the words \u201cunder and subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Independently of such liability there can be no recovery for the water rent, as there was no personal liability therefor: Theobold v. Sylvester, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 362, but the registered owner of a property is liable for taxes assessed thereon during his ownership. There is, therefore, a liability resting upon the defendant for this item. It will be noted, however, that this suit is not by the mortgagee in the foreclosure suit, but by the mortgagor. If the association had been the plaintiff, undoubtedly the judgment for taxes would be sustained: Landreth v. McCaffrey (No. 1), 17 Pa. Superior Ct. 272; Edwin Forrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Home v. Shattuck, 64 Pa. Superior Ct. 239; Hogg v. Longstreth, 97 Pa. 255. To relieve Ms bond, tbe mortgagor was compelled to pay tbe taxes to tbe mortgagee. He is, therefore, subrogated to tbe rights of tbe mortgagee-. In <em>Or. </em>Council of Pa. Royal Arcanum v. Cornelius, 198 Pa. 46, Fell, J., said (50) : \u201c......one who has been compelled to pay a d\u00e9bt which ought to have been paid by another is entitled to exercise all-the remedies which the creditor possessed against that other</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The statement of claim sufficiently avers that the plaintiff was compelled to pay a debt for which the defendant was primarily liable. The right of subrogation is, therefore, complete. To this extent, the judgment should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The record is remitted to the court below with direction to modify the judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
