O. Rankin, executor of Rebecca McCullough to Roy J. Rinehart by deed dated April 1,1903, for a consideration of two hundred sixty-five and 25-100 ($265.25) dollars, which deed was recorded August 23, 1906, in Franklin County Deed Book, Yol. 143, page 89. R. J. Rinehart by deed dated the 28th day of May, 1905, recorded in Franklin County Deed Book, Yol. 143, page 90, conveyed the same land to George Barnes. Barnes at the time of purchase of the land by Rinehart from McCullough\u2019s executor and at the time of the conveyance by Rinehart to him was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>employ of Rinehart, who was a farmer owning the farm which the property conveyed to Barnes adjoined. Rinehart bought the property for the purpose of enabling Barnes to obtain a home, took the title in his name and gave the original judgment to secure the unpaid purchase-money. Barnes paid Rinehart the cash advanced by the latter in the purchase of the property and when conveyed by Rinehart to Barnes the property was subject to the lien of the judgment given by Rinehart to McCullough\u2019s executor. The judgment was not mentioned in the deed from Rinehart to Barnes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-3\">(b) Barnes died September 21, 1908. His will dated September 7, 1908, probated September 28, 1908, recorded in Franklin County Will Book, Yol. S, page 147, provides for the payment of his debts and devises the remainder of his estate to his wife, Nancy Barnes. Letters testamentary on the estate were granted to Roy J. Rinehart, the executor named in the will and the same person as the original defendant in the judgment. The estate left by Barnes consisted of eighty-three and 47-100 ($83.47) dollars of personal property and the land conveyed to him by Rinehart. A widow\u2019s appraisement in the estate of George Barnes was filed November 24,1908, by which all the personal property was set apart to Nancy Barnes, the widow, and the remainder of her $300 exemption, namely two hundred sixteen and 53-100 ($216.53) dollars was charged upon the real estate. Rinehart, as executor, wanted to sell the real estate and pay the judgment. The widow, Nancy Barnes, preferred not to have the real estate sold and agreed, after a conference with the executor and his attorney, H. H.' Spangler, Esq., that she would pay the debts of George Barnes, including the purchase-money judgment which is in controversy. She did, in fact, pay to Rinehart, who acted as her agent in the matter, the amount required to pay the debts of Barnes .other than the judgment. She was then advised that the judgment was a lien on the real estate and that the property might be sold in order to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>it off and that the property would not be hers until the lien was paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">(c) After this arrangement was made she leased the property to various tenants and has continued to do so until the present time.

Brubaker\u2019s Est., 59 Pa. Superior Ct. 109, the judgment we are compelled to enter here is clearly foreshadowed in the reasoning of the opinion of President Judge Bios in the case cited. The earlier statutes on the subject of the liens of judgments against the lands of deceased debtors were there carefully reviewed and their language and scope, as compared with the Act of May 3, 1909, P. L. 383, pointed out. The marrow of the decision in that case is clearly stated in these excerpts from the opinion. \u201cIt is to be presumed that the legislature knew of the construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tion that had been given to the earlier acts and intended to abrogate the rule the courts had deduced. This...... is the clear meaning of the Act of 1909. But did the. legislature intend it to have a retroactive effect? Unquestionably, to construe the act as applying to judgments obtained before its passage, where the decedent died after its passage, would not be giving such effect, and doubtless it should be so construed. But it would be giving it a retroactive operation to hold that a lien, which at the time of its passage was, as against heirs and devisees, unlimited as to time, was destroyed if the decedent had died more than five years before its passage, or, that it was converted into a lien of three years\u2019 duration if the decedent had died three years before its passage. If anything is clear, it is that the legislature deemed five years the reasonable time within which the holder of the lien should revive it, and it is only by holding that the plaintiff in the judgment in question had five years from the date of the passage of the act within which to revive its lien, that the act could be applied to the lien in question without giving it a retroactive operation. ......It is clear that when the judgment in question was originally entered (1893), when it was last revived (1903), and when the defendant in it died (1906), its lien was without limit of time as against the heirs and devisees of the defendant. As only three years had elapsed between the death of the decedent and the passage of the Act of 1909, we think it clear the lien was not divested, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The material facts of the case at bar are thus stated by the auditor whose careful opinion was adopted by the learned court below: \u201cThe important dates are these: May 22, 1908, judgment revived and continued as a lien on the real estate in question; September 21, 1908, George Barnes, owner of the land encumbered by the judgment, died; May 3,1909, date of passage of .the Act of Assembly; July 1,1915, amicable revival of the judgment entered May 22, 1908.\u201d It is thus apparent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>plaintiff in this judgment had allowed more than five full years after the date of the death of the debtor therein and more than five full years after the passage of the Act of 1909 to elapse without attempting to revive the lien of the judgment. There is no room therefore for the discussion of the question whether or not the statute could or should have any retroactive effect. Following our construction of it in Brubaker\u2019s Estate, supra, and again holding the legislature intended it to operate but prospectively, its bar has destroyed the lien of the judgment in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">We cannot excise from the operation of the statute all judgments that had been entered prior to its enactment. The legislative intent is too clearly expressed. We quote the language of the act: \u201cAll judgments which at the time of the death of a decedent shall be a lien on his real estate shall continue, etc.\u201d Nor is it possible, at this late day, to successfully argue it is not competent for the legislature to enact such a statute. Viewed from the standpoint of the common weal, statutes .of limitation are statutes of repose. It is, it always has been, to the interest of the State there should be within some reasonable time, to be defined by the lawmaking power, an end to litigation. The question was fully considered by this court in Shelly v. Dampman, 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 115, wh\u00e9re the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States were reviewed and followed. In Bowden v. The Philadelphia, W. &amp; B. Railroad Company, 196 Pa. 562, the subject of statutes of limitation, operating only on the remedy and not on the cause of action, was again carefully considered and the right of the legislature to enact such statutes was clearly upheld by our own Supreme Court. There remains nothing more for us to say on this branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">It is urged, however, upon our consideration the present devisee of the land in question is estopped to take defense under the Act of 1909 because she made a verbal promise to the executor of her husband\u2019s will she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>pay Ms debts, including the judgment in question. We cannot determine in tMs case what right of action, if any, would result from a breach of such a promise, or what would be the appropriate remedy to enforce such a right of action. We have before us a proceeding in rem. If by force of the law of the land the judgment in question had lost its lien as against the real estate it formerly bound, the execution process of the courts could not be successfully used to enforce the lien that once existed but had been lost through the failure of the plaintiff in the judgment to act within the reasonable time fixed by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\">The assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the court below dismissing the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report is affirmed. The appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
