Cadwallader, for and during the term of his natural life, and upon his decease or in case he should not survive me, then in trust to pay over the net income thereof to his wife Louisa S. Cadwallader, should she then be living for and during the term of her natural life, and upon the death of both of them, in trust to divide the said principal sum into two equal parts of twelve hundred and fifty dollars each and to pay the income of one of the said equal parts ......, And to pay the income of the other equal portion or sum of twelve hundred and fifty dollars to Llewellyn Cadwallader for and during the term of his natural life, and upon his death or in case he should not survive his parents, then to divide the said sum of twelve hundred and fifty dollars among his children share and share alike. The child or children of any deceased child or children of the said......Llewellyn Cadwallader to represent his, her or their parent or parents in the distribution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-11\">David S. Cadwallader and Louisa S. Cadwallader, who were the parents of Llewellyn Cadwallader, both predeceased the testatrix. At the time of the death of the testatrix, Llewellyn Cadwallader was unmarried and without children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-12\">The exceptants contend that the latter part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>recited clause, which gives to Llewellyn Cadwallader the income of the principal sum for life, and at his death the principal to his children, vests the principal sum absolutely in him; in other words, that the word children is used by the testatrix as a word of limitation. The auditor has decided that \u201cchildren\u201d is used as a word of purchase, and has awarded this legacy to the trustee, who is directed by the will to pay the income to Llewellyn Cadwallader for life and at his death to his children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-5\">If the word \u201cchildren\u201d is to be construed as a word of purchase, they take by way of purchase, and the trust is not an executed one, but must be kept alive to support the remainder, and the auditor\u2019s conclusion is right; if, on the other hand, the word \u201cchildren\u201d is to be construed as a word of limitation, then the word operates by analogy to the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, to define the interest of the life beneficiary as an absolute one, and the ex-ceptant is right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-6\">Prima facie the word \u201cchildren\u201d is a word of purchase, and will be construed as such, unless it appear from the will that the word has been clearly used as a word of limitation. This is the ordinary case of a legacy in trust for one for life and at his death to his children, with but two special features, one is the superadded words of distribution, share and share alike, the children of deceased children taking a parent\u2019s share, and the other is the fact that at the death of the testatrix Llewellyn Cadwallader had no children. The first feature in the use of the word children is inconsistent with the thought of heir in a long line of lineal descent, because it provides for a division transversely: Chew\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 23. The second feature goes back to Wild\u2019s Case, 6 Coke 6 a, the first resolution in which is, \u201cthat if A devises his lands to B and to his children or issue, and he hath not any issue at the time of the devise that the same is an estate {ail.\u201d This is for the reason that being real estate, unless the children were in esse at the death of the testator, the gift of the remainder would be void, but there was an expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>desire to provide for them, hence it was inferred that he intended to give the first taker an estate tail. But the rule in Wild\u2019s case does not apply to personal property: Myer\u2019s Appeal, 19 Pa. 113; Coursey v. Davis, 16 Pa. 29; Peale\u2019s Est., 31 Weekly Notes of Cases, 551. Moreover, in our case the gift is to a trustee in whom the entire interest vests, so that it makes no difference that there were no children in esse to take at the death of the testatrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-4\">The auditor has so well supported his conclusion on reason and authority, that it would be superfluous to traverse the same ground. To the many authorities cited by the auditor may be added Meyer\u2019s App., supra, which in itself is decisive of the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">It only remains to notice the authorities cited by the exceptant. In Simpson v. Reed, 205 Pa. 53, the word children is construed as a word of limitation, because in a subsequent clause of the will he uses the word heirs as synonym for children. There is no such feature in this case. A similar use of the word children as synonymous with heirs is to be found in Gilland v. Hallett, 210 Pa. 268; also in Asher v. Stewart, 216 Pa. 251, and in Smith v. Lindsey, 37 Pa. Superior Ct. 171. In Pifer v. Locke, 205 Pa. 616, the word issue is used as a synonym for children, which distinguishes it from our case. To the same effect is Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, and Campbell\u2019s Est., 202 Pa. 159. It is an estate tail in realty and an absolute estate in personalty, where the first taker takes for life with remainder to issue, and nothing to show that issue meant children in the restricted sense: Potts\u2019s App., 30 Pa. 168. Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 335, was a case of limitation for life and then to those entitled under an intestacy of the life tenant, which sheds no light on our case. Brinton v. Martin, 197 Pa. 615, was an ultimate limitation to the heirs of the first taker which is essentially different from our case. In Blair v. Miller, 30 Weekly Notes of Cases, 186, there was no limitation to the first taker for life, which differentiates it from our case. In Packer\u2019s Est. (No. 2), 216 Pa. 116, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>gift was to the first takers and their issue, which, of course, does not aid us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">The authorities cited by the exceptant do not support his exceptions. On the other hand the authorities cited by the auditor abundantly support his conclusion, to which, as heretofore stated, may be added Myer\u2019s App., supra, and note on children as a word of purchase or limitation, 12 Lawyers\u2019 Reports Annotated (N. S.), page 283, and note on the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, 29 Id. page 963.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">We therefore dismiss the exceptions and enter the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-8\">And now, December 4, 1915, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report be dismissed, and that the said report be confirmed, and that distribution be made in accordance therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-10\"><em>James G.

Lindsey, 37 Pa. Superior Ct. 171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-12\">While technically an estate tail cannot be created in personalty, words which would create an estate tail in realty, when used as to personalty, give an absolute interest : Train v.
