A. F.

The plaintiff, after notifying the defendant that it would sell the sixty-five tons in the open market and hold the defendant responsible for any loss, did so sell them at a loss of $553.50.

The defendant denies all the averments of facts set forth in paragraph 2 of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, but on the contrary, avers that the plaintiff\u2019s production from the period beginning January 1, 1914, and ending December 31,1914, of rejected manufacturing bones was 285 tons, and of that amount the said defendant paid for and received 220 tons. The defendant admits that it refused to accept the 65 tons mentioned in said paragraph 2 because and by reason of the fact that it was no wise obliged, obligated, or liable to receive more than an additional 20 tons during the period mentioned. That the said plaintiff though due demand was made upon it by the said defendant prior to the 31st of December, A. D., 1914, in writing refused and neglected to deliver to the plaintiff the remaining 20 tons by reason of which breach the said plaintiff ought not to be suffered or permitted to maintain this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">3. The defendant denies all the averments of fact set forth in paragraph 3 of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claims, and avers that the deponent or the said defendant has no knowledge of the market price alleged to have been obtained by the said plaintiff for the 65 tons mentioned in said paragraph 3 nor any alleged loss consequent thereto, and demands that if the plaintiff deem the same material due and legal proof thereof be given upon the trial of this cause. The said defendant admits the notice of an intended sale in the open market by the plaintiff as is averred in said paragraph 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">The court made absolute rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-4\"><em>Jacob Weinstein, </em>with him <em>Joseph Moss, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1I\">\u2014 An ambiguous contract shall be construed by the acts of the parties thereto in the performance thereof: Thatcher v.

On the last month sixty-five tons were shipped, which defendant refused for the rea- \u2022 son that the contract of sale contained a clause which limited the quantity of the rejected manufacturing bones it was required to take. This clause read: \u201cProduction estimated to be fifteen to twenty tons per month.\u201d Defendant claims the maximum that it could be held for was twenty tons per month, and it was not compelled to take any beyond that amount. The bones refused were sold by the plaintiff in the open market and a loss was sustained of \u00ab1553.50. Our inquiry is directed to the meaning and effect of this clause. Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u201cestimate\u201d as \u201can approximate judgment or opinion as to weight, magnitude, cost and the like; a calculation without measuring or weighing.\u201d Similar definitions are given by other lexicographers. \u201cAs a verb, to judge and form an opinion of the value, from im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>perfect data; to fix the worth of roughly, or in a general way; to form an opinion of, as to amount, number, etc., ......to make an estimate of; to calculate roughly\u201d: 16 Cyc. 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Ho doubt the sense in which the word is used and the idea intended to be expressed by its use may be determined from the instrument, and such meaning may be different from the accepted meaning of the word. There is nothing in this contract to vary its ordinary meaning. The contract was to purchase all the rejected manufacturing bones. The subsequent provision in no way limited that contract. It was merely instructive as to the probable purchase and output, which might be more or less than the quantity mentioned. To hold that it fixes the maximum quantity would be to give to the words the effect of an actual computation instead of an approximate calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">If the plaintiff did not sell in the most advantageous market, the defendant should have so stated in its affidavit, and a positive statement of sale in the open market is not denied by an averment that the defendant does not know the market price.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
