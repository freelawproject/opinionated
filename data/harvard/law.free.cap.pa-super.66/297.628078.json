Rubin Rochester and Ettie Rochester, defendants, and Richard Building &amp; Loan Association, Garnishee.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AVr\">Before Orlady, P.

J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">Newhoff has obtained a judgment against Rochester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>and Ms wife, and issued thereon an attachment execution, which has been served on the Richard Building and Loan Association. On its answers to his interrogatories he now asks that it be adjudged that the garnishee has in its hands certain shares of its capital stock belonging to one of the defendants and that these shares are subject to his attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-3\">It appears by the answers that Rochester owns five shares of the stock of the garnishee and that these have in due form been pledged to it as collateral security for the payment of the condition moneys of a certain bond held by it, which was further secured by a mortgage on real estate that formerly belonged to him. In proceedings on that mortgage, the defendant obtained a judgment under which its damages were assessed at $1,159.17. A sale of the mortgaged property under a levari facias produced a fund of $1,050, out of which, however, must be paid certain claims whose lien has precedence over that of the mortgage in judgment. These amount to about $250.00. Their payment will reduce the sum in the hands of the sheriff to $800.00, and leave a deficiency of approximately $360 on the debt due the garnishee. The withdrawal value of the Rochester stock is $235; and the garnishee claims the right to apply this upon the balance owing it on the bond above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-4\">It is argued on behalf of Newhoff that under the decision in Hamilton Trust Co. v. Hoskins, 244 Pa. 1, a building and loan association that holds shares of its stock pledged as collateral for the payment of a debt, secured also&gt; by a mortgage of land,.must, if it would avail itself of the pledge as against an attaching creditor of the pledgor, appropriate the withdrawal value of the stock to the extinguishment of the debt before resorting to the mortgaged real estate; that, as the garnishee in \u2022 this case did not do this before suing out the scire facias on its mortgage, it cannot do so now; and that the stock in its hands is therefore discharged of the pledge and subject to his attachment only. No such proposition, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ever, as that referred to by the plaintiff was laid down by the Supreme Court in the case mentioned. All that was there decided was that a sheriffs sale of property under a judgment satisfies the judgment debt to the extent of the proceeds applicable to its payment; and that an execution creditor whose debt is thus paid cannot relinquish his claim on the fund raised by such, sale in favor of a subsequent lien creditor and look for the money already paid to him in contemplation of law to stock belonging to the judgment debtor held by way of pledge for the debt, to collect which the execution was issued, when the effect of so doing would be to defeat the claim of another creditor of the defendant by whom that stock has been attached. The right of the pledgee of stock in such a case to appropriate its value toward the payment of the mortgage debt at any time before the debt has been actually or constructively paid is expressly recognized in the opinion filed by the court. In this case the garnishee\u2019s debt has not been satisfied in full by the sale of the mortgaged property, and its right to take advantage of Rochester\u2019s pledge cannot be doubted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-2\">The plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment must be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-4\"><em>Walter Willard, </em>with him <em>Maurice G.
