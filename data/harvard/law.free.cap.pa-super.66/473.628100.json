The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and judgment was entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The suit was between the owner of the motorcycle and the owner of the building in which the distraint was made. The tenant was not a party, so that the condition of his rent account with the landlord was not material to the issue under the.facts of this case. If there was no rent in arrear, or if legal notice of the sale had not been given, the landlord in either event would have been a trespasser ab initio, but if there was rent in arrear and legal notice of the sale, still if the motorcycle belonged to the plaintiff and notice was' given to the landlord or, his bailiff, a trespass was committed in selling the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>erty of the plaintiff: Brown v. Stackhouse, 155 Pa. 582. The material questions were whether the motorcycle was the property of the plaintiff, was on consignment, and of these facts the landlord\u2019s bailiff had knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The facts having been found as contended for by the plaintiff, and it being purely a question for the jury, and having been properly presented, the assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
