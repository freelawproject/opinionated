J., granted the compulsory nonsuit and overruled a motion to take it off. Judgment of nonsuit was thereupon entered, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ assigning for error, <em>inter alia, </em>the refusal of the court to take off said nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-16\"><em>MoSweeney </em>and <em>R. Brown </em>(N. <em>Grossman </em>and <em>Byles </em>with them), for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-17\">It appears from the record in this case, that the sheriff, on May 24th, 1880, filed in the prothonotary\u2019s office his sworn return to the writ of ejectment, stating therein that he had served the same personally on I. G. Howe and John Eaton, terre tenants, by giving to each of them a true and attested Copl- and informing them of the contents thereof, and that J. A. Wing and A. R. Sellew were not found in his bailiwick.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-18\">It also appears, that on December 23d, 1880, W. W. Brown, Esq., entered a general appearance and plea for all of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>fendants. The prothonotary, however, did not enter file-names of the additional parties (Howe and Eaton), served by sheriff, as defendants in the action, in accordance with the provisions of the second section of the Act of Assembly of April 13th, 1807. Had this been done it must be conceded by the defendants in error, that the sheriff\u2019s return of service on I. G. Howe and John Eaton would have stood as <em>prima fade </em>evidence of their being in possession of the disputed,premises. We think that in this case it would have been evidence against all the defendants, under the pleadings .* see Dietrick <em>v. </em>Mattier, 10 S. &amp; R, 151; Gratz <em>v. </em>Benner, 13 Id., 110 ; Cooper <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Id., 26. And if so, surely the plaintiff\u2019s rights should not be prejudiced by the omission of the prothonotary to perform his clerical duties. It is true that the sheriff\u2019s return is only <em>prima fade </em>proof of defendants\u2019 possession: Helfenstein <em>v. </em>Leonard, 50 Pa. St., 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-4\">We submit that J. A. Wing and A. R. Sellew, the original defendants, by their unnecessary appearance and plea of not guilty, have thereby admitted themselves to be in possession of the whole land in controversy : see Ulsh <em>v. </em>Strode, 13 Pa. St., 433; Hill <em>v. </em>Hill, 43 Pa. St., 521 see also Freedly <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 2 Barr, page 100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">The defendants, J. A. Wing and A. R. Sellew, filed no disclaimer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-6\">Upon this point it was said by the Supreme Court in Steinmitz <em>v. </em>Logan, 3 Watts, 162, that \u201cby the Act of the 13th of April, 1807, service of the writ is made evidence of the defendants\u2019 possession ; but he is permitted to disprove it, having disclaimed title.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-7\">\u201cThe defendants, though not summoned, appeared on the return of the writ by attorney, as they had a right to do, and joined in pleading in bar of the action.\u201d After this it was no longer optional for the plaintiff to proceed or not against them if he wished to recover possession: see Mosher <em>v. </em>Small, 5 Barr, page 223 ; see also Michew <em>v. </em>McCoy, 3 W. &amp; S., page 501, on the effect of an appearance in ejectment; and see the case of Wilson <em>v. </em>Willard, 2 Central Law Reporter, 292.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-8\"><em>M. F. Elliott </em>(Gr. <em>L. </em>Roberts, IE <em>B. Smiley </em>with him), for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-9\">As to the possession of J. A. Wing and A. R. Sellew, if the appearance and plea could be treated as <em>prima faeie </em>evidence of their possession, the plaintiff by putting in evidence the return of the sheriff to the writ of ejectment affirmatively proved that at the time of its service they were not in possession, and could not be found in the county, and, therefore recovery could not be had against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u201cWhere a defendant in an ejectment does not intend to contest the plaintiff\u2019s right to the lease, it is not necessary for him to enter a disclaimer on record. The plaintiff in order to recover in ejectment must establish not only his title but also the possession of the defendants \u201d : McKenna <em>v. </em>Johnson, 19 Pa. St., page 434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABF\">\u201cThe defendant in ejectment may defend himself from all the consequences of an adverse verdict by showing that he was not in possession of the premises at the service of the writ or since. . Notwithstanding the return of the sheriff is evidence of the possession of defendant it is <em>only prima facie, </em>and may be rebutted by the defendant after the return is in evidence, which done he is entitled to judgment for costs \u201d: Helfenstein <em>v. </em>Leonard, 50 Pa. St., 461; Kirkland <em>v. </em>Thompson, 51 Pa. St., 216.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AED\">May 24th, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The opinion of the court was filed</p>\n<author id=\"b86-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AGm\">There is no error in the refusal of the court to take off the compulsoiy nonsuit. The evidence wholly failed to show that the defendants were in possession of the land in question; They were not served with the writ by the sheriff. The presumption of possession created by the statute, when the sheriff makes return under oath that he has duly served the writ on the defendants, does not exist. While an appearance and plea by counsel may lead to a verdict and judgment against the defendants, yet on the trial, it is necessary to prove that they were in possession of the premises. Failing in this, the nonsuit was properly entered. This view makes it unnecessary to consider the other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
