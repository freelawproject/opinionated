We, the defendant\u2019s counsel, propose to show that Mr. Diller understood the situation of the rolling mill, the boilers and the steam, and all about it, and that the company understood the same; and with all these matters in view and with a desire to accommodate Mr. Diller with the use of the foundry, which had been fixed up a short time before with the intention of renting it, with the desire of having a foundry there, and with the desire of furnishing Mr. Diller with an opportunity to try the experiment of running the foundry, this arrangment (the agreement) was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-11\">7. <em>Q. </em>Did he ever ask that the tools should be replaced, that were removed?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-12\"><em>Q. </em>Did Mr. Diller over do any work with the tools in the pattern shop when all the tools were there ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-13\"><em>Q. </em>Up to the time when the first tool was removed, in November, did Mr. Diller do any work in the pattern shop; any work on the tools in the pattern shop ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-14\">8.

That the company did not furnish the plaintiff, Diller, sufficient steam to do the business of the foundry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-18\"><em>2. </em>That the company failed to furnish or afford the said plaintiff, Diller, the use of the tools in the pattern shop, but removed them, or some of them, out of the shop, by dismantling said shop of shafting, and belting and pulleys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Now, those alleged breaches are the matters you are trying \u2014the breaches in the lease of \u201c Juty, 1880.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-5\">You cannot entertain in your deliberations any other matters pertaining to this contract of lease, or consider any evidence, that has been submitted to you, that does not bear on the inquiries. What are the breaches alleged \u2014 have they been proven to your satisfaction \u2014 what damages, if any, have been proven that the plaintiff has sustained \u2014 what damages in dollars and cents? [For in this action the judgment is damages for all, or any one of the breaches averred in the complaint of the plaintiff, and which the jury do find, from all the evidence in this case, have been proven.] (Ninth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-6\">[The first breach alleged is, as you will remember, was, that the company did not furnish the necessary amount of steam required for his, the said Diller\u2019s, engine, in carrying on his business \u2014 the foundry business, and by that means he suffered damages and losses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-7\">Is that a breach or'failure proven? If so, and if damages by reason of that failure have been shown to your satisfaction, you will allow the damages accordingly.] (Tenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-8\">[The other breach alleged is, that the company deprived the plaintiff of the use of the tools, or some of them, in the pattern shop, by removing machinery \u2014 the shafting and belting \u2014 and that he, the plaintiff, thereby suffered loss or damages. Now this alleged breach you will consider distinct from any other, and find and determine if the breach is proven, and will then find and determine if damages in consequence have been shown, and how much, if any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-9\">The amount of damages is for the jury, under the evidence in the case; it is exclusively for the jury, under the law and the evidence.] (Eleventh assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-10\">[Now, in conclusion, if the jury believe, from the evidenc\u00e9, that the breaches charged of a violation of the written agreement, have been made out, and if alleged damages to the plaintiff have been proven to your satisfaction \u2014 damages resulting from such breaches, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff, Diller, for such damages in dollars and cents ; the amount of damages is for the jury.] (Twelfth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-11\">The plaintiff presented, <em>inter </em>alia, the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-12\">1. The reasonable meaning of the clause in the lease made by the parties, viz.: \u201c That the second party hereto,\u201d Frank Diller, \u201cshall pay fifteen cents per hour for the steam furnished to his engine by the first party hereto,\u201d (Penn Iron Company, Limited), is that the steam just furnished by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>defendants and paid for by plaintiff at the rate stipulated, was to be in snch sufficient quantity, and at sucli reasonable times, as would enable Mr. Diller to do the work of the foundry up to its ordinary or reasonable capacity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-6\">Answer. Affirmed. (Thirteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-7\">The defendant presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-8\">1. There is no provision in the agreement between the parties in the suit, that binds the defendants to furnish the plaintiff with all the necessary steam required for his engine to carry on his business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-9\">Answer. Negatived. (Fourteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-10\">2. The agreement provides that Mr. Diller shall pay to the company fifteen cents per hour for steam furnished to his engine by the company. If they furnished Mr. Diller with steam, and he paid them at the rate of fifteen cents per hour, there is no breach by the company of that part of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-11\">Answer. We affirm this point with this modification, viz.: provided it is to be understood by the paragraph: \u201cIf they furnished Mr. Diller with steam and he paid them for the same at the rate of fifteen cents per hour,\u201d is to be understood, if they, the company, furnished Mr. Diller sufficient steam for his engine to carry on his business \u2014 his foundry business. (Fifteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-12\">4. This clause of the agreement (in reference to use of tools in pattern .shop and use of engine) is independent of the general provision thereof, and the only consideration wherein he was to pay for the use of the tools in the pattern shop was his furnishing the company with engine power. If, therefore, the jury believe that Mr. Diller cut off the steam of the company\u2019s boilers from his engine, and did not furnish engine power to company when they required it in the pattern shop, he cannot recover any damages on account of the removal of the tools.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-13\">Answer. The Court declines to affirm this asa legal proposition. (Sixteenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-14\">7. There is no evidence on which the plaintiff can recover damages for the loss of the use of the tools in the pattern sl\\pps \u2014 -if he did lose such use \u2014 except the one and a half day\u2019s work on the Myers contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-15\">Answer. The jury\u2019s province is to hear and decide whether there is not evidence on which the plaintiff can recover damages for the loss of the use of the tools in the pattern shop. (Seventeenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b655-16\">Verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and damages assessed at \u00a7750, and judgment thereon, whereupon the defendant took this writ and filed the assignments of error above shown.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-17\"><em>A.

The acts and conduct of Mr. Diller, as well as of the company, show very clearly that it was the intention of the parties when the agreement was made, that Mr. Diller should try the experiment of running his foundry with the waste steam of the company, and that he should pay at the rate of fifteen cents per hour for the same. The inducement to Mr. Diller to try the experiment being the cheapness of the steam and its conveniences.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-5\">Dr. Wharton, 2 Whar.

Co. <em>v. </em>Harlan, 3 Casey, 439, says: \u201c Covenants, like all other contracts, are to be construed according to the intentions of the parties as nearly as the words will permit; and there is no surer guide to the understanding and intentions of the parties, when words are equivocal, than their acts and declarations under the agreement, called commonly its contemporaneous construction.\u201d'</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-7\">To recover damages for the loss of profits resulting from the breach of a contract, the plaintiff must prove not only that he had been prevented from performing it by default of the defendant, but also that he has sustained actual loss thereby: Lentz <em>et al. v. </em>Chotean, 6 Wr., 435, 438; McKnight <em>v. </em>Ratcliffe, 8 Wr., 155, 169; Haak <em>v. </em>Wise, 2 W.

There was no agreement by the defendant to furnish any steam whatever to the plaintiff, and there was no leasing of any property or granting of any privilege which makes it necessary for the law to imply a contract by the defendant to furnish steam enough to the plaintiff to enable him to carry on the work of the foundry up to its ordinary capacity. The things leased to the plaintiff are, (1), certain premises known as the foundry building ; (2), yard space for necessary stock and materials; (8), the joint use of the pattern shop ; and (4), the engine room adjoining the foundry. There is certainly nothing here to indicate any obligation by the lessor to furnish any steam to the lessee for any purpose. Ordinarily, a foundry building and an engine room, contain their own motive power; and if they do not, such an extraordinary omission, if it is intended that the lessor shall supply the power, would be provided for by express terms in the lease. But certainly there is no implication in the mere lease of a foundry building, that the lessor shall furnish the steam to run it. In the lease, next after the subjects of the demise are defined, follows the complete obligation of the lessee to pay the lessor $500 rent for one year, payable monthly. The rent, therefore, was to be paid as the consideration of the things demised, and these did not include any steam, either expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Then another term is added to the contract, by which it is provided that the lessee \u201cshall pay fifteen cents per hour for the steam furnished to his engine \u201d by the lessor, \u201cand he shall have the right to use the tools in the pattern shop ; but in consideration therefor,\u201d the lessor, \u201c shall have the use without charge of the power of the engine\u201d of the lessee whenever they shall require it in tlie pattern shop. The plain and obvious meaning of these words is, that for whatever steam may be furnished by the lessor to the lessee\u2019s engine, the lessee shall pay fifteen cents an hour; but the lessor does not agree to furnish any steam, and the lessee does not agree to take any. But if steam is actually furnished to the engine, which means necessarily also if it is used, the lessee agrees that he will pay fifteen cents an hour for it. If the furnishing of steam by the lessor was a necessary incident to his lease of the promises, there would be an implied obligation to furnish it, and the ease would be parallel to Watson <em>v. </em>OTIern, and Koch and Ballist\u2019s Appeal and the kindred cases. But it is too manifest to require discussion, that there is no such implied obligation. This being the case, where the lessee simply agrees to pay for steam furnished without requiring the lessor to furnish any, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and without the lessor agreeing to furnish any, there is no other obligation than that which appears in the words employed. When the owner of a stone quarry or an ore mine leases his premises to one who is to pay a fixed price per ton for all stone or ore taken out, the very purpose of the lease is that stone or ore shall be taken out, and hence there is' an implied obligation to do so. But that obligation arises from a consideration of the necessary object and purpose of the contract. Without it the contract is a practical nullity. But no such situation arises out of the contract we are considering, and hence no obligation larger than its terms impose, arises from it. -These views require us to sustain, as we do, the 4th, 5th, 10th, 18th, 14th and 15th assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">We sustain the 1st, 2d and 3d, because the value of the lease, or any part of it, is not the measure of the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled for a breach of a particular covenant contained in it. If such a covenant was broken, the actual damage which resulted from the actual breach, can be and should be shown. To ask what was the value of the lease, lets in the wildest and most speculative conjectures, which the friendly zeal of the party\u2019s witness may choose to indulge in. If there was an injury done, let the witness state what it was, and how it was done; and if he can express the value of that particular injury in figures, let him do so. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We think the questions covered by the seventh and eighth assignments should have been allowed, as they bear directly upon the allegation of damages from loss of the use of the tools, and that subject being an open one, presented by the plaintiff, the defendant was as much entitled to give evidence in reply as the plaintiff was, in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">We do not sustain the ninth assignment, as it is only a general statement of the law applicable to any finding of damages, and we see no objection to it. The same is true of the twelfth assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">The sixteenth and seventeenth assignments are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
