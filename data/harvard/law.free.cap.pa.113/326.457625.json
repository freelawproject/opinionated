W. Bennetch, residing near Richland, Lebanon county, Pa., and asked him whether he did not know somebody who would have his life insured in his (the stranger\u2019s) favor, and would support him after he was unable to work. Bennetch said that he would ascertain. He then talked with his father-in-law, John Schmoltz, Sr., the defendant, after which, at the instance of Schmoltz, Bennetch went to Jacob Seigrist and began to negotiate with him for Schmoltz, for a policy on his (Seigrist\u2019s) life, by ask<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ing Seigrist what he wanted out of the money to be secured in the policy. The negotiation resulted in an arrangement whereby a policy for $8,000 was to be taken out on Seigrist\u2019s life in favor of John Schmoltz as beneficiary. Of this $3,000, the sum of \u00a92,800 was to be for the benefit of and paid to John Schmoltz, Sr., and \u00a9200 to pay the funeral expenses of said Jacob Seigrist after his death. It was also contracted at the same time between Seigrist and Bennetch for Schmoltz, that Schmoltz would keep Seigrist out of the poor house by providing for him after he was unable to earn a living, as long as the policy remained in force, or as tlie language of the policy lias it, \u201c$200 to pay the funeral expenses of said Jacob Seigrist : J. Schmoltz also agrees that Jacob Seigrist shall not become a pauper as long as this certificate is in force.\u201d Benneteh then returned to his father-in-law, the defendant, and reported to him the result of his negotiations with Seigrist, and the terms of tlie bargain, and as Bennetch testified, \u201c and the old man (Schmoltz) agreed to do it.\u201d \u201cThereupon the application was made and the policy taken out,\u201d for $8,000, and John Schmoltz held the policy and paid all the assessments and dues thereon down to the time of Seigrist\u2019s death. Seigrist continued working and supporting himself nearly, if not fully, two years after tlie policy was taken out, when the man with whom he was staying, on complaining to Schmoltz that the old man was sick, and that his house was uninhabitable, secured from Schmoltz the loan of \u00a9300 on a mortgage with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum, from liis wife to Schmoltz, on a house which she bought with this money. The mortgage was not fettered or cumbered with any conditions, but was a simple security for the loan of money. After Seigrist\u2019s death and the payment of the insurance money to Schmoltz, he paid the mortgage with interest for one year \u2014 \u00a9318\u2014in settlement of the claim for keeping Seigrist, and retained the balance of the \u00a92,800. This \u00a9318 is the entire amount paid by Schmoltz, besides the premiums, out of the \u00a92,800. Schmoltz was neither a relative nor a creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-6\">The plaintiff presented <em>inter </em>alia, the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-7\">2. The membership, in the Aid Society was the membership of Jacob Seigrist, and as such in the absence of an insurable interest in Schmoltz, lie, Schmoltz, can and could take nothing under it except for advancements made thereon, and the surplus of the money received by him on the policy belongs to the estate of Jacob Seigrist, the insured. Refused. (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-8\">4. The designation of John Schmoltz as beneficiary in the policy and the assignment to Emma Seigrist from the insured, both being unsupported by an insurable interest, other than as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a security for future advances and a debt of one hundred dollars, the transactions were speculative as to them; and the plaintiff in this case is entitled to recover, and the verdict of the jury must be in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the surplus of the money received by the defendant on the policy, after deducting therefrom all advancements and payments by him made on the security thereof. Refused. (Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-4\">In the general charge the Court instructed the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">In June, 1879, an application was .made to the U. B. Mutual Aid Society for an insurance upon the life of Jacob Seigrist. In accordance with that application, the policy before me was issued. It is dated the 8th clay of July, 1879, and it declares that Jacob Seigrist has become a member of the company, and that this membership entitles John Schmoltz, Sr., to \u00a72,800, \u2014 \u00a7200 to pay funeral expenses of said Jacob Seigrist: J. Schmoltz also agrees that Jacob Seigrist shall never become a pauper as long as this certificate is in force.\u201d Following that are these words, \u201c heirs or assigns,\u201d \u2014 and what I have just read is in parenthesis, \u2014 \u201cheirs or assigns, upon the death of said Mr. Jacob Seigrist to \u00a73,000.\u201d [In other words, it is a policy of insurance for \u00a73,000, of which \u00a72,800 are to go to John Schmoltz, and \u00a7200 are to go to pay the funeral expenses of Jacob Seigrist. In addition there is an agreement contained therein, by which Mr. John Schmoltz agreed \u201c That Jacob Seigrist should-never become a pauper as long as this certificate is in force. Schmoltz accepted this certificate, and thereby assumed this obligation, namely:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">The obligation to maintain Jacob Seigrist, and see that he did not become a pauper so long as this certificate is in force. The certificate remained in force until the death of Jacob Seigrist; and you have evidence here with regard to the way in which, and the extent to which, John Schmoltz fulfilled the obligation which was imposed upon him by this paper.] (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">[Now the question that we intend to submit to you is entirely a question of fact, namely: Whether or not this transaction was speculative in its character \u2014 whether it was so upon the part of Schmoltz \u2014 because that is the important question of course \u2014 whether it was upon the part of Schmoltz a speculution upon the life of Jacob Seigrist, or whether it was a <em>Iona fide </em>transaction; a transaction entered into upon his part in good faith, upon good motives \u2014 charitable or benevolent motives \u2014 with a disposition to befriend the man, who seemed to need friends; to support a man who seemed to need support \u2014 whether, in other words, the transaction is free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>from tbat taint which would make it void, namely: The taint of speculation.] (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">If Mr. Schmoltz, out of proper and commendable motives, undertook to support this man, we say to you that in our judgment he had a right to insure his life for the purpose of reimbursing himself for the outlays which he might reasonably expect to be called upon to make; and we think this view is supported by a case which was cited upon the argument here, namely: The case of the Reserve Insurance Company against Kane, in which a son was allowed to insure the life of his father; and one of the grounds on which it was put was that he might be obliged to pay for the support of his father, or that there might be cast upon him in certain contingencies the duty of supporting his father ; and that being so, he had a right to insure his father\u2019s life, and protect himself against the outlays which he, that is, the sou, might be called upon to make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">[I repeat briefly in conclusion, if you find that the transaction was in good faith, undertaken for the honest purpose of support, and that this policy was fairly taken out to reimburse Schmoltz for the outlays which at that time it was likely he would be called upon to make, then it is a good transaction, and the administrator of Seigrist cannot recover.] (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">Verdict for the defendant and judgment thereon, whereupon the plaintiff took this writ and assigned for error the refusal of his second and fourth points, and those portions of the general charge included within brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-9\">J. <em>P. S. Grobin </em>and <em>Bassler </em>Boyer, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arb\">It is not sufficient that the sale and purchase of a policy may have been in good faith and with correct motives. The mischiefs resulting from a sale of a policy for speculating on human life is so contrary to the policy of the law and so in conflict with the just principles of life insurance that it is unsafe to relax the rale that the holder of the property must have some pecuniary interest in the life of the person insured. Permitting the assignee to retain the sum he had paid to the person insured, and. to the company with interest thereon, so far protected the assignee and enforced the rule based on public policy, as to give no just reason to complain: Downey <em>v. </em>Hoffer, 16 W. N. C., 185.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-10\">The insurable interest is that which existed at the time the insurance was effected, not tliat which may exist at the time of the death of 'the insured.\" Scott <em>v. </em>Dickson, 16 W. N. C., 182; Dalby <em>v. </em>Life Ins. Co., 15 C. B., 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-11\">The right to insure for future reimbursement or outlays is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>different in the case of a stranger from that of a son, as in the case of Res. Mut. Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Kane, 31 P. F. S., 155, which was quoted by Judge McPherson in his charge to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">It was for the Court to say whether the transaction was speculative or not, instead of submitting it to the jury on a question of good faith: Moore <em>v. </em>Small, 7 Harris, 468; De France <em>et al. v. </em>De France <em>et al., </em>10 Casey, 390; Todd <em>v. </em>Campbell <em>et al., </em>8 Casey, 252.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">Schmoltz, a stranger in every sense, cmrld take this policy on the life of Siegrist only as security for payments and advancements made on the credit thereof. After these have been deducted, as contended for in our points to the Court, the balance under all the decisions of this Court from Gilbert <em>v. </em>Moose, 8 Out., 74, to Downey <em>v. </em>Holler\u2019s Admr., <em>supra, </em>was a portion of the estate of Jacob Seigrist.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-7\"><em>John Benson </em>and <em>Josiah Funolc (Grant Weidman </em>with them), for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"And\">In Scott <em>v. </em>Dickson, 16 W. N. C., 181, it is held that, \u201cThe essential thing is, that the policy shall be obtained in good faith, and not for the purpose of speculating upon the hazard of a life in which the assured has no interest.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">The policy in this case was in no sense wagering. It was given to a kind, charitable and benevolent friend to reimburse him for the money which he would be called upon to expend in supporting and maintaining the insured, and which established the relation of debtor and creditor, and created an insurable interest on the life of the deceased. This case is entirely different from the cases cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, and does not come within the ruling of the cases cited by them. In those cases the speculative and wagering character of the transactions is admitted, or at least not seriously controverted, and the principles laid down by the Court in them are not applicable in a case like the one in hand, and are no authority, and do not in the least affect this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-9\">The case expressly comes within the ruling of this Court in the Keystone Mutual Association <em>v. </em>Beaverson, 16 W. N. C., 188, and is directly in point and on all fours with this case, and rules it.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aca\">October 4th, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-10\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"AIz7\">delivered the opinion of the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">John Schmoltz, the defendant below, who was named as the beneficiary in the policy on the life of Jacob Seigrist, being neither a creditor nor near relative of the assured, took no interest therein, except as hereinafter stated. The Court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>fell into the error of holding that the question was one of good faith on the part of the beneficiary. \u201cNow,\u201d says the learned judge, in his charge to the jury, \u201cthe qviestion that we intend to submit to you is entirely a question of fact, namely: Whether or not this transaction was speculative in its character; whether it was so on part of Schmoltz, because that is the important question. Whether it was on part of Schmoltz a speculation on the life of Jacob Seigrist, or whether it was a <em>bona fide </em>transaction \u2014 a transaction entered into on his part in good faith; upon good motives, charitable or benevolent motives; with the disposition to befriend the man who seemed to need friends; to support a man who seemed to need support; whether, in other words, the transaction is free from that taint which would make it void, namely: The taint of speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">But as we have intimated, the question is not one of good faith, but of public policy: Downey <em>\u00b6. </em>Hoffer, 16 W. N. C., 185. The intention of John Schmoltz in obtaining this policy may have been innocent and pure, but this cannot be regarded, for the fact remains that he was in no way interested to maintain the life of Jacob Seigrist, and it is certain, the sooner that life was extinguished the better it was, in a pecuniary point of view, for the beneficiary. Nor does it help the matter, but rather the contrary, that the defendant had charged himself with the support of Seigrist, for all the more would his pecuniary interest be advanced by the termination of Seigrist\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Doubtless, the defendant, having entered into an agreement for the maintenance of the insured, might take a policy on his life in order to protect himself to the extent of that charge, even as a creditor may insure his debtor to the extent of his debt, for in that case he would gain nothing by Seigrist\u2019s death, though he might not be interested to maintain his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">It follows, that Schmoltz had an insurable interest in the life of Seigrist to the amount that he actually paid for his support, or which he advanced, in money, or otherwise, in fulfillment of his contract. So, in addition to this, would he be entitled to the money he expended in taking out and maintaining the policy; in other words, ho must be fully reimbursed for all his legitimate expenses, including lawful interest, and for the balance the administrator is entitled to a judgment. As what we have said in effect sustains all the assignments of error, we need not consider them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">The judgment of the Court below is reversed, and a new <em>venire </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
