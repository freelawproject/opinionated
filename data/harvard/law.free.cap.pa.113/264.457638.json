W. Biddle </em>and <em>S. </em>Hepburn, <em>Jr. (Fleming MeQarrell </em>with them), for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU3\">The rule requiring an affidavit of defence so far as book accounts are concerned, refers of course only to such items as are the legal subject of book entries, and as are susceptible of proof by books of original, entry. The account in this case is not for goods sold and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>livered, nor for work and labor done, and we confidently submit that not a single item of the account is a proper subject for book entry, or susceptible of proof by books of original entry. The first item is, \u201c To numbering two houses on Vernon street, 40.\u201d The plaintiffs were not engaged in painting or numbering houses. Their business, so far as it can be gathered from the pleadings, was that of selling real estate, or real estate brokers. The first item manifestly means cash paid for numbering houses. The same is true of the four items for advertising houses. That cash payments cannot be proven by books of original entry is too well settled to admit of discussion. The only other item in this account is the 4 per cent, commission on the sale of the Walnut street house. The amount of these commissions depended upon the contract between the parties, and could not be proven bjr entries which one party chose to make in his books. There is no allegation or affidavit in the statement of claim filed that the defendants, or either of them, ever agreed to pay these commissions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">In Hale\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Ard\u2019s Executors, 12 Wr., 22, it is ruled that \u201c an item of commission for collecting a sum of money is not a proper subject for a book charge.\u201d This decision is settled law and has been universally followed. Greal <em>v. </em>Noll, 1 W. N. 0., 26, decides that commissions of a broker for sale of real estate are not proper subjects of a book charge. This was a Common Pleas case decided by Judges Paxson and Finlettek.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">To the same effect precisely are McStay <em>v. </em>Dugan, 2 W. N. C., 226, and Sylvester <em>v. </em>Thompson, 11 Id., 203 ; Hadley <em>v. </em>Fitler, 12 Id., 461.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">The book of original entries was not proof of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and the only affidavit filed was to the effect that the account was a correct copy of the books of original entry. Surely this was not the proof required by the statute to sustain a judgment against a married woman.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-9\">In Parker and Wife <em>v. </em>Kleeber &amp; Brother, 1 Wr., 251, it is ruled that \u201c no definition of family necessaries can be given, but must be left to the jury in each case as it arises.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-10\">Following this decision it has been ruled that judgment cannot be taken against a married woman for want of an affidavit of defence: Scott <em>v. </em>Wilmer, 1 W. N. C., 41; Eisenberry <em>v. </em>Negus, 2 Id., 445 ; Cooper <em>v. </em>Wallace <em>et ux., </em>7 Id., 468 ; Debraham <em>v. </em>Walker <em>et ux., </em>3 Id., 26 ; Lippiucott and Wife <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 7 P. F. S., 328; Lippincott <em>v. </em>Leeds, 27 Id., 422.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-11\">We confidently submit therefore that the learned judge erred in deciding that the statement of the cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>was sufficient to support the judgment, and that the judgment must be stricken off because the declaration does not contain the necessary averments and proof to sustain it. The absence of these averments in the declaration, we respectfully contend, renders the judgment void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-4\"><em>Francis Jordan (James M. \"Weakley </em>with him), for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARB\">The defendants in error move to quash the writ in this case because not sued out within two years from the entiyof the judgment, as required by the 1st section of Act of April 1st, 1874: P. L., 1874, p. 50; Dig., Vol. 1, p. 702, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">As a matter of fact, and as shown by the record, the judgment in this case was entered May 26th, 1883 ; and the same record discloses the fact that the writ of error was not taken or sued out until April 1st, 1886, nearly three years after the entry of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">The application of the defendants below was an appeal to Ihe equitable discretion of the Court to open the judgment; and as such, we submit, is not reviewable: Reigel <em>v. </em>Wilson, 10 P. F. S., 388 ; Wernet\u2019s Appeal, 10 Norris, 319; Hill <em>v. </em>Irwin, 8 Casey, 314; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Howard, 11 W. N. C., 81-82.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AqA\">October 4th, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-7\">Mr. Chief Justice</author>\n<p id=\"ADxr\">Mercur delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Inasmuch as the plaintiff in error is a <em>feme </em>covert, the statute limiting the time within which a writ of error may be sued out, does not apply to her. The motion to quash the writ is, therefore, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The main contention is, whether the statement filed is sufficient to support the judgment? The claim is to recover a judgment <em>in personam </em>against the husband and wife for work and labor done and money expended, in relation to the sale of the real estate of the wife, at her instance and request.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The proviso to the Act of 11th April, 1848, gives no express authority to a married woman to bind her separate estate by contract for the improvement or repair of her real estate. This power is only constructively within the Act: Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones <em>et </em>ux., 32 Pa. St., 432 ; Murray <em>et al. v. </em>Keyes <em>et </em>ux., 35 Id., 384 ; Shannon <em>v. </em>Shultz, 87 Id., 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">To sustain a common law action against a husband and wife with a view of charging the separate estate of the wife, facts must be averred in the <em>narr, </em>and proved on the trial, sufficient to bring the case within the Act. It is not sufficient that a cause of action against the wife be proved, it must also be set forth in the declaration: Murray <em>et al. v. </em>Keys <em>et ux., supra; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Parke and Wife <em>v. </em>Kleeber <em>et al., </em>87 Id., 251. When the attempt is to charge the real estate of a married woman by a mechanic\u2019s lien, the same rule applies : Shannon <em>v. </em>Shultz, <em>supra; </em>Kuhns <em>v. </em>Turney, Id., 497 ; Loomis <em>v. </em>Fry, 91 Id., 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">A judgment against a married woman which does not affirmatively show her liability on a contract within the statute, is void, and a sheriff\u2019s sale of her property on execution issued thereon will confer no title on the purchaser : Hecker <em>v. </em>Haak, <em>supra, </em>238; Hugus <em>v. </em>Dithridge Glass Company, 96 Id., 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Applying these rules of law to the record in this case we find it clearly defective.- It contains no averment that the debt was contracted for any act done that was necessary for the use, enjoyment or preservation of her property, or that its condition or value was such as to make a sale thereof necessary or even advisable for her advantage or profit. It is not sufficient to allege it was done for her use, and at her instance and request. In some suitable language the necessity therefor must also be averred in the statement or <em>narr. </em>No such language is contained in this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We also think the items contained in the copy of the alleged book account filed, are not within the meaning of the rule requiring an affidavit of defence to be put in. The principal item is for commission on sale of a house. This is not a proper subject of a book charge to be proved by the production of the book as one of original entry: Hale\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Ard\u2019s Executor\u2019s, 48 Id., 22. Other items are manifestly for money paid. The fact that tlie statement of the account is copied from hooks which the plaintiff below avers to be his books of original entries, does not cure the defect. If the entries had no legal standing there to charge the defendant, a copy thereof cannot give to them additional force. If they were not originally proper subjects of book account, they have not become so since, and therefore are not within the rule requiring an affidavit of defence when \u201c a copy of the book entries \u201d is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Judgment reversed and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
