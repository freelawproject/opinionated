The city of Scranton school district has levied a tax of ten mills upon the dollar for school purposes, upon the adjusted valuation of plaintiff\u2019s property made for city purposes, which said tax amounts to tile sum of $71.67, and also one half mill upon the dollar upon the same valuation of the same property to provide for the payment of the interest and the liquidation of the principal of the indebtedness of said school district, which said tax amounts to $3.59. And the said school district is now, through its treasurer, P. J. lluane, endeavoring to collect the said taxes from plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-9\">11. The rate of ten mills lor school purposes, and one half mill for payment of interest and liquidation of principal of indebtedness, is the uniform rate imposed by said city of Scranton school district for the year 1885 upon all real estate in said city, of whatever kind or class, or for whatever purpose used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-10\">Upon this state of facts the plaintiff contends that defendants have no right to collect more than one half of the amounts mentioned, for the reason that the Act of Assembly entitled \u201ca supplement to an Act entitled \u2018an Act dividing the cities of this State into three classes, regulating the passage of ordinances, providing for contracts for supplies and work for said cities, authorizing the increase of indebtedness, and the creation of a sinking fund to redeem tbe same, defining and punishing certain offences in all of said cities, and providing for the incorporation and government of cities of the third class,\u2019 approved May 23d, A.

D. 1877, and the certificate of the Governor issued in pursuance thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">To this the defendants interpose three distinct grounds of defence, the affirmation of any one of which will suffice to destroy the plaintiff\u2019s right to the remedy sought by this bill and necessitate the dismissal thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-6\">These grounds of defence, in the order in which they are presented by the defendants, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-7\">First. The first five sections of the Act of 18th March, 1875, being coupled with the proviso, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-8\">11 Provided, that no city of the third class, nor any city of less population than ten thousand inhabitants, heretofore incorporated, shall become subject to the foregoing provisions of this Act, until the same are accepted by an ordinance, duly passed by a majority of the members elected to each branch thereof voting in favor of the same, and approved by the mayor,\u201d have never been adopted by the city of Scranton and. are not now in force in said city for any purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-9\">Second. The said Act of, 18th March, 1875, has no application to school taxes, and therefore the defendants have nothing to do with the classification and unequal rate provided for in said Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-10\">Third. The first five sections of the said Act of 18th March, 1875, are contrary to that portion of \u00a7 7, of Article third of the Constitution of Pennsylvania which provides that \u201c the General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law <em>. ... . </em>regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts,\u201d and are therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-12\">Are the first five sections of the Act of March 18th, 1875, in contravention of that portion of the Constitution of Pennsylvania which provides that \u201c the General Assembly shall not pass any local or special laws regulating the affairs of counties, eities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-13\">It will hardly be denied that this prohibition extends to the delegation of the power, of passing local or special laws, to the various municipalities named. The spirit of the Constitution must be followed in legislation as well as its letter. If the legislature can pass no special law regulating the affairs of a city, the same prohibition would prevent it from delegating to the city the power to pass a special law for its own regulation, and this is, in effect, what the Act of 1875 and many other enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ments of tbe legislature supposed to be in harmony with the General Act of 1874, have undertaken to do. The decisions of tbe Supreme Court upon the constitutionality of the Act of 1874, when closely examined, will be found to furnish no precedent for such legislation. The Act of 1874 when applied to certain subjects, has been declared constitutional, but it can hardly be said to follow that any Act which may be passed containing the same option clause as the Act of 1874, can shield itself under the pale of these decisions. Both Wheeler <em>v. </em>Pliila., 27 P. F. S., 338, .and Kilgore <em>v. </em>Magee, 4 Norris, 401, arose upon questions concerning legislation affecting all cities of the first and second classes respectively. A statute which should at the time of its approval apply to all cities of the third class would have for its support the precedent of these decisions. The Act of 1875 goes further than this; under its provisions there may be a further division of cities of the third class into those which have accepted the Act of 1875, and those which have not, and this irrespective of their acceptance of the Act of 1874 to which the Act of 1875 is called a supplement. Some cities may accept the Act of 1874 and reject the supplement, while others accept the supplement and reject the Act of 1874. Thus by a juggle between the legislature and the municipalities special legislation is obtained, .and the Constitution is evaded. The wisdom of special legislation for cities is not now <em>in </em>question. It is enough to <em>say </em>the Constitution prohibits it. To support that Constitution, in its letter and spirit, is the duty of courts of justice. If it is wise and just to levy an unequal rate of taxation upon separate classes of property in cities throughout this Commonwealth, the legislature have the power to enact a law for that purpose ; they have no power under the Constitution to enact a law which shall permit the various cities to choose for themselves whether they will have an equal or an unequal rate ; if this could be done, the same principle would permit every subject of municipal regulation to be virtually enacted by the several municipalities, and an era of special legislation inaugurated, tenfold worse than that which existed before the present Constitution was adopted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">Have the first five sections of the Act of 1875 been sufficiently adopted by the city of Scranton ?'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">The title of the Act of 1875 designates it a supplement to the General Act of 1874. If it is not a supplement, if it introduces an entirely new subject, to wit: the classification of real estate, and the unequal rate of taxation thereupon, it is unconstitutional upon another ground, to wit: that its subject matter is not clearly expressed in its title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">If it is a supplement to the Act of 1874, the ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>passed for the adoption of the Act of 1874 and its supplements, and the certificate of the Governor issued in pursuance thereof, constituted, in the opinion of the Master, a sufficient adoption by the city of Scranton of the Act of March 18th,. 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">The Master therefore submits the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">1. The Act of Assembly, approved the 18th day of March, A. D. 1875, P. L., 15, has no application to school taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">2. The first five sections of the said Act of Assembly are in violation of that portion of Article third of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, which prohibits the general assembly from passing any local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">3. The ordinance of the city of Scranton, approved the 16th day of March, A. D. 1877, and the certificate of the Governor issued in pursuance thereof, constituted a sufficient and lawful adoption of the Act of March 18th, 1875, by the said city of Scranton. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">4. The bill in this case should be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">Exceptions were filed both by the plaintiff and by the defendants. These were argued before McCollum, P.

By the terms of the proviso contained in section 5, the Act is applicable to only a portion and not all of the cities of the third class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-10\">The cities of Allegheny and Harrisburg are not subject to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-11\">The proviso subdivides cities into those already incorporated and those which may be incorporated after its date. And if some of the cities accept the provisions of the Act there will be a further subdivision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-12\">We do not question the power of the legislature to classify cities and to enact laws for each class, but contend that having classified cities by the Act of 1874, they cannot make subclasses by excepting a portion of any one class by reference to the date of their incorporation from the operation of a law passed for the class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-13\">2. The proviso leaves it optional with each city whether or not it will become subject to the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-14\">Can the legislature, under the Constitution of 1874, provide more than one system for the government of cities of the third class ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-15\">They provided one tax system for such cities by the Act of 23d May, 1874, P. L., 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-16\">They attempted to provide another tax system optional with cities already incorporated, by the Act of 18th March, 1875, P. L., 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-17\">They attempted to provide still another system, likewise optional, by the Act of 28th May, 1879, P. L., 68.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-18\">If such legislation be sustained any city may get such particular laws as it wishes without interfering with other cities by simply tacking on a proviso like the one in question and then passing the ordinance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-19\">A repeal of the constitutional prohibition wore infinitely better, for then the legislature would know for whom they were legislating, and the people would know when they were being legislated for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-20\">The following from the veto message of Governor Patti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>SON, of July 10th, 1885, is a startling exposition of the manner and the extent to which special and local legislation is sought. We ask this court to add its protest to that of the chief executive, and to sustain the plain prohibition of the Constitution of the Commonwealth:</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-6\">The prohibition of \u00a7 7, of Article III. of the Constitution, against the passage of local or special laws \u2022\u201c regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts,\u201d is absolute. The prohibition against local or special laws upon this subject includes the command that whenever laws relating thereto are passed, they shall be general in their application. Anything which defeats or limits their general application is obnoxious to the prohibition. If certain counties or cities cannot be specially legislated for by name, they cannot be thus legislated for by including them in an exception to a general law. ' The inhibition is against passing laws that will operate upon them alone to the exclusion of others in the same general legal category. Again, the fact whether a law is general or special is to be determined by the force of its operating words at the time of its passage, and cannot be made to depend upon the happening of any such contingency as the desire or action of the councils of a city or the act of a board of county commissioners. If the legislature cannot give a particular county immunity from the operation of a general law, it cannot depute to the city or county the privilege of giving itself such immunity. The power denied to the superior body cannot be vested by it in the subordinate. Neither can the intendment of a broad constitutional provision be defeated by any mere juggle of words. If the law only recognizes cities of given classes, the legislature cannot further divide those classes into those accepting and those not accepting legislation. Neither can such a division be set up as counties governed by special laws and those not governed by special laws. If this could be done, the whole purpose of the constitutional prohibition would be defeated. Some counties or cities in given classes would be governed by one law, and some by others. If the bills now objected to should be signed, the extent or generality of their application would be dependent entirely upon the willingness or unwillingness of certain counties or cities to be governed by them. Surely, this cannot be done, and the purpose of the Constitution be defeated in such an indirect and specious manner. The tendency of this sort of legislation has become so great that I think it is time to assert rigidly the spirit and letter of the Constitution. It is true that many laws containing option clauses have been enacted in the past, and some may have received the sanction of the present executive. The recur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>renco of this character of enactments, however, has become so frequent as to induce me to attempt to out-root the practice, if possible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">3. If the taxes contemplated by the Act of 1875 include school taxes, then the Act is <em>pro tanto </em>unconstitutional, as legislation for only a small number and not all of the school districts of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">Conceding the power of the legislature to classify counties, cities, school districts, &amp;c., and then to legislate for the respective classes, when and how were the school districts of the state classified? No classification of school districts has as yet been attempted, and until they are classified any Act affecting them must affect all or none : Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Fertig <em>v. </em>Patton, 7 Norris, 258; Scowdon\u2019s Appeal, 15 Norris, 422; Davis <em>v. </em>Clark, 15 W. N. C., 209; McCarty <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 16 W. N. C., 497.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-8\">4. Nowhere in the title of the Act in question is there the remotest reference, express or implied, to schools, school districts, or school taxes. Certainly no such ideas as these words suggest are \u201c clearly expressed in the title.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-9\">5. The proviso is a virtual delegation of the legislative power: Parker <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Barr, 507; Lock\u2019s Appeal, 22 P. F. S., 491.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-10\">6. The Act of 1854, which requires school taxes to be levied at a uniform rate on the adjusted valuation for state and county purposes, is a general law. If the taxes mentioned in the Act of 1875 include school taxes, then the Act of 1875 is a partial repeal of the Act of 1854- \u2014 -a partial repeal of the Act of 1854 in all cities which accept the provisions of the Act of 1875.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-11\">Again, the Act of 1874 relating to cities is a general law. The tax provisions of the Acts of 1875 and 1874 cannot stand together, and whenever any city of the third class accepts the Act of 1875 so much of the Act of 1874 as conflicts therewith is repealed as to that city. B3 force of its own provisions the Act of 1875 (first five sections) becomes a partial repeal of the general law of 1874 and is local, applying only to the city which accepts it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-12\">E. <em>N.

It comes to us with the seal of approval of two of the co-ordinate departments of the government. To doubt is to decide in favor of its constitutionality. It is only in a clear case that we are justified in declaring an Act to be unconstitutional;\u201d Craigh <em>v. </em>First Presbyterian Church, 7 Norris, 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-5\">When Wheeler <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 27 P. F. S., 338, and Kilgore <em>v. </em>Magee, 4 Norris, 401, were before this Court, able lawyers who were members of the last Constitutional Convention, contended, in those cases, that the seventh section of the third article of the Constitution absolutely prohibited the classification of cities; that all laws relative to cities must be, applicable to the chief city of the Commonwealth with its immense population and wealth, and the smallest interior city of the third class, alike.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-6\">This Court decided that the just classification provided-for in the Act of 1874 offended against no provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\">The right to legislate for cities b,y classes was firmly established by the unanimous decision of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-8\">In the cases above mentioned the Act of May 23d, 1874, was fairly before the Court; that part of the Act relative to cities of the third class contains a proviso, and the Act of March 18th, 1875, (the constitutionality of which this Court doubted when this case was here on the preliminary injunction), also contains a proviso. The two provisos are as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-9\">Act of 1874,-Sec. 57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-10\">\u201c Any city of the third class, or any city of a less population than ten thousand inhabitants, heretofore incorporated, may become subject to the provisions of this Act, governing cities of the third class to be hereinafter incorporated; and the mayor and councils of such city may effect the same by an ordinance thereof, duly passed by a majority of members duly elected to each branch thereof voting in favor of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARW\">Act of 1875, Sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-11\">\u201cThat no city of the third class, nor ai-y city of less population than ten thousand inhabitants, heretofore incorporated, shall become subject to the foregoing provisions of this Act, until the same are accepted by an ordinance, duly passed by a majority of the members elected to each branch thereof .voting in favor of the same, and approved by the Mayor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>To tost the question whether this is a statute relating to persons or things of a class, it is not a fair interpretation to say some of the class are not'now under it, nor governed by its provisions. The broad and true test is, are any of the designated class deprived of the benefits of the Act by its terms; are any excluded from the operation of its provisions? We submit that there is not one city of the third class in the Commonwealth excluded from the provisions of this Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-4\">The Act in question, when it received the approval of the Governor of the Commonwealth, became a perfect law. It is not an invitation \u2014 it needs no ratification \u2014 it is not a delegation of legislative power, and lacks none of the qualities of command and prohibition essential to every law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">In Lock\u2019s Appeal, 22 P. F. S., 496, Justice Agnbw says: \u201c And why shall not the Legislature take the sense of the people ? Is it not the right of the Legislature to seek information of the condition of a locality or of the public sentiment there? So long, therefore, as the Legislature only calls to its aid the means of ascertaining the utility or expediency of a measure, and does not delegate the power to make the law itself, it is acting within the sphere of its just powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">In view of the irreparable injury that this appellee and other third class cities must sustain if either or both of said Acts are declared unconstitutional, we ask of this Court the rigid application of its former decisions on the question presented in the case at bar.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A5Q\">October 4th, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-7\">Mr. Justice Green</author>\n<p id=\"A_F\">delivered the opinion of the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The plaintiff in this case claims the benefit of the provision of the first section of the Act of 18th March, 1875, which directs that in cities of the third class for the purposes of taxation, all real estate and the improvements thereon, shall be classified and arranged in three classes, upon which different rates of assessment shall be imposed. The rate claimed by plaintiff is less than the full rate levied upon the adjusted valuation made for city purposes upon which the defendant has caused the school tax to be assessed. The proviso to the fifth section of the Act of the 18th March, 187,5, excludes from the operation of the Act all cities of the third class and all cities containing less than ten thousand population previously incorporated, which do not accept, by an ordinance duly passed, the provisions of the Act. According to this all cities that do accept, will be subject to the methods of assessment and collection prescribed by the first five sections, and all that do not will not be so subject, and as to them different methods will prevail. Whether the methods prescribed by the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>shall be the law,will depend,not upon the terms of the legislation, but upon the will of others who are not law-makers at all; and what may be the law in one city of the third class may not be the law in another city of the same class. In other words, a majority of the members of the city councils in any one city of the third class may impose upon the inhabitants of that city a method of taxation which may not prevail in any other city of the Commonwealth. A law which authorizes this to be done is, in our judgment, clearly obnoxious to the seventh section of the third article of the Constitution, which prohibits the General Assembly from passing any local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs or school districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The circumstance that the power to determine the question is delegated to another body does not at all affect the question. The practical result is the same, the law of 1875 will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept, and that makes it local. All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against this provision of the Constitution,' and is void: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Patton, 7 Norris, 258 ; Scowden\u2019s Appeal, 15 Id., 422; Davis <em>v. </em>Clark, 15 W. N. (3., 209; McCarthy <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, Id., 497. In the first of these cases the method employed was to limit the application of the Act which ostensibly embraced \u201call counties \u201d by a geographical description which confined it to one. In the next case the attempt was made to produce the same result by describing two concurrent populations of county and city of such figures as to confine the operation of the Act practically to but one county, and it was condemned for the same reason. In the last two of the cases named, the objectionable limitation restrained the operation of the Act to counties of prescribed population, and in both cases the legislation was condemned because it embraced less than the whole of the counties of the state. In Davis <em>v. </em>Clark the present Chief Justice said: \u201cIt was not then a general Act, applicable to every part of the Commonwealth. It did not apply to a great number of counties, but there is no dividing line between a local and a general statute. It musj; be either one or the other. If it apply to the whole state it is general. If to a part only, it is local. As a legal principle it is as effectually local when it applies to sixty-five counties out of the sixty-seven as if it applied to one only. The exclusion of a single county from the operation of this Act makes it local.\u201d We see no difference in principle between the foregoing cases and the present. It is the duty of the Court to enforce the Constitution as they find it. Attempts in covert modes to defeat its plain provisions, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>set aside with the same certainty as when the methods are open. Even if the intention be innocent, and yet the legislation comes within the constitutional prohibition, it must not be tolerated. We are of opinion that the second conclusion of law found by the Master should have been sustained and the bill dismissed. The other matters discussed do not require consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Decree reversed and plaintiff\u2019s bill dismissed at the cost of the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
