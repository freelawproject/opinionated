The ticket entitled the bolder to all the rights and privileges he would have under a single-trip ticket each way, and being more convenient, and costing a trifle less, the public became accustomed to buy them instead of single-trip tickets. In March or April of 1883, the plaintiff rode from Cleveland to Erie on \u201cLimited Express Train No. 20,\u201d or \u201c The Fast New York Express,\u201d (being called by each of said names in different time tables,) on a round-trip ticket, being then good on that train, as understood by the officers and agents of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">On May 1st, 1883, the officers of the railway company made a change in the rules, which rendered these round-trip tickets not good on one of the company's express trains going west, \u201cLimited Express Train, No. 17,\u201d and one going east, \u201cLimited Express Train, No. 20,\u201d but no notice of this change was given to the public except by the time tables and posters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\">The plaintiff testified that he had no actual notice either from time tables, posters, or otherwise, and that he had no knowledge of any rule which rendered his round-trip ticket not good on the train from which lie was ejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-8\">The plaintiff arrived in Cleveland at about 6 E. M. on the Special Chicago Express, and at about 10 p. m. of the same day he went to tlie Cleveland depot, expecting to return home by train leaving at about that time, called Special New York Express, but he was informed by the ticket agent that said train did not run on Sunday. Then, upon inquiry, the ticket agent informed him, Rosenzweig, that the next train for Erie would leave at 1.22 or 1.42, and further remarked to him, \u201c you will have a long wait,\u201d but said nothing about the number or character of the train leaving at that hour. The plaintiff waited in and about the depot until the train came in from the west. The train was made up of three sleepers, a day coach and baggage car. Several persons got off the train at this point, and one other person besides tlie plaintiff took passage on tlie train at this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-9\">When the plaintiff went to the train to get on board, a person standing by the day coach, dressed in the garb of a railway eraploy\u00e9, assisting passengers to alight, asked him as to what station lie was going, and when informed by him that Erie was his destination, he directed him to take the day coach. The plaintiff then, as directed, stepped into the day coach and took a seat, and being weary soon fell asleep. The train remained in the Cleveland depot about ten minutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-10\">On being awakened by the call of \u201cTickets,\u201d the plaintiff handed Ids ticket to tlie conductor, who, seeing it, reached for the bell cord to stop the train, and as bo took the ticket and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>handed it back, said: \u201cI have orders to put you off; your ticket is not good.\u201d The plaintiff replied: \u201c Conductor, you are mistaken; that ticket was purchased yesterday, and was punched, and I rode on it to Cleveland, and the time is not up.\u201d The conductor again said: \u201cMy orders are to put you off.\u201d The plaintiff then said: \u201cConductor, if there is anything wrong with my ticket here is your fare,\u201d (handing him the money). The conductor again said : \u201cMy orders are to put you off, and off you must go. Come!\u201d The plaintiff then said: \u201c For God\u2019s sake don\u2019t put me off here; carry me to a station,\u201d and the conductor again said: \u201cMy orders are to put you off, and off you must get. I obey orders, if I break owners.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-9\">Under these orders of the conductor, the plaintiff was compelled to leave the car and train. When off the train on the ground, the conductor pointed to a light, saying to the plaintiff: \u201cThat will take you to the depot,\u201d which light the plaintiff soon discovered was from a locomotive coming towards him, and soon passed him. The point where he was ejected from the train is from a little less than a half mile, to a mile and a half, east from the Cleveland depot. (The witnesses differing as to this point.) When the train left him he found himself in the dark and in the midst of many railway tracks, switches, cars, moving trains, locomotives, etc., and a place totally strange and unknown to the plaintiff. From the Cleveland depot, a system of railway yards and switches extend east for a distance of about three miles. On the north side of these tracks for a long distance, and close up to them, is the lake. Immediately on the south side of these tracks, extending from the depot east for one half mile, is a stone wall about seven feet high, surmounted by an iron picket fence, and above this, extending to Summit street, is a high bluff, terraced say about forty-five feet above the tracks. This stone wall extends 900 feet, three to five feet high, east of the over-head bridge. Part of the north track of this system of tracks, and west of the overhead bridge, had been washed out by the action of the waters of the lake. About 200 feet west of the bridge was. a ditch running across the tracks about eighteen to twenty-two inches deep, partly uncovered. The south end of this over-head bridge rests on the high bluff, and from this end a path leads still higher up towards the city. The north end of this foot-bridge rests on a high stone wall, and a winding narrow stairway leads down to a small bath-house which is built out over the waters of the lake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-10\">The whole space and distance from the Cleveland depot east, for three miles along this sj^stem of tracks, is a very dangerous and unsafe place even in the day time, and the railway company had posters and placards in large type put up at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>various places along and about these tracks, giving warning to the people to keep off and away from these tracks, on account of the great danger to life and limb.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">To escape the dangers and peril in which he found himself placed, he at once started in the direction pointed out to him by the conductor, when he noticed that the light to which his attention was directed by the conductor was a locomotive light, coming towards him, and which soon passed him. He then tried to go southward across the tracks towards the city, but was prevented by a freight train just moving towards the 'west. He then moved east in order to get around this train, but found another train back of it. He then tried to go north, as the isafer course to pursue to get away from the tracks and moving trains and engines. In passing across these tracks northward, he saw other cars and engines moving. Noticed some cars moving in a northwesterly direction, and a locomotive then passed him, making it light about him for a moment and then seemingly darker than before. About this time he was hurt by being struck in the rear by some ear or moving obstacle, or was tripped, or fell over some obstacle that raised him and threw him up, and he fell. The blow or trip and fall, rendered him for some time unconscious. When he became conscious, his head was down and his arms and limbs drawn up under him. His hat was driven down over his eyes. In attempting to rise he fell over on his side. He then dragged himself across the tracks to a \u00a1rath or ditch; saw a light, heard voices, and called for help. Some.railroad men, with lanterns in their hands, came to him, lifted him up, walked with and assisted him some distance toward the depot; they placed him on a railroad tie or plank whore he remained some little time, and then dragged himself as best he could toward the depot. When near the depot, a man with a lantern in his hand, came with a baggage truck, on winch he placed him and carried him to and through the depot to a carriage, in which he was placed and taken to a hotel. The left leg of his pants was torn at the knee, and a long slit or hole was torn or cut where the rim and crown of the hat join. A physician, Dr. Charles C. Arms (professor of anatomy in the Medical University of Cleveland), was called, who attended the patient professionally for about two weeks, while he remained in the city of Cleveland. He found the pulse weak, feeble and tremulous, and tbe patient suffering much pain, principally in his back, but also in his head and extremities. Morphia was prescribed, and tbe next day bo gave him a more critical examination, and Cound an injury on the back of the right shoulder; an abrasion on the right knee, the left knee exceedingly tender and swollen, and the left side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>of the back, low down in the lumbar region, swollen and tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\">The injury seemed to be mostly in his back, especially on the left side. He could not lie on his left side. He also had prickling sensation in his feet, and had a falling or sinking sensation, and when awaked from a doze or sleep bj any noise, he would spring up partially in his bed and cry out the word, \u201c Jump ! \u201d He was exceedingly nervous and could not sleep. He kept his bed until December 6fch, when he was removed to his home in Erie, and from that time he was treated by his family physician, Dr. C. Brandes. After some months treatment without recovery, he was advised by his family physician to undergo the severe treatment of the actual cautery, or burning with a white hot iron. After a careful examination of the patient by Drs. C. C. Arms, <em>W. </em>J. Scott and H. Z. Gill, of the city of Cleveland, and full consultation, the same course of treatment was advised by them. The cautery was then performed by applying a white hot iron at some fifteen or more different places along his spinal column. This treatment was applied three different times, but gave no relief save in one particular. Before the cautery was performed his limb had a tendency to draw up. The muscles seemed to be drawn or \u201c knotted,\u201d and drew up the limb. The application of the cautery gave him relief in this particular, but in no other. The paralytic condition of the limb continued, and there was no improvement in the shattered condition of his general nervous system. An epileptic condition developed ; occasionally he would become dizzy, tremulous, and fall in an unconscious state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">The plaintiff presented the following points for charge :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">1. If the jury find from the evidence that the plaintiff purchased a first-class ticket entitling him to ride from Erie to Cleveland and return, that he had no notice from the defendant that his ticket so purchased did not entitle him to ride on train No. 20, that the servants of the defendant, in violation of the rule of defendant omitted to lock the doors of the car when in Cleveland, or to notify the plaintiff that he had no right to take a seat in said car; that they permitted him to take a seat in said car; that the servants of defendant ejected plaintiff from said car after the train had left the depot, when it was passing through the yard of defendant\u2019s railway; that said yard was considered by defendant to be a dangerous place; that plaintiff when endeavoring with care to walk through said yard back to the depot was hurt by a ear, or by falling into or over some obstruction, then, and in that case, your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">Answer of the Court: This cannot be affirmed as an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tirety; the plaintiff was not entitled to notice that the ticket lie held did not allow him to ride on the train in question, but if he had been previously carried on the train on the same kind of a ticket and in good faith, without notice or knowledge on his part, that he had no right to a passage on the particular train mentioned ; and with permission and acquiescence of the employes of defendant, the plaintiff took a seat in a car of said train, and the emplov\u00e9s of the defendant corporation after-wards ejected him at a dangerous place; and the plaintiff, while using ordinary care and caution in endeavoring to make his way through the yard back to the depot received injuries such as should have been foreseen by the conductor of tlie train, as the natural or probable consequence of leaving the plaintiff in such a place in the night time, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">2. That if the jury find from the evidence, that the servants of the defendant ejected the plaintiff from their cars, not at a regular station, nor at a dwelling house, as required by the rules of the company, but at a place known to the defendant to be dangerous and unsafe, then, and in that case, if they find for the plaintiff, their verdict should be punitive damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">Answer of the Court: This is affirmed, with the single qualification that while the jury may, under such circumstances, find punitive or exemplary damages in favor of plaintiff, they are at liberty to find compensatory damages only, if they see proper. (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\">The defendant presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the following points \u2022 1. That plaintiff was bound to ascertain and know the rules and regulations prescribed by the defendant company under which passengers could ride upon that train, and that the law presumes he did know them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-11\">Answer of the Court: The first part of this point is affirmed ; but the last is refused. It is true that the plaintiff was bound to ascertain the rules of the company as to the train on which ho took passage, but there is no legal presumption that be did so ascertain them. (Third assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-12\">3. The plaintiff in tliis action admits and testifies that be did not know, and made no effort to ascertain, whether under the rules of the company bis ticket entitled Lim to ride on the train from which he was ejected; if, therefore, the jury shall find from the evidence in this case that, under the established rules of defendant company, the ticket that the plaintiff had purchased did not entitle him to ride on that particular train, then the Court is requested to charge, as a matter of law, that no special contract being averred or proved, the plaintiff became and was a trespasser on that particular train, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>defendant had a perfect legal right to eject him therefrom, using no more force than was necessary for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">Answer of the Court: This is for the jury. Instructions should be asked for on a hypothetical case, and not by requiring the Court to affirm or negative alleged facts as having been proven. The legal proposition included in this point is covered by the answer to the next point. (Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-7\">4. If the jury shall find from the evidence in this case and within the law as it shall be given them by the Court that, under established rules of defendant company,'the plaintiff had no legal right to be on the particular train of defendant company from which he was ejected, and was a trespasser thereon, then the Court is requested to charge you as a matter of law that defendant company was \u201cnot required to put him off at one place rather than another. While the law will not permit a person to be exposed wantonly to peril, there is no rule which requires any consideration to be shown for the mere convenience of the wrong-doer or trespasser; and if the jury shall find from the evidence in this case that plaintiff was a wrongdoer and trespasser on said train, then plaintiff cannot recover in this action without averring and proving that the act was wilful and wanton, which he has not done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-8\">Answer of the Court: This is refused. It is for the jury to find from the evidence whether the plaintiff was a mere trespasser, wantonly and knowingly intruding on the train, aware of his having no right to be there; or whether he was there innocently and ignorantly, in good faith, and through the negligence of the servants of the company (defendant) in omitting to obey the rule which required them to take precaution against persons without proper tickets getting upon said train. The mere fact that the ticket held by plaintiff did not entitle him to be carried on that particular train, under the rules and regulations of the company (defendant), would not, as assumed in this point, entitle the defendant\u2019s servants to treat him as a wrong-doer, or relieve the company from treating him with care and humanity. (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-10\">5. Plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in this action must be measured by the averments contained in his declaration; plaintiff has., in legal effect, alleged a right to recover, based upon a contract which entitled him to a ride from Cleveland to Erie on the particular train from which he was ejected. The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show this. The Court is requested to charge as a matter of law that plaintiff has wholly failed to prove such a contract, and therefore cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-11\">Answer of the Court: This is refused. The right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>plaintiff to recover in this action does not depend entirely upon his showing a right to ride upon the train in question. (Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">7. That if the jury find from the evidence In this case that under the rules of the defendant company the conductor could not receive a round trip ticket, nor money from the plaintiff for a ride from Cleveland to Erie upon said train, the conductor had a legal right to put him off the train when he saw fit, and unless in doing so he used more force than was necessary, and that plaintiff was injured by the use of such unnecessary force, he cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">Answer of the Court: This is refused. The conductor had no right to put tire plaintiff off the train except at a proper and safe place, and it is for the jury to say from the evidence whether the place where plaintiff was ejected was a proper and safe place or otherwise. (Seventh assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">8. That under the evidence in this case the plaintiff was ui. lawfully upon the train, and therefore a trespasser, and the conductor had a perfect legal right to expel him from the train at any time lie saw fit, and the defendant is not liable for any injuries that he received as the result of such legal expulsion ; therefore the jury cannot consider the question of whether the plaintiff was in fact injured on liis way back to the depot from the place where he was so put off said train, or the question in what manner such injury occurred, if it did occur.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-9\">Answer of the Court: \u201c This is refused. (Eighth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-10\">14. If the jury believe from the evidence in this case that at Erie street bridge there were two safe ways by which plaintiff could have travelled south to the city \u2014 one by the platform and stairway, on the south side of defendant\u2019s tracks, and another by the well-defined pathway on the north side of the defendant\u2019s tracks, then it will not do for plaintiff to say that he did not know of them, for the law made it his duty to look around and know for himself that there were such places of safe travel, and if he neglected this obvious duty and pursued his way down the tracks and yard of the defendant company, in consequence of which an injury resulted, then he was guilty of negligence contributing to the injury, and he cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-11\">Answer of the Court: This Is affirmed with the qualification that the jury should examine the evidence carefully, plaintiff being a stranger at the place, and his evidence being that the conductor pointed towards the depot as a place of safety towards which he should make his way by the tracks. (Ninth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>16. The plaintiff has testified in this action that, after being ejected from the train, he walked down the tracks and towards the depot without looking for a safe way of travel by way of th'e platform and stairway leading to the bridge at Erie street; his admitted neglect in this regard was a violation of the duty that the law imposed, and was contributory negligence, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">Answer of the Court: I decline to affirm the matter of fact claimed in this point. It was the duty of the plaintiff to make every effort to secure his own safety, and if by his neglect to do so he sustained injury, he cannot recover. It is not for the Court to affirm alleged points of evidence; that is for the jury. The proper way is to put a hypothetical case. (Tenth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">18. If the plaintiff himself cannot tell how he received his alleged injuries, whether by' a blow from a moving car or engine, or by a fall over some obstacle in his path, the jury cannot guess, speculate or infer how his alleged injuries were received, nor that they were the natural and probable consequence of the act of the conductor; such a consequence as, under the surrounding circumstances of the case might and ought to have been foreseen by the conductor as likely to occur; and. the verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">Answer of the Court: While it is true that the jury cannot guess, speculate or infer as to how the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were received, yet if they believe from the evidence that such injuries were received by the plaintiff as the direct consequence of his expulsion from the train, and were such injuries as might have been foreseen by the conductor as the natural or probable consequence of leaving the plaintiff in such a place, and that the inability of the plaintiff to testify as to the manner in which he was hurt, results from his having been rendered insensible at the time from such injuries, the fact that he is unable to give an account of the manner of his being so hurt should not, of itself, have the effect of defeating his claim.

The next morning, between one and two o\u2019clock, when he was about to take the Limited Express train to return to Erie, an employe! of the defendant directed him to the day coach; he stepped in, sat down, and quickly curled up and \u25a0went to sleep. After the train had started be was awakened by the conductor\u2019s call for tickets, and instantly took from liis pocket the ticket and a roll of money. The conductor reached for the ticket, immediately said, \u201c My orders are to put you off;\u201d grabbed the bell cord, pushed the ticket back, and said, \u201cYour ticket is no good.\u201d Then the plaintiff vainly endeavored to show the conductor that he was mistaken, offered money in payment of the fare, which was refused, and begged not to be put off at that place, but to be carried to the next station; the conductor answered, \u201cMy orders are to put you off, and off you must get. I obey orders if I break owners; come.\u201d Thereupon the plaintiff followed the conductor out of the car, and on reaching the ground, the conductor pointed to a light and said, \u201c That will take you to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>depot.\u201d The plaintiff started towards that light, soon saw it was on a locomotive, which ran by him. He then tried to get off the tracks; came against what he supposed was a freight Irain, which he believed was just in motion; turned to pass* intuid the train, and in doing so passed another train back of it; then believed it was safer to go northward, and as lie started he noticed a light to his left, a train of cars backing up, and a single car moving; about same time another engine passed him; and when he had crossed some tracks he was struck in the rear and fell unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The condition on the face of the ticket, that it was good onty for thirty days, was the only one of which the plaintiff liad knowledge. He believed it was good on every train, had used that kind of tickets on the defendant\u2019s road for five or six years, never knew there was any discrimination in its use between trains, and had travelled on the Limited Express from Cleveland to Erie on such ticket, in March or April preceding the date of .the injury. When he purchased this ticket and attempted to use it, he did not know there was any difference as to right to use it, between the Limited Express and other trains. Neither ticket agent nor any body else informed him that it was not good on the Limited Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Among the facts in this case the foregoing are testified by the plaintiff; and however much in some particulars his testimony may conflict with opposing testimony, and however strange it may appear that the plaintiff knew nothing of the regulations respecting the Limited Express trains, his credibility and the truth of his statements were for determination by the jury. All facts which the jury were warranted in finding must be kept in view in considering the alleged errors in the rulings of the learned judge of the Common Pleas. If believed, the testimony of the plaintiff shows that he entered the day coach of the Limited Express, in good faith, by direction and apparent assent of the defendant\u2019s employes, without notice or actual knowledge that his ticket was not good on that train, until so informed by the conductor, and that he was put off the train in the midst of railway tracks \u2014 on which were moving, and standing, ears and locomotives \u2014 soon as the conductor could stop, after seeing the ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s ticket was evidence of .the payment of his fare, and of his right to be carried according to its terms. It did not express the whole contract. What it does not set forth may be ascertained from the reasonable rules and regulations of the defendant; and the holder of the ticket is bound to inform himself of such regulations respecting the conduct of trains and the rights of passengers: Dietrich <em>v. </em>Penn. R. R. Co., 71 Pa. St., 432. The jury were instructed that the rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>adopted by the defendant limiting the passengers on the Limited Express to such as purchased special tickets, were reasonable ; that it was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to ascertain whether his ticket entitled him to a passage on that train before going upon it; and if he went on without a proper ticket the company had a right to eject him, at a safe place, using no more force than necessary. This was substantially repeated in response to the defendant\u2019s first, second and seventh points, with addition that it was not incumbent on the defendant to bring home to the plaintiff a knowledge of its rules and regulations. But the Court refused to charge that the law presumes that the plaintiff did know the regulations, and therefore the conductor, if he saw fit, had the right to eject the plaintiff at an improper and unsafe place. Whether there is a legal presumption of such knowledge, is the chief question raised by the assignments of error..</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">At the outset, the defendant supports the proposition that the law presumes that the plaintiff knew of the regulations, by a most specious and ingenious argument. It is clear that an irrebuttable presumption is meant. The result of affirmance of the proposition is indicated in the brief thus: \u201cThe law made it the duty of the plaintiff to ascertain, before taking a seat in the car, whether liis ticket entitled him to ride on that particular train......But whether as a matter of fact he knew this, cuts no figure in this case \u2014 in legal contemplation he did know it. The law made it his duty to know it, and being a duty which the law imposed, there is a conclusive legal presumption that he did know it.\u201d The only case cited in support of such doctrine is Horan <em>v. </em>Ellis, 41 Pa. St., 470, where the rule was recognized, that a breach of the laws of the state is not to be presumed against any one, and the presumption is the contrary until proof overcomes it. That case gives no sanction to the proposition claimed. And the proposition is at variance with the decision in Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Greenwood, 79 Pa. St., 373. There, a rule was adopted and published that after February 1st, 1873, passengers would not be carried on freight trains, except way freight, and not on way freight trains unless they had tickets. Mrs. Greenwood got on the train without a ticket, offered to pay the fare to the conductor, he refused to receive it, and put her off about a mile from a station. She had been accustomed to ride on that train and to pay her fare to the conductor. She Lad no actual knowledge of the rule. Held, that the rule was reasonable ; but the plaintiff having rode in the car before ami after the making of the rule, without a ticket and without objection, the company should not turn her out at a distance from the station without proof of express notice or actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>knowledge of the rule forbidding any one to enter the car without a ticket. Under the circumstances, putting up notice at the station house was not sufficient. The question of legal presumption of knowledge by the plaintiff of the rule was not raised, and probably was not then conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u201cIgnorance of the law, which every one is bound to know, excuseth no one.\u201d Every person in a country must be conclusively presumed to know its laws sufficiently to be able to regulate his conduct by them, for this is indispensably necessary in order to prevent greater evils. Knowledge of the laws of the state is in all cases presumed, though in no case it perfectly exists, and in multitudes of eases does not exist at all in the concrete. To a presumption of law probability is not necessary; but probability is necessary to a presumption of fact: Wharton\u2019s Evi., \u00a7 12-37. But this legal presumption of knowledge has never been extended to the by-laws and regulations of private corporations. No necessity has been shown for judicial enunciation that there is a legal presumption, or a fiction of law, that a person about to become a passenger, or who has become a passenger on a railway, knows the rules and regulations of the railway company.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">A contract was made between the parties when the plaintiff purchased the ticket. Although he neglected to inform himself of all its terms, he was bound by them, unless waived by the defendant. He cannot set up ignorance of them in order to establish rights not therein stipulated and implied. If he could, the defendant had no right at all to eject him from the train. Hence, in a proper sense, he was bound to ascertain and know the regulations of the defendant entering into the contract, and he had no greater rights thereunder than if he had acquired actual knowledge of its terms. As his contract gave him no right to ride on the Limited Express, the company could lawfully eject him. But under the facts which the jury were warranted in finding, the defendant was bound to treat the plaintiff as a passenger who, by mistake, had got on a train not included in the contract. He was entitled to the rights and privileges of a passenger, except as to Limited Express trains. He promptly exhibited his ticket, the evidence of his contract, to the conductor. As a passenger he was rightfully at the station waiting for a train to take him to the place named in the ticket, and entered the car designated to him by an official as the coach for passengers to Erie. There was neither gate, nor closed door, nor employ\u00e9 to warn him that his ticket was not good on that train.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The plaintiff was at the station, a passenger. His entering the car was not like the case of a man entering the dwelling house of another unbidden. One is a public conveyance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>other is private and the occupant\u2019s homo. A passenger who enters a car by mistake is not a trespasser who may be sued as such when he commits no actual injury \u2014 he has rights other than those of a trespasser. He may so conduct himself as to become a trespasser after being informed of his mistake. The defendant is a carrier, and its cars are for the accommodation of travellers. It owes a duty to every passenger who, in good faith, purchases a ticket and enters any of its conveyances. If the conveyance is not going in the direction the passenger wants to go, or is one which by the contract the passenger has no right to take, its duty is to inform the passenger and put him off at a proper place. This principle was recognized in Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Schwindling, 101 Pa. St., 258. In that case the plaintiff was a child, went on the platform of the station, and was injured ; but was not there as a passenger, and had no business of any kind with the defendant, or any of its agents or employes. The defendant was not liable because it owed no duty to the plaintiff. In the opinion it is remarked as conceded, that when a person goes on the platform at a railway station as a passenger, or on business connected with the company, that the company owes him a duty, and if he be injured by the negligent act of the company, lie may recover damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">There is no evidence of collusion or conspiracj between the plaintiff and any of the defendant\u2019s servants to the end that he might wrongfully ride on the Limited Express. As regards the plaintiff, the acts of the persons in charge of the train were the acts of the defendant. As respects his rights, it is immaterial whether the servants of the defendant violated its rules by omitting to lock the doors of the oar, or to give him notice that he had no right to enter and take a seat \u2014 -the doors were not locked and the plaintiff was not notified, and it was submitted to the jury to find whether he entered with consent or acquiescence of the employ\u00e9s of the defendant. A passenger who has an open way to an open car, going to the place to which lie bought and holds a ticket, without knowledge that the ticket is not good on such car, is not to be treated as a wrongdoer, endeavoring to ride without payment of fare, or to riele on a car which he knows his ticket gives him no right to enter. If the plaintiff knew that liis ticket was not good on that car, and that he had no right to enter without a special ticket, lie was a trespasser; otherwise, he was not; and the determination of this was fairly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">For the reasons stated, the third, fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth specifications of error are not sustained. Nor need much be added with reference to the first specification. The plaintiff s first point was not affirmed as an entirety; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>instead, the Court gave full instruction on the matters suggested in the point. What the Court said in the answer was the instruction, and was free of error. That instruction did not submit whether the defendant considered the place dangerous when the plaintiff was put off, but did submit whether he was ejected at a dangerous place. If it be true that the plaintiff was ejected a little west of the bridge, the conductor pointing to a light, remarking that would take him to the depot, it is by no means singular that the plaintiff did not see the bridge, or that the jury found that amid the numerous railway tracks and moving cars and locomotives, in the night time, it was a dangerous place for a stranger. And if he was ejected east of the bridge, there is testimony that it was amidst railway tracks, moving trains and locomotives, and of the efforts of the plaintiff to reach a place of safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">All the defendant\u2019s points from the ninth to the seventeenth, except the sixteenth, both inclusive, were affirmed. These need not be repeated. The jury in that way were fully instructed respecting the requisite care and duty of the plaintiff after he was ejected, and that any negligence on his part in looking out for his safety would defeat his claim for damages. They are referred to as aiding to understand the instructions of which complaint is made. For instance, the fourteenth point sharply defines the duty of the plaintiff with respect to the safe ways at the bridge, and instructed the jury that if he neglected his duty he could not recover. But in the sixteenth point the Court is asked to determine the fact of neglect, and direct a verdict for defendant. The fourteenth point was pertinent with reference to the testimony. The plaintiff, since he was hurt, has learned the location of the bridge, and he thinks he was put off the car east of it; he has no recollection of passing under it, did not look for it, could have seen it had he loolied for it, did not then know a bridge was there, and there was nothing to call his attention-to a bridge. To have affirmed the defendant\u2019s sixteenth point would have been palpable error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The defendant\u2019s eightenth, nineteenth and twentieth points were rightly refused, with proper instructions on the subject suggested. If he was knocked down by a blow in his rear which rendered him unconscious, it does not follow that because he cannot tell what struck him, that the jury may not find the fact that his injury was the direct consequence of a particular act. It was unnecessary to find whether he was struck by a locomotive, or a ear; but it was essential that the jury should find that his injuries were the natural and probable consequence of the act of the conductor; such a consequence as, under the surrounding circumstances of the case, might and should have been foreseen by the conductor as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>likely to flow from Lis act. It is said that these points were intended to squarely present the question of remote and probable cause. If tiie plaintiff was put off at a safe place, and he wandered to a dangerous one, the cause was remote. So would it be, bad he remained in the place of safety and some agency had brought his hurt. Was the place dangerous \u2014 \u25a0 not alone because of the railway tracks and switches, but of their use by trains, ears, locomotives, and for the making up of trains? These were the conditions present which made the place dangerous, especially dangerous for a stranger in the night time. While the plaintiff was trying to get out of that place he received the injury. There is as little reason for inference that he was hurt by a sand bag, as there would have been had the blow killed him. It is probable that the jury inferred that one of the things which made the place dangerous, struck him. There is where the defendant put him, and where he was hurt; the cause and effect were closely connected, and by prudent circumspection and ordinary thoughtfulness the conductor could have foreseen that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was likely to happen. Under the facts and circumstances which the jury could properly find, had the Court ruled that the defendant was not liable by reason of remoteness of the cause of injury, it would have been equivalent to saying that it was wholly immaterial whether the plaintiff was ejected at a safe, or a dangerous place, for in either case he could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The questions raised by the numerous alleged errors in the general charge have already been considered, and only two of the specifications, the fifteenth and twenty-second, will be noted. The fifteenth complains of the following sentence : \u201cThe plaintiff further claims that the place where he was put off was a dangerous and improper place for putting off a passenger, and that his ejection was a wrongful, wanton and inhuman act on part of the conductor, and wholly unjustified by the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The defendant characterizes this as unwarranted, unjust and unfair; that there is no such averment in the declaration, nor was evidence thereof introduced at the trial; and the statement was calculated to poison the mind of the jury. It is true that the phrase \u201cwanton and inhuman\u201d is not in the declaration. But each count avers that, in the night time, the plaintiff urging, asking and insisting that he be carried at least to the nearest station and place of safety, the conductor compelled him to get off at a.dangerous place, \u201cit being upon and in the midst of many railway tracks, switches, trains, car's, engines, locomotives, and where trains of freight were and are made up, and where trains, cars, engines and locomotives pass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and repass, and at a place strange and unknown to the plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff claimed there was testimony tending to prove that averment; and very likely, orally, at the trial, spoke of the act of ejecting him at such a place as wanton and inhuman. But whether he did so qualify the act or not, the Court merely stated the claim, without alleging or asserting anything, or indicating that it was sustained by proof. With equal fairness the claims of each party were stated. If the averment in the declaration be true, was not the act of the conductor inhuman ?</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The twenty-second specification complains of the following : \u201c It was the duty of the conductor to use discrimination, and not to treat as a mere trespasser and tramp and wrongdoer, a passenger who was merely guilty at most of an error of judgment or neglect to make inquiries he ought legally to have made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">That proposition is sound. If the jury found that the plaintiff was a passenger merely guilty of error of judgment and neglect to make the inquiries he ought to have made, then he was not to be treated as a trespasser and wrongdoer. In exercising discrimination the conductor would note his conduct, whether he had or had not a ticket, or whether he was able and willing immediately to pay the fare. If he acted as a trespasser and wrongdoer, and not as a passenger who had made a mistake, he could not complain of the treatment he thus invited. With the context, it is plain that the jury could not have understood that sentence as an instruction that the plaintiff was a passenger only guilty of error of judgment and neglect. In the sentence immediately preceding, the Court charged that if the plaintiff, knowing that he was not entitled to ride on that train, and in wilful violation of the rules of the company entered the train, he was a mere trespasser. And the jury were repeatedly told they were to determine every question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">There was no error in the refusal of defendant\u2019s fifth point. The second count alleges no contract other than is implied by accepting the plaintiff as a passenger, -without his having a ticket, and charges that his tender of the fare was refused and' that he was wrongfully ejected at \u00e1 dangerous place. His right to recover, under the pleadings, did not depend on showing a right to ride on the limited express. He was bound toA show, and did show, that he was a passenger, and as such, if by j the omission of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s to warn him that he could not rightfully enter that train, without a special ticketj he entered it by mistake, he was entitled to the treatment due to a passenger, though not entitled to ride on that train. It is clear that the cause was tried on its merits, and if it be that the declaration does not set forth the case with accuracy, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>amendable. A mere technical defect that did not and. could not mislead, is no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The twenty-fourth specification is not sustained for reasons stated in Lichten wallner <em>v. </em>Laubach, 105 Pa. St., 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Were it conceded that it was error to exclude the question made the subject of the twenty-fifth specification, there is now no cause for complaint, for, at a later stage in the trial, the defendant recalled the witness, who corrected the alleged mistake, and was examined and testified fully on the very point to which the overruled question was directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Manifestly, there is no error in the rulings made the subjects of the last two specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The remaining specification which will be remarked, alleges error in the qualified affirmance of the plaintiff\u2019s second point; \u201cThat if the jury find from the evidence, that the servants of the defendant ejected the plaintiff from their cars not at a regular station, nor at a dwelling house, as required by the rules of the company, but at a place known to the defendant to be dangerous and unsafe, then and in that case, if they find for the plaintiff, their verdict should be punitive damages.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The jury were instructed that under such circumstances they could find punitive damages or only compensatory damages. In considering other points, reference has been made to the averments and evidence touching the time, place and circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s ejection. It is uncoutrovertod that the rules referred to in the point existed, and respecting them the defendant well says, \u201c But the rules of the company were not established for the benefit of trespassers; they were established for the protection of the public and for the benefit of those with whom they stand in contractual relation.\u201d It is unnecessary now to consider whether the company may put off a trespasser, to whom it owes no duty, at a place where there is probability that be will be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Very little stress need be put on the existence of said rules, reasonable as they are, directing only such treatment as ought to be given to passengers, wore no such rules expressly adopted. That they are for guidance of the employes in the putting off passengers who have no right to ride on the trains which they have entered, is obvious. If they had right on the train there would be no occasion to put them off. But in determining whether the conductor acted in reckless disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s rights, the jury ought to have kept'in view the fact that he violated an express rule calculated to promote the safety of passengers and those having contractual relation with the defendant. This conductor committed no battery. lie made no threats. He acted quickly. A glance at the ticket, a puli of the bell rope, the stopping of the train, a deaf ear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s entreaties to be carried to a place of safety, a few significant words, and the plaintiff followed him to the ground there to be pointed to a light toward the depot, but not to a bridge or any safe way out of his peril. If there was no wilful misconduct lay the conductor, how can it be said that he was not recklessly indifferent to the consequences likely to befall the plaintiff? If the suit were against him there could be little question that the jury would be permitted to give exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"ALIU\">The liability of railway and other corporations to exemplary damages for gross negligence is well settled. The general rule in cases for negligence is that only compensatory damages can be given. Juries are not at liberty to go farther than compensation, unless the injury was done wilfully or was the result of that reckless indifference to the rights of others which is ..equivalent to a violation of them. There must be wilful misconduct, or that entire want of care which would raise a presumption of conscious indifference to consequences: Milwaukee &amp; St. P. R\u2019y Co. <em>v. </em>Armes, 91 U. S. R., 489. The corporation is liable for exemplary damages for the act of its servant, done within the scope of his authority, under circumstances which would give such right to the plaintiff as against the servant were the suit against him instead of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
