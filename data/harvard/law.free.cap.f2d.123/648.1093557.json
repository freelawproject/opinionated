(Church &amp; Church, of Washington, D.

The record discloses that opposer has also applied the mark to a grease for bearings; but, as pointed out by the examiner, such use was not pleaded in the notice of opposition, nor does it appear to have antedated applicant's first use of the mark on the goods set forth in the application. For either of these reasons the examiner was right in refusing to consider it as a basis for judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201cIt is opposer\u2019s Contention that rust solvents may be used to prevent the formation of rust on ball or roller bearings. There is no evidence to support this contention, and I doubt that the asserted fact is one of which judicial notice may prop\u25a0erly be taken. But even were it proved I should still be constrained to agree with the examiner that neither rust solvents and bearings, nor any other of the goods to which the parties respectively apply the mark in question, possess the sanie descriptive properties within the meaning of the Trade-Mark Act. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cAnother ground of opposition pleaded in the notice is that applicant\u2019s mark constitutes an appropriation .of opposer\u2019s corporate name. Obviously such appropriation is only partial; and there is nothing in the record to indicate that the word \u2018Norma\u2019 alone would be likely to suggest \u2018Norma-Hoffmann Bearings Corporation\u2019 to the mind of the public, except in connection with the particular class, of merchandise in which opposer deals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We are in accord with the holdings of the Patent Office tribunals that upon the record made the goods of the respective parties do not possess the same descriptive properties, and that in deter-, mining that question appellant\u2019s use of its trade-mark upon grease may not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">It may be unfortunate for appellant that a more complete factual record was not made, but we must pass upon the facts set forth in the record and those of which we may take judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">There is no proof respecting the use of rust solvents, and we cannot, in our opinion, take judicial notice that they are used for the prevention of rust. The term \u201crust solvents\u201d indicates materials for the removal of rust after it is formed and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">There is nothing in the record before us from which we can hold that ball bearings and ball bearing devices in use are normally subject to rust formation; so far as ball bearings are concerned the contrary is suggested by the stipulated fact that appellant since 1923 has made a specialty of grease-packed bearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Therefore we are of the opinion that the purchasers of a rust solvent bearing appellee\u2019s mark would not be likely to conclude that appellant had produced such goods. In the case of Elgin American Manufacturing Co. v. Elizabeth Arden, Inc., 83 F.2d 687, 688, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1168, we said: \u201c * * * The real question confronting us is whether the goods of the respective parties are so related, commercially or otherwise, that, when marketed under the involved trademarks, the purchasing public might reasonably conclude that they originated with the same concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">In our opinion goods used for the removal of rust are not so related to goods which in use normally do not rust that the concurrent use of the same mark upon rust solvents \u00e1nd upon ball bearings and ball bearing devices would be likely to cause confusion in the minds of purchasers as to the origin of the goods to which the mark is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">We next come to the consideration of. the use by appellee of a part of appellant\u2019s corporate name. The leading case upon this subject is that of American Steel Foundries v. Robertson, 269 U.S. 372, pages 381, 382, 46 S.Ct. 160, at page 162, 70 L.Ed. 317, wherein it is stated: \u201c * * * Where the appropriation of the corporate name is complete, the rule of the statute, by its own terms, is absolute, and the proposed mark must be denied registration, without more; but, where less than the whole name has been appropriated, the right of registration will turn upon whether it appears that such par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>tial appropriation is of such character and extent that, under the facts of the particular case, it is calculated to deceive or confuse the public to the injury of the corporation to which the name belongs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Since, upon the question of whether the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties, we hold that confusion in origin of the goods is not likely from the concurrent use of the mark upon the goods of the respective parties, it follows that, in accordance with the rule stated in the case last cited, we must hold that the use of the mark \u201cNorma\u201d by appellee upon rust solvents would not deceive or confuse the public to the injury of appellant, to whom the name \u201cNormaHoffmann Bearings Corporation\u201d belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In this opinion we have not discussed other goods, viz., boiler compounds and soot destroyers, to which appellee applies his mark, for the reason that it is obvious that such goods are not of the same descriptive properties as the goods to which appellant applies its mark, nor are they even remotely related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
