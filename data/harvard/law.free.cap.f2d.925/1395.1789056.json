This is the second appeal to this court in this case; in the first, we reversed the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Secretary\u2019s denial of disability benefits and supplemental security income. <em>Reese v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 1093 (11th Cir.1988) (table) (unpublished opinion). On remand, the administrative law judge (AU) granted the requested benefits, and the district court affirmed without opinion. Plaintiff then moved for award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the EAJA (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A)), which provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in a suit against the United States unless the government's position in the suit was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-15\">Plaintiff disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that the AU\u2019s original decision on the merits and the Secretary\u2019s acceptance of that decision were \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d The district court reached this result because it believed that \u201cthe presence of a factual dispute among the physicians who treated and evaluated Plaintiff is sufficient to find that the Government\u2019s position was reasonable and, thus, \u2018substantially justified.\u2019 \u201d We review the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion; this standard requires great deference to the district court\u2019s findings of fact but allows for close scrutiny of its rulings on questions of law. <em>Stratton v. Bowen, </em>827 F.2d 1447, 1450 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-16\">We cannot agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the presence of a factual dispute, standing alone, precluded it from holding that the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified. The Supreme Court has held that the government\u2019s position is \u201csubstantially justified\u201d when it has a \u201creasonable basis both in <em>law and fact.\u201d Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>552, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-5\">In our first decision in this case, we held that the Secretary\u2019s decision that plaintiff could perform light work was not supported by substantial evidence and that the AU\u2019s \u201cgeneral finding\u201d in this regard could not, as a matter of law, meet the burden of demonstrating that plaintiff retains the residual capacity to work. <em>Reese v. Bowen, </em>slip op. at 3. In addition, we held that \u201cthe Secretary failed to consider Reese\u2019s complaints of subjective pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing the reasonableness of the government\u2019s position in this case, we note that both of the errors forming the basis for our original reversal were contrary to clearly established statutory and court precedent. <em>See Jean v. Nelson, </em>863 F.2d 759, 767 (11th Cir.1988) (among the factors to consider when evaluating reasonableness are \u201cviews expressed by other courts on the merits\u201d and \u201cthe clarity of the governing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-6\">Regarding the Secretary\u2019s acceptance of the AU\u2019s general finding that plaintiff could still perform light work, \u201cthis Court has long held that such conclusory statements are unacceptable.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Serv., </em>839 F.2d 1453, 1458 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe Secretary cannot claim the position was substantially justified when he accepted the conclusory statement that the AU had \u2018carefully considered all the testimony given at the hearing and the documents described in the List of Exhibits_\u2019 \u201d). Much more is required from the AU and the Secretary to facilitate judicial review of the agency decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au4R\">This [conclusory] statement tells us nothing whatsoever \u2014 it goes without saying that the AU gave the testimony the weight he believed should be accorded to it. What is required is that the AU state specifically the weight accorded to each item of evidence and why he reached that decision. In the absence of such a statement, it is impossible for a reviewing court to determine whether the ultimate decision on the merits of the claim is rational and supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1491-3\"><em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981) (cited in <em>Reese v. Bowen, </em>slip op. at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-10\">Similarly, the AU\u2019s summary dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s subjective complaints of pain failed to meet clearly established statutory requirements. The AU\u2019s finding on this issue was limited to one sentence: \u201cThe claimant\u2019s allegations of pain and discomfort have been carefully considered, however, the medical and other evidence in this case fails to establish that this pain and discomfort is severe enough to place a significant restriction on his occupational activities.\u201d Missing from the AU\u2019s opinion was any analysis of the factors that Congress has said that the agency <em>must </em>consider before discrediting such subjective complaints of pain. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A) (enacted in 1984, one year before the AU\u2019s decision in this case). Our decisions interpreting this statutory provision have made clear that the AU must consider whether (1) objective medical evidence confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from an underlying medical condition or (2) that the objectively determined medical condition is of a severity which can reasonably be expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Mason v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 1460, 1462 (11th Cir.1986) (quoting S.Rep. No. 466, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b1491-11\">The Secretary concedes on appeal that the AU committed legal error in discrediting plaintiff\u2019s subjective complaints without the required additional analysis. But, the Secretary contends that there was enough evidence supporting the AU\u2019s decision to make it \u201creasonable\u201d for our analysis. As the Secretary explains it, the AU \u201cdid not take a position contrary to the regulation regarding the evaluation of pain nor apply a higher standard, but simply neglected to recite the applicable evaluation steps.\u201d This explanation is unavailing. Given the clear congressional guidance on the proper analysis of subjective complaints of pain and our clear mandate that such findings must be supported by more than conclusory statements, we believe the Secretary\u2019s decision to accept the AU\u2019s decision had no reasonable basis in law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>whether or not it was supported by some factual evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1492-4\">Because the district court failed to consider whether the government\u2019s position had a reasonable basis in law and because we conclude that it did not, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees and REMAND the case for appropriate proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
