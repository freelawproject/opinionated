Reise, Ballard Spahr, LLP, Atlanta, GA, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b908-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">This is an appeal from the grant of CitiMortgage, Inc.\u2019s (Citi) motion to dismiss Howard D. Horowitz\u2019 (Horowitz) complaint, for failure to state a claim for relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Horowitz asserted claims for wrongful attempted foreclosure and fraud against Citi. We find that the district court properly granted Citi\u2019s motion to dismiss and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">On August 19, 2005, Horowitz executed a promissory note in favor of American Home Mortgage, Inc. (AHM) in the amount of $176,000. He also executed and conveyed a security deed to real property to AHM, securing the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Later that same day, AHM assigned its rights under Horowitz\u2019 security deed, and its rights under his promissory note, to ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. (ABN AMRO). Two years later, in 2007, ABN AMRO merged into Citi.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">On May 31, 2012, Citi sent Horowitz a letter indicating that he had defaulted on his loan obligations and that a foreclosure sale of his real property was scheduled for July 3, 2012. For four consecutive weeks, Citi published the Notice of Sale Under Power in the local newspaper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">On June 26, 2012, Horowitz filed suit against Citi, asserting claims for attempted wrongful foreclosure and fraud, alleging that Citi lacked the authority to foreclose on his real property because it did not hold Horowitz\u2019 promissory note, nor was it the assignee of his security deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">As to Citi\u2019s standing to foreclose on Horowitz\u2019 real property, it is undisputed that Horowitz executed both the security deed and promissory note to AHM. However, under the terms of the security deed, Horowitz \u201cgrant[ed] and convey[ed] to [AHM] and [AHM\u2019s] successors and assigns, with power of sale, [the real property.]\u201d When AHM assigned its rights under Horowitz\u2019 security deed to ABN AMRO, the assignment stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-18\">American Home Mortgage, Inc. hereby sells, assigns, transfers, sets over and conveys unto: ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc. and/or their [sic] respective successors or assigns as their interest may appear ... that certain [security deed] ... together with the real property therein described in said deed, and secured thereby, the notes evidencing said indebtedness having this day been transferred and assigned to the said [ABN AMRO] together with all its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>rights title and interest in and to the said deed, the property described and indebtedness thereby secured; and [ABN AMRO] is hereby subrogated to all of the rights, powers, privileges and securities vested in [AMH] under and by virtue of the aforesaid mortgage to secure debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Horowitz does not dispute the assignment from AHM to ABN AMRO. He does dispute that Citi has standing to foreclose on his real property as a result of its merger with ABN AMRO in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The district court determined that, as a result of the merger, Citi acquired the assets, rights and liabilities of ABN AMRO, including Horowitz\u2019 security deed, with power of sale, and his promissory note. <em>See Birt v. CitiMortgage, Inc., </em>No. 1:11-cv-1473-CC, Order Granting Summary Judgment, at 5-8 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 26, 2012) (Citi had standing to foreclose on plaintiffs property because, \u201cby merger of ABN AMRO and [Citi], the power to sell and foreclose was vested in the successor, [Citi],\u201d without any further assignment or conveyance). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The district court properly found that Citi had standing, and was thus entitled to exercise the power of sale in Horowitz\u2019 security deed. Therefore, Horowitz cannot state a claim for attempted wrongful foreclosure or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We have independently reviewed the record in this appeal, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel. In a thorough, well-reasoned decision, we find that the district court properly granted Citi\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">. The notice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-13\">Under and by virtue of the power of sale contained in [the Security Deed] from Howard D. Horowitz to American Home Mortgage, Inc.... said Security Deed being last transferred and assigned to ABN AMRO Mortgage Group, Inc....

But my rationale differs somewhat from that of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-14\">Under the \u201cincorporation by reference doctrine,\u201d as applied in the Eleventh Circuit, I do not believe that the district court could, at the motion to dismiss stage of the proceedings, properly consider the certificate of merger CitiMortgage attached to its motion. Only \u201cin cases in which a plaintiff refers to a document in its complaint, the document is central to its claim, its contents are not in dispute, and the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss\u201d does the doctrine allow a court to consider matters or documents beyond the four corners of the complaint and its attachments. <em>See Fin. Sec. Assurance, Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1276, 1284 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Ci-tiMortgage\u2019s certificate of merger is not central to <em>Mr. Horowitz\u2019s </em>claim. Simply stated, Mr. Horowitz would not have had \u201cto offer a copy of the article in order to prove [his] case.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1285 (quoting <em>Fudge v. Penthouse Int\u2019l, Ltd., </em>840 F.2d 1012, 1015 (1st Cir.1988)). Indeed, Mr. Horowitz alleges that CitiMortgage had no right to foreclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">I also do not think that the merger between CitiMortgage and ABN AMRO could be established by referring to the finding of another court in another case. We cannot take judicial notice of a fact found true in another action, without more. \u201cIf it were permissible for a court to take judicial notice of a fact merely because it has been found to be true in some other action, the doctrine of collateral estoppel would be superfluous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>29 F.3d 1549, 1553 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cA court may take notice of another court\u2019s order only for the limited purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>of recognizing the \u2018judicial act\u2019 that the order represents or the subject matter of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Nevertheless, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201 the district court properly took judicial notice of CitiMortgage\u2019s regulatory filings with both the New York Department of State and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and those filings establish the fact of the merger. Numerous district courts have taken judicial notice under similar circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Kohan Prod. Ltd. v. Comerica Bank, </em>No. CV 10-0034 PSG (AJWx), 2010 WL 956402, at *1 n. 1 (C.D.Cal. Mar. 11, 2010) (\u201cThe court takes judicial notice of the merger agreements under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(d) because they are \u2018capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Chevron Corp. v. Salazar, </em>807 F.Supp.2d 189, 193 n. 5 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (\u201cBoth the Merger Agreement and the Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, of which the Court also takes judicial notice, so reflect.\u201d) (record citation omitted); <em>St. John v. Bosley Inc., </em>No. 1:10-cv-954, 2011 WL 4007388, at *1 n. 2 (N.D.Ohio Sept. 8, 2011) (\u201cThe court added Bosley as a defendant after taking judicial notice that in August, 2010 Bosley, Inc. and MHR filed a Certificate of Merger issued by the Secretary of the State of Delaware.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">After taking judicial notice of the certificate of merger filed with the New York Department of State, New York law does the rest. In pertinent part, \u00a7 906 of New York\u2019s business corporation law provides that not more than thirty days after the filing of the certificate, a merger shall be effected and all rights and property of the consolidated corporation shall vest in the surviving corporation without further action. <em>See </em>N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 906. Thus, the surviving corporation, CitiMort-gage, held both the note and security deed and had standing to foreclose on Mr. Horowitz\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
