Acosta-Rodriguez states that he is in custody for a \u201cnon-existent career offender conviction.\u201d He asserts that he meets the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he is actually innocent of being a career offender. He makes no attempt to argue how the remainder of his substantive claims satisfy the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Acosta-Rodriguez\u2019s claim based on an alleged error in applying the career offender sentencing enhancement may not be asserted in this \u00a7 2241 petition because it fails to satisfy the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000). The district court properly dismissed Acosta-Rodriguez\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Padilla v.
