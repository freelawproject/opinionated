Gaskin had a total replacement of his right knee and suffered from degenerative joint disease in his left knee. Dr. Scott Duffin, an orthopedist who performed surgery and follow-up care on Gaskin\u2019s left knee, offered an assessment of Gaskin\u2019s physical limitations and indicated that Gaskin\u2019s pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>was often severe enough to interfere with his attention and concentration. The ALJ ultimately denied disability benefits after finding that Gaskin could perform jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">On appeal, Gaskin argues that the ALJ \u2014 by assigning significant weight to Dr. Duffin\u2019s opinion without expressly rejecting any aspects thereof \u2014 accepted Dr. Duffin\u2019s assessment that Gaskin\u2019s pain was often severe enough to interfere with his attention and concentration. He concludes that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert were, therefore, incomplete because they failed to include Gaskin\u2019s pain-related limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We review the ALJ\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence and whether the ALJ applied proper legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence that a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We may not reweigh the evidence or decide the facts anew, and we must defer to the ALJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence even if the evidence may preponderate against it. <em>See Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">A claimant must be under a disability to be eligible for disability insurance benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(E). A claimant is disabled if he is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically-determinable impairment that can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The claimant bears the burden of proving his disability and of presenting evidence to support his claim. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Social Security Administration applies a five-step sequential analysis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a). This process includes a determination of whether the claimant (1) is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe and medically-determinable physical or mental impairment; (3) has such an impairment that meets or equals a Listing and meets the duration requirements; (4) can perform his past relevant work, in the light of his residual functional capacity; and (5) can make an adjustment to other work, in the light of his residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">A claimant who can make an adjustment to other work is not disabled. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), (g)(1). When determining whether a claimant can make an adjustment to other work, the ALJ first determines the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>See id. </em>The claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity is an assessment, based upon all relevant evidence, of the claimant\u2019s ability to do work despite his impairments. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">The Commissioner bears the burden of demonstrating that, in the light of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity, a significant number of jobs that the claimant can perform exist in the national economy. <em>See Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v), (g)(1). The ALJ may make this determination by posing hypothetical questions to a vocational expert. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1180 (11th Cir.2011). A vocational expert\u2019s testimony, however, only constitutes substantial evidence that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>claimant can perform other work when the ALJ presented the vocational expert with a hypothetical question that comprised all of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>See Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">In reality, substantial-evidence review in cases like this one involves some intricacy. \u201c[T]he testimony of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159. The ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion, and the failure to do so constitutes error. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. \u201cMoreover, the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1179. We have written that, absent such a statement, it is impossible for us to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is rational and supported by substantial evidence; and we have said we will decline to affirm simply because some rationale \u2014 given the record \u2014 might support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">The ALJ failed to address Dr. Duffin\u2019s assessment that Gaskin\u2019s pain was often severe enough to interfere with his attention and concentration, and those limitations were not included in the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity assessment or hypothetical questions. Given the discourse in our precedents, we are unable to review correctly whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Gas-kin was not disabled. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision; and we instruct that court to remand to the ALJ for an express consideration of Dr. Duf-fin\u2019s seemingly-pertinent assessment that Gaskin\u2019s pain was often severe enough to interfere with his attention and concentration. Then, the ALJ must take into account the ALJ\u2019s resulting findings, about the impact of pain, in a residual functional capacity assessment and determine once more whether other work exists that Gas-kin can perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
