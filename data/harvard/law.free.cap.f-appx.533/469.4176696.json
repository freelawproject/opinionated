His motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Before the court is Dawson\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. In it, he argued that he was being held in violation of federal law and the constitution and that filing a motion under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate to test the legality of his detention. The district court disagreed and dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In his brief, Dawson argues that he has met the requirements to have his petition heard under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause because this court\u2019s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 in <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>453 Fed.Appx. 498 (5th Cir.2011), demonstrates his innocence, as his conviction was allegedly obtained with the aid of a paid Government witness. He further argues that <em>Wilson </em>was decided as a \u201cmini-en banc\u201d case, a term he does not define, it is precedential and overrules previous case law, despite being unpublished.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">In limited circumstances, a prisoner may invoke \u00a7 2241 to attack errors that occurred at trial or sentencing by establishing that his claim falls within \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2255(e). Specifically, a \u00a7 2241 applicant must show that the claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\"><em>Wilson </em>cannot form a basis for invoking the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. Dawson\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and therefore frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The Government has moved for a dismissal of Dawson\u2019s appeal as frivolous or, in the alternative, for an extension of time in which to file a brief. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as frivolous is granted, Dawson\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous, and the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension is denied. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">Additionally, Dawson has moved for bail pending his appeal. The motion for bail is denied. <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">We caution Dawson that future frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; MOTION TO DISMISS AS FRIVOLOUS GRANTED; MOTION FOR EXTENSION DENIED; MOTION FOR BAIL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b492-11\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
