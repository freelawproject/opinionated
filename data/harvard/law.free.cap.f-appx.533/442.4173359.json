The district court denied his motion to proceed IFP, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving in this court for IFP status, Padilla is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Padilla, however, does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. Padilla\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is therefore DENIED. Padilla\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-21\">As we recognized on November 6, 2012, Padilla has accumulated at least three strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Padilla v. Watkins, </em>491 Fed.Appx. 484, 485 (5th Cir.2012). We have not applied the \u00a7 1915(g) bar here because Padilla filed this appeal before the bar was imposed. <em>See Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir.1998). However, we reiterate that Padilla is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed in a court of the United States while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>less he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AM\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
