On appeal, a motion to proceed IFP is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); FED. R. APP. P. 24(a)(3). This court\u2019s inquiry is limited to whether the appeal involves legal points that are not frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">In 2002, Ruiz pleaded guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to possession with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), and of using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The firearm charge arose when arresting officers discovered a firearm in the car Ruiz was driving during a drug transaction, located between the driver\u2019s seat and the center console. Ruiz moved to withdraw his plea prior to sentencing, but his motion was denied following a hearing. Ruiz claimed he did not know that the gun was in the vehicle, a contention that the district court rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-25\">The district court sentenced Ruiz to 204 months of imprisonment. Ruiz filed a direct appeal challenging his guilty-plea con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>viction on the drug-trafficking charge and sentence, among other things, on the grounds that the district court did not inform him, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), of the drug quantity involved. Finding no error, this Court affirmed. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>64 Fed.Appx. 416 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In 2005, Ruiz filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion asserting numerous grounds for relief from his conviction, which the district court denied on the merits. In 2011, Ruiz filed the present \u00a7 1651(a) motion, seeking to invalidate his guilty plea on the firearm count under \u00a7 924(c). He asserts that the sentencing court erred in failing to admonish him at rearraignment that the Government was required to prove active employment of the firearm, that he never actively employed the firearm in his ease, and that he relied on his counsel\u2019s bad advice in pleading guilty to the firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The district court denied Ruiz\u2019 petition for extraordinary writ under the All Writs Act, concluding that Ruiz had an alternative remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 that precluded his All Writs Act petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996); <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). The district court denied Ruiz leave to proceed IFP, and Ruiz appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Ruiz contends that the denial of his \u00a7 1651(a) petition was error. He urges that such a petition is the only remedy available to him to invalidate his unjust 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction, presumably because any alternative remedy he would have would have been untimely or otherwise procedurally precluded. Specifically, Ruiz argues that he may seek a writ of <em>audita querela </em>and seek general \u201cextraordinary relief\u2019 through the All Writs Act despite the general availability of \u00a7 2255 relief for federal prisoners. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 509-13, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954) (holding that, despite \u00a7 2255, the writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is available to federal defendants after they are released from custody to correct fundamentally unjust federal sentences); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 487-88 (5th Cir.2010) (stating that \u201cthe writ of <em>audita querela </em>might ... survive in criminal adjudications, if there is a gap for it to fill ... [if] there is a legal objection to a judgment which has arisen subsequent to that judgment\u201d) (emphasis and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">We need not reach Ruiz\u2019s contention that relief under the All Writs Act is available to him, because he has not presented grounds for relief on the merits. Ruiz argues, essentially, that his guilty plea under \u00a7 924(c)(1) is invalid because there was no factual basis for his having <em>actively employed </em>the firearm during the drug-trafficking offense. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3) (requiring a factual basis for a guilty plea). In support, Ruiz cites <em>United States v. Carter, </em>117 F.3d 262 (5th Cir.1997), in which this Court held that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea under \u00a7 942(c)(1) was invalid where the defendant did not actually use or display the firearm during the drug transaction, but where the firearm had merely been resting on a vehicle\u2019s console. <em>Id. </em>at 264-65 (citing <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 143, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (establishing rule)). However, <em>Bailey </em>\u2014 and by exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>sion, its application in <em>Carter </em>\u2014 was legislatively overruled in 1998 when Congress amended \u00a7 924(c)(1) to criminalize not only the <em>use </em>of a firearm, but also the <em>possession </em>of a firearm in furtherance of drug-trafficking crimes. <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 25, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010) (\u201cThe 1998 alteration [of \u00a7 924] responded primarily to our decision in <em>Bailey ... </em>[which] held [that] \u00a7 924(c)(1) did not reach \u2018mere possession\u2019 of the weapon. Congress legislated a different result; in the 1998 revision, colloquially known as the Bailey Fix Act, the Legislature brought possession within the statute\u2019s compass.\u201d) (citations and other quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (providing for punishment of \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Ruiz pleaded guilty in 2002, after \u00a7 924(c)(1) was amended to prohibit the possession of a firearm during drug-trafficking offenses. The abstract of Ruiz\u2019 judgment reflects that he pleaded guilty to \u201cuse, carry or possession [of] a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime\u201d on or about July 5, 2000. The Pre-Sentence Report recites that an arresting officer \u201csaw the butt of a gun protruding between the driver\u2019s seat and the console.\u201d Ruiz does not deny that the gun was in his possession, and he does not renew his contention that he did not know the gun was in the car; he contests only the legal significance of the gun\u2019s location under <em>Carter. </em>Ruiz\u2019s reliance on <em>Carter </em>is misplaced because possession of a firearm in furtherance of the drug-trafficking offense is now a sufficient factual basis for a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Given the foregoing, Ruiz\u2019s sole substantive contention in this appeal lacks merit. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED, and his appeal DISMISSED. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. In the alternative, the district court liberally construed the petition as a motion for new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, a motion for modification of sentence under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, and a motion to vacate a federal sentence under \u00a7 2255, and the court denied relief on various procedural grounds. On appeal, Ruiz maintains that he seeks relief pursuant to the All Writs Act only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
