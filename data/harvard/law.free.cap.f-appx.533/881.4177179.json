By way of background, Brown was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>attempted robbery of a credit union, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and 2, and possession of an unregistered short barreled shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5841, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The indictment charged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Brown \u201cdid knowingly and willfully attempt to take, by force and violence and by intimidation, property and money belonging to and in the care\u201d of a credit union. The evidence at trial showed that Brown and his codefendant arrived at a credit union with the intention of robbing it, but they were arrested prior to entering the building. In its jury instructions, the district court said that, to be convicted of attempted credit union robbery, Brown had to knowingly and willfully intend to commit the substantive crime of credit union robbery \u2014 which required that Brown take property from a credit union \u201cby means of force or violence or intimidation\u201d \u2014 and to take a substantial step towards the commission of the crime. On direct appeal, Brown argued that a conviction for attempted credit union robbery required the government to establish that the defendant had used actual force <em>and </em>violence or intimidation, rather than just an attempt to engage in an act of intimidation. Reviewing the issue for plain error since Brown\u2019s counsel had not preserved the objection at trial, we rejected the claim because there was a circuit split and no controlling precedent from us or the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Brown thereafter moved the district court for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied in its entirety, concluding on the relevant ineffective assistance of counsel claims that an' attorney could not be ineffective for failing to argue an issue for which there was no controlling authority. Nevertheless, the district court issued a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) for these two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-M\">[Wjhether Brown\u2019s trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance of counsel ... by failing to argue before the district court that the Government needed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Brown used actual force, violence, or intimidation during an attempted bank robbery, thus causing his appellate lawyer to lose an otherwise valid claim on appeal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-11\">[Wjhether Brown\u2019s trial lawyer provided [ineffective assistance of counsel] by failing to object to jury instructions that, Brown claims, amended the indictment by allowing the jury to convict Brown of an attempted bank robbery without finding that he used actual force, violence, or intimidation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">On appeal, Brown raises these issues, and also argues that the district court erred in concluding that his counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue that a \u00a7 5861(d) conviction required the government to prove that he knew the characteristics of the firearm that brought it within the statute\u2019s scope.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>In a \u00a7 2255 appeal, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Devine v. United States, </em>520 F.3d 1286, 1287 (11th Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>both prongs of the ineffective assistance of counsel test set out in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Dell v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1267, 1272 (11th Cir.2013). An issue not briefed on appeal is considered abandoned. <em>United States v. Willis, </em>649 F.3d 1248, 1254 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">To make a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Courts need not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Under the first prong, the defendant must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient by demonstrating that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable under prevailing professional norms. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Under the second prong, the defendant must establish prejudice by showing a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A \u201creasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Where the prisoner alleges that counsel failed to preserve an issue for appeal, we have rejected the argument that the inquiry into prejudice is whether the appellate panel would have arrived at a different conclusion on direct appeal. Instead, we\u2019ve held that the relevant inquiry is whether the objection would have caused the factfinder to have a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Purvis v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 738-39 (11th Cir.2006). This holding was due in part to <em>Strickland\u2019s, </em>requirement that courts determine prejudice based on the outcome of the trial, not the outcome on appeal, when the claimed error occurred at the guilt stage of a trial. <em>Id. </em>at 739. We also relied on <em>Jackson v. Herring, </em>42 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir.1995), where the trial attorney had remained completely silent while the prosecutor struck all blacks from the jury, and we\u2019d asked if there was a reasonable probability of a different result at trial that was sufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 1361-62.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">First, we find unavailing Brown\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the government needed to prove that he engaged in force <em>and </em>violence or intimidation to convict him under \u00a7 2113(a). That section criminalizes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APm\">[wjhoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>from the person or presence of another, or obtains or attempts to obtain by extortion any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any ... credit union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFz\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has decided if attempted robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) requires proof of force <em>and </em>violence or intimidation, rather than just an attempt to engage in an act of intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Here, the district court did not err by denying Brown\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance because Brown did not establish <em>Strickland </em>prejudice. For starters, the relevant inquiry is not whether Brown was prejudiced on direct appeal, but, instead, whether there was a reasonable probability that the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt about Brown\u2019s guilt if his trial counsel had argued this issue before the district court. <em>See Purvis, </em>451 F.3d at 739-40. This case does not fall within the \u201crazor thin exception\u201d created in <em>Davis </em>because, unlike in <em>Davis, </em>where the attorney only failed to perfect an objection after raising it initially, Brown\u2019s attorney <em>never </em>raised the issue before the district court. <em>See id. </em>at 739-40; <em>Davis, </em>341 F.3d at 1315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">As applied here, Brown did not establish <em>Strickland </em>prejudice concerning his guilt because he did not meet his burden of proving that there was a reasonable probability that the district court would have upheld any objection or argument on whether attempted robbery under \u00a7 2113(a) requires proof of force <em>and </em>violence or intimidation. Indeed, there is a lack of controlling authority on the issue, and the majority of circuits that have addressed the issue have not decided the issue in Brown\u2019s favor. While a favorable decision on the issue would likely have precluded the jury from finding him guilty on the \u00a7 2113(a) count, as the government did not present any evidence that Brown actually used force and violence or intimidation, Brown\u2019s argument amounts to mere speculation that the district court would have resolved the issue favorably to him, and that is insufficient to establish prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">We also reject Brown\u2019s constructive amendment claim. A constructive amendment of an indictment \u2014 which occurs \u201cwhen the essential elements of the offense contained in the indictment are altered to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond what is contained in the indictment\u201d \u2014 constitutes per se reversible error. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>486 F.3d 1212, 1226-27 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Construing Brown\u2019s brief broadly, he argues that his counsel erred by failing to object to jury instructions that did not require the jury to find that he had used actual force <em>and </em>violence or intimidation, which effectively amended the indictment. But the district court did not err by denying this claim for the reasons established in the first claim. As we\u2019ve already described, there was a lack of controlling authority concerning whether a conviction under \u00a7 2113(a) required the jury to find actual force and violence or intimidation, and the majority of circuits that have addressed the issue have not decided the issue in Brown\u2019s favor. Thus, even if the indictment were constructively amended by not requiring the jury to find either violence or intimidation, Brown did not establish that he was prejudiced at trial by his attorney\u2019s failure to object to this constructive amendment. Accordingly, Brown did not meet his burden of proof to demonstrate that his counsel was ineffective. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\">. By separate order, we have construed this third argument as a motion to expand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>COA, and denied the motion. To the extent he raises it now, we decline to address it since it is outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\">. In <em>Purvis, </em>we distinguished <em>Davis v. Sec\u2019y, Dep't of Corrs., </em>341 F.3d 1310 (11th Cir.2003), where we had determined that the relevant inquiry was whether there was a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome on direct appeal had the claim been preserved. We pointed out that in <em>Davis, </em>counsel\u2019s alleged failures were committed \u201csolely\u201d in the attorney\u2019s role as appellate counsel. <em>Purvis, </em>451 F.3d at 739. We said that <em>Davis </em>was an unusual case because, there, counsel had recognized and pressed an issue before the trial court, but had neglected to take a step that was relevant only to the appellate stage of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 740. We characterized <em>Davis </em>as a \u201crazor thin exception\u201d to the general rule that prejudice is measured in terms of the impact on the result of the trial, not the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. Brown\u2019s motion to file a reply brief out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b907-5\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALu\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition should be affirmed because he has not shown prejudice under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). I write separately to emphasize two points. First, given trial counsel\u2019s complete failure to raise the \u00a7 2118(a) issue in the District Court, Mr. Brown\u2019s case does not implicate <em>Davis v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>341 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[Wjhen a defendant raises the unusual claim that trial counsel, while efficacious in raising an issue, nonetheless failed to preserve it for appeal, the appropriate prejudice inquiry asks whether there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome on appeal had the claim been preserved.\u201d). <em>Davis </em>remains binding circuit precedent and may provide the controlling prejudice standard in the appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Second, while the Court need not address <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deficient performance prong because Mr. Brown makes an insufficient showing as to prejudice, <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069, it bears repeating that \u201cthe mere absence of [controlling circuit] authority does not automatically insulate counsel\u2019s failure to object\u201d from being deemed deficient. <em>Gallo-Chamorro v. United States, </em>233 F.3d 1298, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). Since I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Brown was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to raise the \u00a7 2113(a) issue, I express no opinion about counsel\u2019s performance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
