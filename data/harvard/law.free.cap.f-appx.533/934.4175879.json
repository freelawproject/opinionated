After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Mareus, a native of the Bahamas and a national of both the Bahamas and Haiti, was deported and physically removed from the United States to Haiti in 1996. In 1998, he illegally reentered the United States and evaded law enforcement for several years. Mareus was eventually discovered living in Miami, Florida, and was indicted in June 2012 with illegally reentering the United States after previous deportation and removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). Mareus entered a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">The probation office prepared a presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) to assist the district court in determining Mareus\u2019s sentence. The PSI determined that Ma-reus had a total offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of III, which called for a sentence of 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the parties agreed that the total offense level should be reduced by three levels because Mareus had accepted responsibility. The court then concluded that the advisory sentencing guidelines range was 46 to 57 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-16\">The court went on to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The government advocated the imposition of a 46-month sentence because Mareus had been in the United States illegally for 14 years and because he had been previously convicted of a series of firearms and narcotics crimes. Mareus argued for a more lenient sentence of five years\u2019 probation because his previous criminal convictions were remote in time and would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>been considered in determining his criminal history category if he had illegally reentered the United States in 2012 rather than in 1998. He also requested a downward variance in light of his cultural assimilation and ties to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">In light of Mareus\u2019s criminal history, the district court declined to impose a probationary sentence or to grant a downward variance. It imposed a sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the guidelines range, and a three-month term of supervised release. Mareus timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">On appeal, Mareus argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on a single factor listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that the district court, in focusing solely on Mareus\u2019s criminal record, unreasonably disregarded other factors related to Mareus\u2019s history and characteristics, including his cultural assimilation into the United States and the fact that his entire family resides in the United States. He further argues that the district court\u2019s focus on Mareus\u2019s criminal history was unreasonable because his convictions were remote in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence using a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The burden of establishing unreasonableness lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence well below the statutory maximum penalty is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1322, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a 50-month sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the ten-year statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Reviewing a sentence\u2019s reasonableness requires two steps. First, we ensure that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court also must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the lands of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d 627, 638 (11th Cir.2013). We will reverse \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en bane) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court\u2019s unjustified reliance upon any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). However, courts are still permitted to attach \u201cgreat weight\u201d to one factor over others. <em>Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d at 638. Further, in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court does not need to discuss each factor explicitly. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. An acknowledgment that the district court has considered both the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to grant a downward departure based on cultural assimilation pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 8), unless the court incorrectly believes that it lacked the authority to depart from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006). Further, we will assume the court understood its authority absent a record indication to the contrary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We conclude from the record that Mareus\u2019s 46-month sentence is reasonable. He does not raise arguments of procedural unreasonableness, and he fails to demonstrate substantive unreasonableness in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. First, the district court\u2019s sentence represented the lowest end of the applicable guideline range, and we ordinarily would expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. This sentence also was well below the 20-year statutory maximum penalty. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Moreover, the 46-month sentence was needed to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and deter Mareus from further criminality. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court questioned whether a probationary sentence, as Mareus requested, would effectively deter him from returning to the United States illegally, especially since he evaded capture for 14 years after his last reentry. The court also noted that Mareus\u2019s convictions, although imposed more than 15 years ago, were for violent crimes involving drugs and firearms. In light of these considerations, a custodial sentence within the guideline range would better serve the goals set out in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">In addition, while the district court cited Mareus\u2019s criminal record as the \u201cprimary motivation\u201d for denying the variance request, [R. 30 at 25], it did not do so to the detriment of all other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d at 638; <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. The record clearly shows that the court acknowledged its application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. It heard evidence on Mareus\u2019s cultural assimilation, his family\u2019s presence in the United States, his work history, and the temporal remoteness of his convictions. The court also stated it had considered all arguments before issuing its decision. This serves as the court\u2019s sufficient acknowledgement of the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Mareus cannot ask us to reweigh the factors, absent a clear error of judgment on the district court\u2019s part. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Finally, we may not review the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to grant Mareus a downward departure based on cultural assimilation, pursuant to USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.8). Mareus does not contend that the district court misunderstood its authority to grant a downward departure. As the record does not indicate otherwise, we will presume the district court understood its authority to grant such departures, thus putting the court\u2019s ruling outside of our jurisdiction. Dudley, 468 F.3d at 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Mareus\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
