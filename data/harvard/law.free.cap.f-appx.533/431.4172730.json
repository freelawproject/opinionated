The property subject to the Note was located at 6537 Talbot Parkway, Dallas, Texas, 75232 (\u201cthe Property\u201d). In 2010, after Appellants defaulted on the mortgage payments, they contacted Wells Fargo and attempted, unsuccessfully, to apply for a loan modification. Appellants then \u201cdecided to bring the account current.\u201d In response, Wells Fargo accelerated the Note for the total amount due and ultimately foreclosed on the Property due to Appellants\u2019 default on the Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">In 2011, Appellants filed suit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against Wells Fargo alleging claims for breach of contract, anticipatory breach of contract, unreasonable collection efforts, gross negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the Texas Debt Collection Practices Act. <em>See </em>Tex. Fin.Code \u00a7\u00a7 392.001-396.353 (2006). Appellants also filed requests for an equitable remedy of accounting and for declaratory relief enjoining Wells Fargo from foreclosing on the Property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response to Appellants\u2019 third and final amended complaint, Wells Fargo filed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, which was granted by the district judge. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration and to vacate the final judgment dismissing them claims, which was denied by the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Wells Fargo then filed a motion for attorney fees and expenses which was granted in part and denied in part by the district judge. In that motion, Wells Fargo moved for $32,970.60 in attorney fees and $2,430.91 in expenses. After a detailed and thorough analysis in accordance with the applicable law of this circuit, the court ultimately granted $20,000 in attorney fees and no expenses. Appellants subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of that judgment which was also denied by the district judge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Appellants now appeal the district court judgment granting Wells Fargo\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, as well as the portion of the judgment partially granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for attorney fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">After reviewing the record, including the terms of the Note and the Deed of Trust, this court\u2019s jurisprudence, and all applicable state and federal law, we conclude that Appellants have failed to provide any persuasive argument or authority showing that the district court erred in granting Wells Fargo\u2019s 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Appellants have also failed to show that the district court erred in partially granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion for attorney fees and expenses. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment and adopt its analysis in full.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-26\">. The Note was executed by James King only. For the purposes of these proceedings, however, James King's wife, Gayle King, and their daughter, Trecia DeJean, are also named Plaintiffs-Appellants. According to Appellants, Ms. DeJean moved in with the Kings subsequent to Mr. King\u2019s execution of the Note and began assuming responsibility for ensuring that the monthly payments were made, with the permission of Mr. King.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\">. Appellants initially filed in Texas state court, and Wells Fargo removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, on grounds of diversity jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">. In 2011, the State court granted a temporary restraining order which subsequently expired. This Court denied Appellants\u2019 motion for stay or injunction pending appeal in 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-12\">. Wells Fargo does not appeal the portion of the district court judgment denying in part its motion for attorney fees and expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-13\">. Appellants argue for the first time on appeal that their default was excused by impossibility and frustration of purpose. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered. <em>Lofton </em>v. <em>McNeil Consumer &amp; Specialty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Pharms., </em>672 F.3d 372, 380-81 (5th Cir.
