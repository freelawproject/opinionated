Prior to his plea, Peters moved unsuccessfully to dismiss this count of the indictment based on his assertion that Congress violated the non-delegation doctrine by giving the Attorney General the power to decide whether the SORNA applied retroactively. Peters\u2019s conditional plea reserved his right to bring this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">In <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>632 F.3d 912 (5th Cir.2011), the defendant raised an identical challenge to the SORNA. Reviewing de novo, we noted that the non-delegation doctrine argument had been rejected in <em>United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 260-64 (5th Cir.2009). <em>Johnson, </em>632 F.3d at 917. Peters recognizes that his argument is foreclosed but presents the issue to preserve it for further appellate review in light of the dissent in <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 975, 181 L.Ed.2d 935 (2012). As Peters concedes, we are bound by <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Whaley. See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999) (noting that a panel is bound by the precedent of previous panels absent an intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling the prior precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
