Codes of Montana 1935) but warrants of arrest may also issue upon the filing of an information in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u201cIf a warrant is issued by a justice of the supreme court, or judge of a district court, it may be directed generally to any sheriff, constable, marshal, or policeman in the state, and may be executed by any of those officers to whom it may be delivered in any part of the state.\u201d Section 11736, Rev. Codes of Montana 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">\u201cA justice of the supreme court, or a judge of the district court, may, by an indorsement under his hand upon a warrant of arrest, authorize the service thereof by telegraph, and thereafter a telegraphic copy of such warrant may be sent by telegraph to one or more peace officers; and such copy is as effectual in the hands of any officer, and he must proceed in the same manner under it, as though he held an original warrant issued by the magistrate making the indorsement thereon.\u201d Section 11767, Rev. Codes of Montana 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">\u201cIf the person making the arrest is acting under the authority of a warrant, he must show the warrant, if required. \u2019 \u2019 Section 11759, Rev. Codes of Montana 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">The application of the petitioner shows that his present restraint is lawful and pursuant to the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"AErB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>If a criminal action has been properly commenced against petitioner in a court of competent jurisdiction in Flathead county and a warrant for petitioner\u2019s arrest has been issued therein directed to the sheriff of Flathead county, such warrant would be the authority under which the officer would act in arresting petitioner by taking him into custody and such warrant the officer could execute in Powell county as well as Flathead county. Sec. 11736, R. C. M.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">In the recent case of State of Montana ex rel. Bradford v. Ewing, District Judge, 120 Mont. 463, 187 Pac. (2d) 389, this court announced and followed the general rule which is that an injunction will not be granted to prevent the enforcement of the criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">The facts stated in the petition are wholly insufficient to entitle the petitioner to injunctive relief. Accordingly, the writ is denied and the petition ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
