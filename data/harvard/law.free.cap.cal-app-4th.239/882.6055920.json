J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZk\">Plaintiff Judicial Council of California, Administrative Office of the Courts (JCC), entered into a contract with defendant Jacobs Facilities, Inc. (Facilities), a wholly owned subsidiary of defendant Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (Jacobs). Performance of the contract required a license issued pursuant to the Contractors\u2019 State License Law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 7000 et seq.; CSLL), and Facilities was properly licensed when it commenced work. In the ensuing months, Jacobs, as part of a corporate reorganization, transferred the employees responsible for performing the JCC contract to another wholly owned subsidiary. In the process, Jacobs caused the new subsidiary to obtain a contractor\u2019s license, while permitting the Facilities license to expire. Notwithstanding the lapse of its license, Facilities remained the signatory on the JCC contract until nearly a year later, when the parties entered into an assignment of the contract to the new, licensed subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"A0L\">JCC sued Jacobs and the two subsidiaries under section 7031, subdivision (b), which requires an unlicensed contractor to disgorge its compensation. JCC sought return of all monies paid to Facilities under the contract, some $18 million. In response, defendants contended (1) Facilities had complied with the CSLL, (2) Facilities had \u201cinternally\u201d assigned the contract to the new subsidiary prior to expiration of its license, (3) JCC ratified the internal assignment when it consented to the assignment to the new subsidiary, and (4) Facilities had \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the CSLL under the provisions of section 7031, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">When the matter was called for trial, defendants requested a hearing on the issue of substantial compliance. The trial court deferred that hearing until after a jury trial on defendants\u2019 other defenses to JCC\u2019s claim. After the jury found for defendants, the substantial compliance hearing was never held.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">JCC appeals the denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to defendants. We reverse the judgment and attorney fees award entered on the jury\u2019s verdict, concluding Facilities violated the CSLL when it continued to act as the contracting party after its contractor\u2019s license expired. We decline to order entry of judgment for JCC, however, because defendants remain entitled to an opportunity to prove their substantial compliance under the statute. We remand for a hearing pursuant to section 7031, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">JCC is the administrative agency of California\u2019s judicial branch. In 2005, JCC issued a request for proposals (RFP) for the provision of maintenance and repair services to courthouses and other judicial branch buildings throughout Southern California. The successful respondent was Facilities, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jacobs, which is a publicly traded corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">JCC and Facilities entered into a three-year facilities maintenance and repair agreement (the contract) in April 2006. The contract anticipated Facilities would organize, supervise, and bill for building repair and maintenance, while retaining subcontractors to perform some or all of the actual repair work. Among the provisions pertinent to this lawsuit, the contract precluded its assignment by Facilities, \u201cin whole or in part,\u201d without JCC\u2019s written consent. Facilities also represented and warranted it held a class B contractor\u2019s license and agreed it would secure and maintain all licenses required for the performance of work under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Facilities commenced work under the contract, which covered a total of 121 buildings, in April 2006. In performing the contract, Facilities employees provided only administrative and oversight services, while retaining subcontractors to perform actual maintenance and repair work. When work was completed, Facilities recorded its completion in a dedicated computer system and generated an invoice. The invoices called for payment to Facilities, but the account to which JCC was directed to remit payment was a general Jacobs account from which Jacobs allocated payments among its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In December 2006, Jacobs undertook a \u201cbranding initiative\u201d designed, among other things, to reduce the costs associated with maintaining its many subsidiaries. As part of this initiative, Jacobs decided to dissolve Facilities and transfer its employees to Jacobs. Although the liquidation of Facilities into Jacobs was accomplished pursuant to a document effective December 2006, Facilities was not actually dissolved as a corporate entity until September 2010. The change in corporate structure did not affect performance of work under the contract, which was carried on in the same way by the same persons, but those persons appear to have become employees of Jacobs in January 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Throughout the reorganization, Facilities continued to invoice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>for payment and execute contractual amendments as necessary, and insurance and bonds required under the contract continued to be maintained in the name of Facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Defendant Jacobs Project Management, Co. (Management), was formed in January 2008 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Jacobs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under a written agreement, Jacobs transferred 713 employees, including some former Facilities employees, to Management, as well as the \u201cfixed assets use[d] by those employees.\u201d It appears all employees providing services to JCC under the contract became employees of Management in February 2008, although the record is not wholly clear on this point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Throughout 2008, Jacobs allocated compensation received from JCC under the contract to Management, rather than Facilities. As before, actual work under the contract was unaffected, and invoices sent to JCC continued to instruct it to remit payment to \u201cJacobs Facilities Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">When a corporation applies for a contractor\u2019s license, it must designate a \u201cqualifying individual,\u201d a corporate officer or employee who is qualified for the same license classification for which the corporation is applying. (See \u00a7 7068, subd. (b)(3).) Once the license issues, the qualifying individual is \u201cresponsible for exercising that direct supervision and control of his or her employer\u2019s or principal\u2019s construction operations to secure compliance with this chapter and the rules and regulations of the board.\u201d (\u00a7 7068.1, subd. (a).) The qualifying individual for the Facilities license was Scott McCallister. He remained in that position until August 12, 2008, at which time he voluntarily withdrew. Three days later, Management was issued a class B contractor\u2019s license, on which McCallister was the qualifying individual. Because Facilities failed to designate another qualifying individual, its contractor\u2019s license was suspended, and the license expired by operation of law in November 2008. (\u00a7 7068.2, subd. (c).) McCallister\u2019s withdrawal as the qualifying individual on the Facilities license was not legally necessary to permit him to serve in that role for Management, since the Business and Professions Code permits such overlap. (\u00a7 7068.1, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">At trial, Jacobs claimed to have performed an \u201cinternal assignment\u201d of the contract from Facilities to Management on the date the new license was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>issued to Management, but the internal assignment was not documented by a written contract or, it appears, any other writing. In explaining the internal assignment, Jacobs\u2019s witnesses said the company assigned performance of the \u201cbusiness functions\u201d of Facilities to Management \u2014 essentially transferring responsibility for performing \u201cthe work\u201d under the contract \u2014 as of the date of Management\u2019s licensure. If the Jacobs entities told JCC of the internal assignment, it was not until much later.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Although Facilities had begun divesting itself of assets and employees in December 2006, the Jacobs entities\u2019 first documented mention of the reorganization to JCC is an e-mail from April 2008, sent in connection with the negotiation of a different contract. At that time, a Jacobs employee told JCC that, as a result of a corporate reorganization, Facilities would not be the contracting entity on the new contract. During a subsequent exchange of e-mails, the employee explained that Jacobs intended to \u201cnovate\u201d existing Facilities contracts to Management, once Management acquired the necessary contractor\u2019s license. In response, a JCC employee confirmed his understanding that Jacobs intended to transfer the contract to a new operating entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Jacobs did nothing to implement the intended novation of the contract until December 2008, when a Jacobs employee sent a copy of a proposed novation agreement to JCC under a \u201cto whom it may concern\u201d cover letter. Although JCC directed the letter to a responsible JCC employee, neither he nor anyone else at JCC responded to it, and Jacobs did nothing to follow up until eight months later, in August 2009, when the same Jacobs employee sent the same proposed novation agreement again, this time addressing the cover letter to a particular JCC employee. In the meantime, in February 2009, JCC exercised the first of three discretionary one-year extensions of the contract. McCallister executed the agreement extending the contract on behalf of Facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Jacobs\u2019s August 2009 letter seeking consent to a novation did raise a response from JCC, but the parties displayed no urgency in transferring the contract until JCC learned in October 2009 that Facilities had allowed its contractor\u2019s license to lapse nearly a year earlier. JCC was particularly concerned about appearances that the \u201cAdministrative Office for the Courts, which represents the justice system, had a contractor who was not in compliance with the law.\u201d As a cure, the parties entered into an agreement assigning the contract to Management in November 2009. Hereafter, we will refer to this agreement as the \u201cassignment,\u201d distinguishing it from Jacobs\u2019s earlier internal reassignment of duties to Management, which we will refer to as the \u201cinternal assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">JCC filed this action in December 2009 against Facilities and Management. The operative complaint, JCC\u2019s second amended complaint (complaint), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>joined Jacobs as well. The complaint alleges three causes of action: breach of contract growing out of the expiration of Facilities\u2019s contractor\u2019s license;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> disgorgement under section 7031, subdivision (b), which allows a person who has employed an unlicensed contractor to obtain \u201call compensation paid\u201d to the contractor; and breach of guaranty against Jacobs. Management cross-claimed against JCC for compensation payable under the contract that JCC began to withhold after it learned the Facilities license had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">JCC\u2019s statutory and contract claims were bifurcated, and the statutory claims proceeded to trial in April 2012. Prior to trial, defendants requested a \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d hearing from the trial court. Under section 7031, subdivision (e), a contractor who has failed strictly to comply with the CSLL can avoid disgorgement if the \u201ccourt\u201d determines that the contractor substantially complied, as defined in section 7031, subdivision (e). Among other elements, the contractor must show that it \u201cacted reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure.\u201d (\u00a7 7031, subd. (e)(2).) The court granted defendants\u2019 request, but it deferred the hearing until \u201cafter the case went to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Responding to a special verdict, the jury found Facilities had maintained a contractor\u2019s license at all times while performing the contract; Facilities had \u201cinternally assigned]\u201d the contract to Management prior to the expiration of the Facilities license; JCC was not \u201cadversely affect[ed]\u201d by the internal assignment; and Management was owed $4,669,376. The jury also found that Facilities had been paid $18,331,911 by JCC for its work under the contract, but the jury declined to require Facilities to disgorge that amount. The deferred substantial compliance hearing was never held.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In November 2013, JCC dismissed with prejudice its contract cause of action, and Management dismissed the claims in its cross-complaint seeking relief other than recovery under the unpaid invoices. On motion of the Jacobs entities, the trial court entered a defense judgment on JCC\u2019s statutory claim and Management\u2019s counterclaim for unpaid invoices, requiring JCC to pay Management the $4.7 million found by the jury. The court thereafter summarily denied JCC\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). In February 2014, the trial court granted the Jacobs entities\u2019 motion for contractual attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>JCC appeals the denial of its motion for JNOY and the award of attorney fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">A. <em>Denial of JCC\u2019s JNOV Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The evidence is essentially undisputed that Facilities contracted to deliver services requiring a contractor\u2019s license, allowed its license to expire, and continued to deliver the services while unlicensed. On its face, this would appear to constitute a violation of the CSLL, entitling JCC to the remedies specified in section 7031. While it might be argued that the violation was merely a technical one, given Management\u2019s licensure, this is an argument for substantial compliance, an issue deferred by the trial court. Accordingly, the question before the jury, and now before us, was whether defendants <em>strictly </em>complied with the statute. Any failure of compliance, whether or not technical or de minimis, requires reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Defendants argue we can affirm the jury\u2019s conclusion the requirements of the CSLL were met because (1) they did not violate the CSLL because the statute does not penalize changes in a contractor\u2019s form of business; (2) the internal assignment of the contract from Facilities to Management prevented a violation; or (3) in executing the assignment, JCC retroactively ratified an assignment from Facilities to Management as of the time Management acquired its license, thereby avoiding a violation. We find none of these arguments sufficient to uphold the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">1. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The CSLL provides \u201ca comprehensive scheme which governs contractors doing business in California.\u201d <em>(Asdourian </em>v. <em>Araj </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 276, 282 [211 Cal.Rptr. 703, 696 P.2d 95] <em>(Asdourian).) </em>\u201cThe purpose of the licensing law is to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services. [Citation.] The licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in California have the requisite skill and character, understand applicable local laws and codes, and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business.\u201d <em>(Hydrotech Systems, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Oasis Waterpark </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 988, 995 [277 Cal.Rptr. 517, 803 P.2d 370] <em>(Hydrotech).) </em>For purposes of the CSLL, \u201ca contractor is any person who undertakes to or offers to undertake to ... , or does himself or herself or by or through others, construct, alter, [or] repair . . . any . . . structure, project, development or improvement, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>do any part thereof . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7026.) There is no dispute the work undertaken by Facilities in the contract required a contractor\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">The two provisions of the CSLL of concern here are designed to enforce compliance with the CSLL\u2019s licensing requirements. Section 7031, subdivision (a) provides that no person \u201cengaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor\u201d can bring an action for compensation for work requiring a contractor\u2019s license if the person was not properly licensed at all times during the performance of the work.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 7031, subdivision (b) goes further, permitting a person \u201cwho utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor\u201d to bring an action for disgorgement of \u201call compensation paid to the unlicensed contractor.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the language of the two provisions is somewhat different, they are interpreted \u201cin a consistent manner, resulting in the same remedy regardless of whether the unlicensed contractor is the plaintiff or the defendant.\u201d <em>(Alatriste v. Cesar\u2019s Exterior Designs, Inc. </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 656, 666 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 277] <em>(Alatriste).) </em>The statutory intent behind section 7031, subdivisions (a) and (b) is \u201cto discourage persons who have failed to comply with the licensing law from offering or providing their unlicensed services for pay.\u201d <em>(Hydrotech, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 995.) Because the remedies of subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 7031 are essentially two sides of the same coin in denying' compensation to an unlicensed contractor, we will refer to the remedies jointly as \u201cforfeiture.\u201d Both aspects of forfeiture are involved here, since JCC seeks disgorgement of compensation paid under subdivision (b), while the Jacobs entities were awarded a judgment for compensation withheld by JCC, which subdivision (a) would preclude them from recovering if a CSLL violation were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Because it denies all compensation for a contractor\u2019s work, regardless of the quality of the work or the reasons for the failure of licensure, section 7031 can have harsh and seemingly unfair effects. To mitigate these effects, our courts developed, in the decades prior to 1990, the doctrine of \u201csubstantial compliance,\u201d which was applied \u201cin exceptional circumstances [when] the purposes of the [CSLL] are not furthered by strict enforcement of section 7031.\u201d <em>(Asdourian, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 282.) Recognizing the \u201c \u2018the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>severity of th[e] sanction\u2019 \u201d imposed by section 7031, the courts did not \u201cinsist\u00ed] on literal compliance [with the CSLL] in the situation in which the party seeking to escape his obligation has received the full protection which the statute contemplates.\u2019 \u201d (Asdourian, at pp. 282-283.) To excuse a failure of strict compliance with the CSLL by invoking the doctrine of substantial compliance, \u201cthe test [was] whether the contractor\u2019s \u2018substantial compliance with the licensing requirements satisfies the policy of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Latipac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 278, 281 [49 Cal.Rptr. 676, 411 P.2d 564].)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Judicial discretion in the enforcement of section 7031 came to an end in 1989, when the Legislature amended section 7031 to abolish the doctrine of substantial compliance. The new language stated unequivocally: \u201cThe judicial doctrine of substantial compliance shall not apply to this section . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7031, former subd. (d); Stats. 1989, ch. 368, \u00a7 1, p. 1509; see <em>MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental &amp; Metal Works Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 429 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 755, 115 P.3d 41] <em>(MW Erectors).) </em>In an extensive discussion of the amendment, <em>MW Erectors </em>characterized the statutory history as making clear the Legislature intended \u201cto narrow a \u2018loophole\u2019 created by the <em>courts\u2019 </em>use of the substantial compliance doctrine to avoid \u2018apply[ing] the licensing law strictly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 430.) The unequivocal language of the amendment communicates unambiguously the Legislature\u2019s insistence on strict enforcement of section 7031. Although statutory amendments since 1989 have reintroduced a limited defense of substantial compliance, via subdivision (e) of section 7031, compliance with the terms of subdivision (e) is the exclusive means for avoiding forfeiture in the event of a violation of CSLL.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(MW Erectors, </em>at pp. 429, 432-434; <em>Pacific Caisson &amp; Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc. </em>(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 681, 694 [130 Cal.Rptr.3d 430].)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Courts have taken their cue from the Legislature in enforcing the letter of the law, consoled by the Legislature\u2019s \u201c \u2018 \u201cdetermination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 423, italics omitted.) Accordingly, if a contractor is unlicensed for any period of time while delivering construction services, the contractor forfeits <em>all </em>compensation for the work, not merely compensation for the period when the contractor was unlicensed. <em>(Alatriste, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 665.) Although construction contractors often make substantial payments to others for materials and labor, an unlicensed contractor forfeits all money paid, without offsets for such payments to third parties. <em>(Ahdout v. Hekmatjah </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 21, 31 [152 Cal.Rptr.3d 199] <em>(Ahdout).) </em>Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>section 7031 is held to apply \u201c \u2018[r]egardless of the equities\u2019 \u201d <em>(MW Erectors, </em>at p. 423), unlicensed contractors are prohibited from asserting equitable defenses, such as estoppel, to forfeiture. (See <em>Twenty-Nine Palms Enterprises Corp. v. Bardos </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1455 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 52] <em>(Twenty-Nine Palms).) </em>On the contrary, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[c]ourts may not resort to equitable considerations in defiance of section 7031.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ahdout, </em>at p. 31.) As a result, an unlicensed contractor is subject to forfeiture even if the other contracting party was aware of the contractor\u2019s lack of a license, and the other party\u2019s bad faith or unjust enrichment cannot be asserted by the contractor as a defense to forfeiture. <em>(MW Erectors, </em>at p. 424.) For a contractor failing to qualify under the statutory safe harbor of subdivision (e), section 7031 is truly a strict liability statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe trial court\u2019s power to grant a motion for JNOV is the same as its power to grant a directed verdict. [Citation.] The court must accept as true the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict, disregarding all conflicting evidence and indulging in every legitimate inference that may be drawn in support of the judgment. The court may grant the motion only if there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict. [Citations.] On appeal from the denial of a motion for JNOV, we determine whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, supporting the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP </em>(2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1237 [166 Cal.Rptr.3d 676].) Where, however, the trial court\u2019s denial of JNOV is based on an issue of law, our review is de novo. <em>(Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures &amp; Television </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1138 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">2. <em>Penalizing Changes in Business Form Under the CSLL</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As suggested above, we agree with JCC that, on the basis of what is materially undisputed evidence, the Jacobs entities failed to comply with the CSLL. The analysis is straightforward. Facilities contracted with JCC to supply services requiring a contractor\u2019s license. Although Facilities was licensed at the time the contract was made, its license expired in November 2008. Yet Facilities continued to deliver services and accept compensation from JCC as the signatory under the contract until November 2009, when the assignment was executed. Because Facilities was unlicensed for a portion of the period of its contract performance, its compensation under the contract is subject to forfeiture under subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 7031.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Defendants argue section 7031 was not intended to penalize a violation resulting from a mere change in business form, citing language to similar effect from <em>E. J. Franks Construction, Inc. v. Sahota </em>(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1123 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 778] <em>(Franks). </em>In <em>Franks, </em>the sole shareholder of the plaintiff corporation entered into a home construction contract as a sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>proprietorship. During performance of the contract, he incorporated the business, creating the plaintiff corporation, and the contractor\u2019s license that had been issued to him in his personal capacity was reissued to his corporation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(Franks, </em>at p. 1126.) The corporation then took over work on the residence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1126, 1131.) The defendants sought to avoid payment for the corporation\u2019s work under section 7031, arguing it was not licensed at all times during the performance of the contract. <em>(Franks, </em>at p. 1126.) The court held section 7031 inapplicable because at no time was work on the home provided by an unlicensed contractor; rather, the court found, the circumstances involved a mere change in business entity by a licensed contractor, thereby maintaining proper licensure throughout. Section 7031, the court concluded, \u201cis not intended to deter <em>licensed </em>contractors from changing a business entity\u2019s status and obtaining a reissuance of the license to the new entity during a contract period.\u201d <em>(Franks, </em>at p. 1129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">While <em>Franks </em>may have reached the correct result on its facts, the broad interpretation of its language urged by defendants cannot be justified, and the decision should only cautiously be applied beyond the precise situation before that court. <em>Franks </em>never mentions the doctrine of substantial compliance, but to the extent the court purported to approve the delivery of services under a construction contract by an entity that was not licensed at the time work on the construction began, the court was necessarily invoking the now defunct doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While it may be true that section 7031 was not intended to deter licensed contractors from changing the form of a business entity, there is nothing in the statute to suggest that a violation of the CSLL occurring during or as a result of such a change is excused. On the contrary, by restricting the doctrine of substantial compliance to the circumstances established in section 7031, subdivision (e), the Legislature implicitly ruled that any CSLL violation not satisfying subdivision (e), regardless of its cause, is subject to section 7031.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>For purposes of this decision, however, we need not decide whether <em>Franks </em>was correctly reasoned. It is sufficient to note the decision\u2019s rationale rested heavily on the continuity of licensure resulting from reissuance of the license of the sole proprietorship to the corporation, in effect perpetuating the license. As the court held, the CSLL was not intended to deter a contractor from changing its business form and \u201cobtaining a reissuance of the license to the new entity.\u201d <em>(Franks, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.4th at p. 1129.) That is not what happened here. Facilities did not change its business form, nor did it transfer its license to another entity. Rather, an entirely new entity was created, and a new contractor\u2019s license was issued to Management. Following the licensure of Management, Facilities retained both its corporate existence and its license, although the license was suspended and eventually expired. Unlike the hand off of both license and business form that occurred in <em>Franks, </em>Jacobs maintained two separate business entities and two licenses for a significant period of time. The continuity of license and business entity that was central to the rationale of <em>Franks </em>was not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In arguing their corporate reorganization did not result in a violation of the CSLL, defendants contend disgorgement in these circumstances does not serve the statutory purposes. Part of the Legislature\u2019s purpose, however, was to impose \u201cstrict and harsh penalties\u201d <em>(MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 418) in order to ensure contractor compliance with the statute. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Hydrotech: </em>\u201cThe purpose of the licensing law is to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services. [Citation.] . . . [\u00b6] Section 7031 advances this purpose by withholding judicial aid from those who seek compensation for unlicensed contract work. The obvious statutory intent is to discourage persons who have failed to comply with the licensing law from offering or providing their unlicensed services for pay. [\u00b6] Because of the strength and clarity of this policy, it is well settled that section 7031 applies despite injustice to the unlicensed contractor. \u2018Section 7031 represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business <em>outweighs any harshness between the parties, </em>and that such deterrence can best be realized by denying violators the right to maintain any action for compensation in the courts of this state.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hydrotech, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 995.) To the extent of serving that deterrent purpose, loss of compensation by the Jacobs entities was fully within the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Yet we acknowledge penalizing the Jacobs entities for these technical transgressions only indirectly serves the CSLL\u2019s larger purpose of preventing the delivery of services by unqualified contractors, since the Jacobs entities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>were neither dishonest nor incompetent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For better or worse, however, this is beside the point. The doctrine of substantial compliance, as developed by the courts, attempted to limit the forfeiture remedy to circumstances in which that remedy served the larger statutory purpose. In that form, the doctrine was rejected by the Legislature. It is preserved in a restricted statutory form; thus, courts can no longer exercise discretion in the application of the doctrine. To avoid forfeiture for a CSLL violation, a contractor must now satisfy the terms of section 7031, subdivision (e). (See generally <em>MW Erectors, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at pp. 432-434.) To the extent the contractor fails to satisfy that exception, the courts have no choice but to allow forfeiture, regardless of the nature of the violation or its relation to the larger ends of the CSLL.  \u201cOur function is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent, and \u2018not to determine whether the Legislature\u2019s policy choices were right or wrong.\u2019 [Citation.] Courts may not evaluate the desirability of the policies embodied in legislation. \u2018 \u201c[T]he choice among competing policy considerations in enacting laws is a legislative function.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Alatriste, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 672.) While we appreciate the potentially great harshness of this legislation in these circumstances, any argument for expansion of the substantial compliance doctrine must be directed to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">3. <em>The Effect of the Internal Assignment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Defendants argue Facilities internally assigned the contract to Management after its acquisition of a license in August 2008, thereby avoiding a violation upon the expiration of Facilities\u2019s license. We conclude the internal assignment was irrelevant to the issue of CSLL compliance because Facilities continued to act in the capacity of a contractor until November 2009, when it was relieved of that role by the assignment. Facilities was therefore required by the CSLL to maintain a contractor\u2019s license until that time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">As a practical matter, the internal assignment shifted responsibility for providing services under the contract from Facilities to Management. The requirement of licensure under section 7031, however, does not necessarily adhere to the person who is performing services under a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>contract. Rather, a license is required for any person who is \u201cengaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) Following the internal assignment, Facilities did not cease its involvement in the contract. On the contrary, Facilities continued as the signatory on the contract, executed amendments to it, issued invoices and received payments, and maintained in its own name on the insurance and bond required under the contract. Because JCC was given no formal notification of the change, it continued to look to Facilities for performance. By continuing to serve after the internal assignment as the contracting entity in connection with work requiring a contractor\u2019s license, Facilities continued to act \u201cin the capacity of\u2019 a contractor, notwithstanding Jacobs\u2019s delegation of performance to Management. Facilities therefore was required to be licensed until the time it was relieved of this role by the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Controlling in this regard is <em>Opp v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 71 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 260], The plaintiff in Opp, an individual, was a licensed contractor who served as the president of an unlicensed corporation. Opp\u2019s corporation executed a subcontract for construction services under his individual license number. When Opp brought an action for payment, the defendant asserted the bar of section 7031, subdivision (a), arguing the corporate signatory to the contract was unlicensed. <em>(Opp, </em>at pp. 72-73.) Opp claimed section 7031 was inapplicable because he used his personal license number in executing the contract, personally supervised the work, and dealt with the general contractor as a sole proprietor. <em>(Opp, </em>at p. 74.) The court rejected the argument, distinguishing between Opp\u2019s performance of work under the subcontract and his corporation\u2019s agreement to deliver that performance. As the court reasoned, the CSLL does not necessarily require \u201cthe person who \u2018does the work\u2019 \u201d to possess a license, but rather the person who qualifies as a contractor under the statute by acting in the capacity of a contractor. <em>(Opp, </em>at p. 74.) Such a person, the statute recognizes, can perform construction services \u201chimself or herself or by or through others.\u201d (\u00a7 7026.) As the court concluded, \u201cThe issue, then, is not who \u2018did the work,\u2019 but who was \u2018engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Opp, </em>at p. 75.) Because Opp\u2019s corporation undertook to provide construction services by executing the contract, the court held, the corporation was required by the CSLL to possess a license, and its failure to possess a license precluded its recovery of compensation for the work. <em>(Opp, </em>at p. 75; cf. <em>Montgomery Sansome LP v. Rezai </em>(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 786, 797 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 181]; <em>Twenty-Nine Palms, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1449-1450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Putting aside the issue of ratification, considered below, there is no evidence to suggest JCC gave its written consent to a transfer of responsibilities, required by the contract to effect a valid assignment, prior to November 2009. Without th\u00e9 consent of the obligee, the delegation of a duty by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>obligor under a contract does not extinguish the obligor\u2019s duty. (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 318, p. 19.) Accordingly, even if Facilities unilaterally delegated its duties under the contract through an internal assignment to Management in August 2008, Facilities remained responsible to JCC for the delivery of services. Further, as noted above, Facilities continued to act as the contracting party vis-\u00e1-vis JCC, executing contract amendments, maintaining insurance, and sending invoices in its own name. Under the rule of <em>Opp, </em>Facilities\u2019s delegation of performance under the contract to Management did not relieve Facilities of its obligation under the CSLL to remain licensed so long as it was obligated to deliver services under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">For this reason, we conclude the jury\u2019s finding that Facilities maintained a contractor\u2019s license \u201cat all times while engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor in connection with\u201d the contract is not supported by substantial evidence. The evidence is undisputed that Facilities continued to act as a contractor by remaining the signatory on the contract and accepting compensation even after its license expired in November 2008. Defendants contend that Management\u2019s assumption of day-to-day work under the contact provided evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding but Management\u2019s performance of such work did not preclude Facilities from continuing to act as a contractor. In remaining the signatory on the contract, continuing to secure bonding and insurance, executing contract amendments, and soliciting and receiving payments, Facilities continued to act as a contractor after the lapse of its license. Management\u2019s assumption of day-to-day duties is not evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Defendants argue that following the internal assignment, Facilities was merely a surety of Management\u2019s performance and therefore did not require a license, citing <em>Wiseman v. Sklar </em>(1930) 104 Cal.App. 369 [285 P. 1081] and <em>Cutting Packing Co. v. Packers\u2019 Exch. </em>(1890) 86 Cal. 574, 577 [25 P. 52]. Neither case relieves Facilities of its responsibilities here. In a sentence quoted only partially by Facilities in its brief, the <em>Wiseman </em>court explained the effect of an unconsented assignment; \u201c \u2018The obligations of an assignor of a contract continue to rest upon him and he will be required to respond to the other party to the contract in the event of a default on the part of the assignee.\u2019 \u201d (Wiseman, at p. 374.) As a result, \u201cirrespective of the legality or lack of legality of the assignment, [the assignor] was at all times responsible to [the other parties] under the contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 374-375.) As this demonstrates, <em>Wiseman </em>does not suggest that, following an unconsented assignment, the obligor under a contract is relegated to the role of surety. <em>Cutting Packing </em>is similar. While the decision refers to the assignor as a surety, the term is used only to describe the assignor\u2019s relationship to the assignee; that is, if the assignee failed to pay, the assignor would be required to pay. With respect to the obligee under the contract, \u201cthe burden of the obligation that rested upon the [assignor] . . . could not be transferred without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>the consent of [the obligee], [Citation.] And as he refused to consent ... the relations of himself and the plaintiff as to such burden were not affected by the assignment of the contract.\u201d <em>(Cutting Packing Co., </em>at p. 576.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, as to JCC, the internal assignment did not alter Facilities\u2019s duties under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Yet even if Facilities became a common law surety, it would not have been relieved of the duty of licensure under the CSLL, given its continued status as the contracting party after the internal assignment. Section 7044.2, the exception for sureties cited by Facilities, applies only to an \u201cadmitted surety insurer,\u201d and only when it \u201cengages a contractor to undertake the completion of a contract on which a performance or completion bond was issued by the surety insurer.\u201d There is no evidence Facilities was an admitted surety insurer or had issued a bond to guarantee performance. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 995.120, subd. (a) [defining admitted surety insurer as \u201ca corporate insurer or a reciprocal or interinsurance exchange\u201d licensed under the Ins. Code].) Nothing in the Business and Professions Code outside section 7044.2 exempts a surety from the requirement of licensure while acting in the capacity of a contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Defendants also argue the internal assignment did not require JCC\u2019s approval because it resulted from a corporate reorganization. The principle was first suggested in <em>Trubowitch v. Riverbank Canning Co. </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 335 [182 P.2d 182] (Trubowitch), in which the plaintiff, an assignee, sought to arbitrate a dispute over nondelivery of fruit under a contract containing a nonassignment clause. After the contract was made, the original party, a corporation, was dissolved, and its assets were distributed to its shareholders, who carried on the business. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 337-338.) The defendant resisted arbitration over its nondelivery because it had not consented to an assignment to the shareholders. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 338.) In considering the issue, the court held, \u201cif an assignment results merely from a change in the legal form of ownership of a business, its validity depends upon whether it affects the interests of the parties protected by the nonassignability of the contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 344-345.) In finding the assignment valid under this principle, <em>Trubowitch </em>reasoned the \u201cseller\u2019s financial interests were fully protected\u201d because the contract involved only the delivery of goods and contained provisions ensuring payment would be made.- <em>(Id. </em>at p. 346.) The court distinguished such a contract from one for the provision of \u201cservices requiring special skill, capacity or taste.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>In the second decision cited by defendants, <em>People ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. </em>v. <em>McNamara Corp. Ltd. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 641 [104 Cal.Rptr. 822] <em>(McNamara), </em>the defendant corporation was granted a state construction contract. Following its entry into the contract, the defendant assigned its interest in the contract to its wholly owned subsidiary without obtaining the state\u2019s consent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 645.) After performance of the contract was \u201cbrought to satisfactory completion\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the state defended against a claim for payment, in part, by contending the contract was rendered unenforceable as a result of the lack of consent. While the court quoted <em>Trubowitch </em>in reaching its conclusion, it ultimately held that the assignment did not render the contract unenforceable because the unconsented assignment was ineffective. Because the parent corporation remained responsible to the state under the contract, the court held, to deny enforcement \u201cwould be to exalt form above substance.\u201d <em>(McNamara, </em>at p. 649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Accordingly, neither <em>Trubowitch </em>nor <em>McNamara </em>holds that contracts are freely assignable among the wholly owned subsidiaries of a corporate parent, notwithstanding the presence of a nonassignment clause. The holding in <em>Trubowitch </em>was actually quite narrow. The contract was merely for the delivery of goods, and there were provisions in the contract to ensure the defendant would receive payment for the goods. <em>(Trubowitch, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 346.) The court expressly noted that a different result was likely if the contract required, as here, \u201cservices requiring special skill, capacity or taste.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) McNamara, </em>in turn, appears to have based its holding on the ineffective nature of an unconsented assignment. Just as we have held with respect to Facilities, <em>McNamara </em>found the defendant, the putative assignor, continued to have an \u201cunaltered duty ... to perform the contract\u201d notwithstanding the assignment, since, in the absence of state consent, the assignment was ineffective to shift the defendant\u2019s obligation to the state to perform. <em>(McNamara, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d at p. 649.) Both decisions are therefore consistent with our conclusion that the internal assignment did not relieve Facilities of its status of obligor under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The essence of defendants\u2019 argument is that there was no CSLL violation because Management, following its licensure, began performing day-to-day work under the contract well before the lapse of Facilities\u2019s license. Indeed, Facilities was incapable of such work, because the necessary employees and assets had been transferred to Management. The CSLL is not necessarily satisfied merely because the person or entity actually performing services under a contract is licensed. (See, e.g., <em>Vallejo Development Co. v. Beck Development Co. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 929, 938 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 669] [unlicensed entity that entered into contract and claimed merely to be the \u201c \u2018administrator\u2019 \u201d of work barred from recovery].) Rather, a license is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>required for any person who is \u201cengaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.\u201d (\u00a7 7031, subd. (a).) In remaining the responsible party on the contract, Facilities continued to act as a contractor well past the lapse of its license. Further, while Facilities may not have maintained the employees necessary to perform day-to-day work, it continued in corporate existence and retained officers, thereby permitting it to carry out such administrative duties as securing insurance and bonding, soliciting and accepting payment, and executing contract amendments. Because these activities were in the capacity of a contractor, Facilities was required to be licensed until execution of the assignment relieved it of that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">4. <em>Ratification Through the Assignment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Even if the internal assignment was ineffective in avoiding a forfeiture, defendants argue (1) JCC ratified the internal assignment in executing the assignment and (2) the assignment itself was retroactive or related back to the date of the internal assignment. It is by no means clear that a violation of the CSLL can be cured after the fact in this manner, but we assume its effectiveness for purpose of argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The parties to the assignment are JCC and the three Jacobs entities. The recitals of the assignment state (1) Jacobs, at some unspecified time, notified JCC that due to a corporate consolidation Facilities would no longer enter into contracts for the type of services provided under the contract and that such services \u201care\u201d being performed by Management; (2) in furtherance of Jacobs\u2019s corporate consolidation, the assignment \u201cis intended to evidence [Facilities\u2019s] assignment of the Contract to [Management], and [Management\u2019s] assumption of the Contract\u201d; (3) Facilities \u201cdesires to memorialize its assignment of the Contract to [Management]\u201d; (4) Management \u201cdesires to memorialize its assumption of the Contract\u201d; and (5) Management possesses the qualifications to perform under the contract. The covenants of the assignment include an assignment of the contract from Facilities to Management,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> a ratification by Management of \u201call actions taken by [Facilities] under or with respect to the Contract,\u201d a warrant by Management of its suitability, a consent by JCC to the assignment, and a guaranty by Jacobs of Management\u2019s performance. The covenant of assignment states Management assumes the contract \u201cas if [Management] was the original party to the Contract.\u201d JCC\u2019s consent states: \u201cThe State hereby executes and enters into this Agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>solely for the purpose of consenting to, and the State hereby consents to, the Assignment and Assumption of the Contract on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Defendants argue the jury could have relied on the assignment as evidence in finding a ratification of the internal assignment. In making this argument, defendants seek to convert what would appear to be an issue of contract interpretation into an issue of fact, thereby invoking the deferential standard of review applicable to appellate review of findings of fact. We might agree with defendants if there were some other evidence to support a finding of ratification. That is not the case. There is no indication the parties even discussed JCC\u2019s ratification of the internal assignment. Instead, Facilities\u2019s <em>only </em>evidence of a ratification is the effect of the assignment. The issue is therefore one of contract interpretation, to which we apply de novo review. <em>(Pittsburg Unified School Dist. v. S.J. Amoroso Construction Co., Inc. </em>(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 808, 826 [181 Cal.Rptr.3d 694].)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We find little or nothing in the assignment to support a conclusion JCC ratified the internal assignment. Most importantly, there is no express covenant of ratification. If the parties had intended for JCC to ratify the internal assignment, it would have been simple for them to include such a covenant. To the contrary, in the places in the agreement where one might expect confirmation of a ratification by JCC, it is absent. Most obviously, the provision entitled \u201cRatification\u201d refers only to Management\u2019s ratification of actions taken by Facilities under the contract; there is no mention of ratification by JCC of the internal assignment. In addition, the covenant relating to JCC\u2019s consent to the assignment, another logical place to insert a provision relating to ratification by JCC, makes no mention of it. That provision states only that JCC consents to the assignment itself, not to any earlier internal assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">As discussed above, the assignment contained a series of recitals that referred indirectly to the internal assignment. One of these constituted an acknowledgement by JCC that, at some unspecified date prior to the execution of the assignment, Facilities had notified JCC that Management was actually performing the services being delivered under the contract. Defendants argue from this and the other recitals that the assignment should be interpreted as effecting the internal assignment, which occurred over a year earlier. The language of the covenants suggests otherwise. The language of the assignment covenant states Facilities \u201chereby . . . assigns and transfers the Contract\u201d and Management \u201chereby assumes the Contract.\u201d Both are phrased in the present tense, implying the transfer of rights and duties occurred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>means of the assignment itself, at the time of execution of the assignment. There is no reason to construe this language to ratify or recognize an earlier transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Defendants also argue the language in the assignment covenant stating Management assumes the contract \u201cas if [Management] was the original party to the Contract\u201d is evidence of a ratification. The meaning and legal implications of this phrase are unclear, but there is no reason to construe it as a ratification of the internal assignment, which did not occur until two years after the execution of the contract. If the language were taken literally, it would substitute one CSLL violation for another, since Management did not possess a license until two years after performance of the contract began.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Defendants also argue JCC \u201crelinquished its right to object to the [internal] assignment because a subsequent consent to a prior assignment \u2018relates back to the time of the assignment,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>University of Judaism v. Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 937, 942 [132 Cal.Rptr. 907] <em>(Transamerica). </em>As part of its acquisition of real property, the plaintiff in <em>Transamerica </em>was assigned a fire insurance policy covering the property, issued by the defendants. No change in use occurred as a result, of the acquisition, since the lessee of the property was the same before and after. One month later, the property burned, and the defendants were not notified of the assignment of their policy until after the fire. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 939.) They attempted to cancel the policy, citing a clause requiring the insurers\u2019 consent to any assignment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 940.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In denying cancellation, the court noted the purpose of the nonassignment provision was to prevent an increase of risk of loss due to a change of ownership without the knowledge of the insurer. <em>(Transamerica, supra, </em>61 Cal.App.3d at p. 940.) The court explained: \u201cIn this case, had notice been promptly given prior to the loss, defendants would have routinely approved the assignment of the policy to plaintiff. . . . There is no evidence that the change of ownership in any way increased the risk to defendants. Since the change of ownership did not increase the risk to defendants, and they would have routinely approved the assignment, they cannot claim they suffered any prejudice from the late notice. [Citation.] [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] The language of the provision is consistent with plaintiff\u2019s theory that defendants should be deemed to have consented to the assignment, and that such consent relates back to the time of the assignment. ... To avoid a forfeiture, plaintiff may, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>lieu of express approval, show that the assignment would have been routinely approved.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 942, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Assignment clauses in insurance policies are subject to uniquely applicable rules, including statutory restrictions on their enforcement. (See, e.g., <em>Fluor Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1175, 1205-1206 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 498, 354 P.3d 302] [Ins. Code, \u00a7 520 prohibits the enforcement of a nonassignment clause to bar recovery for a loss by a policy assignee].) We conclude Transamerica\u2019s finding of deemed approval and relation back must be restricted to the assignment of standard property insurance policies, the situation before the <em>Transamerica </em>court. It seems likely, as the court believed, that property insurers routinely approve the assignment of their policies from the seller to the purchaser of covered property when the underlying use of the property does not change. In the absence of a change in use, there is unlikely to be a good faith reason to refuse. Further, if an assignment is approved, the approval necessarily relates back to the date of the sale in order to avoid a lapse in insurance coverage. There is no basis, however, for applying this rule to the assignment of other, less standardized contracts. To do so would cause the enforceability of nonassignment clauses to depend upon an after-the-fact evaluation of the likelihood of routine approval of a typical assignment, an entirely impractical standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In any event, there was no evidence to suggest JCC would \u201croutinely\u201d consent to the type of assignment sought by Facilities, as required by <em>Transamerica. </em>JCC engaged in a formal RFP process in order to find a suitable service provider. Any change in provider, even if due to a corporate reorganization, would require similar due diligence. JCC would necessarily have wanted to satisfy itself the assignment posed no business risk, even if the assignment merely recognized a change in corporate structure. Simply as a matter of fact, JCC delayed when first approached for a novation, and it refused to sign an assent to novation and would not consent to the assignment without a guarantee of performance by Jacobs. There was nothing routine about its consent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Nor is there any justification for finding that JCC\u2019s consent relates back to the time of the internal assignment. As noted above, such consent is necessary in the insurance context to avoid a lapse in coverage. While defendants argue relation back was necessary here to avoid the lapse in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>licensure, there is no reason to conclude JCC\u2019s duty of good faith <em>required </em>it to absolve Facilities of its lapse in licensure, in the same way the insurer\u2019s duty of good faith required it to maintain coverage. As noted by Transamerica, the insurers accepted premium payments made after the assignment; providing coverage was simply delivering the services for which they had already accepted compensation. There is no parallel circumstance here.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Defendants once again raise <em>Trubowitch </em>and <em>McNamara </em>in this context, arguing, in effect, that even if the internal assignment was not effective at the time it was entered into, given JCC\u2019s right of consent, we should view JCC\u2019s eventual consent as retroactive because the assignment was the result of a mere corporate reorganization and, as the jury found, did not harm JCC\u2019s interests. <em>(Trubowitch, </em>supra, 30 Cal.2d at pp. 345-346.) At this point, we run into the abolished doctrine of substantial compliance. As discussed above, JCC\u2019s interest in the prospective performance of the contract was sufficient to preclude its free assignment among wholly owned subsidiaries of Jacobs. JCC had the contractual right to approve such a change, even if it was merely the result of a corporate reorganization. To find that the assignment had a retroactive effect merely because Facilities\u2019s breach of the assignment clause did not harm JCC, when the ordinary principles of law discussed above provide no grounds for finding the assignment to be effective prior to its effective date, would be to invoke a special rule excusing a section 7031 remedy because a violation of the CSLL was harmless. This is just the type of rule bending precluded by the Legislature when it abolished the substantial compliance doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Defendants also argue JCC waived its right to object to the internal assignment by dealing with Management at a time when it had knowledge of the assignment, citing <em>Trubowitch. (Trubowitch, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 342.) Assuming the applicability of the principle in this context, the record does not support a finding that the Jacobs entities informed JCC of the internal assignment prior to execution of the assignment. The initial notification, in April 2008, merely informed JCC that Jacobs intended to execute a novation transferring the contract from Facilities to another subsidiary at some point in the future. Thereafter, Jacobs sent proposals to JCC seeking its consent to a novation, and it continued to send invoices and execute contractual documents in the name of Facilities. There is no evidence Jacobs informed JCC it had unilaterally assigned the contract to Management, and Jacobs\u2019s continued attempts to negotiate a formal assignment of the contract suggested otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Defendants additionally contend the internal assignment was not void but voidable, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Klopstock </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 897 [151 P.2d 641] <em>(Klopstock), </em>and argue JCC effectively affirmed the internal assignment when it entered into the assignment. In <em>Klopstock, </em>a party\u2019s claim of right in property derived from the assignment of a lease, which had occurred without the consent of the lessor. After the lessor learned of the assignment, it objected but \u201cserved no notice terminating or declaring a forfeiture of the lease.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 899.) The court held that the lessor\u2019s objection to the assignment, in the absence of a formal declaration of forfeiture, was ineffective to prevent the vesting of property rights in the assignee. As the court explained, the assignments of the lease \u201cthough made without the written consent of the lessor, were merely <em>voidable, </em>not void; there was no ipso facto termination of the lease by reason of the lessee\u2019s failure to obtain the lessor\u2019s written consent to assignment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 901.) Because the lessor did not \u201ctake advantage of the exclusive remedy available to it for termination of the lease\u201d by \u201cdeclaration of a forfeiture upon proper notice,\u201d the court held, the lessor did not prevent the passing of property rights through assignment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 902, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">As the foregoing account suggests, the principle announced by <em>Klopstock </em>is unique to lease law: the unconsented assignment of a lease can be voided by the lessor\u2019s declaration of forfeiture, but it is valid unless and until such a declaration has been made. <em>(Klopstock, supra, </em>24 Cal.2d at pp. 901-902.) <em>Klopstock </em>does not purport to malee this principle applicable outside lease law, in which there are no comparable procedural requirements for the rejection of an assignment, and subsequent decisions have applied the decision solely within that framework. (E.g., <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Blair </em>(1949) 33 Cal.2d 744, 746-747 [204 P.2d 884]; <em>Weisman v. Clark </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 764, 767 [43 Cal.Rptr. 108].) With respect to an ordinary contract containing a nonassignment clause, an unconsented assignment, rather than effective until voided, is simply ineffective. Taking the present situation as an example, it is inconsistent with contract law to claim, following the internal assignment, that JCC was required to accept performance from Management unless or until it voided the contract. On the contrary, JCC had the right to insist on performance by Facilities until or unless it had consented to the assignment. To hold otherwise would, in effect, permit Jacobs to force JCC to accept the internal assignment or forfeit the contract, a choice inconsistent with JCC\u2019s contractual right to approve any assignment. Accordingly, JCC\u2019s act in entering into the assignment did not affirm the earlier internal assignment; rather, it effected an assignment as of the effective date of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">As a final matter, defendants contend that Management was entitled to recover the unpaid sums awarded by the jury even if Facilities was not, because the sums accrued at a time when Management, a licensed entity, was performing the services under the contract. We find no legal basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>claim. Management lacks standing to recover under the contract because it was not a party to the contract during the time when the unpaid bills accrued. <em>(Bleavins v. Demarest </em>(2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1542-1543 [127 Cal.Rptr.3d 580].) While defendants asserted a claim for unjust enrichment in the counterclaim, it is well established that equitable theories cannot be employed to overcome a failure of licensure. <em>(Ahdout, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th 21, 31.) Because the contracting party, Facilities, was unlicensed at the time Management performed the services, Facilities\u2019s recovery was precluded by section 7031, subdivision (a). The counterclaim improperly attempted to enlist the equitable theory of unjust enrichment to overcome Facilities\u2019s failure of licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">5. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We view the jury\u2019s verdict as an attempt to reach an equitable resolution, given the harsh consequences to defendants from the strict application of section 7031. The Jacobs entities\u2019 violation of the statute, clear as it is, appears to have resulted from the manner of execution of their corporate reorganization, rather than any attempt to evade licensure requirements. But though the jury was unwilling to give its imprimatur to the forfeiture of income, that is the remedy the Legislature has prescribed, and our task is to implement the Legislature\u2019s prescription. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">B. <em>Substantial Compliance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Defendants request that, in the event the judgment is reversed, the matter be remanded for the conduct of a substantial compliance hearing. We find such a remand appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">1. <em>Waiver of Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">As discussed above, section 7031, subdivision (e) codifies the substantial compliance defense to enforcement of the forfeiture remedy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Defendants asserted a substantial compliance defense in their answer to the complaint and requested a substantial compliance hearing when the parties appeared for trial. The court granted the request \u201cwith the understanding that the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>would take place after the case went to the jury and that the type <em>[sic] </em>would rely on trade testimony as the evidentiary hearing that\u2019s required by statute and that counsel could offer more evidence especially for that hearing if they needed or wanted to do so.\u201d Counsel clarified with the court that the hearing would occur \u201cat the conclusion of the trial,\u201d which the court confirmed. Defendants never thereafter requested a substantial compliance hearing, either at the close of evidence or after judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">JCC contends defendants forfeited such a hearing when they failed to request it after submission of the case to the jury and before the jury returned with its verdict. We do not understand the trial court\u2019s ruling to have anticipated that the hearing would occur immediately after the matter was sent to the jury. On the contrary, because there would be no way of knowing how long the jury\u2019s deliberations would require, it would make no sense to hold a hearing immediately after submission. Rather, we interpret the court as deferring the substantial compliance hearing until after trial, as defendants\u2019 counsel suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Further, we find no forfeiture. Defendants timely requested a substantial compliance hearing. The trial court granted the request but deferred the hearing until after the jury rendered its verdict. Once the defense judgment was entered, a substantial compliance hearing became superfluous. Defendants should not be deprived of their right to prove compliance with section 7031, subdivision (e) merely because the trial court chose to defer the matter and they prevailed at trial. (See <em>Pacific Caisson &amp; Shoring, Inc. v. Bernards Bros. Inc., </em>supra, 198 Cal.App.4th 681, 693-696 [where court failed to address issue of substantial compliance in granting summary judgment, contractor was entitled to remand for a trial on the issue].) The sole case cited by JCC in support, <em>Maxwell v. Powers </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1596 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 62], is wholly inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">We also decline JCC\u2019s invitation to find as a matter of law that the Jacobs entities failed to comply with section 7031, subdivision (e). To demonstrate substantial compliance, a contractor must show it was licensed prior to performing, acted reasonably and in good faith to maintain its license, was unaware of any failure of licensure upon commencement of performance, and acted promptly and in good faith to reinstate its license upon learning it was invalid. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As the trial court anticipated in its ruling, this demonstration may require the presentation of evidence on matters that were not directly relevant to the issues before the jury. Defendants are entitled to a full evidentiary hearing on the issues relevant to the elements of substantial compliance under subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>2. <em>Nature of Hearing on Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In ruling that defendants have not waived their right to a substantial compliance hearing, we have assumed that section 7031, subdivision (e) requires resolution of the issue by a judge, rather than jury. That appears to have been defendants\u2019 assumption in seeking such a hearing from the trial court. Rather than rely on an unexamined assumption, however, we asked the parties for supplemental briefing regarding the nature of the hearing to be conducted on remand.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Reviewing the issue de novo <em>(Hopkins v. Kedzierski </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 736, 744 [170 Cal.Rptr.3d 551]), we conclude our assumption was correct<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On remand, the substantial compliance hearing must be conducted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Section 7031, subdivision (e) states that \u201cthe court may determine that there has been substantial compliance with licensure requirements under this section if it is shown at an evidentiary hearing . . .\u201d that the contractor satisfied the statutory requirements. Based on this language, there is little room for doubt that the Legislature intended the determination of substantial compliance to be made by a judge, rather than a jury. The language of the Legislature\u2019s instruction, that \u201cthe court\u201d make the determination after an \u201cevidentiary hearing,\u201d is ordinarily used to indicate resolution by a judge. (See <em>Mendoza v. Ruesga </em>(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 270, 285 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 610]; e.g., Evid. Code, \u00a7 402 [preliminary determinations of evidence admissibility to be made by \u201ccourt\u201d out of the presence of jury]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 116.520, 116.610 [\u201ccourt\u201d to hear matters in small claims court].) Reflecting trial courts\u2019 similar understanding of this language, the statutory substantial compliance determinations reviewed in reported appellate decisions have been made by judges, rather than juries. (E.g., <em>Oceguera v. Cohen </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 783, 788-789 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 443]; <em>Construction Financial v. Perlite Plastering Co. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 170, 174 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 574].)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>This conclusion is reinforced by the equitable nature of the substantial compliance doctrine. Equitable matters are traditionally reserved for resolution by the court. (See generally <em>Hoopes </em>v. <em>Dolan </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 146, 155-156 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 337] <em>(Hoopes).) </em> Substantial compliance, a doctrine established long before its adoption in the context of the CSLL, is considered to arise in equity. (See, e.g., <em>Hill v. Newkirk </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1059 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 859] [labeling substantial compliance an \u201cequitable doctrine[]\u201d as a defense to failure to comply with California Tort Claims Act]; <em>Knapp Development &amp; Design v. Pal-Mal Properties, Ltd. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 423, 436 [219 Cal.Rptr. 44] [referring to \u201cequitable considerations\u201d in connection with \u00a7 7031 substantial compliance]; <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Morton\u2019s Chefs Services, Inc. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 380, 387 [218 Cal.Rptr. 684] [substantial compliance is an \u201cequitable [defense]\u201d in a wrongful detainer action]; <em>Knight v. Black </em>(1912) 19 Cal.App. 518, 526 [126 P. 512] [substantial compliance, asserted to avoid forfeiture of a lease, \u201cappeals to the equity side of the court\u201d].) Given the equitable nature of the substantial compliance doctrine, it is unsurprising that the Legislature would assign its determination to the court, rather than a jury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Defendants contend that, regardless of the Legislature\u2019s intent, they have a constitutional right to the jury determination of substantial compliance. \u201c[T]he state constitutional right to a jury trial \u2018is the right as it existed at common law in 1850, when the Constitution was first adopted . . . .\u2019 [Citations.] [\u00b6] \u2018As a general proposition, \u201c[T]he jury trial is a matter of right in a civil action at law, but not in equity.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[I]f the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought \u201cdepends upon the application of equitable doctrines,\u201d the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.\u2019 [Citation.] And \u2018if a proceeding otherwise identifiable in some sense as a \u201ccivil action at law\u201d did not entail a right to jury trial under the common law of 1850, then the modern California counterpart of that proceeding will not entail a <em>constitutional </em>right to trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Franchise Tax Bd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1006, 1010 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 158, 252 P.3d 450].)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Defendants\u2019 counterclaim for payments withheld under the contract was asserted under section 7031, but it was premised on the contract. We therefore assume for purposes of argument that it was legal in nature. Although disgorgement is ordinarily viewed as an equitable remedy <em>(Cruz </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number><em>PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc. (2003) 30 </em>Cal.4th 303, 307, 317-318 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 66 P.3d 1157]), when, as here, \u201cliability is definite and damages may be calculated without an accounting, the action is legal,\u201d even though the relief is in the nature of disgorgement. <em>(American Master Lease LLC </em>v. <em>Idanta Partners, Ltd. </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1483 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 548].) JCC\u2019s cause of action is therefore likely legal, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">That is not the end of the issue. As <em>Hoopes </em>noted, \u201cComplications arise when legal and equitable issues (causes of action, requested remedies, or defenses) are asserted in a single lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Hoopes, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th at p. 156.) In that situation, \u201cThe lawsuit is rarely treated as a single unit for purposes of determining the right to a jury trial. [Citations.] In most instances, separate equitable and legal issues are \u2018kept distinct and separate,\u2019 with legal issues triable by a jury and equitable issues triable by the court.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">When equitable defenses are interposed to a legal cause of action, the \u201cproper rule\u201d is for the court to hear and dispose of the equitable defenses first, before submitting the legal claim to a jury. <em>(Swasey </em>v. <em>Adair </em>(1891) 88 Cal. 179, 180 [25 P. 1119]; see <em>Hoopes, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th at p. 157 [\u201c \u2018better practice\u2019 \u201d is for the court to decide equitable issues first]; <em>Stephen Slesinger, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walt Disney Co. </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 736, 763 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 268].) Alternatively, the court may try all issues in one proceeding, with the jury sitting in an advisory role with respect to factual issues applicable to the equitable issue. (A-C <em>Co. v. Security Pacific Nat. Bank </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 462, 473 [219 Cal.Rptr. 62]; but see <em>Swasey, </em>at p. 181 [equitable defense that could be asserted in independent suit against the plaintiff must be heard first].) In that circumstance, it remains \u201cthe duty of the trial court to make its own independent findings .... [Citation.] There is no authority for asking a jury\u2019s advice as to \u2018whether injustice can only be avoided by enforcing the promise\u2019 or, more generally, whether the equitable doctrines of promissory estoppel or unclean hands should be applied.\u201d (A-C <em>Co., </em>at p. 474.) Whichever approach is adopted, equitable issues retain their character, despite being raised in the context of a legal claim. A litigant has no constitutional right to a jury determination of an equitable issue merely because it is raised in the context of a claim at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Defendants argue the substantial compliance doctrine should be viewed as arising at law in these circumstances because the doctrine \u201cgoes to [Management\u2019s] capacity to recover under the contract.\u201d In making their argument, defendants equate \u201ccapacity to recover\u201d with \u201ccapacity to contract\u201d and argue the latter is an element of their cause of action at law for breach of contract. Contrary to defendants\u2019 premise, however, capacity to contract and capacity to recover are quite different concepts. Capacity to contract refers to a party\u2019s power to enter into a binding contract, and it ordinarily depends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>upon an individual\u2019s age and mental soundness. (Rest.2d Contracts, \u00a7 12, p. 30; Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 38, 39, 1556, 1557.) Defendants suggest no reason why a contractor lacking a license is legally unable to contract. While, as a result of Business and Professions Code section 7031, the contractor cannot use the courts to enforce payment if performance of its contract requires a license, the contract itself is not void or voidable for lack of capacity. The argument therefore provides no basis for concluding substantial compliance is a legal doctrine as asserted in Management\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Compliance with the CSLL can fairly be characterized as an element of defendants\u2019 cause of action for breach (\u00a7 7031, subd. (a)), but that alone does not make substantial compliance a legal doctrine. Rather, in that context, substantial compliance is an equitable doctrine asserted by defendants to permit recovery in spite of their inability to prove CSLL compliance, in much the same way the doctrine can be asserted to excuse a failure to comply with the Tort Claims Act. (See <em>Hill v. Newkirk, </em>supra, 26 Cal.App.4th at p. 1059.) Alternatively, as asserted by defendants in response to JCC\u2019s claim for disgorgement, substantial compliance is an equitable defense to JCC\u2019s claim. Either way, the doctrine is equitable in nature. Accordingly, defendants have no constitutional right to its determination by a jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">C. <em>Attorney Fees</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">III.

Instead, the corporation only performed additional work not included in the contract. <em>(Ibid.) </em>For that reason, JCC reasonably argues, the decision\u2019s pronouncements about the CSLL are dicta.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> If there is any doubt about the applicability of the substantial compliance doctrine in the circumstances confronting <em>Franks, </em>the answer is found in <em>Weiman v. Superior Court </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 710 [336 P.2d 489], in which the Supreme Court excused a failure of licensure essentially identical to that in <em>Franks </em>by invoking the substantial compliance doctrine. <em>(Weiman, </em>at pp. 713-714.) <em>Franks </em>does not cite or discuss either <em>Weiman </em>or an earlier case reaching a similar result, <em>Citizens State Bank </em>v. <em>Gentry </em>(1937) 20 Cal.App.2d 415 [67 P.2d 364], Both, of course, were decided prior to the Legislature\u2019s abolition of the substantial compliance doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\"> We reject JCC\u2019s argument that defendants were in any way dishonest or incompetent in carrying out the contract. There is simply no evidence in the record to support either characterization. Jacobs\u2019s failure of licensure was a result of the manner in which it carried out its corporate reorganization, which had no apparent impact on the manner in which it performed services under the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> JCC contends there is no substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of an internal assignment. Well before Jacobs claims to have undertaken the internal assignment, it informed JCC that it intended to transfer responsibility for the contracts to Management after Management obtained a license. Management thereafter acquired a license, and its employees delivered services to JCC under the contract. We assume for purposes of argument that this constitutes substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> The Supreme Court confirmed this principle in <em>Peiser </em>v. <em>Mettler </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 594 [328 P.2d 953]: \u201cIt has sometimes been said that the effect of an assignment is to make the lessee a surety for the assignee. [Citations.] This may be true in a limited sense as between the assignee and his assignor, the lessee, but as between the lessor and the lessee the latter remains a primary obligor under his express contract to pay rent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> This covenant states, Facilities \u201chereby . . . assigns and transfers the Contract to [Management]. [Management] hereby assumes the Contract from [Facilities], including all of [Facilities\u2019s] rights, . . . responsibilities, and liabilities under or flowing from the Contract as if [Management] was the original party to the Contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> In this connection, defendants cite the long-standing principle that \u201c \u2018if an agreement can be reasonably interpreted so as to avoid a forfeiture, it is the duty of the court to avoid it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Universal Sales Corp. v. Cal. etc. Mfg. Co. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 751, <em>771 </em>[128 P.2d 665].) For the reasons discussed above, we do not believe it would be reasonable to construe the assignment as ratifying the internal assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> Defendants argue JCC and Facilities \u201croutinely\u201d entered into written contracts \u201clong after they had modified their contractual relationship.\u201d While this may be true, it does not mean that the alteration itself was routinely approved. In any event, there is no evidence the \u201ccontractual relationship\u201d between JCC and Facilities was \u201cmodified\u201d by the substitution of Management prior to execution of the assignment. Any earlier substitution was a unilateral action by the Jacobs entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\"> Defendants also argue JCC \u201cled Jacobs to believe it would not object to [Management\u2019s] assumption\u201d of the contract when a novation was first proposed in 2008. While that may be true, JCC never suggested to the Jacobs entities that the approval, when it occurred, would be deemed retroactive. There is no basis for estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b651-10\"> Section 7031, subdivision (e) provides, in relevant part: \u201c[T]he court may determine that there has been substantial compliance with licensure requirements under this section if it is shown at an evidentiary hearing that the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor (1) had been duly licensed as a contractor in this state prior to the performance of the act or contract, (2) acted reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure, (3) did not know or reasonably should not have known that he or she was not duly licensed when performance of the act or contract commenced, and (4) acted promptly and in good faith to reinstate his or her license upon learning it was invalid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> In their supplemental briefings, the parties expressed concern that this issue is being raised for the first time on appeal. As suggested, the issue is potentially pertinent to JCC\u2019s claim of waiver; if defendants had a right to jury trial on the issue of substantial compliance but failed to submit the issue to the jury, it was arguably waived. In any event, the issue is one of law and has been fully briefed by the parties. In aid of the trial court on remand, appellate courts may address legal issues that necessarily will arise later in the proceeding. (E.g., <em>Kurtin </em>v. <em>Elieff </em>(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 455, 482 [155 Cal.Rptr.3d 573]; <em>In re Marriage of Iverson </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1502 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 70], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Freeman </em>(2010) 47 Cal.4th 993, 1006, fn. 4 [103 Cal.Rptr.3d 723, 222 P.3d 177]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 43.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b653-7\"> In its supplemental letter brief, ICC asks us to also address whether (1) the issue of substantial compliance is subject to summary adjudication and (2) a trial court may decline to exercise its discretion to find substantial compliance, despite finding the statutory elements to be satisfied. We decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\"> Defendants contend that when interpreted to require court determination, section 7031 conflicts with Code of Civil Procedure section 592, which states that issues of fact arising in the context of breach of contract actions are to be tried by a jury. Section 592 has generally been interpreted as codifying the common law distinction between law and equity and \u201cdoes not expand the jury trial right beyond its common law scope.\u201d <em>(Crouchman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1167, 1174 [248 Cal.Rptr. 626, 755 P.2d 1075].) For that reason, we do not view the issue of the availability of a jury under Code of Civil Procedure section 592 as different from the issue of its availability under the state Constitution, discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\"> As defendants note, it has been held that courts have the discretion to submit an equitable defense to the jury when the defense \u201c \u2018is so intertwined with legal claims that it cannot be separately tried to the judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Unilogic, Inc. v. Burroughs Corp. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 612, 623 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].) There is reason to doubt whether that discretion allows the submission of the issue of substantial compliance to a jury, since the Legislature has expressly instructed otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 882.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, First Appellate District, Division Five, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
