In an effort to thwart her efforts, defendant requested a court hearing to set aside the wage assignment. At the hearing, he denied he was behind on his child support payments, and held up a sheaf of fraudulent papers that he described to the court as cancelled checks and other documents that proved he owed no money. He handed the documents to his disbelieving ex-wife and the San Mateo County Department of Child Support Services attorney at the hearing, who both expressed suspicion about the legitimacy of the documents. The family court denied defendant\u2019s request without prejudice, finding \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to set aside the wage assignment. A few weeks later, defendant pressed his claim at the department of child support services office, once again providing it with fraudulent documents to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of offering forged and fraudulent documents into evidence in violation of Penal Code section 132,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of forgery under section 470, subdivision (b). He does not challenge the forgery conviction. He appeals his convictions under section 132 on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law because he did not offer the forged checks \u201cin evidence\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and the jury instruction on section 132 was erroneous. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant\u2019s convictions under section 132. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">The facts in this case are essentially undisputed. Defendant and Jane Parrish were divorced in 2001, and defendant was ordered to pay Parrish monthly child support for their two children. In November 2010, defendant stopped making the payments, and would not respond to Parrish\u2019s inquiries about the missing payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">Parrish went to the San Mateo County Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) in September 2011 for help. After Parrish submitted proof that defendant had not paid child support since November 2010, DCSS took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>steps to have an order sent to defendant\u2019s employer to withhold his wages and assign them to pay child support. Defendant responded by filing a request for a hearing in superior court to set aside the wage assignment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">A hearing on defendant\u2019s request was held in San Mateo County Superior Court on January 12, 2012. Defendant, Parrish, and Eric Tannenwald, a DCSS attorney, were present. Parrish told the commissioner that she had not been paid child support since October 2010, and Tannenwald supported her contention. The commissioner asked defendant, \u201cAnything you want to say ... in addition to what Miss Parrish or Mr. Tannenwald has indicated to the court?\u201d Defendant responded by holding up some documents and stating: \u201cYes, Your Honor. I have copies of the cancelled checks, and I apologize, in going through this I realized that I am missing a month, but basically from the November 2010 to November 2011, and I have been faithfully paying my child support ever since the initial order was sought by Miss Parrish. And again, I see no reason for the state and the county to waste their resources on this when in fact it is being paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">Defendant handed the documents to Tannenwald. They included purported copies of the cancelled checks that defendant had referenced, and statements from defendant\u2019s credit union purporting to show the checks had been cashed. Tannenwald told the commissioner: \u201cYour Honor, he provided copies of the front of the check, looks like a back of a check with the same signature, but what I would typically see in reviewing these, in the courts of my practice, are some notations from the bank, specifically clearing numbers and things like that, the posting banks.\u201d Parrish also reviewed the checks provided by defendant. She told the commissioner: \u201cI have never received these checks, I did not sign them, and suspiciously it is the exact same signature printout, exact same thing. Looks like he photoshopped it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">The commissioner denied defendant\u2019s request to set aside the wage assignment without prejudice, finding there was \u201cinsufficient evidence today to go forward with [the request].\u201d The commissioner told defendant that \u201cif \u2022 you want to go to DCSS and show them documentation that you have been making timely payments, you can re-file, and I will take it up again then.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">A few weeks after the January 12 hearing, Tannenwald wrote to defendant asking if he wanted an administrative review to contest the arrears. DCSS was authorized to conduct such an administrative review by Family Code section 17526, subdivision (a). As part of its review, DCSS was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>\u201cconsider all evidence and defenses submitted by either parent on the issues of the amount of support paid or owed.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 17526, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">On February 29, 2012, defendant went to DCSS\u2019s office and met with Blanca Velasquez, a DCSS caseworker. Defendant gave her copies of the same cancelled checks that he had provided Tannenwald during the January 12 hearing, plus copies of what were supposedly three more cancelled checks from December 2011, January 2012, and February 2012, and about a year\u2019s worth of statements from defendant\u2019s credit union. According to Velasquez, defendant \u201crequested an administrative review\u201d of the child support issue by DCSS as soon as possible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">Tannenwald wrote a letter to defendant the next day confirming that DCSS received the documents defendant provided and would \u201cbegin an administrative review and provide copies to Ms. Parrish for verification.\u201d Tannenwald forwarded copies of the documents to Parrish. Parrish told Tannenwald that she believed the documents were fraudulent and that she had still not received child support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">Tannenwald, on behalf of DCSS, filed an order to show cause in the superior court seeking a judicial determination of child support arrears owed by defendant. A hearing was noticed for May 31, 2012. Tannenwald also took steps to have a subpoena issued to defendant\u2019s credit union for copies of the checks and bank statements that defendant said proved he had paid child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Defendant moved to quash the subpoena. A hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to quash was held on May 15, 2012. Defendant argued that disclosure of his financial information would violate his privacy rights. He also told the court: \u201cI have provided copies of the cancelled checks as they\u2019ve requested. I\u2019ve provided copies of the clearance numbers. I\u2019ve provided copies of bank statements showing the pertinent information. . . . [\u00b6] And Ms. Parrish has not provided anything, any legal basis or expert testimony to say that what I have provided is not correct. She has not provided any bank statements of her own to refute that, that she has been paid.\u201d The court denied defendant\u2019s motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>Later that same day, defendant used a credit card to pay the full amount of child support he owed Parrish. Defendant informed Tannenwald the next day that he paid the missing child support, and requested that DCSS withdraw the subpoena and take the upcoming May 31 hearing off calendar. Tannenwald conveyed defendant\u2019s request to Parrish, but she refused to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Prior to the May 31 hearing, defendant\u2019s credit union responded to the DCSS subpoena with a declaration stating that the checks had never been presented and never cleared defendant\u2019s account. Defendant failed to appear at the May 31 hearing. The court found that defendant had not paid child support from November 2010 until May 2012, as reflected in the DCSS audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Defendant was charged with two counts of offering forged or fraudulent documents into evidence in violation of section 132. Count 1 was based on the documents defendant brought to the January 12 hearing. Count 2 was based on the documents defendant provided to DCSS on February 29. Defendant was also charged with forgery (\u00a7 470, subd. (b); count 3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Defendant testified at the jury trial in this matter and admitted that he did not pay child support to Parrish during the contested period. He admitted he falsified the checks and bank statements that he brought to the January 12, 2012, hearing and provided to DCSS on February 29, 2012. Defendant denied that he was trying to defraud Parrish out of child support payments. He testified that \u201c[i]t was only my intent to stall DCSS from, you know, putting liens on my bank account or taking away my licenses. ... [\u00b6] ... I just merely wanted to buy some time and have them asking questions rather than liening <em>[sic\\ </em>my bank account or anything like that.\u201d As to why he did not use his credit card to pay child support prior to May 15, 2012, defendant testified that May 15 was when he first learned he could use a credit card to pay child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Defendant was convicted on all three counts and placed on three years\u2019 supervised probation with terms and conditions that included, as to count 3, that he serve one year in the county jail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Defendant timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">A. <em>The Evidence Was Sufficient to Convict Defendant of Violating Section 132.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">Section 132 was enacted in 1872 and has never been amended. It provides: \u201cEvery person who upon any trial, proceeding, inquiry, or investigation whatever, authorized or permitted by law, offers in evidence, as genuine or true, any book, paper, document, record, or other instrument in writing, knowing the same to have been forged or fraudulently altered or ante-dated, is guilty of a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">Defendant contends that due process requires reversal on counts 1 and 2 because the prosecution\u2019s evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove his guilt. Defendant argues that \u201c[a] violation of section 132 occurs when a defendant \u2018offers into evidence,\u2019 false evidence,\u201d and that, as to count 1, he never actually offered the fraudulent checks and bank statements into evidence during the January 12 hearing. As to count 2, he contends that his \u201cmere delivery of the false documents to DCSS also did not constitute \u2018 \u201coffering] into evidence\u201d \u2019 those documents within the meaning of section 132.\u201d Separately, he argues that there was \u201cno evidence [he] knew that any such proceeding was taking place,\u201d referring to the administrative proceeding regarding his delinquent child support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">The Attorney General argues that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant on count 1 because, even though defendant did not formally move documents into evidence during the January 12 hearing, he used them in an attempt to persuade the court that he had paid the missing child support payments. As to count 2, the Attorney General argues that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant offered the fraudulent documents in evidence on February 29 by providing them to DCSS because his production was in connection with an administrative review of the missing child support payments. The Attorney General also argues that there was substantial evidence that defendant knew DCSS would be conducting an administrative review and that, in any event, defendant\u2019s knowledge of an administrative review is not an element of section 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">A state court conviction violates due process if it is not supported by sufficient evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rowland </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 238, 269 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 841 P.2d 897].) \u201cWhen considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>contains substantial evidence \u2014 that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value \u2014 -from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People v. Lindberg </em>(2008) 45 Cal.4th 1, 27 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 323, 190 P.3d 664].) \u201cWe presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier of fact reasonably could infer from the evidence. [Citation.] If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. [Citation.] A reviewing court neither reweighs evidence nor reevaluates a witness\u2019s credibility. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>To the extent a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is based on the interpretation of a statute, our interpretation of the statute is de novo. <em>(People v. Hassan </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1313 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 314].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">2. <em>Construction of the Phrase \u201cOffers in Evidence\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The phrase \u201coffers in evidence\u201d in section 132 has been construed by courts only sporadically. One of the earliest cases was <em>People v. Wignall </em>(1932) 125 Cal.App. 465 [13 P.2d 995], where the defendant was convicted of violating section 132 after he filed a false will in a probate proceeding. The appellate court reversed the conviction, holding the evidence was insufficient to show he offered the will in evidence during the probate proceeding, although the court did not discuss the phrase \u201coffers in evidence\u201d in much detail. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 475.) The court simply stated that the false will \u201cis not mentioned in the testimony of any witness and is not covered by any admission or stipulation of counsel. ... It contains no [endorsement which would even tend to indicate that it had ever been introduced in evidence in any probate proceeding.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Although the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of offering the false will in evidence, the court held it \u2022was sufficient to convict the defendant under a different statute for filing the false will with the clerk\u2019s office. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">In <em>People v. Hooper </em>(1935) 10 Cal.App.2d 332 [51 P.2d 1131], the defendant was convicted of violating section 132 based on his use of a falsified check in a civil trial to show that he did not owe rent. (10 Cal.App.2d at pp. 333-334.) The defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to show that he offered the falsified check in evidence during the civil trial because it was never formally introduced into evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 334.) The court disagreed, stating: \u201cIt is true that the record does not disclose that the check was ever marked as an exhibit in the civil case, and the court reporter at that trial could not discover from his notes that it was ever formally introduced in evidence. But the check was produced in the municipal court by appellant\u2019s attorney, appellant there testified as to the check and the disputed endorsement, it was marked for identification, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>examined by the court and was the subject of expert testimony and legal argument. We are of the opinion that such use of the document constitutes an offering in evidence within the meaning of the section.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 334-335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Horowitz </em>(1945) 70 Cal.App.2d 675 [161 P.2d 833], the defendant was convicted of forgery of a will (\u00a7 470), causing a forged will to be filed (\u00a7 115), preparing a false and antedated will (\u00a7 134), and offering in evidence a forged will (\u00a7 132). (70 Cal.App.2d at p. 684.) The charges were based on the defendant\u2019s actions in connection with the purported will of his late mother. <em>(Ibid.) </em>He argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the brief discussion pertaining to section 132, the court concluded the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant because \u201c[h]e offered [the will] for probate. He defended a contest filed by [the decedent\u2019s husband]. He knowingly offered the forged instrument in evidence, the crime denounced by section 132.\u201d (70 Cal.App.2d at p. 688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Geibel </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 147 [208 P.2d 743], the defendant, an attorney, was charged with forgery of a will (\u00a7 470), causing a forged will to be filed (\u00a7 115), and offering in evidence a forged will (\u00a7 132), all relating to the will of a former client. (Geibel, at pp. 152-153.) The defendant was convicted on all three counts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 152.) He argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to show he offered a false will in evidence in violation of section 132, because he had merely offered a will for probate by presenting it at a hearing. The court disagreed, and summarized the evidence supporting the defendant\u2019s conviction: \u201c[A]t the hearing on the petition for admission to probate of the will, [the defendant] appeared not only as one of the attorneys for the petitioner, but there testified as to the execution of the will and the genuineness of the disputed signature of the testator. The document was examined by the court, and was the subject of expert testimony and legal argument.\u201d (Geibel, at pp. 169-170.) The court concluded: \u201cWe are persuaded that such use of the instrument constitutes an offering in evidence within the meaning of the code section <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hooper[, supra,] </em>10 Cal.App.2d 332, 334), and that the evidence was, therefore, sufficient to support the verdict and judgment on [the section 132 count].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 170.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">The meaning of \u201coffers in evidence\u201d was discussed at length in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pereira </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1057 [255 Cal.Rptr. 285] <em>(Pereira), </em>where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>defendant was charged with two counts of violating section 132. One count involved the production of a fraudulently altered loan application in response to a subpoena issued by the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) in connection with its investigation of possible violations of the Political Reform Act of 1974 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 81000 et seq.). (207 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1061-1062.) The second count involved production of a different version of the same loan application in a civil proceeding to enforce a judgment. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The defendant had initially received a subpoena duces tecum in connection with the civil proceeding, but reached an agreement with the subpoenaing party to produce documents, including the loan application, voluntarily. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss both section 132 counts, reasoning that the \u201cmere producing of the documents\u201d did not amount to offering the documents into evidence. (207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1063.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The appellate court in <em>Pereira </em>reversed and held that \u201cthe scope of section 132 extends beyond those situations involving the formal introduction in evidence of documents in a court of law.\u201d <em>(Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1067.) The court construed the phrase \u201coffers in evidence\u201d in the context of the wide breadth of section 132, which, by its terms, applies to \u201c \u2018any trial, proceeding, inquiry, or investigation whatever, authorized or permitted by law.\u2019 \u201d (207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1063.) The court determined that this phrase \u201cbespeaks a broad range of formal as well as informal settings in which an \u2018[offer] in evidence\u2019 may constitute a violation of the section. Viewed in this light, the phrase \u2018[offer] in evidence\u2019 is not used in a technical sense or as a term of art.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1063-1064.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">In considering the loan application produced in response to the FPPC subpoena, the court held that \u201cthe tender of documents pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum issued by the FPPC constitutes an offer in evidence within the meaning of section 132 if made during a proceeding, inquiry or investigation authorized or permitted by law.\u201d <em>(Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1064.) \u201cThe subpoena duces tecum to defendant to produce the . . . loan application was issued in furtherance of such an investigation of \u2018possible violations\u2019 of the Political Reform Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 83115),\u201d and the purpose of the investigation was \u201cto gather evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1064 \u2014 1065.) Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201c[o]ne who in response to an FPPC subpoena knowingly submits fraudulently altered or antedated documents in such an investigation, \u2018offers in evidence\u2019 the documents so tendered within the meaning of section 132.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1065.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">The <em>Pereira </em>court reached a similar conclusion with regard to the loan application produced in the civil judgment enforcement proceeding. The court reasoned that \u201cthe use of a subpoena duces tecum to discover and inspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>relevant documents is an accepted practice\u201d in civil judgment enforcement proceedings as part of an examination of the debtor\u2019s property. <em>(Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1066.) Such an examination \u201cis similar to a trial\u201d because witnesses are required to appear and to testify, and \u201c[a]t the conclusion of the examination, the judge or referee may order the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in the property applied to satisfy the money judgment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThus, the production of documents pursuant to a subpoena duces tecum in contemplation of a debtor\u2019s examination is an \u2018[offer] in evidence\u2019 at a \u2018trial, proceeding, inquiry, or investigation . . . authorized or permitted by law ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThat the documents were ultimately produced pursuant to an agreement between counsel and not in direct response to the subpoena duces tecum is of no import. It would be illogical to hold criminal sanctions for offering false documents in evidence could be avoided simply by agreeing voluntarily to produce the evidence in consideration for the dropping of a subpoena.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\"><em>Pereira </em>was not unanimous. The dissenting opinion in <em>Pereira </em>stated that section 132 should not extend to the \u201cmere delivery of documents to a state functionary conducting a preliminary investigation and to an attorney seeking discovery to enforce a civil judgment.\u201d <em>(Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1069 (dis. opn. of Sparks, J.).) The dissent\u2019s view was that section 132 \u201ccontemplates that whatever the nature of the investigation or inquiry it be sufficiently formal to permit the introduction of evidence.\u201d (207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1075 (dis. opn. of Sparks, J.).) Accordingly, the dissent concluded that \u201coffers in evidence\u201d means to \u201csubmit a document for introduction into the official record of some formal, pending proceeding, inquiry or investigation of any kind which is authorized or permitted by law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\"><em>People v. Bhasin </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 461 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 708] involved a conviction under section 132 in connection with an earlier criminal case against the defendant for identity theft and securing a fraudulent loan. (176 Cal.App.4th at p. 466.) In the underlying case, the defendant fraudulently obtained a document from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which he then gave to his attorney to use to cross-examine a witness. <em>(Ibid.) </em>When the defendant\u2019s attorney finished his cross-examination, he gave the document to the prosecutor, who suspected that it was fraudulent. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After the prosecution investigated the document\u2019s authenticity, a mistrial was declared. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 467, fn. 3.) The defendant was charged and convicted in a later trial of violating section 132 for his use of the false DMV document. (176 Cal.App.4th at pp. 464-465.) He appealed, arguing \u201cthere was insufficient evidence presented that he \u2018offered into evidence\u2019 the [DMV document] at the underlying trial to support his conviction for violating section 132.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 468.) The defendant contended that he must have actually moved the DMV document into evidence in order to be found in violation of section 132. (176 Cal.App.4th at p. 468.) The appellate court rejected this argument. Quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>from <em>Pereira </em>at length, it stated that \u201c \u2018offerfs] in evidence\u2019 \u201d should not be used \u201c \u2018in a technical sense or as a term of art.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court reasoned that \u201c[t]he fact that defendant gave the [document] to his attorney, it was used in cross-examination [of a witness], it was read into the record, and it was marked for identification by defendant clearly was an offer of evidence within the meaning of section 132. The fact that the prosecution sought to move the [document] into evidence (without objection from defendant\u2019s counsel) was not imperative to a conviction of section 132. There simply is no requirement that a document must be moved into evidence in order to constitute a violation of section 132.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded that the evidence supported a finding that the document \u201cwas offered into evidence within the meaning of section 132.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">With these cases in mind, we turn to the evidence in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">3. <em>January 12 Hearing (Count 1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">Defendant argues that he did not offer the fraudulent checks and statements in evidence during the January 12 hearing because they were not provided to the commissioner or court clerk, and did not become part of the court record. The only case defendant relies on to support his argument is <em>People </em>v. <em>Wignall, supra, </em>125 Cal.App. 465. As we have noted, the court in <em>Wignall </em>did not discuss the phrase \u201coffers in evidence\u201d in any detail, but held that the evidence was insufficient to convict a defendant under section 132 when a false will was filed for probate but not mentioned in testimony or introduced in evidence during any proceeding. <em>Wignall </em>is distinguishable because in this matter, defendant made affirmative use of fraudulent documents during a court hearing. They were the centerpiece of his argument: he held up the documents and referred to them when arguing to the court, and he provided the documents to Parrish and Tannenwald. After listening to defendant explain the significance of the fraudulent documents, the commissioner concluded there was \u201cinsufficient evidence ... to go forward\u201d with his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">Defendant argues that <em>People </em>v. <em>Bhasin, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.4th 461 is distinguishable because in <em>Bhasin, </em>unlike here, the fraudulent document was actually marked for identification, there was questioning and sworn testimony about the document, and the contents of the document were read into the record. We do not find this argument persuasive. Section 132, by its terms, applies to \u201cany trial, proceeding, inquiry, or investigation whatever,\u201d which includes the January 12 family law hearing regarding wage garnishment \u2014 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>hearing that defendant was authorized by law to request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the formalities in the criminal trial in <em>Bhasin </em>and the January 12 family court hearing differ, defendant\u2019s use of the fraudulent documents at the January 12 hearing was similar to the defendant\u2019s conduct in <em>Bhasin. </em>In both cases, the documents were offered in support of the merits, and their substance was described on the record for the finder of fact to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Defendant argues that <em>Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d 1057 is distinguishable because the defendant there \u201caffirmatively produced the documents under compulsion of law during an inquiry or investigation,\u201d which was not the case at the January 12 family court hearing. This is a distinction without a difference. Section 132, by its terms, does not require documents to be produced under compulsion of law. Nor have courts construing section 132 read in such a requirement. The defendants in <em>People v. Bhasin, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.4th at page 466 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hooper, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.2d at page 334 voluntarily offered fraudulent documents at trial in support of their cases, and each was convicted of violating section 132. The same is true in <em>People v. Horowitz, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.2d 675 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Geibel, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 147, where the defendants filed false wills as part of a probate proceeding. Nothing indicates they did so under compulsion of law. <em>(People v. Horowitz, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.2d at p. 688 [the defendant \u201cknowingly offered the forged instrument in evidence\u201d]; <em>People v. Geibel, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.2d at p. 169 [\u201cthe will was offered for probate by [the defendant] or at his behest . . .\u201d].) It would be anomalous to conclude that the defendant in <em>Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d 1057 was liable under section 132 because he was compelled by subpoena to produce documents, but defendant here is not because he availed himself of court process and chose to use fraudulent documents to support his cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Defendant argues that \u201cother sources of law\u201d establish that the phrase \u201coffers in evidence\u201d does not extend to his conduct during the January 12 hearing. Defendant relies on section 140 of the Evidence Code, which defines \u201cevidence\u201d as \u201ctestimony, writings, material objects, or other things presented to the senses that are offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of a fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 140.) This definition says nothing about the meaning of the phrase \u201coffers in evidence.\u201d Further, the false checks and statements used in court on January 12 meet the statutory definition of \u201cevidence,\u201d because they were writings that defendant used to prove the non-existence of the allegation that he had not paid child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>Defendant also argues that the fraudulent checks and bank statements \u201cdid not contain any of the indicia of evidence as defined in CALCRIM No. 104,\u201d which defines \u201cevidence\u201d as \u201c \u2018the sworn testimony of witnesses, the exhibits admitted into evidence, and anything else [the trial judge] tell[s] you to consider as evidence.\u2019 \u201d Like section 140 of the Evidence Code, the definition in CALCRIM No. 104 says nothing about the meaning of the phrase \u201coffers in evidence.\u201d Further, the definition in CALCRIM No. 104 is of little utility in interpreting section 132 because jury instructions apply to trials, and section 132 extends to any \u201cproceeding, inquiry, or investigation whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Another \u201csource of law\u201d defendant relies on is California Rules of Court, rule 3.1306 (rule 3.1306), which governs the use of evidence at law and motion hearings. This rule states, in part, that \u201c[e]vidence received at a law and motion hearing must be by declaration or request for judicial notice without testimony or cross-examination, unless the court orders otherwise for good cause shown,\u201d and a party seeking to present oral evidence must seek written permission at least three days before the hearing. (Rule 3.1306(a); see rule 3.1306(b).) Defendant contends that this rule applied to the January 12 hearing, and because defendant did not present the documents in conformity with it, he could not have offered them in evidence within the meaning of section 132. Assuming, without deciding, that rule 3.1306 even applied to the January 12 hearing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s argument is meritless. Rule 3.1306 is not a rule of evidence or exclusion, but a rule of procedure for law and motion proceedings. A document does not lose its status as \u201cevidence\u201d because a party does not comply with the requirements of rule 3.1306. Further, a court may consider evidence that is not submitted in compliance with rule 3.1306 if no objection is made, or upon a showing of good cause. If rule 3.1306 even applied to the January 12 proceeding, we may assume the family court commissioner found good cause to consider the documents used by defendant. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>We conclude there was substantial evidence that defendant \u201coffer[ed] in evidence\u201d the fraudulent documents during the January 12 hearing. Defendant requested the court hearing to quash an income withholding order. He then affirmatively used the documents in an effort to persuade the family court - of the merits of his position. Defendant held up the checks and bank statements during the hearing as proof he had been \u201cfaithfully\u201d paying child support since November 2010. He then provided the documents to DCSS Attorney Tannenwald, who told the commissioner that the checks did not look like the kind he typically sees when looking for proof of child support payments. Defendant\u2019s former wife also examined the checks at the hearing and told the commissioner she \u201cnever received these checks\u201d and that it \u201c[l]ooks like he photoshopped\u201d her signature onto the checks. After hearing from DCSS\u2019s counsel and the parties, the commissioner made a finding that \u201c[b]ased on what I am hearing today . . . there has been no payment yet received,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthere is insufficient <em>evidence </em>today to go forward\u201d with defendant\u2019s request to set aside the wage assignment order. (Italics added.) We agree with <em>Pereira </em>that the phrase \u201c \u2018offers in evidence\u2019 \u201d is \u201cnot used in a technical sense or as a term of art.\u201d <em>(Pereira, </em>supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1064.) On this record, there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant had \u201coffer[ed] in evidence\u201d forged or fraudulent documents at the January 12 hearing within the meaning of section 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">4. <em>February 29 Delivery of Documents to DCSS (Count 2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Defendant challenges his conviction on count 2 on two grounds. First, he argues that the meaning of \u201coffers in evidence\u201d does not extend to his delivery of documents to DCSS on February 29. Second, he argues that even if it does extend to his conduct on February 29, the evidence is insufficient to convict him because there was no evidence that he \u201cknew any kind of formal investigation would occur\u201d when he delivered the documents to DCSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">As to the first argument, defendant makes many of the same arguments he raised in connection with his conviction on count 1. He argues that he did not offer in evidence the fraudulent checks on February 29 because he did not produce them under compulsion of law. As we discussed earlier, whether a defendant offers evidence voluntarily is beside the point for purposes of section 132. Defendant also relies on the same \u201cother sources of law\u201d to argue that the phrase \u201coffers in evidence\u201d does not extend to his conduct on February 29. Those authorities are equally inapposite for the same reasons we have described.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>Defendant relies on the dissenting opinion in <em>Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d 1057 to support his argument that his delivery of documents to DCSS on February 29 was not offering into evidence those documents within the meaning of section 132. This argument is unavailing. In <em>Pereira </em>a defendant produced documents in response to a subpoena in an FPPC proceeding, and produced similar documents in response to a subpoena and informal request in a civil judgment enforcement proceeding. The dissenting justice expressed the concern that \u201c[u]nder the majority\u2019s construction, any known forged document delivered to some investigating official trolling on a fishing expedition would violate the statute, even if it had no conceivable relevance to the authorized investigation.\u201d <em>(Pereira, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1076 (dis. opn. of Sparks, J.).) The circumstances in the matter before us have no connection to this concern. Defendant voluntarily delivered documents to DCSS and affirmatively used them to support his claim that he had been faithfully paying child support. To the extent the dissenting opinion in <em>Pereira </em>can be construed to mean that \u201coffers in evidence\u201d should not extend to defendant\u2019s conduct on February 29, we respectfully do not find it persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Defendant\u2019s other argument is that \u201c[t]here was no evidence [he] knew any kind of formal investigation would occur\u201d when he delivered the documents to DCSS on February 29. There was overwhelming evidence at trial to the contrary. At the conclusion of the January 12 hearing, the commissioner told defendant that \u201cif you want to go to DCSS and show them documentation that you have been making timely payments, you can re-file, and I will take it up again then.\u201d Tannenwald wrote a letter to defendant after the hearing, asking if defendant wanted DCSS to conduct an \u201cadministrative review\u201d of the missing child support payments. Defendant then voluntarily went to DCSS on February 29 and provided DCSS with copies of the fraudulent checks as proof that he was paying child support. Velasquez, the DCSS caseworker, testified that when defendant provided the fraudulent checks and bank statements on February 29, he \u201crequested an administrative review as soon as possible.\u201d She also testified that defendant demanded that DCSS \u201cunfreeze his accounts immediately so that he could make his mortgage payment the next day.\u201d The day after defendant went to DCSS, Tannenwald wrote a letter to defendant stating that DCSS received the documents and would \u201cbegin an administrative review and provide copies to Ms. Parrish for verification.\u201d Substantial evidence establishes that defendant knew DCSS would conduct an administrative review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>We thus conclude that there was sufficient evidence that defendant \u201coffer[ed] in evidence\u201d fraudulent checks and bank statements when he provided them to DCSS on February 29. Defendant hand delivered the documents to DCSS in another attempt to convince DCSS that he had been paying child support. Defendant\u2019s stated goal was to stop DCSS from garnishing his wages. It is undisputed that DCSS was authorized by Family Code section 17526 to conduct an administrative review of the missing child support payments, and that DCSS was required to \u201cconsider all evidence and defenses submitted by either parent on the issues of the amount of support paid or owed.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 17526, subd. (a).) Given these circumstances, defendant\u2019s actions on February 29 were more than just a \u201cmere delivery\u201d of documents to DCSS. He \u201coffer[ed] in evidence\u201d the documents as part of a proceeding authorized by law.
