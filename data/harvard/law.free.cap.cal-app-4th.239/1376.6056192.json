J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGH\">Defendant Daniel Fiamatai Foalima appeals from his conviction of first degree murder. He contends the trial court erred by (1) refusing to strike a possible accomplice\u2019s testimony after the accomplice testified he did not know the answer to most of the questions asked him; (2) instructing the jury on accomplice testimony; (3) admitting evidence of media coverage of the murder to impeach a witness\u2019s testimony that was recorded in an earlier trial but admitted here; (4) ordering direct victim restitution allegedly for a crime of which defendant was acquitted and that was not the proximate cause of the victim\u2019s damage; (5) imposing jail booking and classification fines without determining defendant\u2019s ability to pay; and (6) imposing restitution fines without determining defendant\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The prosecution charged defendant with murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> second degree robbery (\u00a7 211), and arson (\u00a7 451, subd. (b)). The information alleged defendant used a dangerous weapon (a knife) to commit the murder and the robbery (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)), and he committed the murder while committing the robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">The parties presented the following evidence at trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">\n<em>People\u2019s case-in-chief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">\n<em>The events of August 6 to 7, 2010</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">Shalini Singh, the victim\u2019s daughter, lived at the North Avenue Apartments in Sacramento with her daughter, a roommate, and the roommate\u2019s children. The victim, Arun Singh (Singh), was 50 years old. He often visited Shalini and frequently stayed the night at her apartment. Singh had been involved with drugs for the last 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">At approximately 10:00 p.m. on Friday, August 6, 2010, Shalini was in the apartment complex\u2019s hot tub with friends. While Shalini and her friends were in the hot tub, defendant walked into the pool area and asked for a cigarette. Shalini and defendant conversed, and she pointed out the location of her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-11\">Singh came to the pool area, and Shalini and he returned to her apartment. Singh asked if he could stay the night. Shalini said yes, but she and her roommate would be gone for the night. Singh left between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. to get some food. Shalini would not see him again alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">Meanwhile, at approximately 10:15 p.m. on August 6, 2010, after he had spoken with Shalini, defendant met Cindy Pau at the North Avenue Apartments. Pau had earlier contacted defendant to buy Ecstasy pills, and they negotiated the sale in her car at the apartment complex. Defendant told Pau he would return with the drugs. Pau waited and sent at least one text message to defendant. At 10:26 p.m., defendant sent a text message to her saying he could not get the drugs. The apartment complex\u2019s surveillance video filmed Pau leaving the complex at approximately 10:28 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>The surveillance video filmed defendant and two others leaving the complex on foot at 11:01 p.m. August 6, 2010, and returning at about 11:52 p.m. Defendant was wearing a long white T-shirt. The video also filmed defendant and two others from 1:23 a.m. until 1:25 a.m. hanging out in the complex\u2019s parking lot. In this later segment, defendant was wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and white tennis shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Sometime after 2:00 a.m. on August 7, 2010, Shalini received a telephone call from her upstairs neighbor. She learned her apartment was on fire and her father was dead. Her father\u2019s wallet and car keys were never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Shalini\u2019s upstairs neighbor, Dion Brent, testified the complex\u2019s fire alarm sounded sometime after 2:00 a.m. Brent and his son entered Shalini\u2019s apartment and saw a fire in the living room. They attempted to put it out with a fire extinguisher. Others arrived and doused the fire with a water hose. Brent saw a body in the apartment\u2019s living room. To him, the body appeared not to have legs or arms. The fire department arrived at 2:50 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Quentin Watts and Lazarus Bolton shared an apartment at the North Avenue Apartments. In the early morning hours of August 7, 2010, Watts returned home with his friend Leonard Gray and some female friends. He noticed emergency vehicles in the area. After he and his group went inside his apartment, a few others came in. In a later interview with police, Watts told the detective one of the persons who had come in had something on his hands that Watts believed was blood, and he did not want that person reaching into the chips. In the same interview, Watts viewed a photo lineup and identified defendant as the person who had blood on him. He also identified Laki Lee Lopa and Fine Tupuo as two others that were with defendant. At trial, Watts could not remember making these identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">Bolton, in a later interview with detectives, also identified defendant, Lopa, and Tupuo as people who were inside his apartment or right outside his door the night of the murder. Police investigators later determined defendant, Tupuo, and Lopa knew each other. Tupuo lived at the North Avenue Apartments, and Lopa lived one block away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Watts left his apartment about 45 minutes after he had arrived. As he left, he saw a fire on a stairwell or landing area near his apartment that was smoldering. He walked past the fire and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">\n<em>Investigations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-11\">Fire investigators viewed the apartment. The apartment\u2019s front door had no obvious signs of damage. The victim\u2019s body was discovered in the living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>room. Investigators observed water from the overhead sprinkler system on the floor, the victim, and the furniture. They saw charring on the carpet, the victim, and some cushions. The apartment appeared ransacked. Fires had also been started in two bedrooms. Two smoke detectors were missing. The investigator determined the fires were deliberately set with an open flame device and were incendiary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">Investigators also determined another fire had been deliberately set with an open flame device on the landing of an exterior stairwell of another apartment building at the North Avenue Apartments during the early morning hours of August 7, 2010. Investigators collected charred, fabric remains of what appeared to have been a black jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">Investigators found a broken knife blade underneath the victim\u2019s body. The knife contained the victim\u2019s DNA, but no unknown profiles were found in the recovered DNA. Fingerprints found in the apartment belonged to the victim or the apartment\u2019s residents. Heat, smoke, and fire can affect the recovery of fingerprints and DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">On August 9, 2010, fire investigators found two smoke detectors in a field adjacent to the apartment complex. The victim\u2019s DNA was recovered from one of the smoke detectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">The forensic pathologist determined the victim died from blunt force head injuries, multiple stab wounds, and asphyxia by neck compression. The victim\u2019s upper teeth, nose, face bones, skull and larynx were fractured. His face \u201cwas basically caved in.\u201d He had numerous bruises and lacerations on his face, head, and neck. Some of the bruises were \u201cpattern\u201d bruises, or a bruise caused by an object\u2019s impact, with the object\u2019s impression marking the skin. There were three distinctive patterns on the victim\u2019s head. Some marks looked like the tread of a shoe. Elongated parallel marks went across the right eyebrow. A patterned mark consisting of \u201cconcentricular\u201d marks like a target in three pairs existed on the scalp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">The victim was stabbed approximately 20 times in the back, neck, head, shoulder, arm, jaw, and torso. Blunt force injuries and the stab wounds were inflicted contemporaneously. The victim\u2019s left hand had been cut off after he had died. His right hand had cuts and hacks in what looked like an attempt to cut it off after he had died. The fingernails were clipped short and did not extend to the fingertips. The victim\u2019s body had also been set on fire after he had died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>\n<em>Natalie Jackson\u2019s tip</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">In August of 2010, defendant and Natalie Jackson were \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d and had contact with each other once a week.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the morning of August 16, 2010, Jackson e-mailed law enforcement about the North Avenue Apartments murder. In her e-mail, Jackson stated she had overheard \u201ca guy that I know very well\u201d talking about the murder. She said there should be a bag with a hand and a knife in it by the freeway and the apartment complex\u2019s surrounding area, and she asked the police to search for it. She also asked the police to check the victim\u2019s fingernails for DNA, because he had scratched the suspect a few times. She wanted the police to find this evidence before she gave them the suspect\u2019s name. If they took him in for questioning before then, he would know she had something to do with it and her life would be in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">The police asked Jackson for more details. She wrote that she knew there was a hand and a knife in a bag \u201cnear the [I]-80 freeway behind the apartments some where around the field.\u201d <em>(Sic.) </em>She also stated she believed the victim still had a hand attached to him, and asked police to check his fingernails for DNA from the suspect. She again would not release the suspect\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Later that day, a detective spoke with Jackson by phone. Jackson repeated the information she had given the police earlier. She also informed the detective that defendant was the perpetrator. She had been at a party and overheard defendant and others talking about the crime. She stated the victim had a history of selling drugs, and defendant intended to rob him for Ecstasy pills and maybe some marijuana. Jackson spoke about the fire in the stairwell landing, and said defendant had taken off what he was wearing and had burned it. She also said defendant had cut off the victim\u2019s hand because there had been an altercation and the victim had scratched him. Defendant had not been sure which hand the victim used to scratch him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">On August 22, 2010, police found a human left hand in some bushes on the south side of Interstate 80 and just northeast of the North Avenue Apartments. The parties stipulated the hand belonged to the victim. Police also found two knives and a pair of rolled-up gloves in the same vicinity. The victim\u2019s DNA was recovered from both knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">Defendant was arrested on August 25, 2010, for violating parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>On August 30, 2010, Jackson attempted to recant her earlier information. She e-mailed the police stating she had given them wrong information on the suspect: \u201cI thought I had the person but really [it] was all rumors and I just over heard it. I hope I don\u2019t get in trouble for this, I was only trying to do the right thing and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">At trial, Jackson testified she originally e-mailed police because she wanted a reward. She did not know at the time if there was a reward and did not ask for one in the e-mails. She stated she had lied in her earlier e-mails. She had not overheard anything and had knowingly falsely accused defendant. She also was not afraid of defendant. She nonetheless expected to get a reward if the police found the perpetrator. She claimed she had called about a reward, but she did not remember with whom she spoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Jackson claimed the information she received about the murder came from rumors. She said rumors about the murder were \u201ceverywhere\u201d on MySpace, the news, and the Internet. She could not name any person from whom she heard the rumors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Jackson also testified she sent the e-mails to police because she did not like defendant at the time. She was upset that he had \u201ccheated\u201d on her and impregnated a woman named Laura Tautala. Defendant had also impregnated Jackson during the summer of 2010 and had urged her to abort the baby, but did not make the same request of Tautala. That upset Jackson. She accused defendant of committing the murder so she could \u201cget him back\u201d from Tautala. She also believed defendant would think it funny she had named him as a suspect in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Jackson denied she and defendant had a romance after he was placed in custody. She thought they had talked between five and 10 times from August through September 2010. In fact, defendant called her 71 times from August 28 through September 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">\n<em>Additional investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">After defendant\u2019s arrest, law enforcement officers located a pair of shoes in the trunk of a car belonging to defendant\u2019s girlfriend Laura Tautala. The shoes were the white and blue shoes defendant wore the night of the murder. One shoe tested positive for blood on the side of its sole. Tiny bloodstains were in the crevices of the left shoe\u2019s sole, which matched defendant\u2019s DNA. Other stains on the shoe tested negative for blood, but the results could have been affected if defendant washed the shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">A criminalist testified the pattern on the soles of the shoes defendant wore the night of the murder was similar to a patterned bruise on the victim\u2019s head. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>He concluded the shoes could have made the pattern bruise and could not be eliminated as the bruise\u2019s source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Defendant\u2019s cell phone records placed him at the North Avenue Apartments on the night of August 6, 2010, and the early morning of August 7, 2010. The records also placed him at his parent\u2019s house on the afternoon of August 8, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">An analysis of a laptop computer taken from defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 house revealed that during the afternoon of August 8, 2010, someone used the laptop to search the Internet for \u201chomicide on North Avenue, Del Paso Heights,\u201d and \u201chomicide on North Avenue Apartments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">\n<em>Interviews with defendant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\"><em>A </em>detective interviewed defendant after he was arrested on August 25, 2010, for a parole violation to ask him questions about the murder. The detective observed defendant had scratches on his upper torso near his left shoulder and on his stomach. The scratches were healing and did not appear to be fresh. Defendant initially claimed the scratches were from riding a scooter, but he later said he did not know how he got them. Defendant also mentioned he had been in a fistfight within the last month. Defendant said he was alone in his apartment at the time of the murder and was asleep from 11:00 p.m., August 6, 2010, until about 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. the next morning. He had lost his cell phone and could not account for the phone calls and text messages on his phone the night of August 6, 2010. Defendant said he did not know where the North Avenue Apartments were and had never been there. He said he did not learn anything about the murder from the news and did not know anything specific about it. He also denied ever researching the murder on a computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">The same detective interviewed defendant again on October 29, 2010. The detective informed defendant he had additional evidence that defendant had been at the North Avenue Apartments the night of the murder and that he regularly visited the complex. Defendant said he did not know anything, had nothing to say or explain, and had nothing to do with the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">\n<em>Media coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">Prior to the second trial in 2012, an analyst from the district attorney\u2019s office researched what information was publically available on the Internet between August 7, 2010, and August 16, 2010, that discussed the murder. He viewed Web sites such as MySpace, Facebook, the Sacramento Bee, YouTube, and Google. The media coverage reported the victim had been mutilated, dismembered, had his legs and arms cut off, or had his hands and feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>cut off. Police later reported the dismemberment had not been as extensive as witnesses had reported, but they did not say what dismemberment had occurred. The analyst found no public \u201cpersonal chatter\u201d about the murder between individuals on social media sites. He could not search private conversations or posts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Defendant testified at trial. He had served a prison term for shooting into an inhabited dwelling. He was released on parole on July 6, 2010, 31 days prior to Singh\u2019s murder. He started selling drugs within a couple of days after his release. He also drank alcohol often and openly in violation of his parole conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">Defendant was friends with Laki Lee Lopa and Fine Tupuo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tupuo lived at the North Avenue Apartments. On the evening of August 6, 2010, defendant was hanging out and drinking malt liquor at the North Avenue Apartments with Tupuo and others. He spoke with Shalini Singh at the hot tub and asked her for a cigarette. She gave him one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-7\">That same night, he agreed to sell Cindy Pau some Ecstasy. She met him at the apartment complex, and they negotiated the drug sale in her car. After he got out of Pau\u2019s car, he met with \u201cAB\u201d and another person about a block away from the apartments to purchase the drugs. He got into a \u201cscuffle\u201d with AB\u2019s companion, and ended up with a bloody nose. He cleaned himself back at Tupuo\u2019s apartment, including his shoes, which had blood on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-8\">He then ran into Quentin Watts and \u201csome girls.\u201d He and Tupuo went to Watts\u2019s apartment and hung out with the girls. He did not have blood on his hands while he was there. When he left the apartment, he saw a fire on a landing and walked around it. He also saw police officers and firemen at the other side of the complex. He went to Lopa\u2019s house and spent the night there by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-9\">Defendant denied killing or injuring the victim. He denied saying there were knives and a hand in the field. He denied telling Jackson he took part in a murder. He admitted looking on the Internet for information about the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-10\">Defendant admitted lying to law enforcement about never having been to the North Avenue Apartments, his whereabouts on the night of the murder, his residence, whether he researched the murder, and where his cell phone was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>He agreed he and Jackson were \u201cfriends with benefits.\u201d While he was in custody in and around 2009 and 2010, they corresponded and she put money in his prison account. After he was released from custody in 2010, he impregnated Tautala and Jackson. He encouraged Jackson to get an abortion, but she did not take that well. After returning to custody in August 2010, he contacted Jackson more than 70 times through September. He wanted her to \u201cbe there\u201d while he was incarcerated, and he wanted her to believe they had a future together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">\n<em>Rebuttal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">The prosecution called Fine Tupuo as a witness on rebuttal and granted him use immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tupuo said he did not know the answers to many of the questions asked him. He did state he did not know defendant and had never met him. Tupuo had lived at the North Avenue Apartments in August 2010. He did not know that while he lived at the North Avenue Apartments, a person had been murdered there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">\n<em>Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">The jury convicted defendant of first degree murder, but acquitted him of second degree robbery and arson. The jury also found not true the enhancement allegations alleged against the murder count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">The trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 25 years to life. It imposed direct victim restitution in the amount of $13,700, which included $4,500 for Shalini\u2019s damaged clothing and household goods. The court also imposed a $10,000 restitution fine under section 1202.4, subdivision (b), and stayed a parole revocation restitution fine of $10,000 under section 1202.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">\n<em>Fine Tupuo\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">Defendant contends the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when it refused to strike Fine Tupuo\u2019s testimony and permitted the prosecution to make inferences from the testimony during closing argument. We disagree, as defendant was given an opportunity to cross-examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>Tupuo, which is what the Constitution requires when a witness asserts a loss of memory. That counsel chose not to take advantage of the opportunity is not court error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">A. <em>Background information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">Witnesses, including defendant, testified Tupuo was with defendant during the night of the murder. The prosecution called Tupuo to testify in rebuttal. The prosecution gave him use immunity for his testimony. On direct examination, Tupuo answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d to most of the prosecutor\u2019s questions. For example, when asked if he was currently serving prison time for a first degree burglary conviction, Tupuo said he did not know about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Tupuo stated he did not know if he knew defendant and did not know him by his name. He had never met defendant. He acknowledged he had lived in the North Avenue Apartments in August 2010, but when asked if defendant had ever visited him there, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The prosecutor informed Tupuo that defendant had said he visited him at least twice a week, and he asked Tupuo if that refreshed his recollection of whether defendant had visited him. Tupuo said, \u201cProbably did. Probably not. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Tupuo said he did not know if there had been a fire in one of the apartments or if someone had been murdered there. When asked if he recalled fire engines coming to the apartment complex on Saturday, August 7, 2010, he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">When asked if the prosecutor\u2019s investigator and defendant\u2019s investigator had interviewed him within the last week or so, Tupuo said, \u201cProbably.\u201d However, he did not remember telling the investigators he had been at Lopa\u2019s house, heard the sirens, or saw the fire engines go by on the way to the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\">When asked if defendant obtained a dark sweater or jacket with a hood from Tupuo\u2019s apartment, Tupuo answered, \u201cProbably did. Probably. No, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He did not remember owning a dark sweat jacket with a hood. He did not know if he walked with defendant to the ampm to buy more beer. He did not want his statement to the defense investigator read back to him to refresh his memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">Tupuo did not remember telling the defense investigator he was not with defendant the night of August 6 and morning of August 7, 2010. He did not remember telling the defense investigator that he was at Lopa\u2019s place sleeping by himself through the early morning hours of August 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>Tupuo could not remember telling the prosecution\u2019s investigator that he left the North Avenue Apartments in the early morning hours of August 7 and left defendant behind. He also could not remember telling the defense investigator that he was at the hot tub area drinking beers earlier on the evening of August 6, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Tupuo could not remember moving out of the North Avenue Apartments, but he said he moved into a \u201chouse with . . . wood\u201d on a street named Ethan by the Arden area. Asked if he was with defendant the night of the murder, Tupuo said he did not remember. He also did not know if defendant had been in his apartment the night of August 6 at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s entire cross-examination of Tupuo went as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">\u201cQ[:] If I ask you any questions are you going to know anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">\u201cA[:] No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: No further questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">Defendant moved to strike Tupuo\u2019s testimony. He claimed he was denied his right to cross-examine Tupuo because Tupuo said he would not know anything if he was asked a question and was therefore unavailable to be cross-examined. Defendant asked the court to admonish the jury not to consider Tupuo\u2019s testimony. He also asked the court to prohibit the prosecutor from arguing any inferences from Tupuo\u2019s testimony in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">The trial court denied the motion. The court acknowledged Tupuo was not a cooperative witness. However, Tupuo answered some of the questions put to him. Moreover, defense counsel did not \u201cactually make any attempt\u201d to ask Tupuo questions. The court could not find Tupuo would have refused to answer any of defense counsel\u2019s questions because counsel did not in fact ask him any other than the one question which all but required a simple, predictable answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">The trial court also refused to prohibit the prosecution from arguing inferences from Tupuo\u2019s testimony. Based on the evidence that defendant and Tupuo were together the night of the murder at the apartment complex, the prosecution could infer Tupuo was an accomplice and that he refused to give helpful answers in order to protect his friend or not to incriminate himself, even though he had immunity. Those were reasonable arguments the prosecution could make to the jury regarding Tupuo\u2019s motivation for testifying as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>During closing argument, the prosecutor asserted defendant believed he was \u201cuntouchable,\u201d in part because residents of the apartment complex, including Tupuo, would not testify against him. Even when given immunity, Tupuo would not confirm defendant\u2019s story that the two of them were together the night of the murder drinking beer, and that defendant had a fight and cleaned himself up at Tupuo\u2019s apartment. Instead, Tupuo denied even knowing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The prosecutor continued; \u201c[Y]ou might think well, that was kind of worthless. I didn\u2019t get much out of him. [\u00b6] But actually, you got a lot out of Mr. Tupuo because it makes you think what\u2019s going on? Because Mr. Tupuo, what\u2019s up with a guy that is given a free pass, immunity, and asked questions about that night that says he can\u2019t remember anything and won\u2019t even acknowledge that [defendant], who visits him twice a week and was staying at his place, is his friend? [\u00b6] Because he doesn\u2019t want to be a snitch. Doesn\u2019t want to be involved. The three of them are together all night. We\u2019ve got one of \u2019em right here. [\u00b6] We\u2019ve brought the other one in front of you. He doesn\u2019t even want to be with him. That should let you know everything you need to know about [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erred by refusing to strike Tupuo\u2019s testimony and by allowing the prosecution to argue inferences from his testimony. He asserts questioning an obdurate person who does not remember anything substantive is equivalent to questioning a witness who refuses to testify at all and thus violates his right to confrontation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to strike for an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 422 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">The Sixth Amendment right of confrontation secures a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination. <em>(Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 415, 418 [13 L.Ed.2d 934, 937, 85 S.Ct. 1074].) The right of confrontation \u201chas long been read as securing an adequate opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1988) 484 U.S. 554, 557 [98 L.Ed.2d 951, 956, 108 S.Ct. 838] <em>(Owens).) </em>\u201c \u2018[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees only \u201can <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Owens, supra, </em>484 U.S. at p. 559, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">That opportunity may be denied if a witness refuses to answer questions, but it is not denied if a witness cannot remember. A witness who \u201crefuses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>answer any question on direct or cross-examination denies a defendant the right to confrontation which contemplates a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the witness.

In that case, the assault victim, who suffered memory loss from the assault,-testified he remembered identifying defendant as his assailant in an interview with an FBI agent. On cross-examination, the victim stated he could not remember seeing his assailant at the time of the assault and could not remember a number of persons who visited him in the hospital, although there was evidence he had received numerous visitors. Defense counsel was unable to refresh the victim\u2019s recollection. <em>(Owens, supra, </em>484 U.S. at p. 556.) Defendant claimed on appeal he was denied the right to an effective cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">The United States Supreme Court found no constitutional violation, ruling memory testing was not essential to an opportunity for effective cross-examination. The high court wrote the constitutionally guaranteed opportunity to cross-examine witnesses \u201cis not denied when a witness testifies as to his current belief but is unable to recollect the reason for that belief. It is sufficient that the defendant has the opportunity to bring out such matters as the witness\u2019 bias, his lack of care and attentiveness, his poor eyesight, and even (what is often a prime objective of cross-examination, [citation]) the very fact that he has a bad memory. [The] ability to inquire into these matters suffices to establish the constitutionally requisite opportunity for cross-examination when a . . . witness\u2019 past belief is introduced and he is unable to recollect the reason for that past belief. . . . The weapons available to impugn the witness\u2019 statement when memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve success, but successful cross-examination is not the constitutional guarantee.\u201d <em>(Owens, supra, </em>484 U.S. at pp. 559-560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1392\">*1392</page-number>This court followed <em>Owens </em>in <em>Gunder. </em>There, a prosecution witness, a longtime friend of the murder defendant, testified he could not remember events on the night before the murders. The prosecution then played for the jury a video of the witness\u2019s earlier statement to police describing the events he claimed to have forgotten. On appeal, the defendant argued his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he did not assert a violation of the defendant\u2019s confrontation right. <em>(Gunder, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at pp. 417-418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">We concluded the defendant was not denied his confrontation right. We rejected the defendant\u2019s reliance on cases in which a witness\u2019s refusal to testify violated a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. <em>(Gunder, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at p. 419.) Relying on <em>Owens, </em>we stated: \u201cThe circumstance of feigned memory loss is not parallel to an entire refusal to testify. The witness feigning memory loss is in fact subject to cross-examination, providing a jury with the opportunity to see the demeanor and assess the credibility of the witness, which in turn gives it a basis for judging the prior hearsay statement\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Owens\u2019s and <em>Gunder\u2019s </em>reasoning applies here. Tupuo\u2019s asserted inability to recall or remember most of the events about which he was questioned did not by itself deny defendant an opportunity to cross-examine him. The jury had the opportunity to see Tupuo\u2019s demeanor and assess his credibility. Tupuo\u2019s \u201c \u2018presence at trial as a testifying witness gave the jury the opportunity to assess [his] demeanor and whether any credibility should be given to [his] testimony or [his] prior statements. This was all the constitutional right to confrontation required.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Homick </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 816, 861 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 289 P.3d 791], quoting <em>People v. Perez </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 760, 766 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 522].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">We also note that defendant declined to exercise his opportunity to cross-examine Tupuo. The trial court reasonably held it could not determine if defendant had been denied his right to cross-examine Tupuo because defense counsel did not cross-examine him. Counsel asked only whether Tupuo would know anything if he was asked a question. Simply asking Tupuo if he would know anything did not establish Tupuo was effectively unavailable as a witness. Defendant had the opportunity the Sixth Amendment gave to him as declared by <em>Owens, </em>and he did not take advantage of it. That tactical choice does not constitute constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">In correspondence after briefing was completed, defendant asserted <em>Murillo, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.4th 448, was relevant to his case. <em>Murillo </em>is distinguishable because it concerned a refusal to answer, not a loss of memory. In that case, a witness, who identified the defendant before trial in a photographic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>lineup, refused to answer questions at trial. His identification to police was the only eyewitness identification of the defendant. The trial court allowed the prosecution to ask the witness 110 leading questions concerning the details of his out-of-court statement and identification. In response to each of the prosecutor\u2019s questions, the witness said he had \u201c \u2018nothing to say\u2019 \u201d or did not respond. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 450-451.) The trial court allowed the prosecutor to display the photographic lineup on which the witness had circled the defendant\u2019s photo, along with other photos of the witness himself. The witness refused to answer any questions about these exhibits. The court instructed the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not evidence, and the only facts from the testimony the jury could consider were the witness\u2019s physical appearance and his refusals to answer. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 451-452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Division Six of the Second District Court of Appeal ruled the prosecutor\u2019s detailed questions to the witness, and the witness\u2019s refusal to answer the leading questions while the prosecutor read to the jury from his police interviews, denied the defendant the opportunity to cross-examine on what was \u201ctantamount to devastating adverse testimony.\u201d <em>(Murillo, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.4th at p. 456.) Quoting from <em>Douglas v. Alabama, supra, </em>380 U.S. at page 420, the court stated effective confrontation of the witness was possible \u201c \u2018only if [he] affirmed the statement as his.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Murillo, supra, </em>at p. 456.) Because the witness did not, inferences from his refusal \u201c \u2018 \u201cadded critical weight to the prosecution\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination, and thus unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">The <em>Murillo </em>court stated: \u201c[T]here is a point at which the prosecutor\u2019s leading questions are tantamount to evidence and overpower the proceedings so that the resulting prejudice is incurable by admonition or instruction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Murillo, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.4th at p. 457.) The case before us, however, did not reach that point. Tupuo did not refuse to answer. He claimed loss of memory, and that did not deny defendant an opportunity to cross-examine him or to observe his demeanor and weigh his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">In addition, the prosecutor\u2019s questions here did not become tantamount to evidence. None of the prosecutor\u2019s questions became significant testimony adverse to defendant. If they had been answered in the affirmative, the questions would have established, at best, that Tupuo was at the apartment complex in the early evening hours of August 6, 2010, but not later. Such evidence would have added very little to the case against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">Defendant also spends much of his opening brief arguing against <em>People v. Lopez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1553-1554 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 655] <em>(Lopez), </em>in which the Court of Appeal for the Fourth District held that a person who refused to testify under the Fifth Amendment when he actually had no Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>Amendment right could be called to testify, and, if the witness still refused to testify, the jury could draw inferences from his refusal to testify. <em>Lopez </em>does not apply here, as Tupuo did not refuse to testify. He testified he did not remember or know about some of the matters raised in the prosecutor\u2019s questions, but he did not refuse to testify or claim he had a right to refuse to testify. He answered the questions, and defendant was free to cross-examine him on those answers and impeach his credibility. That was defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment, and nothing the trial court did denied him of that right. The court did not abuse its discretion denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike and allowing the prosecutor to argue inferences from Tupuo\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">II.

He asserts the order is erroneous because (1) the jury acquitted him of committing arson, the crime that directly caused the economic damage; (2) related to the first point, his conduct of murdering the victim was not the proximate cause of the damage; and (3) the court violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi) </em>to have a jury determine victim restitution. We disagree. Defendant\u2019s conduct was a proximate cause of the economic loss, and <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to direct restitution orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">A. <em>Background information</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">At sentencing, the trial court ordered defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim\u2019s daughter, Shalini, in the amount of $13,700. $4,500 of that amount was to reimburse Shalini for the clothing and household items destroyed in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">At a restitution hearing, defendant challenged the direct restitution order to the extent it required him to pay the $4,500. He contended he was not obligated to pay for items destroyed in the fire because the jury had acquitted him of committing arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>The trial court disagreed with defendant. The court ruled that although the jury acquitted defendant of arson, the entire circumstances surrounding the murder made restitution appropriate because the fire was set to destroy evidence of the murder.

Indeed, our Supreme Court has recognized that ordinarily an acquittal would preclude the court from including the loss related to that crime in a restitution order. (See <em>[People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975)] 15 Cal.3d [481,] 487 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545].) <em>That is not to say that an acquittal on one count will preclude the imposition of a restitution order under all circumstances. </em>We merely hold that in the nonprobation context, a restitution order is not authorized where the defendant\u2019s <em>only </em>relationship to the victim\u2019s loss is by way of a crime of which the defendant was acquitted.\u201d <em>(People v. Percelle, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 180, first italics in original, other italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Here, of course, defendant\u2019s relationship to Shalini\u2019s loss arises not only from an arson for which defendant was acquitted, but also from a murder for which he was convicted. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s task was to determine whether the criminal conduct for which defendant was convicted was the proximate cause of the damage to Shalini\u2019s clothing and household items. (See <em>People v. Holmberg </em>(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1320-1322 [125 Cal.Rptr.3d 878]; <em>People v.

Under that standard, a cause in fact is something that is a substantial factor in bringing about the injury. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1052-1053; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7431, subd. (a), p. 428; [CACI No. 430 (2014)].) The substantial factor standard generally produces the same results as does the \u2018but for\u2019 rule of causation which states that a defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause of the injury if the injury would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 that conduct. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1053; Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 41, p. 266.) The substantial factor standard, however, has been embraced as a clearer rule of causation \u2014 one which subsumes the \u2018but for\u2019 test while reaching beyond it to satisfactorily address other situations, such as those involving independent or concurrent causes in fact. <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Gonzales, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 1052-1053; <em>Thomsen </em>v. <em>Rexall Drug &amp; Chemical Co. </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 775, 783 [45 Cal.Rptr. 642]; Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 41, pp. 266-268.)\u201d <em>Rutherford </em>v. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 968-969 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 941 P.2d 1203].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1397\">*1397</page-number>Defendant contends his actions in committing the murder were not a substantial factor in damaging Shalini\u2019s clothes and household items lost in the fire. The evidence showed the fire was started after the victim died. There was no evidence regarding who started the fire or when it was started. And the jury was not instructed to consider whether defendant aided and abetted the commission of arson or whether the arson was a natural and probable consequence of the murder. These points, defendant claims, indicate his actions were not the proximate cause of Shalini\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Defendant applies the substantial factor test too narrowly. The test, put simply, is whether Shalini would have incurred damages had there been no murder. The answer is clearly no.

Cervantes </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 860, 871 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 148, 29 P.3d 225].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">Here it was reasonably foreseeable that defendant or his accomplices would act to destroy evidence where the victim, while still alive, obtained defendant\u2019s DNA under his fingernails, and that such actions to destroy evidence could cause harm or damage, including the damage Shalini suffered. Under these circumstances, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in determining defendant\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of Shalini\u2019s economic losses and that there was no independent intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">Additionally, defendant contends the decision to grant direct victim restitution must, under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Southern Union Co. v. United States </em>(2012) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>567 U.S. _ [183 L.Ed.2d 318, 132 S.Ct. 2344] <em>(,Southern Union), </em>be subject to a jury determination and be established beyond a reasonable doubt. He asserts that since section 1202.4 does not authorize imposing a financial order for a crime of which defendant was acquitted, the $4,500 is essentially an additional penalty to the statutory maximum of $10,000 proscribed for a restitution <em>fine. </em>(See \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).) He thus claims the order is a penalty that exceeds the statutory maximum and is subject to jury approval. We disagree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">First, we have already determined the trial court did not abuse its discretion by requiring defendant to pay Shalini the $4,500 as direct restitution under section 1202.4. Thus, the order does not impose an additional restitution fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Second, because the grant of a direct restitution order is not a monetary penalty, it is not subject to <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Southern Union. </em>Prior to <em>Southern Union, </em>the <em>Apprendi </em>court held that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond <em>the prescribed statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 490, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">Thereafter, in <em>Southern Union, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that Sixth Amendment right to a jury applies to \u201csentences of criminal fines.\u201d <em>(Southern Union, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [183 L.Ed.2d at p. 325].) In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[criminal fines, like . . . other forms of punishment, are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[183 L.Ed.2d at p. 327].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-10\">However, neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor <em>Southern Union </em>applies to direct victim restitution because direct victim restitution is not a criminal penalty. <em>(People v. Pangan </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 574, 585-586 [152 Cal.Rptr.3d 632].) \u201c[Direct victim restitution is a substitute for a civil remedy so that victims of crime do not need to file separate civil suits. It is not increased \u2018punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 585.) Section 1202.4 imposes no statutory limits on the amount of direct restitution a court may order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\">For the same reasons, the court\u2019s determination may be established by a preponderance of the evidence. The higher standard of proof applies to facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>that increase a crime\u2019s penalty beyond what a judge could impose based on the applicable statute and the facts in the record. <em>(Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296, 301 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 412, 124 S.Ct. 2531].) Since direct restitution is not a criminal penalty and is not subject to a statutory maximum amount, it is not subject to a jury trial and may be imposed based on the preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">Hull, J., and Murray, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 9, 2015, S229913.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-13\"> Undesignated references to sections are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1089-10\"> Defendant underwent an earlier trial, but the court declared a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked.
