J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">I. <em>INTRODUCTION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">Defendant Noe Iniguez appeals the judgment of conviction following a jury trial. Defendant was convicted of two counts of violating a restraining order (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273.6, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of distributing a private image (\u00a7 647, subd. (j)(4)). Defendant contends on appeal that section 647, subdivision (j)(4), is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, the court misin-structed the jury, there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions, and the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument. As discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">II. <em>FACTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">At trial, Jennifer Fajardo testified she dated defendant off and on for four years, and although the relationship ended in 2011, defendant continued to contact her by repeatedly e-mailing her, texting her, and coming by her house. Fajardo sought a restraining order, and a three-year restraining order prohibiting defendant from harassing, attacking, striking, or directly or indirectly contacting her was issued by the court. Fajardo worked as a secretary and bookkeeper for a painting contractor\u2019s company, and also acted as the administrator of the company\u2019s Facebook page. Whenever someone would post a message on her employer\u2019s Facebook page, Fajardo would receive an e-mail notification- alerting her of the posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">On December 12, 2013, Fajardo received an e-mail regarding a posting and immediately accessed the company\u2019s Facebook page. On the page, Fajardo saw a post with defendant\u2019s name, indicating he was the person who posted the message. Fajardo testified the post stated defendant \u201c[c]ailed Jennifer and I was trying to get your services and she started flirting with me. I don\u2019t want that kind of trick by a cunt, c-u-n-t. I\u2019m a serious man and I\u2019m not trying to get a hooker, I just wanted to hire you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">On the same date, Fajardo was alerted to another post on the company\u2019s Facebook page. The posting had the same text as the previous one posted by defendant. Instead of defendant\u2019s name, however, it indicated it was posted by \u201cNizon F. Cush.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>On March 28, 2014, Fajardo got an e-mail about another Facebook post. This one was posted by \u201cNizon F. Cush\u201d in Spanish. Fajardo translated it into English as stating, \u201cGood job, but please laid [sic] off,\u201d and, \u201cSlut, Jennifer Fajardo.\u201d The post also included a photograph of Fajardo at a beach without a shirt showing her bare breasts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">Fajardo testified the photograph of her at the beach was taken by defendant using a digital camera in 2010 or 2011 while they were still dating. Defendant and Fajardo understood at the time the photo was taken that it would \u201cremain just between\u201d the two of them, and \u201cthat it wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Defendant transferred this photograph and others he had taken of Fajardo onto his computer, and the two of them had \u201cpromised to erase them when everything was over, and that they would never be published anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Fajardo testified she felt embarrassed and afraid upon seeing the post that included the photograph showing her breasts, because she believed nothing between her and defendant could now be hidden. Although her employer\u2019s project manager and not her boss had learned of the post, she was concerned about losing her job. Fajardo testified, \u201cIt\u2019s been so hard for me going to work thinking that my boss is going to tell something and I\u2019m afraid to lose my job as well.\u201d Fajardo further testified the post \u201cmade me feel bad, to the point that I even told my mother that all I wanted to do was go get in the car and go kill myself.\u201d Although she believed she needed psychological help due to the posting, she had not seen a professional because she did not have money to pay for a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">A. <em>Constitutionality of Section 647, Subdivision (j)(4)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-8\">Defendant argues section 647, subdivision (j)(4), is unconstitutional because it is vague, thereby violating due process of law under the United States and California Constitutions (U.S. Const., 5th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7), and overbroad, violating the right to free speech (U.S. Const., 1st Amend.). \u201cWe review the constitutionality of a statute de novo. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Brian J. </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 97, 124 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 246].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>(1) <em>Due process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">Due process of law is based on the \u201cconcepts of preventing arbitrary law enforcement and providing adequate notice to potential offenders. [Citation.] These protections ... are often referred to collectively as the \u2018fair warning\u2019 rule. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castenada </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 743, 751 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, 3 P.3d 278].) \u201cThe vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of \u2018 \u201ca statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that [persons] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] A vague law \u2018not only fails to provide adequate notice to those who must observe its strictures, but also \u201cimpermissibly delegates basic policy matters to [law enforcement], judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] In deciding the adequacy of any notice afforded those bound by a legal restriction, we are guided by the principles that \u2018abstract legal commands must be applied in a specific context,\u2019 and that, although not admitting of \u2018mathematical certainty,\u2019 the language used must have \u2018 <em>\u201creasonable </em>specificity.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Sheena K. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 890 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 716, 153 P.3d 282], some italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">Defendant was convicted of committing a 2014 violation of section 647, former subdivision (j)(4). At that time the statute provided, in relevant part, that every person who committed any of the following acts was guilty of a misdemeanor: \u201c(A) Any person who photographs or records by any means the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person, under circumstances where the parties agree or understand that the image shall remain private, and the person subsequently distributes the image taken, with the intent to cause serious emotional distress, and the depicted person suffers serious emotional distress. [\u00b6] (B) As used in this paragraph, intimate body part means any portion of the genitals, and in the case of a female, also includes any portion of the breasts below the top of the areola, that is either uncovered or visible through less than fully opaque clothing.\u201d (\u00a7 647, former subd. (j)(4).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">Defendant argues the statute is vague because it \u201cfails to specify the nature of the agreement and understanding] the parties must reach before a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>can legally \u2018distribute\u2019 the image,\u201d and \u201cfails to notify a person what constitutes \u2018private.\u2019 \u201d The terms of the statute, however, are not such that a person of common intelligence would be required to guess at their meaning. Similarly, those of common intelligence would not differ as to its application, and its terms do not lend themselves to arbitrary and discriminatory application. The images subject to the statute are those of intimate body parts, including genitals and female breasts. The agreement or understanding referred to in the statute simply reflects that it is reasonable for individuals to concur with one another that such images not be distributed to other persons. Pictures of these body parts are commonly understood to be private, meaning not to be seen by the general public absent consent given by the party being depicted. Read in the specific context of the statute, the terms used in section 647, former subdivision (j)(4) provided a person with reasonable specificity, thereby comporting with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\">(2) <em>First Amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">\u201cThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution states: \u2018Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . .\u2019 \u201d and applies to the states under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <em>(Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 121, 133-134 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 980 P.2d 846]). Under the overbreadth doctrine, \u201clitigants may challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because the very existence of an overbroad statute may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected expression. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 709 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365].) To avoid being unconstitutionally over-broad, \u201cstatutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn and represent a considered legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has to give way to other compelling needs of society. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 601, 611-612 [37 L.Ed.2d 830, 93 S.Ct. 2908].) The overbreadth doctrine \u201cis, manifestly, strong medicine\u201d which has been used \u201csparingly and only as a last resort.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Defendant argues the statute is overbroad because it \u201carbitrarily forecloses to any person the right to distribute legally taken photographs of certain images,\u201d and it applies to \u201calmost any photographs of \u2018intimate body parts.\u2019 \u201d Assuming, without deciding, a person has a free speech right to distribute photographs and other captured images, section 647, former subdivision (j)(4), was not overbroad because it was narrowly drawn and it protected a compelling public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">As it read in 2014, section 647, former subdivision (j)(4) only barred a person who photographed or recorded the image from distributing it, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>such a person had the intent to cause serious emotional distress. The requirement that a person <em>intend </em>to cause distress served to narrow the law (see <em>Stark v. Superior Court </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 368, 391 [128 Cal.Rptr.3d 611, 257 P.3d 41]), rendering it inapplicable, for example, if the person acted under a mistake of fact or by accident (see \u00a7 26 classes Three &amp; Five).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">Furthermore, it is not just <em>any </em>images that are subject to the statute, but only those which were taken under circumstances where the parties agreed or understood the images were to remain private. \u201cThe government has an important interest in protecting the substantial privacy interests of individuals from being invaded in an intolerable manner. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Astalis </em>(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 8 [172 Cal.Rptr.3d 568].) It is evident that barring persons from intentionally causing others serious emotional distress through the distribution of photos of their intimate body parts is a compelling need of society. The statute was not overbroad because the limitations specified therein greatly narrowed its applicability, diminishing the possibility that it could lead persons to refrain from constitutionally protected expression, and it constituted \u201ca considered legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has to give way to other compelling needs of society. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Broadrick v. Oklahoma, supra, </em>413 U.S. at pp. 611-612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">B. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">Defendant argues the court erred by failing <em>to </em>instruct the jury <em>that </em>a violation of section 647, subdivision (j)(4) must be \u201cknowing\u201d; failing to define \u201cdistributes\u201d and \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d; failing to provide a unanimity instruction; and failing to instruct the jury pursuant to CALCRIM No. 358 that it should consider with caution any statements made by defendant tending to show his guilt. \u201cWe review de novo whether jury instructions state the law correctly. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jackson </em>(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 918, 923 [118 Cal.Rptr.3d 623].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">(1) <em>Elements of section 647, subdivision (j)(4)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">The court instructed the jury regarding the elements of section 647, former subdivision (j)(4), as it read in 2014. This included that the People were required to prove defendant photographed an intimate body part of Fajardo under circumstances where he and Fajardo understood the image would remain private, and he \u201csubsequently distributed the image with the intent to cause emotional distress.\u201d The court further instructed the jury that the violation required \u201ca specific intent,\u201d and that to find a person guilty of the crime, \u201cthat person must not only intentionally commit the prohibited act, but must do so with the specific intent.\u201d As indicated by the instruction on the elements of section 647, former subdivision (j)(4), the jury was required to determine if defendant had the specific intent to cause emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 9\">*Supp. 9</page-number>As noted by defendant on appeal, the court did not instruct the jury that in order to be found guilty, the People had to prove defendant knew or should have known distribution of Fajardo\u2019s image would cause serious emotional distress. The court was not required, however, to instruct the jury regarding knowledge, because it complied with the constitutional requirement of including a scienter element (see <em>Elonis v. United States </em>(2015) 575 U.S. _, _ [192 L.Ed.2d 1, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 2003]), by instructing the crime required specific intent, and the statute as it read' in 2014 did not explicitly specify such knowledge was needed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACr\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the court was not required to define for the jury the terms \u201cdistributes\u201d and \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d found in section 647, subdivision (j)(4). This is because there is no indication in the statute that the terms at issue were used in a \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018technical sense peculiar to the law\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 616, 670 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 133, 237 P.3d 474]), and since \u201cthe terms defendant^ challenge[s] are words in common use and of common knowledge' . . . their definition [was] not necessary.

The Oxford Dictionary defines \u201cserious\u201d as \u201c[significant or worrying because of possible danger or risk; not slight or negligible.\u201d (Oxford Diets. Online &lt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ serious&gt; [as of Mar. 25, 2016].) It defines \u201cemotion\u201d as relating to \u201cstrong feeling deriving from one\u2019s circumstances, mood, or relationships with others\u201d; (Oxford Diets. Online &lt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/ emotion&gt; [as of Mar. 25, 2016]) and \u201cdistress\u201d as \u201c[e]xtreme anxiety, sorrow, or pain\u201d (Oxford Diets. Online &lt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/ english/distress&gt; [as of Mar. 25, 2016]). These are common terms and words which \u201ccan readily be understood by jurors\u201d <em>(People v. Manibusan </em>(2013) 58 Cal.4th 40, 98 [165 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 314 P.3d 1]) and therefore did not need to be defined in the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 10\">*Supp. 10</page-number>(2), (3)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAhv\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">C. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">Defendant argues insufficient evidence was presented that defendant violated section 647, subdivision (j)(4), because there was a lack of proof he distributed Fajardo\u2019s photograph and lack of proof she suffered any serious emotional distress. Defendant further argues there was insufficient evidence he violated the restraining order, because the People did not prove the order was issued under Family Code section 6218.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-7\">(1) <em>The term \u201cdistributes\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">Defendant argues that the term \u201cdistributes\u201d in section 647, subdivision (j)(4)(A), should be defined to exclude posting an image on Facebook. He urges we adopt a dictionary definition of the word defining it to mean \u201c[t]o deliver\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (9th ed. 2009) p. 543); or use the meaning contained in the federal statute barring distribution of child pornography, which requires transfer of the pornography to another person (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252); or use the meaning contained in state statutes barring distribution of child pornography, which require a transfer of possession (see, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 313.1). Defendant argues posting an image on a social media site such as Facebook does not effectuate delivery of the image or transfer to a specific person. As discussed above, however, there is no indication in section 647, subdivision (j)(4), that the term \u201cdistribute^]\u201d was intended to have a technical legal meaning, or to mean anything other than its commonly used and known definition of \u201cto give or deliver (something) to people.\u201d (Merriam-Webster Diet. Online &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/distribute&gt; [as of Mar. 25, 2016].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">Moreover, to the extent there is any ambiguity in the meaning of the term \u201cdistributes,\u201d we may consult extrinsic evidence of intent, including the legislative history of the statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Yartz </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 529, 538 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 328, 123 P.3d 604].) Legislative analyses of the Senate bill that enacted section 647, subdivision (j)(4), are replete with indications that posting images on public Web sites was <em>precisely </em>one of the evils the statute sought to remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">One analysis stated, \u201c \u2018 \u201cCyber revenge\u201d is an invasive and increasingly common crime, which often involves the <em>online posting </em>of private or intimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 11\">*Supp. 11</page-number>photos of another person without the person\u2019s consent. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Assem.

Another stated, \u201cAccording to the author: [\u00b6] \u2018Cyber revenge\u2019 or \u2018revenge pom\u2019 refers to the <em>posting of </em>illicit pictures of another person without his/her consent, often as retaliation following a bitter breakup between partners.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Unfinished Business Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 255 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 3, 2013, pp. 4\u20145, italics added.) Yet another referred to an instance where naked photographs of an ex-spouse were posted without her authorization on a personal ads section of a Web site. (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 255 (2013-2014 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 21, 2013, pp. 4-5.) Completely absent from the legislative history is any indication that the statute should be limited to situations where a person delivered or transferred an image to another specific person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">\u201c \u2018To determine whether sufficient evidence supports a jury verdict, a reviewing court reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(2015) 60 Cal.4th 966, 988 [184 Cal.Rptr.3d 612, 343 P.3d 808].) The evidence Fajardo\u2019s photograph was posted on a public Facebook page using an alias Fajardo knew was used by defendant constituted substantial evidence supporting defendant\u2019s distribution of the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">(2) <em>The term \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">Defendant argues the term \u201cserious emotional distress\u201d should also be given a specialized legal meaning, akin to the definition of \u201csevere emotional distress\u201d for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. (See <em>Coleman v. Republic Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 403, 416 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 744] [defining severe emotional distress as \u201coutrageous\u201d conduct which is \u201cextreme\u201d and going \u201c . beyond all possible bonds of decency [so as to be] regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community .\u201d].) Defendant maintains there was insufficient evidence to establish Fajardo suffered such distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-10\">However, as discussed ante, there is no indication a specialized legal meaning was intended to be used instead of the commonly understood meaning of the term, such as a \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cstrong feeling\u201d of \u201cextreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 12\">*Supp. 12</page-number>anxiety, sorrow, or pain.\u201d (See Oxford Diets.

An image showing Fajardo\u2019s bare breasts\u2014which she believed would never be seen by anyone other than defendant\u2014was posted on a Facebook page, and Fajardo now felt nothing between her and defendant could be hidden from the public. Fajardo was embarrassed, she worried about losing her job, believed she needed psychological help but lacked the money for treatment, and she felt so bad that she told her mother she wanted to \u201cget in the car and go kill [herself].\u201d Whether a common or specialized definition was used, this was all that was required to satisfy the element in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">(3) <em>Protective </em>order<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAgd\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">D. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAi5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">IV. <em>DISPOSITION</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ai7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1284-9\">B.
