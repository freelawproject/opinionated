The prisoner was a French sailor, and the murder with which he stood charged had been committed upon the high seas. On his landing in North Carolina he was taken up and committed to jail. From thence he was taken on the next day, brought into court in irons, and examined, without being informed that he was then under an examination and not on his trial. He understood not the English language, and no one informed him of what was passing. There was room to believe that he thought, when he was remanded to jail, that he had been tried, convicted, and condemned, for he asked a person who understood the French language on what day he was to be executed. The counsel said although in the case of a person who had resided some time in this country, or in others in which the proceedings are carried on by jury, the objection would be frivolous, yet it must have weight in the case of a foreigner unacquainted with our laws and our language; that what the prisoner had seen in court, except perhaps the confrontation of witnesses, was all that in familiar circumstances he would have seen in his own country had he been tried there, where sentence of death is not pronounced in court in presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>prisoner, but read to him afterwards by the clerk in the dungeon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-3\">2. The examination and confession subscribed by an offender before a justice of the peace is good and sufficient evidence against such offender. Gilb. Ev. 140. The examination of Sterne and Boroski, was, by the chief justice, refused to be read at their trial. See 3 State Tr. p. 470. And Serjeant Wilson, in his edition of Hale\u2019s Pleas of the Grown (volume 2, p. 585, in notes), adds a query, whether the chief justice was not right in such refusal. For, by the opinion of some judges now living, the statute does not extend to the examination of the party accused unless he signed his examination, but only to the witnesses or persons accusing. In Vaughan\u2019s Case, Mr. Crauley having made oath that the examination was taken before Sir Charles Hedges, and signed by the prisoner, it was read. 5 State Tr. 229. In Harrison\u2019s Case, the attorney-general desired that the defendant's examination, taken before the Lord Chief Justice Brumpton, might be read, and the defendant having acknowledged the hand to be his that was subscribed to it, it was read accordingly. 7 State Tr. 118. In Layer\u2019s Case, the prisoner\u2019s counsel said, and the chief justice granted, th\u00e1t this examination could not be read unless it was signed by him. 8 State Tr. 474, 8 Mod. 89.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-4\">PATERSuN, Circuit Justice, thought the examination ought to have been signed by the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-5\">SITGREAVES, District Judge, said the first objection had much weight with him, and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-6\">Mr. Attorney of the United States withdrew his motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-7\">The prisoner was found guilty upon other evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-8\">And jt was moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the length and depth of the wound were not mentioned in the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b1213-9\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel cited Heydon\u2019s Case, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 4 Coke, 42.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1212-26\"> [Reported by Hon.

But THE COURT informed the bar they would take up the motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-18\">On the part of the United States several precedents of indictments were read out of West, in which the length and depth of the wound are not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-19\">Mr. Martin observed that, in all the indictments (but one) in which the length and depth of the wound were not mentioned, the instrument had gone through the body of the person killed, some limb had been cut off, or the wound had been given with a blunt weapon. In this case the mortal wound was stated to have been given with an axe, on the head. That the authority in Coke was not only unshaken, but frequently recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-20\">THE COURT, however, overruled the motion, without making any observation, and passed sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-21\">At the same time sentence was passed on three other men who had been included in the same indictment, and they were soon after executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-22\">This is the first time that judgment of death was given under the authority of the United States.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
