He said the murder was committed on the high seas, in 1818. The brig Holkar sailed from the port of N. Y. in Oct., 1818, under Captain Brown, and a coloured crew, with the exception of one man. The brig sailed for Curaeoa, and reached the port of her destination. She took in a return cargo; and while on the high seas, the crew arose, mutinied, and murdered Captain Brown, the mate of the vessel, and a Captain Humphries, .who was a passenger on board. The district attorney stated the difficulties in procuring testimony, after a lapse of six years, but said that he should present everything that could be reached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-12\">[Evidence on the Part of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-13\">[He then called Thomas M\u2019Cready, who Is a clerk in the custom house.

(Mr. Haines objected to the competency of the witness, on the ground that he had been in the state prison. It appeared that he had been indicted for grand larceny, and convicted on the 7th of October, 1819, when he was sentenced to the state prison for three years, and had served his time out. The counsel for the prosecution replied, and produced a pardon from the governor, dated the 9th of April, 1824. See the judge\u2019s charge. The objection was overruled by THE COURT, and the examination proceeded.) Witness shipped on board the brig Holkar, in 1818, commanded by Samuel Brown. He shipped with Alexander Cheevers (or Shivers!, Charles Moutiza, Patrick Butler (his right name was Harry Cook, called Cook or Doctor). James Irving, John Robinson (the prisoner), John Williams (white man), and himself and mate. They were all colored people except John Williams. Sailed on the morning of Sunday for Curacoa, where they' arrived and discharged, and took in a return cargo, and started for New York. At Curacoa, Shivers had a dispute with the captain. Captain Humphries, a passenger, took charge of the vessel; the captain and mate being sick, the men refused to work under him, when they were put in prison, except Robinson, Jones, and the cook, but Robinson was afterwards taken up for stealing part of a barrel of beef from the vessel, and remained in prison till the brig sailed. The night before, Alexander Cheevers and Charles and James ran away, but were taken up and carried on board, the morning she sailed. John Williams was left at Curacoa. where he went in a Dutch man of war. Capt. Hum-phries came passenger in the brig, but used to do captain\u2019s duty sometimes. When they had been out seven or eight days, the captain sent them up to bend another topsail about dusk; John. James, Charles, Alexander, and witness. They had some dispute aloft, and being reproved, they made some answer which induced the captain to go down and load his pistols. James and Charles pretended to be sick, and went below and staid in their berths. The captain made tea and coffee, and sent to them from the cabin. Charles was sick at this time. Charles and James and witness were in the captain\u2019s watch. The prisoner and Alexander Shivers were in the mate\u2019s watch. The witness was in his berth and neai'ly asleep, when Alexander came down, and asked Charles whether he was ready, Charles said, \u201cYes.\u201d Witness asked what they were going to do? Charles answered. \u201cNone of your business.\" Robinson said he was going to call the mate forward and tell him there was something wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>there. Charles then told witness that they ..were going to kill the captain, the mate and passenger. Robinson (the prisoner) went and called the mate forward. He came forward, and Charles and James jumped out of the forecastle; Charles and James with a crowbar, and James with a liand-spike. \"Witness then heard somebody strike, and heard the mate cry \u201cMurder!\u201d and stamp on the deck. \"Witness was below. When witness got upon deck, the mate was fallen. Witness cried out, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, what are you doing!\u201d Charles then answered. \u201cYou son of a bitch, if you say a word, I will knock your brains out.\u201d Alexander took his (the mate\u2019s) watch out of his pocket, and Charles, Alexander and James hove him overboard. They then went aft, and witness followed them. The prisoner said he would call Captain Hum-phries up, for he used to do captain\u2019s duty. He went down, but Captain H. would not get up. He then went down and told Captain Brown the mate wanted him forward. Captain B. got up, and went fox-ward as far as the windlass, when he started back, and all at once began to walk aft. Charles ran out from behind the camboose. and struck at him with a crowbar, which the captain caught in his hand, exclaiming, \u201cCharles is that you?\u201d Charles said \u201cTes.\u201d Alexander Cheevers now ran around the long-boat, and struck him twice on the head with a hatchet. James llien took the handspike and struck him over the face. The prisoner then, came with a harpoon, struck the captain in the left side. His head was lying towards the stai-board. The captain put his hand upon his breast, and then they picked him up and threw him overboard, and told witness to take the helm. At the time the mate was killed, the prisoner had. the helm: and while they were killing the captain, the witness had the helm, but part of the time left it to see the fray. This done, Charles said. \u201cLet us go down now and kill that damned privateer son of a bitch Captain Humphries:\u201d upon which all went down in the cabin, and told witness to keep the helm. Witness heard Captain Humphries crying murder for some time, and then all four came up from the cabin, bringing Captain H. with them, and laid him down; and they hove him overboard. The cook came up after they had thrown Captain Humphries ovei-board. They told him to go down and clear up the blood in the cabin; he went and got a bucket of water, and did it. They said Captain Humphries was getting the captain's pistols out. when they struck at him. and broke one of them in his hand. Alexander Skivers took charge of the brig. They then ran near Pono Rico,\" to the Mona Passage, and from thence to St. Domingo. Prisoner then bored holes in the brig to scuttle her, and they intended to go ashore in the boat. About two o'clock in the afternoon, a vessel was near them, and they were frightened, and took out the boat, and put aboard some provisions and clothing, -and they all got in, except the witness, who at first refused to go, until Charles took a pistol and threatened to shoot him if he did not. They went ashore about Jacquemel. After the murder, they found on board a box of gold, buckles, &amp;e.: they also found 110 dollars, and a Masonic apron, which was thrown overboard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-5\">[Cross-examined: Witness was bom in Orange county.

The question for you to decide is one involving the life of the prisoner. It is for you to say whether he is guilty or not guilty. The material point in this ease is, whether the prisoner at the bar is the person who shipped on board the Holkar, in 1818, as sworn to by David Valentine, Oliver King, Peter Willis, and Mr. Bogart. The offense as charged in the indictment, if committed at all, is an aggravated piratical murder. It took place upon the high seas, and is therefore within the jurisdiction of this court. It satisfactorily appears by the evidence, that the Holkar cleared for Curacoa in October, 1818. There can be no doubt of this fact; indeed, it is not denied. It appears \u00a1liso that the vessel was commanded by Captain Brown; that her crew. with the exception of one person, was composed of colored people. This appears by the testimony of Diana, King. Willis. Mr. Bogart, and Mr. Conklin. It apjiears by the register of the ship and notarial list of Mr. Bogart (which agree with each other), that Alexander Cheevers. &lt;\u2019bar\u00edes Montiza, Patrick Butler (called Cook). James Irving, Charles Robinson (the prisoner), King, the witness, and the mate were the crew of the vessel. The vessel sailed for Curacoa, since which time nothing has been heard of -her. The insurances upon the Holkar and her cargo have long since been paid. There is no doubt, therefore, the vessel has been lost, whether in the manner related by King or not remains for you to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-21\">Before his honor recapitulated King's testimony. he called the attention of the jury to the infamy of his character. It appears (said he) by the record of the general ses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>sions that King has been convicted of a larceny, and has been sentenced to the state prison, has served out his time, and has received a pardon from the executive of the state, for the purpose of making him a witness against the prisoner, all since the commission of the alleged murder. His honor observed, he had no doubt of the efficacy of the pardon, and that he was now a competent witness; his credibility, however, was still a subject for the consideration of the jury. The law has made him a competent witness; but the jury were not compelled to believe him. ana he should advise the jury to give no weight to his testimony where he was not corroborated by others. He adverted to the examination of King, made on the 3d o\u00ed June, 1819, immediately on his arrival in this country. The objection then to his credibility did not exist. That examination, and his testimony here to-day, appear to agree in all essential particulars; and it appears by Justice Hopson, chat it was not possible for him to have had access to that paper.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Ambx\">A pardon has the effect to restore a felon to competency as a witness. See State v. Foley, 15 Nev. 68, citing above case.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b650-3\">His honor instructed the jury, that the testimony of King ought to have no weight in their minds, unless corroborated by others, or by the circumstances of the case, and proceeded to detail the principal facts of the loss of the vessel, and the murder of Captain Brown, the mate, and Captain Humphries, as related by King (see his testimony). He remarked upon the consistency of King\u2019s story, the minute history of the circumstances he had given, the difficulty, not to say impossibility, of King\u2019s framing such a connected chain of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">It could not have escaped the jury (said his honor) that the case depended materially upon the circumstances. Before he enumerated them, he remarked upon the nature of circumstantial evidence. A number of cases have been cited and read, to show you the dangerous tendency of this kind of proof. It is possible an innocent person may have suffered, bul such cases (if any such there were) could be no objection to this kind of evidence; if jurors were to disregard it, there would be an end to the administration of law, and to government. It was (he observed) the duty of the jury to weigh all the evidence for and against the prisoner, and that fair and legal inferences were to be made from facts and circumstances proved, they were often more satisfactory and conclusive than the testimony of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Then as to the identity of the prisoner. Notwithstanding he shipped on board the Holkar by the name of Charles Robinson, and was known only by the name of Tom Jones, yet it appeared by the testimony of a number of witnesses he was the same person. Diana Valentine swears positively that she was well acquainted with the prisoner; that she had boarded in the same house with him before the Holkar sailed.
