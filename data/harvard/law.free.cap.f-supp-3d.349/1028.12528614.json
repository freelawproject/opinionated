Dkt. # 40. The underlying dispute is a class action to recover money lost playing electronic gambling games available through different platforms, including Facebook and mobile. Playtika argues that the Complaint should be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , and failure to state a claim. Playtika also argues in the alternative that allegations related to Vegas Downtown Slots should be stricken from the Complaint because Wilson has not alleged that he actually played that game.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Playtika Ltd. is an Israeli company that markets a number of apps that allow players to partake in popular gambling games, such as slot machine, via Facebook and mobile. Complaint, Dkt. # 1, at 2, 6. Playtika's apps include Slotomania, House of Fun, Caesars Slots, and Vegas Downtown Slots, the first three of which Wilson has\n   personally played.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 10. All of these apps allow users to play gambling games with virtual \"coins\" that may be purchased in the apps after users run out of the initial free allotment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. Despite the fact that these coins cannot be redeemed for actual money, Wilson alleges that they are nonetheless valuable because they can be used to continue playing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 14. Therefore, Wilson alleges that Playtika's apps constitute gambling as defined by RCW \u00a7 9.46.0285 in violation of RCW \u00a7 4.24.070. Wilson also alleges two derivative claims for violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, RCW \u00a7 19.86.010, and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When a defendant moves to dismiss a complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Schwarzenegger v.

A plaintiff cannot simply rest on the bare allegations of its complaint, but rather is obligated to come forward with facts, by affidavit or otherwise, supporting personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Amba Marketing Systems, Inc. v.

A prima facie showing means that the plaintiff has produced admissible evidence, which if believed, is sufficient to establish the existence of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Ballard v.

Application\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Playtika contends that Wilson lacks personal jurisdiction to sue in Washington both because Playtika is not headquartered or incorporated in the state and because it merely placed its app in the stream of commerce and did not direct its activities at Washington. Wilson concedes that general jurisdiction is lacking, but argues that specific jurisdiction is satisfied because Playtika entered into numerous contracts with consumers in Washington who had downloaded their app. Essentially, the parties quarrel over whether the \"purposeful direction\" or \"purposeful availment\" test for jurisdiction applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A court's personal jurisdiction analysis begins with the \"long-arm\" statute of the state in which the court sits.\n   <em>\n    Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V. v.

Washington's long-arm statute extends the court's personal jurisdiction to the broadest reach that the United States Constitution permits, so the jurisdictional analysis under state law and federal due process are the same.\n   <em>\n    Byron Nelson Co. v.

In contrast, the \"purposeful availment\" analysis is most often used in suits sounding in contract, and often requires \"evidence of the defendant's actions in the forum, such as executing or performing a contract there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p800\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237389\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/797/#p800\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When deciding whether to apply the purposeful availment or direction analysis, courts look to the underlying dispute to determine whether it primarily sounds in contract or tort. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Boschetto v. Hansing\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's claims included breach of contract, misrepresentation, fraud, and violation of a consumer protection law against the seller, but the court applied the purposeful availment analysis because all of the claims were premised on the contract.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3120134\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/1011/#p1016\">\n    539 F.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 (9th Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Panthera Railcar LLC v.

In\n   <em>\n    Boschetto\n   </em>\n   , the court found that there was no purposeful availment where the parties consummated one lone transaction for a car via eBay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1017. However, the court also stated that a party's use of eBay to establish \"regular business with a remote forum\" may be sufficient for purposeful availment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1019. Indeed, other courts have held that a seller's use of an online platform to run a \"sophisticated business\" and conduct a \"substantial volume of sales\" constitutes purposeful availment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oakley, Inc. v.

Courts have also found purposeful availment where the defendant sells inventory and provides follow-up services from its own site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helicopter Transp. Servs., LLC v.

Or. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This case presents a difficult middle ground between the discrete categories\n   of contract and tort. On the one hand, Wilson's claims sounds in contract since he is essentially trying to recover for numerous transactions that he now argues were illegal. On the other hand, Wilson's claims also rest on the design of Playtika's app as a whole, since he can only succeed if this novel form of online gaming constitutes \"gambling\" under Washington law. In this way, Wilson's suit resembles a product liability action in which Playtika allegedly designed a dangerous product that allows people to gamble online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, while the design of Playtika's apps may be integral to determining whether the transactions Wilson entered into were illegal, the transactions themselves are at the heart of this case. In other words, Playtika's apps can only be illegal insofar as they facilitate illegal gambling, which is transactional or contractual in nature. As Wilson explains, the common law treats parties to a wagering contract as in\n   <em>\n    pari delicto\n   </em>\n   , leading courts to traditionally refuse to rescind such contracts. 7 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 13:23 (4th ed. 2018). To counter this, states have passed laws like RCW \u00a7 4.24.070 to provide a means of restoring parties to their original positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   38 Am.

In any case, Playtika fails to explain how the core of Wilson's claims is better characterized as falling under tort law.

Playtika first points to the Complaint's allegation that \"Playtika provides visitors of its online slot machines a bundle of free 'coins' that can be used to wager on its games,\" but this refers to the same \"initial allotment\" of coins that was also alleged in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   . Dkt. # 1, at \u00b6 2. However, Playtika also identifies two screenshots in the Complaint that\n   demonstrate players' ability to gain additional free coins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 27-28. One screenshot shows the \"pop up\" screen players encounter after running out of coins, which prompts them to \"BUY COINS\" and additionally suggests that they may \"collect [a] Special Bonus when available in the lobby.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. The other screenshot depicts the menu for purchasing coins, which contains a notification in the lower corner that the player has a \"Free Store Bonus [of] 1,000 Coins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although Wilson's allegations do not describe these aspects of the screenshots, the Complaint does locate the screenshots within the overall gameplay and explains what they generally depict. The Court can infer from these images that players can obtain\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   additional free coins after the initial allotment. The screenshots do not indicate how often such coins are available, how many can be obtained, or what exactly can be done with them. The Court can therefore only consider whether some additional free coin allotments, however small or infrequent, remove Playtika's virtual coins from the statutory \"thing of value\" definition in RCW \u00a7 9.46.0285.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   They do not. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that virtual coins are valuable because they \"extend the privilege of playing\" that is lost when a player runs out of free coins.\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not predicate its holding on whether this privilege was\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   lost, but instead explained that the privilege was lost when a player \"must buy more chips\" to keep playing. It therefore does not matter that a player may obtain more free coins at some future time because, until then, they must pay to extend their privilege of playing. Additional free coin allotments do not change the role of coins from \"extension\" to \"enhancement\" as Playtika argues.

Despite the fact that players could obtain a new voucher each day through a number of means, the court still held that the credits earned from play sessions were a \"thing of value\" that extended the ability to play.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 235, 242,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20P.3d%201162\">\n    110 P.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, it is worth noting that if buying additional coins\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   served the functions described in the declaration, the coins may in fact fall outside the \"thing of value\" definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW \u00a7 9.46.0285.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, Playtika argues that the Court should disregard the Ninth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   as contrary the Washington Gambling Commission's statements regarding \"social gaming,\" as well as other district court cases addressing the matter. To support its position, Playtika asks the Court to take judicial notice of a pamphlet released by the Commission in 2014 and a recent statement by the Commissioner regarding the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   . These are both public records that the Court can properly take judicial notice of, as Wilson concedes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n, Dkt. # 52, at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   However, they do not support the conclusions that Playtika hopes for. While the pamphlet offered by Playtika does state that social gaming is not gambling if there is no prize, it also purports to provide only \"general guidance\" to consumers. Dkt. # 43-1. The Ninth Circuit already declined to defer to this pamphlet, and the Court does the same here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the Commissioner's statement regarding the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ruling merely asserts that the Commission did not participate in the case and it may be appealed. It does not express any specific position with respect to the underlying issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Playtika cites out-of-circuit cases holding that virtual coins are not a \"thing of value,\" these merely persuasive authorities must be rejected in light of the Ninth Circuit's holding. In fact, the Ninth Circuit already rejected these cases itself, stating that they involve \"different state statutes, state definitions, and games.\"\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With Playtika's ammunition thus depleted without success, the Court must follow the binding ruling in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    c. Whether Players \"Lose\" such that Recovery is Possible\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Just as it rehashes the \"thing of value\" issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   , Playtika also re-argues that Wilson cannot recover \"the value of the thing ... lost\" under RCW \u00a7 4.24.070 because he did not \"lose\" anything. However, this argument rises or falls on the strength of Playtika's prior argument that its coins are not valuable because they are periodically given out for free. Because this argument has failed, it follows that Wilson did in fact lose something of value by playing Playtika's games and may now recover its value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516483\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/784/#p785\">\n    886 F.3d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    d. Whether Playtika's Games are \"Bona Fide Business Transactions\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Playtika also argues that its games are exempt from the statutory prohibition on gambling because they fall within the \"bona fide business transaction\" exception. This exception reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Tabular or graphic material set at this point is not displayable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   RCW \u00a7 9.46.0237. According to Playtika, its games involve \"bona fide business transactions\" because players merely pay for the privilege of entertainment. The fact that players do not know how much entertainment they will receive does not make their games any different from buying tickets to a baseball game, which could go into extra innings or end relatively quickly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Wilson responds that \u00a7 9.46.0237 contains a non-exhaustive list after \"bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts\" that identifies the purchase of securities and insurance as two examples. Wilson contends that, applying Washington principles of statutory interpretation, the exception should be limited to\n   transactions similar to insurance and securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   When construing a state statute, a federal court must apply that state's principles of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v.

To determine what constitutes a \"similar\" item, courts look to the \"clearly stated legislative intent\" behind the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n    at 741-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, the list clearly contemplates excluding purchases of securities or other investments and insurance. Buying virtual coins is not \"similar in nature\" to either of these transactions because the buyer is not protecting themselves against a fortuitous risk or obtaining a stake in a company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Playtika argues that \"bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts\" is a broad category that unambiguously includes the sale of credits used for amusement games. In support of this, Playtika points to RCW \u00a7 9.46.010, which states that the Washington Gambling Act seeks to \"avoid restricting participation by individuals in activities and social pastimes.\" However, the rest of this sentence limits the types of social pastimes to those that are \"more for amusement rather than for profit, do not maliciously affect the public, and do not breach the peace.\" RCW \u00a7 9.46.010. While the wording is ambiguous regarding\n   <em>\n    whose\n   </em>\n   profit is at issue, Playtika certainly profits from its games and Wilson would argue that they have a malicious effect on the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In any case, Playtika misconstrues the \"transaction\" that is at issue in this case. Whereas traditional gambling consists of a single transaction (money for a chance to win), Playtika's games divvy up this process between two transactions. The first is the purchase of virtual coins using real money, and the second is exchanging these coins for an opportunity to win more of them. This second transaction is what Wilson alleges is gambling, which is defined as \"staking or risking something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the person's control or influence.\" RCW \u00a7 9.46.0237. Consequently, regardless of whether purchasing coins from Playtika is similar to buying tickets to a baseball game, using those coins to play Playtika's games is not a \"bona fide business transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    e.

Playtika supports this proposition with a statement from the declaration of PHC's Chief Financial Officer. Dkt. # 41, \u00b6 4. However, the Court cannot consider this declaration at the dismissal stage, and Playtika has alleged that PHC owns and operates the games at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Dkt. # 1, \u00b6 24. If PHC truly does not own, operate, or benefit from Playtika's games, it should be easy to dismiss them on summary judgment.

R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The question, then, is whether the class allegations change this outcome. They do. The defining feature of class actions is the plaintiff's ability to assert claims on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated. It necessarily follows from this that the plaintiff will claim damages for harms that they themselves did not suffer, with the operative issue being whether those other harms are sufficiently similar to theirs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, Wilson alleges that all of Playtika's games \"function[ ] in a substantially similar fashion\" by allowing players to buy and spend virtual coins for a chance to win more coins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Dkt. # 1, at 7. As previously noted, the heart of this case sounds in contract, so whether or not Wilson's specific harm is \"typical\" of the class will turn on how the transactions he entered into with Playtika compare with the rest of the class. It will not necessarily turn on which specific games Wilson played, except to the extent the games function differently such that Wilson entered into different types of transactions than some of the class members. In any case, that question should be addressed at the class certification stage, since there is no indication at this point that VDS functions so uniquely that the allegations related to that game are \"immaterial.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, Playtika argues that all claims related to House of Fun should be stricken because no Defendant owns, offers, or operates that game.
