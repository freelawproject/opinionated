MOORER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Defendant City of Mobile filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support, (Docs. 89 &amp; 90), a reply brief in support, (Doc. 104), a response and supporting documents to Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, (Docs. 100 &amp; 101), and a response in opposition to Plaintiffs' sur-reply, (Doc. 110). Plaintiffs Thai Meditation Association of Alabama, Inc., Sivaporn Nimityongskul, Varin Nimityongskul, Serena Nimityongskul, and Prasit Nimityongskul have filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support, (Docs. 91 &amp; 94), a reply brief in support (Doc. 106), a response and supporting documents to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Docs. 97 &amp; 98), and a sur-Reply in opposition to Defendant's motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 112). For the reasons stated below, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is due to be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is due to be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter arises out of the Defendant's denial of Plaintiffs' zoning applications to construct a Buddhist meditation center in a residential district. The Complaint asserts seven counts: (1) Defendant imposed and implemented land use regulations, both on their face and as applied, in a manner that places a substantial burden on Plaintiffs' religious exercise in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a) ; (2) Defendant imposed and implemented land use regulations, both on their face and as applied, in a manner that discriminates against Plaintiffs on the basis of religion and religious denomination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(2) ; (3) Defendant imposed and implemented land use regulations, both on their face and as applied, in a manner that treats Plaintiffs on terms that are less than equal to nonreligious assemblies in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(1) ; (4) Defendant has deprived Plaintiffs of their right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (5) Defendant has deprived Plaintiffs of their right to equal protection under the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (6) Defendant imposed and implemented land use regulations, both on their face and as applied, in a manner that places a burden on Plaintiffs' religious exercise in violation of Article I, \u00a7 3.01 of the Alabama Constitution ; and (7) Defendant has negligently misrepresented facts relating to Plaintiffs' zoning classification in violation of Alabama state law. (Doc. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant filed a motion to dismiss certain parts of the Complaint. (Doc. 18). The Court granted in part Defendant's motion to dismiss as to the facial components of Counts 1, 2, and 3. (Doc. 31). Defendant's motion to dismiss as to Count 7 was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties subsequently filed cross motions for summary judgment-Defendant's motion on all counts, and Plaintiffs' motion on Counts 1 through 6. Each party briefed their position and provided evidentiary support thereof to the Court. This matter is now ripe for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiffs Sivaporn Nimityongskul (\"Nimit\"), Varin Nimityongskul (\"V. Nimit\"), Serena Nimityongskul (\"S. Nimit\"), and Prasit Nimityongskul (\"P. Nimit\") (collectively, \"the Nimit Plaintiffs\") purchased property located at 2354 and 2410 Eloong Drive (\"the Eloong property\") for the primary purpose of constructing a Buddhist meditation center on the site. (Doc. 92-4; Doc. 92-29; Doc. 92-30, p. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 12-22). Plaintiff Thai Meditation Association of Alabama, Inc., (\"TMAA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   has a leasehold interest in the Eloong property. (Doc. 92-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2015, Nimit submitted an application to the City of Mobile Planning Commission (\"the Planning Commission\") for Planning Approval, Planned Unit Development (\"PUD\"), and Subdivision Approval (collectively, the \"Applications\" or \"Plaintiffs' Applications\") to permit TMAA's development on the Eloong property. (Doc. 93-21). In the Applications, Plaintiffs sought construction of a 2,400-square foot meditation center building, a 2,000-square foot cottage for visiting monks, a 600-square foot restroom facility, and associated parking. (Doc. 93-22). The Planning Commission ultimately denied Plaintiffs' Applications, and the Mobile City Council (\"the City Council\") denied Plaintiffs' appeal, upholding the Planning Commission's decision. (Doc. 92-20, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Zoning Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Chapter 64 of the Code of the City of Mobile, Alabama (\"the Zoning Ordinance\") divides Mobile into fifteen zoning districts, identified in Section 64-3 of the Zoning Ordinance. (Doc. 92-12, pp. 20-53). Section 64-3 of the Zoning Ordinance sets forth the specific regulations governing the applicable districts and delineates uses permitted by right and uses requiring planning approval.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 22-53, 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, before a church or religious facility may locate in a residential area, the Planning Commission must determine if the facility's location would be in harmony with, and appropriate for, the residential district.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Eloong Property is located in an R-1 Residential District (\"R-1 District\"). (Doc. 93-1). R-1 Districts are composed of primarily \"one-family dwellings and small open areas ... where residential development seems likely to occur.\" (Doc. 92-12, p.22). Churches and schools are permitted with Planning Approval in R-1 Districts because Defendant wishes to encourage suitable neighborhood environments for families.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Plaintiffs sought to build a religious facility in an R-1 District, they were required to apply for Planning Approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Religious Beliefs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   TMAA is a Buddhist religious organization. (Doc. 93-24, p. 1).

(Doc. 93-75 \u00b6\u00b6 14-16). TMAA's religious exercise includes \"prayer, meditation, various religious ceremonies, lectures, teaching and learning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While there are many different schools of Buddhism, TMAA engages in the meditation technique known as\n   <em>\n    Dhammakaya\n   </em>\n   meditation, which is practiced by thousands of temples in Thailand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 13, 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Meditation sessions at TMAA are led by either monks or lay teachers trained in Dhammakaya meditation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs believe \"Shakyamuni Buddha, the founder of the Buddhist religion, achieved his great spiritual insights as a result of years of meditation, and he taught that mediation is central to following his teachings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Every week, TMAA offers four meditation classes with talks on Buddhist scriptures and morality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant, however, questions Plaintiffs' meditation practice as religious exercise. (Doc. 100, p. 3). Defendant bases its viewpoint on various public announcements, in which Plaintiffs explained why religion is not important for meditation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 92-16). For instance, in a 2010 article published by AL.com, Nimit explained, \"[T]his meditation center was established in order to teach people how to find inner peace and happiness. My ultimate mission is to spread world peace through inner peace, and have people see that mediation is not to be associated with any one particular, race, culture, and religion ....\" (Doc. 92-16, p. 7). TMAA also holds itself out to be a non-profit, non-religious organization on social media and other website directories.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 14-15. Furthermore, in her deposition, Nimit agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The great thing about meditation is that philosophy/religious belief is not important. Meditation is about consciousness. The beliefs of the mind become trivial. You dive deep into the heart of the matter to gain access to your soul - your inner reality. Therefore, meditation can be practiced by people of different religions or no religion at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc. 101-2, pp. 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs assert they describe their meditation practices as \"non-religious\" because TMAA is open to all, and \"following Buddhist teachings does not require rejection of the particular theistic concepts that are central to Judeo-Christian notions of what is meant by 'religion.' \" (Doc. 94, p. 5). In fact, both the Planning Commission and City Council heard testimony to this effect at the hearings in front of each body. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 92-19, p. 18) (\"The meditation [center] has elicited itself on Facebook and other social media as non-religious to indicate that one does not have to be Buddhist in order to come learn meditation.\"); Doc. 93-34, p. 12 (\"Buddhist liberation is essentially tied to meditation and meditation practice.\"). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs' religious beliefs were questioned throughout the processing of the Applications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 92-19; Doc. 93-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Location History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   TMAA began in 2007 at a home located at 4567 Airport Boulevard, Mobile, Alabama. (Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 23). The home provided housing for a Buddhist monk who taught meditation classes there.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In August 2007, a citizen complained to Defendant that Plaintiffs had posted a sign that advertised services that were provided inside of the home. (Doc. 93-10, p. 1). A City Inspector came to the home and informed Nimit the sign was not permitted and must be removed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nimit removed the sign, and the inspector issued a Notice of Violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 1-2. The Notice gave Plaintiffs ten days to either cease the violation or apply for Planning Approval.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 14, 2007, Plaintiffs applied for Planning Approval to continue offering meditation services at the home. (Doc. 93-12). The application received tremendous community opposition, and many neighbors came to the Planning Commission hearing to oppose the application. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 85; Doc. 32 \u00b6 85). Similar to the Applications at issue in this case, opposition to Plaintiffs' application for the Airport Boulevard home targeted both legitimate community concerns as well as Plaintiffs' religious beliefs. For instance, one resident wrote a letter stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   There is no concern on their part for the welfare of children growing up in this quiet area, no thought given to the additional traffic and the danger it represents, and no concern for the loss of property value that we will all suffer because of their unwanted intrusion .... While serving with the Air Force in Vietnam many years ago I had the occasion to visit Thailand, where there are countless temples, and the streets are filling with Buddhist priests, wearing their colorful, orange robes. It was a quaint sight, but I had no desire to bring one back to my neighborhood, and install him there .... We do not want a meditation center, a non-sectarian church, a dental clinic, a service station, a bingo palace, or anything that is alien to family life intruding upon the citizens of this area ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Doc. 93-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 1, 2007, the Planning Commission recommended denial of Plaintiffs' application based on concerns regarding the possibility for future rezoning or use variance requests, and the lack of compliance with the parking surface, maneuvering, tree and landscaping, and buffering requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. 93-13, p. 3). The Planning Commission's Staff Report explained, \"[T]he meditation center would likely be a relatively 'quiet' neighbor and might generally be conducive to location in a residential area. However, as parking improvements and, most likely, building code improvements would be required to accommodate the proposed use, the general compatibility appears to be less favorable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs later withdrew their application. (Doc. 93-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2009, Plaintiffs relocated TMAA to its current site at 3821 Airport Boulevard, Mobile, Alabama. (Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 6). The current site is located in a shopping center on a busy street.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs assert its current location creates significant hardships for their religious exercise because their meditation practice requires a serene environment, they lack sufficient space for visiting monks and overnight retreats, and participants have encountered safety issues while attending classes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 10-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant, however, asserts Plaintiffs' proposed meditation center would not alleviate Plaintiffs' size concerns because it is only 200 square feet larger than its current location, and Plaintiffs own numerous homes throughout the city where they could host visiting monks. (Doc. 100, p. 7). Additionally, Defendant asserts Plaintiffs have received 100 acres of viable land where they could host their meditation activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs aver they received approximately 100 acres of donated land in November 2014 for the purpose of building a meditation center. (Doc. 92-30, pp. 41-44; Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 25). However, after investigating the property and consulting with their land use professional, Plaintiffs found the donated acreage was not a feasible location. (Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 26). Thus, Plaintiffs began searching for other property suitable for their meditation practices, and they discovered the Eloong Property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History of Plaintiffs' Applications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 24, 2015, Plaintiffs attended a predevelopment meeting with their attorney and realtor, Bill Youngblood (\"Youngblood\"), and two City of Mobile Planners, Bert Hoffman (\"Hoffman\") and Marie Cross York (\"York\") to discuss the possibility of relocating TMAA to the Eloong property.

The purpose of a pre-development meeting is for Defendant to gather information from applicants or potential applicants about what they are proposing to do at a specific location. (Doc. 93-5, p. 3). Additionally, Defendant provides applicants information about the process they must go through in order to obtain approvals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant reviews,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the district in which applicants wish to locate and whether the property is a legal lot of record.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, if an applicant's proposed use is not permitted in the district, in which the property is zoned, Defendant would inform the applicant of such at the predevelopment meeting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at p. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   At the predevelopment meeting for Plaintiffs' potential Applications, the discussion centered around concerns about construction as well as the religious nature of their proposed meditation. (Doc. 93-25, p. 9). Following the meeting, Defendant concluded Plaintiffs' Applications would need the following approvals: \"(1) Planning Approval for worship related use; (2) PUD because of a second habitable structure on the property; (3) Subdivision; and (4) Variance for non-paved parking and maneuvering.\" (Doc. 93-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 11, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted the Applications to construct a meditation center on the Eloong property.

The Planning Commission issued the first Staff Report for Plaintiffs' Applications on October 15, 2015, which noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The applicant is requesting Planning Approval to allow a meditation center in an R-1, Single-Family Residential District, Planned Unit Development approval to all multiple buildings on a single building site, and Subdivision approval to create one legal lot of record.

The documentation included TMAA's articles of incorporation, tax documentation, letters from Buddhist monks, letters from the Dhammakaya Foundation, and a letter from Eric Loomis, an associate professor of Philosophy, explaining the centrality of meditation to the Buddhist religion. (Doc. 93-29, pp. 3-5; Doc. 93-24; Doc. 93-34, pp. 10-12). TMAA's articles of incorporation state, \"The corporation has been organized for ... teaching and research into growth and development of mind and spirit through meditation and to expand the knowledge of Buddhism.\" (Doc. 93-24). Upon receipt of the items, Hoffman consulted\n   Anderson to further evaluate Plaintiffs' religious status. (Doc. 93-45).

A second email to Councilman Small, however, touched on the religious nature of Plaintiffs' meditation center. (Doc. 93-36, p. 1).

Additionally, TMAA was referred to as an interested party throughout the paperwork and proceedings before the Planning Commission and City Council, and Plaintiffs' Applications specifically requested using the property as a meditation center. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 92-7). Defendant's assessment of TMAA's ability to bring suit is contrary to the purpose of the doctrine of standing: it \"is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court.\" 59 AM. JUR. 2D Parties \u00a7 29 (2018). All of the Plaintiffs in this case have a legally protected interest in the Eloong property, they were all injured by Defendant's denial of planning approval, and a favorable decision by this Court will redress their harm. Thus, TMAA has standing under Article III to bring suit against Defendant. Furthermore, based on the foregoing reasons, TMAA, also, meets the requirements of standing for purposes of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendant regulates land use within its jurisdiction, in part, through its Zoning Ordinance. (Doc. 92-12, p. 6). The Zoning Ordinance states a \"church or religious facility: including parish house, community house and educational buildings\" is \"allowed by right\" in business districts but requires \"Planning Approval\" to locate in R-1 residential districts. (Doc. 92-12, p. 146). Planning Approval is a process by which Defendant determines \"uses that may be appropriate in certain districts at certain locations, but not in all locations.\" (Doc. 93-3, p. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 20-23). \"The review required for Planning Approval examines the applicant's location and site plan with regard to transportation, parking and access, public utilities and facilities, traffic congestion and hazard, and to determine if the proposal is in harmony with the orderly and appropriate development of the district.\" (Doc. 92-13, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant's assessment procedures for Planning Approval ultimately result in a case-by-case evaluation for the proposed activity for each church or religious facility.\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n    366 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The mere fact that the Zoning Ordinance distinguishes \"uses allowed by right\" from \"uses requiring planning approval\" is evidence that each proposed activity is individually assessed against an existing land use regulation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 92-12, p. 137).

Defendant Has Not Imposed a Substantial Burden on Plaintiffs' Religious Exercise\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In pertinent part, RLUIPA's \"substantial burden\" provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation in a manner that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person, including a religious assembly or institution, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person, assembly, or institution - (A) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (B) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(a)(1). The question of \"substantial burden\" is a \"question of law for courts to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    Eternal World Television Network, Inc. v.

Because the alleged burden in this case results from the application of the Zoning Ordinance, the Court must determine whether the Zoning Ordinance, or its implementation, involves \"religious exercise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Under RLUIPA, \"the term 'religious exercise' includes any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-5(7)(A). Additionally, \"[t]he use, building, or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered to be religious exercise of the person or entity that uses or intends to use the property for that purpose.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-5(7)(A). \"In passing RLUIPA, Congress recognized that places of assembly are needed to facilitate religious practice, as well as the possibility that local governments may use zoning regulations to prevent religious groups from using land for such purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n    366 F.3d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court's initial inquiry into a substantial burden claim under RLUIPA is whether Plaintiffs are engaged in the exercise of religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the proposed use for the Eloong property is \"primarily as a residence, but it will also be used as a meditation center with meditation sessions approximately 3 times a week and an estimated attendance of about 25 people per session.\" (Doc. 92-9, p. 5). The meditation center's mission is \"to help spread Dhammakaya meditation,\" (Doc. 92-30, p. 63 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6), which is \"the biggest Buddhist sect in Thailand.\" (Doc. 92-30, p. 88 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). Additionally, Plaintiffs propose constructing a cottage on the property for \"visiting religious clergymen.\" (Doc. 92-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendant, however, contends Plaintiffs' meditation practice is not religious exercise. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 100, p. 3 \u00b6 5). In support of its argument, Defendant provides evidence of Nimit conveying, \"[M]editation is not to be associated with any one particular race, culture, and religion,\" and TMAA \"does not promote any religion.\" (Doc. 92-16, p. 7). Nimit, also, agrees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The great thing about meditation is that philosophy/religious belief is not important. Meditation is about consciousness. The beliefs of the mind become trivial. You dive deep into the heart of the matter to gain access to your soul - your inner reality. Therefore, meditation can be practiced by people of different religions or no religion at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Doc. 101-2, pp. 6-7). Additionally, Defendant references individuals (specifically neighbors of the Eloong property) who dispute TMAA as a religious facility. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 90, pp. 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 93-33 (referencing an email from resident Esham to City Councilman C.J. Small in which Esham begins by stating, \"In keeping you\n   apprised of the Meditation Center's business activities ....\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs assert they have described their meditation activity as \"non-religious\" because TMAA \"is open to all and that following Buddhist teachings does not require rejection of the particular theistic concepts that are central to Judeo-Christian notions of what is meant by 'religion.' \" (Doc. 94, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The key language in RLUIPA's broad interpretation of religious exercise is Plaintiffs' exercise does not have to be \"compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-5(7)(A). It is clear that building a center with the alleged purpose of teaching Dhammakaya meditation falls squarely within RLUIPA's definition of \"religious exercise.\" Accordingly, the Court's inquiry turns to whether or not Defendant has imposed a substantial burden upon Plaintiffs' free exercise of religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"[T]he plaintiff shall bear the burden of persuasion on whether the law (including a regulation) ... substantially burdens the plaintiff's exercise of religion.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-2(b).

Plaintiffs contend:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The current location is so noisy that sirens, other road noise, and noise from passersby can be heard in the mediation room and interrupts the concentration of those attempting to meditate. The Center cannot host monks because there is not sufficient space for them, given their particular religious needs, which limits their religious practices. The current location has also posed safety concerns, as the donation box has been stolen twice, and attendees have had their cars broken into.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   (Doc. 94, p. 33). Plaintiffs, also, note churches and religious facilities are only \"permitted by right\" in business districts, which create the same issues as their current location. (Doc. 106, p. 15). Unlike the congregations in\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs claim the Eloong property has religious significance because they \"need a quiet, serene environment\" to practice meditation. (Doc. 94, p. 37). Additionally, Plaintiffs contend an alternate location is unavailable because the 106-acre donated property is not a \"ready alternative,\" according to their land development professional. (Doc. 106, p. 16). Moreover, because the donated property is, also, zoned in an R-1 district and surrounded by residential uses, Plaintiffs argue\n   they \"need not waste further resources attempting to use an inadequate property which will likely be denied, and where there will again be a substantial likelihood of neighborhood opposition, even if there is some remote possibility of being approved.\" (Doc. 106, p. 17). Furthermore, in 2007, Defendant took issue with the Center's location on a major road but now suggests the Center would not be suitable on a minor road. (Doc. 94, p. 38). \"The City's actions have 'to a significantly great extent lessened the prospect of [Plaintiffs] being able to construct a [meditation center] in the future ....' \" (Doc. 94, p. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendant, however, asserts it has not exerted pressure that has forced Plaintiffs to forego their religious precepts. (Doc. 90, p. 27). It contends complaints of outside noise distracting members \"are insufficient to constitute a Substantial Burden as such distraction cannot be said to violate Plaintiffs' religious precepts.\" (Doc. 104, p. 7). Additionally, Defendant asserts lack of housing for visiting monks does not rise to such a level because \"there is no pressure on Plaintiffs to violate religious precepts and, as shown by their deposition testimony, Plaintiffs own several different homes in the city which could serve such housing needs.\" (Doc. 104, p. 7). Defendant, also, contests Plaintiffs' assertion of inadequate space: \"Plaintiffs practice meditation in such a location at 3821 Airport Boulevard which consists of roughly 2,200 square feet - nearly the same size as the 2,400 square foot meditation center building proposed for the Eloong property,\" (Doc. 90, p. 28). Defendant argues Plaintiffs continue practicing meditation in the same manner they were practicing before they submitted their Applications for the Eloong property. (Doc. 90, p. 28). Defendant, also, notes Plaintiffs hold meditation events at their current location and at other locations within the City of Mobile. (Doc. 90, p. 28). Furthermore, Defendant argues denying Plaintiffs' application to locate on a major road in 2007 and a minor road in 2015 \"shows uniform reluctance to grant planning approval to non-residential uses in an established, single-family neighborhood.\" (Doc. 104, p. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   While Plaintiffs have presented substantial arguments detailing the inadequacies of their current location against the suitability of the Eloong property, the Court is not merely concerned in comparing the shortfalls of one property to the sufficiency of the other. The Court must determine whether Defendant's application of the Zoning Ordinance has imposed significant pressure that has required Plaintiffs to forego their religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Unlike the Plaintiff Congregations in\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs argue the Eloong property has religious significance. However, the Eleventh Circuit explained the religious significance of the property must be \"such that their faith requires a [center] at\n   <em>\n    this particular\n   </em>\n   site.\"\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n    366 F.3d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate this. Plaintiffs allege their religious exercise requires them to locate in a quiet and serene area. Such qualities, however, are also attributable to various properties, especially those located in residential areas. Because Plaintiffs' religious significance argument is intertwined with overly common general characteristics of land, they must present evidence of land use characteristics specifically unique to\n   <em>\n    this particular\n   </em>\n   site. For instance, Plaintiffs do not argue they are unable to locate on the 106-acre donated property because it does not possess religiously significant qualities of serenity and quietness. They simply argue it is not a ready alternative. Thus, Plaintiffs' religion could require them to locate at either site. Similarly, Plaintiffs' reasoning for the religious significance of the Eloong property may, also, be used to claim religious significance of other properties, especially those in R-1 districts. Accordingly,\n   Plaintiffs' ability to flexibly argue such a requirement is not proof that their religion\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   them to locate at\n   <em>\n    this particular\n   </em>\n   site. While RLUIPA offers broad protection to religious exercise, it does not entitle Plaintiffs to establish a meditation center anywhere they want.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs, also, argue they lack sufficient space to host monks at their current location. (Doc. 94, p. 34). They assert monks live by a strict code of conduct, so they cannot share a room with non-monks or be housed in the same building as women. (Doc. 93-75 \u00b6\u00b6 44; 65). Because there is not adequate space at TMAA's current location for separate housing, Plaintiffs argue they are unable to host traveling monks for their overnight retreats or keep resident monks for meditation classes. (Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 16). Defendant, however, maintains Plaintiffs own several single-family homes within the City of Mobile that could provide housing for the monks. (Doc. 100, p. 45). Yet, Plaintiffs contend requiring participants to leave the retreats breaks the meditative atmosphere, further inhibiting their religious exercise. (Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Though Defendant does not attempt to respond to the fact that breaking the meditative atmosphere of retreats inhibits Plaintiffs' religious exercise, the Court, nevertheless, finds Plaintiffs' inability to host monks does not amount to a substantial burden. While TMAA holds meditation classes multiple times a week, overnight retreats are occasional, two to three times a year. (Doc. 92-30, p. 11 \u00b6\u00b6 15-22). Accordingly, TMAA refers to retreats as \"special activities\" that \"feature experienced instructors and discourses on Buddhism.\" (Doc. 93-78, p. 4). While the Court rejects Defendant's \"anywhere but here\" argument regarding Plaintiffs' ability to house monks in a different location, it is, nevertheless, evident Plaintiffs' inability to host monks is, at most, an inconvenience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs, also, assert the current location has presented safety issues. (Doc. 94, p. 34). While sympathetic to Plaintiffs' concerns, safety is not a matter that implicates religious exercise. In sum, Plaintiffs' arguments are not consistent with the Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent previously discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition to Eleventh Circuit precedent, Plaintiffs present persuasive authority from other Circuits' interpretation of the Substantial Burden provision. (Doc. 94, p. 35). The Fourth Circuit has concluded, \"When a religious organization buys property reasonably expecting to build a church, governmental action impeding the building of that church may impose a substantial burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Bethel World Outreach Ministries v. Montgomery Cnty. Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n    706 F.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557 (4th Cir. 2013). Plaintiffs argue a strong comparison can be made between the facts of this case to the facts of the\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   case. (Doc. 98, p. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   , a large religious institution, Bethel World Outreach Ministries, held multiple worship services at two different locations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n    706 F.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The church sought to build a new location because the size of their current facilities restricted the lengths of their services, which did not allow Communion to be held until after the services; limited their ability to have \"Alter Calls,\" which allowed attendees to dedicate their lives to Christ, join the church, or make prayer requests; caused the church to face overcrowding, which sometimes prevented worshippers from entering; and lacked the facilities to host other religious, educational, and counseling programs.\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n    706 F.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To alleviate their problems, the church applied to construct an 800-seat church on a 119-acre agricultural reserve.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n    at 553-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the county did not contest the fact that other churches were permitted in the same zone where Bethel's proposed property was located.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Fourth Circuit concluded a reasonable fact finder could find the county's actions imposed a substantial burden on the church's exercise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court, also, found it significant the county completely prevented the Plaintiffs from constructing any church on the property, rather than imposing limitations on the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048896\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/548/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs contend, similar to\n   <em>\n    Bethel\n   </em>\n   , they reasonably expected to use the Eloong property because: (1) the Zoning Ordinance encourages religious uses in R-1 districts; (2) the property could easily accommodate their use; and (3) there were no land use impacts that would justify denial. (Doc. 94, p. 36). However, Defendant argues, \"Nimit also knew from her past experience that such approval was not assured, having been recommended for denial the last time she sought planning approval to convert a single-family home in a neighborhood to a meditation center.\" (Doc. 100, p. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This Court is cautious to concur with Plaintiffs' reasoning under their \"reasonable expectation\" argument. Under their line of reasoning, concluding Defendant imposed a substantial burden would be to essentially grant an automatic exemption to religious organizations from discretionary land use regulations. A fundamental role of local governments in zoning matters is to evaluate whether a religious organization's use can be accommodated in the area in which it seeks to locate. To strip a municipality of that determinative power would be to usurp a central function of local government and, in effect, impermissibly favors religious uses over secular uses. RLUIPA should not be interpreted in a way that undermines the legitimate responsibility of local governments in implementing land use regulations. Thus, the Court does not agree with Plaintiffs' \"reasonable expectation\" argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs argue, based on the Ninth Circuit's line of reasoning, \"(1) that [Defendant's] broad reasons given for its tandem denials could easily apply to all future applications by [Plaintiffs]; and (2) that [Plaintiffs] readily agreed to every mitigation measure suggested by the Planning Division ....\" (Doc. 94, p. 37) (citing\n   <em>\n    Guru Nanak Sikh Soc'y of Yuba City v.

(Doc. 100, p. 49). In\n   <em>\n    Guru Nanak\n   </em>\n   , a Sikh non-profit organization was denied a conditional use permit (\"CUP\") to construct a temple in a residential area.\n   <em>\n    Guru Nanak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n    456 F.3d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The denial was based on citizens' voiced fears that the resulting noise and traffic would interfere with the existing neighborhood.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n    at 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One year later, the organization was again denied a CUP to construct a temple in a large, agricultural district.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n    at 983-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit determined the Planning Division had imposed a substantial burden because \"[t]he net effect of the County's two denials ... is to shrink the large amount of land theoretically available to Guru Nanak.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n    at 991-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendant differentiates this case based on the following facts: (1) Plaintiffs' Applications for planning approval were submitted eight years apart for two separate properties (Airport Boulevard in 2007 and the Eloong property in 2015); (2) both of the properties in this case were zoned R-1; (3) both of the properties were historically used as single-family residences; (4) both of the properties are in the middle of established single-family residential neighborhoods; and (5) both applications attempted\n   to convert the properties to the assembly-type use of a meditation center. (Doc. 100, p. 49). Moreover, Defendant contends it has never discouraged Plaintiffs' practices at their current, established location. (Doc. 100, p. 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Before Plaintiffs moved to their current location, they provided meditation services at a home on Airport Boulevard. (Doc. 94, p. 6). Because Plaintiffs used signage to advertise their meditation services at the home, Defendant issued a notice of violation on August 30, 2007, ordering Plaintiffs to take the sign down within ten days or apply for planning approval. (Doc. 93-10, pp. 1-2). Plaintiffs removed the sign and subsequently applied for Planning Approval on September 14, 2007. (Doc. 93-12). On November 1, 2007, the Planning Commission recommended denial of Plaintiffs' application because the proposed use and modifications could preclude future single-family residential use to the site, and set the stage for future zoning and variance requests, and Plaintiffs' site plan did not reflect compliance with parking surface and maneuvering requirements, tree and landscaping requirements, and buffering requirements. (Doc. 93-13, p. 3). While the Staff Report noted Plaintiffs would likely be a relatively \"quiet\" neighbor, the report stated parking improvements and building code improvements made TMAA's compatibility less favorable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. Furthermore, Plaintiffs' initial application was met with community opposition, including complaints about increased traffic and child safety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 93-14). Predictably, Plaintiffs moved TMAA to its current location in a shopping center on Airport Boulevard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs, now, attempt to relocate TMAA to a different residential district. However, Defendant's considerations and stated reasons for denying Plaintiffs' first application should have implied to Plaintiffs there was a possibility those same concerns would arise in their applications for the Eloong property. Plaintiffs should have been on notice compatibility would be an issue, especially since their proposed site on the Eloong property is much larger than its initial location on Airport Boulevard and their proposed construction for their Applications is on a much larger scale than the proposal on their first application. Accordingly, Plaintiffs should have known proposed parking improvements and building code improvements, especially those on a larger scale, may be unfavorable in the same zoning district for which TMAA was first deemed incompatible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Moreover, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Guru Nanak\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs have not been denied the opportunity to locate in distinctly separate districts. In order for Plaintiffs to make a comparable case to\n   <em>\n    Guru Nanak\n   </em>\n   , Defendant would have had to deny their initial location in an R-1 district and subsequently deny their attempt to relocate in a differently zoned area (i.e. a business district).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3350482\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/978/#p989\">\n    456 F.3d at 989-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The County's stated reasons for denying Guru Nanak's first application implied to Guru Nanak that it should not attempt to locate in higher density districts (two-family residence, neighborhood apartment, general apartment, and the combining district) where nearby neighbors would be similarly bothered. Accordingly, Guru Nanak proposed a smaller temple, with the same seventy-five person capacity, on a much larger parcel of agricultural land.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In light of the aforementioned standards and based on the facts presented by both parties, as a matter of law, the Court cannot conclude Plaintiffs have been substantially burdened by Defendant's denial of their Applications. Plaintiffs present persuasive authority from numerous Circuits, but the binding Eleventh Circuit's standard is whether Defendant has imposed pressure so significant as to require Plaintiffs to forego their religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n    366 F.3d at 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Plaintiffs' current location on Airport Boulevard may be less than ideal, Plaintiffs have not met the standard set in place by this Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   This Court is not insensitive to Plaintiffs' concerns that Defendant may use technicalities in the Zoning Ordinance to reject applications it deems unwanted. It is undeniable the Zoning Ordinance makes it more difficult for Plaintiffs to operate its meditation center on the property of its choice. However, the fact that a local regulation limits the geographical options of churches and religious facilities does not prove Plaintiffs have been substantially burdened in their religious exercise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Midrash\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n    366 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1227 n.11. The inconveniences imposed on Plaintiffs do not preclude them from ultimately fulfilling their religious mission through meditation as a whole or through its other various activities. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to establish a prima facie case under RLUIPA's Substantial Burden provision. Therefore, this Court is not required to reach the question of whether Defendant can justify the burden created by articulating a compelling governmental interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    2. RLUIPA - Nondiscrimination (Count 2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In Count 2, Plaintiffs allege Defendant's application of the Zoning Ordinance violated their rights under RLUIPA's Nondiscrimination provision. Both parties seek summary judgment with respect to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   RLUIPA's nondiscrimination provision provides, \"No government shall impose or implement a land use regulation that discriminates against any assembly or institution on the basis of religion or religious denomination.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc(b)(2).

(Doc. 92-16, p. 6-7). Additionally, each of the Nimit Plaintiffs co-owns a portion of the Eloong property where TMAA wishes to locate. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 93-73 \u00b6 35). Furthermore, TMAA is affiliated with the Dhammakaya school of Buddhism, the most predominant religion of Southeast Asia. (Doc. 93-74 \u00b6 4). Thus, the Plaintiffs fall within the confines of \"assemblies or institutions\" because they are a company of persons collected together to practice meditation, and they are members of an established organization. The Court's inquiry, thus, turns to whether Defendant's denial of Plaintiffs' Applications was on the basis of religion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Defendant's primary assertion is their Planning Approval decision was based on the poor compatibility of Plaintiffs' proposed meditation complex within a single-family neighborhood, not bias towards Plaintiffs' religion or practice of meditation. (Doc. 90, p. 3). While this argument supports the level of discretion Defendant claims to possess, Defendant's evaluation of Plaintiffs' Applications is riddled with inclinations of discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 92-19, p. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 9-14) (\"[I]n summary, even if this was a religious facility and they're threatening us now according to the deal with this federal religious land act, the Planning Commission still has the right and the obligation to review for planning approval to see if it is harmonious.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendant asserts the questioning of Plaintiffs' religious status stemmed from advertisements that indicated TMAA held itself out to be \"non-religious.\" (Doc. 90, p. 2). Yet, at the City Council meeting that was held on January 19, 2016, supporters of TMAA, including Nimit, explained why TMAA is considered \"non-religious,\" despite its affiliation with the Dhammakaya school of Buddhism. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 92-19). For instance, one TMAA attendee, Kent Welsh, stated, \"The meditation [center]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   has elicited itself on Facebook and other social media as non-religious in order to indicate that one does not have to be Buddhist in order to come learn meditation.\" (Doc. 92-19, p. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 6-9). Another attendee, Wilburn Jones, stated TMAA is open to \"people of various religious faiths,\" noting that he practices meditation even though he is of Roman Catholic faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 9-16. Even one of the City Council members, Bess Rich, commented on Defendant's questioning of Plaintiffs' religious status: \"But we have religious facilities all over R-1s that get expanded. I've sat on many applications and listened to them .... It just seems to me there's a double standard here because the incorporation papers clearly state it was for religious purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261451\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/1214/#p1225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at p. 47 \u00b6\u00b6 3-9. Despite hearing this testimony, as well as similar testimony at the December 2015 meeting, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 92-15), Defendant decided Plaintiffs did not deserve to be classified as a church or religious facility because they did not pass certain \"tests\" with the IRS. (Doc. 93-22, p. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The record, also, reveals other contemporary statements made at the January 2016 City Council meeting that suggest discrimination towards Plaintiffs' religion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Doug Anderson (City of Mobile Planning Department Attorney): As discussed in pre-council this morning and I think it was Councilman Small said this is apples and oranges. This is not a religious facility. The application was Meditation Center of Alabama or whatever. This is not the Baptist Church or the Episcopal Church. There were questions raised whether or not they actually qualified for that particular chart of permitted uses. That's why the issue came up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, pp. 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Bess Rich (Councilwoman): Again, traffic safety, drainage, parking on a very small footprint were arguments that opponents to the mosque's expansion raised were trumped by the threat of a religious discrimination suit. I can only draw a similar parallel to the meditation center site. The meditation center application has stated that it will be used as a religious site. The road, drainage and utility access to this meditation site may be valid concerns similar to the parking and traffic concerns of the mosque site, but the Planning Commission and this council established a precedent by not considering zoning as a criteria to approve the application of the mosque. The fear of a religious discrimination and the threat of a Justice Department lawsuit were the sole reasons the mosque expansion was approved. How can the City allow one religion and expansion and stop another religion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, pp. 73-74).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Bess Rich: I don't know where to begin with what tax papers. I don't believe the mosque was asked to present their tax papers or any other religious facility that I've witnessed expansion planning approval was ever asked. So it is a different treatment that is being presented, different benchmarks, and at all times we should be as fair and even-handed as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, p. 92 \u00b6\u00b6 13-20).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   John Lawler (Plaintiffs' Attorney representing their Applications): They may have said traffic but that is an effort to shield or cover the real reasons that they're opposed to it. That's what they're doing. I mean, ask yourself, you've seen many cases come before you where traffic was (inaudible) problem, much worse that this and it was worked out. This facility is okay in this district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, p. 66 \u00b6\u00b6 16-22).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   John Lawler: And we all know - I think we all know in our heart of hearts if this was the little church up on Riverside\n   that had decided to build a little retreat for prayer, we wouldn't be here today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, p. 70 \u00b6\u00b6 9-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Furthermore, the specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision include various emails that tend to reveal a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes. For instance, a November 23, 2015, email from Anderson to Hoffman read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   I do not think it is [religious]. This shows the IRS has given it tax exempt status as a charity or foundation - there are tests a church has to go through with the IRS to be classified as a church/religious organization. Just because meditation is part of a religion (my preacher teaches contemplative prayer) does not make the building a church or the owner a religious organization. Recommend denial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   (Doc. 93-45, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Another email exchange between Deputy Director of Planning, Richard Olsen, and Anderson and Hoffman conveyed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   Since there was discussion about regardless of determination of religious facility or not, and comparing to the Community center, recreation center: including social services, activity centers, outreach programs use, do we need to change the reasons for denial? Maybe something like below since those were the points made by the opposition that led to the decision - even though there was not really any PC discussion? Or, just leave it like it was on the agenda? Or combine the two?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   (Doc. 93-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Deposition testimony, also, revealed Defendant may have substantially departed from its normal sequence of procedure. For example, Hoffman conveyed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Q: Okay. Do you know of anyone else in the City government that's questioned whether a use is a church or religious facility?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   A: Not to my knowledge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Q: How does the planning staff determine whether an activity constitutes religious worship?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   A: It's primarily based on the application, on the applicant's statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   Q: You said primarily. Is there any secondary consideration?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   A: I don't really think that there would be. You know, the only information we'll have available is that being provided by the applicant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   (Doc. 93-5, p. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As discussed,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the information provided by the applicants in this case stated the Eloong property would be used as a religious site. (Doc. 92-19, pp. 73-74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs, also, assert Defendant normally works with applicants to mitigate impacts and allow approval, but such was not the case with their application. (Doc. 94, pp. 49-50). Defendant admits it \"usually attempts to work with applicants, religious and non-religious\" and may impose \"conditions on expansions of a non-residential use in a residential neighborhood [including] limiting hours of operation and access, requiring road improvements, buffering, and building scale.\" (Doc. 100, p. 24 \u00b6 43). However, Defendant asserts it would have imposed conditions only if the Planning Commission felt the use was appropriate for the location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 27 \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs argue Defendant has approved many Christian churches and other uses even where there had been community opposition, the use was not necessarily in harmony with the residential area, there were land use impacts and traffic issues, and the use was out of scale with the surrounding homes. (Doc. 94, p. 50). Defendant argues, however, Plaintiffs' proposed site is not similarly situated to\n   the various church uses that have been approved with planning approval in the R-1 Districts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 100, pp. 25-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   By Defendant arguing its application of the Zoning Ordinance is legitimate, it analyzes Plaintiffs' proffered comparators, which consists of other churches located in R-1 Districts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, Defendant contends some of the comparator churches' applications were approved because the existing structure was located on a small parcel of land, had previously been used as a church, and no proposal for constructing new buildings was presented. (Doc. 100, p. 27 \u00b6 47) (referring to New Home Baptist Church's 2002 application). Moreover, Defendant asserts other churches were approved in the midst of community opposition, which \"pales in comparison\" to the opposition of Plaintiffs' proposed center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 25 \u00b6 45 (referring to opposition received by Port City Church of Christ's 2005 parking lot expansion and Ashland Place UMC's amended planning approval application where each church received community opposition from only two people).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The record, also, reveals contemporary statements rebutting Plaintiffs' assertion of discrimination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   Richard Olsen (Deputy Director of Planning): The recommendation for denial was largely based on the insufficient access. The Eloong Drive is, as Mr. Small stated, 16 feet. It's recently, within the last two years, paved by not a city standard paving. It's not in real good condition. We would not recommend approval - planning [approval] for any type of facility in or on this property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   (Doc. 92-12, p 85).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   Dwayne Graham (Attorney for Various Landowners in Opposition): I can tell you that my owners are not afraid of anything and they don't misunderstand anything. They are angry about one thing and that is these false allegations of being religiously prejudiced that have been published against my people in the media and have been fostered by some people in support of this. They are angry about that because that is totally utterly false. Religion has never had anything to do with the basis of my clients and the neighborhood's opposition. We have nothing against Buddhists. We have nothing against meditation. Meditation sounds like it's perfectly fine although I would comment that this project has certainly not brought peace and tranquility to this neighborhood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, pp. 50-51).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Clark Kelly (Resident of Eloong Drive): So, you know, we would oppose this project regardless whether it were religious in nature, secular in nature, if it were a corporate retreat center or a Girl Scout camp.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   (Doc. 92-19, p. 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court recognizes the parties' competing evidence includes statements and actions taken by citizens and subordinate public officials whose liability might not ordinarily attach to a municipality.

Because these are competing motions for summary judgment, the Court necessarily applies the appropriate assumptions to each side of the contest. Ultimately, no genuine issue of material fact exists, and summary judgment is appropriate for Defendant on the similarly situated question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Alba Fishing and Hunting Club is located on Dog River at 2530 River Forest Road, approximately two miles away from the Eloong property. (Doc. 97-11, p. 1; Doc. 93-3, p. 51). It has been associated with the location since 1921, before the area was incorporated into the City of Mobile. (Doc. 97-11, p. 5). In 2006, the Club filed an application \"requesting Planning Approval, Planned Unit Development, and Subdivision Approvals to allow the expansion of an existing recreation club in an R-1, Single Family Residential district.\" (Doc. 97-11, p. 4). The application allowed the Club to replace a portion of its clubhouse damaged by Hurricane Katrina and add a membership meeting hall to the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-4.

Additionally, the existing caretaker's residence on the site was approximately 1,200 square feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In sum, the proposed site plan included three separate buildings that would total roughly 6,400-square feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The buildings would expand across two lots totaling approximately 8.5 acres.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Plaintiffs' Eloong property is also located in an R-1, Single Family Residential District along the Dog River. (Doc. 93-22, p. 1). Plaintiffs' Applications were for Planning Approval, Planned Unit Development, and Subdivision Approval to allow them to build a meditation center, cottage, and restroom facility on the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The three buildings would total 5,000-square feet. (Doc. 94, pp. 8-9). Additionally, the existing structures on the property included a 5,000-square foot home and a separate garage apartment. (Doc. 92-30, p. 20). In sum, the proposed site plan included five separate buildings that would approximately total 10,000-square feet and the buildings would expand across two lots approximately totaling 6.72 acres. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 93-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Defendant contends the Club is not a similarly situated comparator. Defendant takes issue with the Club's age of existence and its purpose for seeking planning\n   approval. (Doc. 104, p. 21). \"Such an application to repair and restore a nearly century-old part of the community which predates most of the community is hardly similarly situated to an application to build a new meditation center complex on a site historically used as a single-family residence within a single-family residential neighborhood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant, also, notes the Club was \"approved without opposition\" at its Planning Commission meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Plaintiffs, however, argue the Club is similarly situated to the Eloong property because \"it was located on the Dog River, could impact community character, was located on substandard narrow roads, and was surrounded by single family residential uses.\" (Doc. 94, p. 50). Plaintiffs, also, contend, \"It is irrelevant that [the Club]-near the subject property-was 'damaged by Hurricane Katrina' and that the 'application was approved without opposition.' \" (Doc. 106, p. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   As Plaintiffs argue, the Club and TMAA are similarly situated to the extent that they sought the same form of zoning relief from the same decision-making body under the same provisions for Planning Approval.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Primera Iglesia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3088483\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1295/#p1308\">\n    450 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Primera and the School are not similarly situated because, notably, they sought markedly different forms of zoning relief, from different decision-making bodies, under sharply different provisions of local law.\").

When an organization's use of a property predates a zoning ordinance, the organization has an expectation that it will be able to reasonably expand that use. If such an expectation is thwarted, the organization may suffer a deprivation of property without due process of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST. amend. V. In contrast, when a use does not predate the ordinance, an organization would not be afforded that same reasonable expectation of expansion. The Club fits within the former situation. TMAA does not. Furthermore, unlike Plaintiffs' use of the Eloong property, the Club was not seeking to put its property to a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   use. The Club has operated as a fishing and hunting organization at its site since 1921, and its expansion in 2006 aligned with its established use of the property. It is undeniable Plaintiffs have shown a potential comparator was treated differently in\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   respects, but Plaintiff cannot show the Club is sufficiently similarly situated to support its Equal Terms claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Because Plaintiffs failed to produce prima facie evidence of a similarly situated comparator, Plaintiffs have not met their initial burden of proof. Therefore, there is no cognizable evidence of less than equal treatment, and summary judgment is due to be granted for Defendant on Count 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Federal and State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In addition to the claims under RLUIPA, both parties contend summary judgment is due on the following federal and state law claims: the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment (Count 4), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count 5), and the Alabama Religious Freedom Amendment (Count 6). Defendant, also, contends summary judgment is due on Plaintiffs' state law claim of negligent misrepresentation (Count 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Doc. 94, p. 32). However, Plaintiffs argue they are not required to demonstrate the burden imposed on their religious exercise is \"substantial\" (as required under RLUIPA) to prove a violation of the Free Exercise Clause.

Furthermore, Plaintiffs claim Defendant's denial of their Applications is subject to strict scrutiny because the denial was an individualized assessment and was not applied in a neutral and general manner to their religious group. (Doc. 98, p. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Defendant, however, argues the Zoning Ordinance is a neutral and generally applicable law, which is subject to only rational basis scrutiny.

Defendant\n   asserts, \"There is no evidence that any provision of the Zoning Ordinance was enacted to target Plaintiffs or as a reaction to the subject application, or applied in any manner that would violate Plaintiffs' rights under the Free Exercise Clause.\" (Doc. 90, p. 36). Defendant contends Plaintiffs have misapprehended Free Exercise jurisprudence because the \"Free Exercise Clause does not inhibit enforcement of otherwise valid regulations of general application that incidentally burden religious conduct.\" (Doc. 104, p. 28) (citing\n   <em>\n    Emp't Div. v.

As demonstrated in the Court's findings under RLUIPA's Substantial Burden provision, the burdens Plaintiffs experience are nothing more than inconveniences incidental to Defendant's denial of their Applications. Defendant's denial does not restrict Plaintiffs' current religious practice but, rather, prevents a change in their religious practice. Furthermore, the Free Exercise Clause is not blanket authorization for a religious organization to build a place of worship on any property it deems ideal. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' inconveniences do not rise to a constitutionally impermissible infringement on free exercise, and summary judgment is due to be granted for Defendant on Count 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

While the language of the statute essentially reflects the language of RLUIPA's Substantial Burden provision, Plaintiffs argue against interpreting ARFA in light of the case law decided under RLUIPA because of one judge's dissent in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Snider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420740\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/447/\">\n    929 So.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Snider\n   </em>\n   involved a child custody dispute based, in part, on the mother's decision to employ biblical principals in using corporal punishment to discipline the child.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420740\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/447/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his dissent, Alabama Supreme Court Justice Parker wrote, \"The right to worship God according to the dictates of one's conscience is the most cherished star in our constitutional constellation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420740\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/447/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420740\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/447/\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While Justice Parker's dissent provides some interpretation of ARFA, there is no judicial \"explanation of how rigidly the term 'burden' is to be\n   used.\"\n   <em>\n    Presley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207146837\">\n    2014 WL 7146837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *24. Furthermore, there is little to no Alabama case law providing guidance on what the constitutional provision means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   As a preliminary matter, interpreting ARFA in light of the case law decided under RLUIPA yields the same conclusion the Court reached in Plaintiffs' federal Substantial Burden claim: Plaintiffs' claim would be unsuccessful. In the alternative, even if, as Justice Parker contends, ARFA is \"designed to be stronger than that of the Constitution of the United States,\" this Court refuses to hold a government violates ARFA when its actions incidentally burden a plaintiff's religious exercise. To hold that \"any\" burden includes those that are minimal, insignificant, or incidental is to adopt an interpretation that runs afoul of the judiciary's efforts in controlling the floodgates of litigation. The difficulty with Plaintiffs' argument is it may very well result in religious organizations seeking redress from the courts for virtually all governmental zoning decisions that produce results contrary to the organization's wishes. This broad interpretation of \"burden\" that Plaintiffs seek protection from under ARFA is simply not available in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   In conjunction with the parties' competing summary judgment motions, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental Sur-Reply addressing the parties' arguments concerning the interpretation and constitutionality of ARFA. (Doc. 112). Similar to the Court's reasoning,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant asserts in its reply brief, \"Plaintiffs' interpretation of ARFA would lead to an application violative of the Establishment Clause.\" (Doc. 104, p. 32). Plaintiffs, however, contend they have \"only restated its clear text,\" and thus, Defendant's argument is essentially a challenge to ARFA itself. (Doc. 112, pp. 3-4). This Court does not agree with Plaintiffs' reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   As support for their argument under ARFA, Plaintiffs cite Judge Parker's dissent, which claims, \"Alabama's constitutional protection of the right to worship God was designed to be stronger than that of the Constitution of the United States.\" (Doc 94, p. 32) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Snider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420740\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/447/\">\n    929 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   466 n.15 ). The Constitution of the United States, however, does not protect burdens that are only incidental to a Plaintiffs' religious exercise.\n   <em>\n    Lukumi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p532\">\n    508 U.S. at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p532\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, to argue ARFA is stronger than protections under the United States Constitution is effectively to argue ARFA could protect burdens that are only incidental to a plaintiff's religious exercise. This Court does not find that to be so. Justice Parker's dissenting opinion\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not binding precedent on the Alabama state courts nor is it binding upon the federal courts. We do not interpret Defendant's arguments as claims against ARFA's constitutionality nor do we find Plaintiffs' Sur-Reply persuasive. Thus, summary judgment is due to be granted for Defendant on Count 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Negligent Misrepresentation (Count 7)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   While Plaintiffs do not move for summary judgment on their claim of negligent misrepresentation, Defendant asserts no genuine dispute of material fact exists under the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The elements of a misrepresentation claim under Alabama law are: \"(1) a misrepresentation of material fact, (2) made willfully to deceive, without knowledge, or mistakenly, (3) which was reasonably relied on by the plaintiff under the\n   circumstances, and (4) which caused damage as a proximate consequence.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant Bank v. Talmage Kirkland &amp; Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888468\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/231/#p238\">\n    155 So.3d 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (Ala. 2014) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The basis for Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim rests in an alleged misrepresentation made by Hoffman at the April 24, 2015, predevelopment meeting. (Doc. 98, p. 45). Plaintiffs assert Hoffman told them their proposed use would be treated as a religious facility in the zoning process, and Plaintiffs reasonably relied on that representation, but this was not done, which caused harm to the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888468\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/231/#p238\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant argues there was no misrepresentation because Plaintiffs' application for planning approval was ultimately denied under the guidelines of the Zoning Ordinance. (Doc. 104, pp. 32-33). Additionally, Defendant contends Plaintiff cannot show Hoffman's alleged representation was made willfully with the intent to deceive, Plaintiffs detrimentally relied on the representation, or Plaintiffs were damaged as a proximate result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The record evidence shows Hoffman wrote an email to various City of Mobile employees on April 27, 2015, stating, in relevant part, \"We told the potential applicant that the use of the house as a meditation center would require: 1) Planning Approval for worship related use ....\" (Doc. 93-27). However, whether or not that constituted a misrepresentation is a genuine dispute of material fact. As previously determined under Plaintiffs' Nondiscrimination and Equal Protection Claims, the evidence shows a triable factual issue exists as to whether Defendant ultimately denied Plaintiffs' application under the guidelines of the Zoning Ordinance or as a result of animus towards Plaintiffs' religious beliefs. Thus, the Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, Defendant misrepresented a material fact, and Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Count 7 is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
