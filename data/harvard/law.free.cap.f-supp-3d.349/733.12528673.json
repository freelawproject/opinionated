Plaintiffs filed a Response (Doc. 191) and Defendants filed a Reply (Doc. 194). For the following reasons, the motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant OSF Healthcare System (\"OSF\") is an Illinois 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, founded by The Sisters of the\n   Third Order of St. Francis (\"St. Francis Order\"). (Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Doc. 148 at 8-9). OSF operates eleven acute care hospitals, home health care services and other health care facilities in Illinois and Michigan. OSF has defined-benefits plans covering its own direct employees (\"St. Francis Plan\") and employees of the recently-acquired St. Anthony's Health Center (\"St. Anthony's Plan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Retirement Committee for the Retirement Plan for Employees of Saint Anthony's Health Center (\"St. Anthony's Committee\") is the administrator of the St. Anthony's Plan. Defendant Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis Employees Pension Plan Administrative Committee (\"St. Francis Committee\") is the administrator of the St. Francis Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs Sheilar Smith and June Schwierjohn were employed at Saint Anthony's Health Center (\"SAHC\") until 2015 and 2016 respectively. Both are vested participants in the St. Anthony's Plan. Plaintiffs Kasandra Anton, Bonnie Bailey, and Peggy Wise were employed by OSF and are vested participants in the St. Francis Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case involves claims asserted under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), Pub.L. 93-406,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%20840\">\n    88 Stat. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as amended. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim OSF and related entities have improperly treated the St. Anthony's Plan and St. Francis Plan (collectively, \"the Plans\") as \"church plans\" exempt from the requirements of ERISA. Plaintiffs allege that as a result, OSF has failed to fund the Plans' trust accounts to the levels required under ERISA to cover all accrued benefits, that the defendants failed to follow certain notice, disclosure and managerial requirements, and that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties. (Fourth Amended Complaint, Doc. 138 at 41-56).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs also assert a claim for declaratory judgment, seeking a declaration that the church plan exemption as applied violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and is therefore unconstitutional. (Id. at 56-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   OSF is a nonprofit healthcare system. (Doc. 138, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 32). In 1880, the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis, an order of Franciscan sisters, incorporated as an Illinois nonprofit under the name \"Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis,\" with the stated objective of \"conducting hospitals\" (Doc. 150-1 at 1-6). The name of the corporation was changed to OSF Healthcare System in 1989, and the St. Francis Order formed a new Illinois nonprofit corporation named The Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis (\"STOSF\") to \"serve as an integral part of the Roman Church and to carry out its mission; [and] to carry on the corporal works of the mercy of the Roman Catholic Congregation of Sisters.\" (Declaration of Sister Diane Marie McGrew, President of OSF, Doc. 150 at \u00b6\u00b6 11; Doc. 150-1 at 10-14; Doc. 150-4 at 2-6, 26). The Sisters in the St. Francis Order are the only members of STOSF, which in turn is the sole member of OSF. (Doc. 150 at \u00b6 9; Doc. 150-3 at 3). STOSF's authority over OSF is governed by OSF's governing documents and the canonical and civil guidelines pertaining to Church properties. (Doc. 150-3 at 5). In 2014, SAHC, a nonprofit Catholic hospital operated by The Sisters of St. Francis of the Martyr of St.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   George in Thuine (\"St. George Order\"), merged into OSF with the permission of the applicable Roman Catholic Church department and the endorsement of the Bishop of Springfield. (Doc. 150 at \u00b6\u00b6 18-21; Doc. 150-6 at 11-14; Doc. 150-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   OSF requires that its President and a majority of its Board of Directors be Sisters. (Doc. 150-3 at 5, 11). All directors (including lay members) are required to meet certain qualifications, including \"Commitment to the Philosophy, Mission, Values and Vision of [STOSF,]\" and \"Commitment to uphold the Catholic Code of Ethics in all dealings and deliberations pertaining to the Board's responsibilities.\" (Id. at 5-6). Among the powers reserved to STOSF (as sole member of OSF) is the power to appoint, approve or remove OSF's chairperson, vice-chairperson, chief executive officer, president, chief medical officer/chief clinical officer, regional CEOs, and operating division presidents and CEOs. (Id. at 3-4). STOSF also has the power to \"approve the introduction or termination of value sensitive ministries or services, and to eliminate services or activities which are in conflict with the philosophy and purposes of the established ministry.\" (Id. at 5). In the event OSF is dissolved, its assets revert to STOSF. (Id. at 3). OSF is recognized as a Catholic institution in the Official Catholic Directory. (Doc. 149-7 at 6). Its bylaws provide that any Medical Staff Bylaw or Rule is invalid if it conflicts with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (\"ERDs\") promulgated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. (Doc. 150-3 at 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both Plans at issue in this case are sponsored by OSF. (Docs. 138 and 140, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57, 72-74). The St. Francis Plan has approximately 18,000 participants, and the St. Anthony's Plan has approximately 1,300 participants. (Declaration of April M. Rowe, OSF Manager of Employee Benefits, Doc. 153 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9). Sixty participants in the St. Francis Plan are employed by for-profit entities; none of the St. Anthony's Plan participants are employed by for-profit entities. (Declaration of Amanda Lowry, Vice President Controller of OSF, Doc. 159 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The St. Francis Plan is \"administered and maintained\" by the St. Francis Committee, whose members are appointed by the OSF Board of Directors (the majority of which is made up of St. Francis Order Sisters), and the majority of committee members must be Sisters. (Doc. 153-1 at 63) Currently, the Committee consists of seven voting members, four of whom are Sisters. (Doc. 150 at \u00b6 27). The Committee is designated as the Plan Administrator and has \"the power and discretion to determine all questions arising in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan.\" (Doc. 153-1 at 63-64). The Committee's determinations are considered \"conclusive and binding[.]\" (Id. at 64). The Committee also holds \"all powers necessary or appropriate to accomplish its duties under [the] Plan [and] [e]xcept as otherwise provided in [the] Plan, the Committee shall have full and complete authority, responsibility, and control in its sole and absolute discretion over the management, administration and operation of the Plan[.]\" (Id.). Those powers include the determination of eligibility to receive Plan benefits, computation and certification to OSF and the trustee of the amounts \"necessary or desirable to be contributed to the Plan,\" and the administration of the Plan's claims procedures and claims review procedures. (Id. at 64-65). Under the St. Francis Plan, benefits \"shall not be paid unless the [St. Francis Committee], in its discretion, determines that the Claimant is entitled to them.\" (Id. at 65). The Committee is separately empowered to \"adopt such rules and decisions as it deems necessary\n   or desirable.\" (Id. at 65). OSF has authority to amend the Plan, although any amendment that affects the rights, duties or responsibilities of the St. Francis Committee (other than its removal) must have the Committee's written consent. (Id. at 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The St. Anthony's Committee is similarly charged with administering the St. Anthony's Plan, and \"shall have all discretionary powers and authority necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan.\" (Doc. 153-2 at 50, 53). Its members are the same as those of the St. Francis Committee - seven voting members, four of whom are St. Francis Order Sisters. (Doc. 150 at \u00b6 27). \"Any action or determination or decision whatsoever taken or made by the [St. Anthony's Committee] in good faith shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons concerned, including but not limited to the Employer, Employees and former Employees, Participants and former Participants and their spouses and Beneficiaries.\" (Doc. 153-2 at 52). The St. Anthony's Committee is responsible for Plan interpretation, benefit determinations, the claims process, and revision of the Plan to correct errors to effectuate the intent of the Plan. (Id. at 50-53). However, the St. Anthony's Committee cannot otherwise modify the Plan without the express consent of the employer's Board. (Id. at 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on two bases: that the Plans properly qualify for the church plan exemption and are therefore not subject to the ERISA requirements which underpin the claims in Counts I-VIII; and that the church plan exemption is not unconstitutional as alleged in Count IX. Summary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party can demonstrate \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

While there are numerous areas of inquiry that Plaintiffs state they would have explored prior to the filing of summary judgment motions, those pertinent to the instant motion have been at issue from the outset of this case. Although Defendants' filed for summary judgment well before the extended discovery deadline, Plaintiffs had ample time and opportunity to conduct\n   discovery relevant to the issues raised in Defendants' motion. As such, the Motion is not premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Do the Plans Qualify for the ERISA Church Plan Exemption?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ERISA exempts \"church plans\" from its requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

Plaintiffs concede that OSF is a nonprofit organization, and that St. Anthony's Health Center was a nonprofit entity prior to its acquisition by OSF.

What remains in dispute is whether OSF is \"associated with\" the church under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The term \"associated with a church or convention or association of churches\" refers to an organization that \"shares common religious bonds and convictions with that church or convention or association of churches.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (33)(C)(iv). Here, the undisputed facts demonstrate that OSF \"shares common religious bonds and convictions\" with the Catholic Church. As previously noted, STOSF (whose membership is limited to Sisters) is the sole member of OSF. In addition to numerous references to Catholicism throughout its statements of values, OSF has incorporated Roman Catholic doctrine into its basic structure, including the qualification for directorship and the automatic invalidation of any medical bylaw or rule that conflicts with the ERDs formulated by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. OSF is listed in the Official Catholic Directory, which \"[c]ourts view ... as a public declaration by the Roman Catholic Church that an organization is associated with the Church.\"\n   <em>\n    Overall v.

This Court joins them and finds that the Plan Committees are organizations for purposes of the Court's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs challenge whether the Plan Committees actually \"maintain\" the Plans. It is undisputed that the Plan Committees are the administrators of the Plans. (Docs. 138 and 140 at \u00b6\u00b6 101-104, 106-108). Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that OSF and SAHC (presumably before the acquisition) - not the Plan Committees - actually maintain the Plans. More particularly, they argue that maintaining a Plan necessarily includes the power to modify or terminate it (powers that are at least partially reserved to OSF) as well as funding it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   These arguments were considered and rejected in\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267000\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/1213/#p1222\">\n    877 F.3d at 1224-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and by District Judge Catherine Perry of the Eastern District of Missouri in\n   <em>\n    Sanzone,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526860\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/326/795/#p805\">\n    326 F.Supp.3d at 803-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both found that the \"ordinary meaning\" approach to interpreting the term \"maintain\" is appropriate, and found that the ordinary meaning did not require the power to modify or terminate the plan in order for an entity to be said to maintain it. \"Maintain\" has several definitions in Black's Law Dictionary, the most applicable one being \"[t]o care for (property) for purposes of operational productivity or appearance; to engage in general repair and upkeep.\"\n   <em>\n    Maintain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Merriam-Webster's similarly defines \"maintain\" as \"to keep in an existing state (as of repair, efficiency, or validity)\"; \"to continue or persevere in\"; \"sustain\"; and \"to support or provide for.\"\n   <em>\n    Maintain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's II Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2002). In holding that a subcommittee did \"maintain\" the Plan in question, the\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   court concluded, \"when ERISA says that a church plan includes a plan 'maintained' by a principal-purpose organization,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (33)(C), it simply means the principal-purpose organization, as Black's says, 'cares for the plan for purposes of operational productivity.' And this is precisely the point of the Subcommittee.\"\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267000\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/1213/#p1222\">\n    877 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Plan Committees have authority over the Plans sufficient to meet the ordinary meaning of \"maintaining\" the Plans. The Committees are each given significant power and control over the interpretation of the Plans, the eligibility of claimants, entitlement to benefits, as well as rule-making authority. This degree of authority is consistent with \"caring for the Plans for purposes of operational productivity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs also suggest that the Plan Committees do not have \"primary ongoing responsibility (and potential liability) to plan participants [,]\" and therefore they do not \"maintain\" the Plans. (Doc. 191 at 18) (citing\n   <em>\n    Advocate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604690\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1652/#p1656\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1661 ). The record in this case, however, belies this suggestion. Both Plans entrust decisions about participant claims, eligibility and benefits to their respective Plan Committee, including the eligibility of an employee, beneficiary or other person to receive Plan benefits, as well as the interpretation of Plan provisions and the administration of claims procedures. The St. Francis Plan specifically states that \"Benefits under the Plan shall not be paid unless the [St. Francis Committee], in its discretion, determines that the Claimant is entitled to them.\" (Doc. 153-1 at 65). These are central responsibilities that may give rise to claims for the wrongful denial of benefits. The interpretation advocated by Plaintiffs, which necessitates the inclusion of plan funding and the power to modify or terminate the Plan, is simply too narrow. One may be appointed caretaker to maintain a property without the authority to burn it to the ground, build an addition or sell it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Are the Plan Committees Associated with a Church?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Whether the Plan Committees themselves are sufficiently associated with a church rests on ERISA's definition of the term \"associated with\"; \"shar[ing] common religious bonds and convictions with that church or convention or association of churches.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (33)(C)(iv). In that vein, the Plan Committees are tightly\n   connected with the Roman Catholic Church. They are both dominated by members of a recognized Roman Catholic religious order.

But the question is not whether the Plan Committees are doing their jobs well or excessively delegating their authority, but rather whether the structure satisfies the requirements of the church plan definition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
