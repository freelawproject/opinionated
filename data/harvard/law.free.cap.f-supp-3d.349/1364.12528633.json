For the reasons explained below, AMEC's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2015, the United States Army Corps of Engineers issued a solicitation for a construction project in Poland (the \"Project\"). Compl. \u00b6 6. Hoping to put together a proposal for the Project, AMEC asked subcontractors Crystal Steel Fabricators, Inc. and Memco, Inc. (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") to submit proposals for supplying and erecting the Project's structural steel\n   work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Plaintiffs agreed, and in September 2015, the parties entered into a contract-titled the \"Teaming Agreement\"-concerning the joint preparation and submission of a proposal for the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Teaming Agreement, attached as Ex. A to Compl. [Doc. 1-1] (\"Teaming Agreement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the terms of the Teaming Agreement, Plaintiffs promised (1) to support AMEC's proposal for the structural steel work described in its statement of work, (2) to support only AMEC in its efforts to submit a successful proposal, and (3) to give up their rights to support other bidders for the Project as well as their rights to independently bid for the Project. Compl. \u00b6 12; Teaming Agreement \u00a7 I.C, II. In exchange, AMEC promised that, if awarded a contract, it would use its best efforts to negotiate in good faith with Plaintiffs to enter a subcontract for the Project's structural steel work. Compl. \u00b6 12; Teaming Agreement \u00a7 I.D, IV. In relevant part, the Teaming Agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00a7 I.A] Prime Contractor [AMEC] shall submit, as prime contractor, a proposal for the project. Subcontractor shall support the proposal for the types of work identified in the Subcontractor Statement of Work attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (\"Exhibit 1\" or \"SOW\") ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00a7 I.C] Subcontractor agrees that it is entering into this agreement on an exclusive basis.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-20. Plaintiffs further allege that they incurred direct and indirect expenses and costs of at least $150,000.00 \"in preparing and submitting to AMEC all appropriate materials, including price proposals, pertinent to the work assigned to 'Subcontractor' described in the Statement of Work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs now bring claims against AMEC for breach of contract (Count One), promissory estoppel (Count Two), unjust enrichment (Count Three), and quantum meruit (Count Four).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The parties may want assurance that their investments in time and money and effort will not be wiped out by the other party's footdragging or change of heart or taking advantage of a vulnerable position created by the negotiation. Suppose the prospective buyer spends $100,000 on research, planning, and consultants during the negotiation, money that will have bought nothing of value if the negotiation falls through, while the seller has spent nothing and at the end of the negotiation demands an extra $50,000, threatening to cancel the deal unless the buyer consents. This would be an extortionate demand, and, as it is profoundly unclear whether it would be independently tortious, parties to a negotiation would want a contractual remedy. But they might prefer to create one in the form of a deposit or drop fee (what in publishing is called a \"kill fee\"), rather than rely on a vague duty to bargain in good faith. That is one reason why the notion of a legally enforceable duty to\n   negotiate in good faith toward the formation of a contract rests on somewhat shaky foundations, though some contracts do create such a duty, which shows that some business people want it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Venture Assocs.
