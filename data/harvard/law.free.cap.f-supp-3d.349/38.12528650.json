They do so by challenging the National Marine Fisheries Service's oversight and authorization of the American lobster fishery, an industry Plaintiffs contend contributes heavily to the whale's demise. Specifically, Plaintiffs bring suit against the Secretary of Commerce, NMFS, and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, alleging that these Defendants have violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs currently seek discovery and the admission of extra-record evidence pursuant to their two ESA counts. Defendants counter that such materials should not be considered by the Court, contending that all of Plaintiffs' claims must be examined solely on the basis of the current administrative record. The Court attempted to assist the parties in reaching a compromise on this issue, but apparently to no avail, as they continue to hold fast to their respective positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40 (Status Report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thus forced to address the merits of the discovery dispute, the Court concludes that while Plaintiffs' two APA-based counts are confined to the record, evaluation of the two ESA counts may be based on evidence beyond that scope.

Both of these claims are brought pursuant to the \"citizen-suit provision\" of the ESA, which provides that any individual may bring a civil suit \"to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency ... who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this [Act] or regulation issued under the authority thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201540\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1)(A). As relief, Plaintiffs seek to compel the Government to comply with its substantive duties to avoid jeopardy and to refrain from committing unauthorized take. In pursuit of these ends, they seek declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order directing Defendants to implement mitigation measures to protect the whales from entanglements in lobster gear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBD Compl. at 32; CLF Compl. at 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 8, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Joint Motion on the Scope of Review, requesting that the court permit discovery on their two ESA claims.

Where the sides part ways, however, is over whether Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on the citizen-suit ESA counts. Because their Motion is in large part based upon the specific provisions of the ESA under which those counts arise - namely, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9 - the Court will provide a brief statutory background before analyzing the availability of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Statutory Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ESA is \"the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation\" and \"reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the 'primary missions' of federal agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Tenn.

Agencies' obligations under \u00a7 7, however, are not fulfilled merely by engaging in this procedural consultation process. Rather, the ESA also imposes substantive requirements pursuant to the \"no-jeopardy\" provision. Under \u00a7 7, the agency has an ongoing duty to avoid jeopardy that continues regardless of the status of consultation, so long as the agency retains discretionary control over the action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cottonwood Envtl.

Plaintiffs contend that because resolving this claim requires an assessment of the \"totality of [the] circumstances with regard to Defendants' recent and ongoing actions and inactions related to right whales and the consequent likelihood of jeopardy to the species,\" Mot. at 16, an administrative record will not suffice. In support, they offer\n   examples of evidence that would be relevant to their \u00a7 7 contention but that are not contained in the administrative records from the 2014 BiOp or the 2017 fisheries determination, such as \"new scientific information showing right whales have declined[,] ... continue to be entangled in fishing gear, and may face functional extinction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.

Relatedly, Defendants take the position that, although Plaintiffs assert that there is \"no end point for the Administrative Record\" and thus request discovery, this apparent conundrum is in fact the product of \"[t]he timing of Plaintiffs' Complaints,\" which were filed \"after NMFS reinitiated consultation and commenced the Atlantic Whale Take Reduction Team process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court finds none of Defendants' arguments ultimately convincing. Although it appreciates the pragmatism and efficiency issues raised by the Government, such concerns do not obviate Plaintiffs' right to an opportunity to develop information necessary to prove their claims. As discussed below, the Court concludes that the posture of this case and the specific allegations at issue weigh in favor of permitting discovery to ensure Plaintiffs' access to such materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court begins with the implications of\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   with respect to the availability of discovery in this case. The Circuit there addressed a challenge to a Forest Service decision approving a mineral-exploration project and drilling program in Montana, which the plaintiffs alleged violated \u00a7 7 of the ESA. As noted above, the court found that \"[s]ince the ESA does not specify a standard of review, judicial review is governed by section 706 of the [APA],\" and \"the appropriate standard of review under the ESA is [thus] the arbitrary and capricious standard provided by\" that section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3634545,525708\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/685/678/\">\n    685 F.2d at 685-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court ultimately determined that the Forest Service's action did not violate \u00a7 7 as it was \"reasonable and supported by the record,\" and \"[s]ufficient evidence exists to support the [agency's] decision that the ... proposal, as modified, will not endanger the Cabinet Mountains grizzly bear population.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3634545,525708\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/685/678/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3634545,525708\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/685/678/\">\n    at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court acknowledges that the language in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   is fairly sweeping and, at first glance, may seem to stand for the principle that all ESA suits must be considered under the APA standards for review. A closer analysis of the case, however, reveals that it is not quite so broad a holding. First, as Plaintiffs note, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   in fact specifically did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   address whether it could consider documents plaintiffs in that case wanted to introduce because the materials were \"cumulative of evidence that was considered in the administrative proceedings\" and were therefore already in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains Wilderness v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3241030\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/510/1186/\">\n    510 F.Supp. 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1189 n.2 (D.D.C. 1981). As this determination indicates, the case did not squarely present the issue of the availability\n   of discovery (or lack thereof) on appeal. Rather, the Circuit was concerned with the appropriate\n   <em>\n    standard\n   </em>\n   of review to be applied - a concept distinct from the question of the permissible\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the record before the district court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Watersheds Project v. Kraayenbrink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088550\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/472/#p497\">\n    632 F.3d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497-98 (9th Cir. 2011) (relying on expert reports submitted by plaintiffs to determine whether federal agency considered relevant factors in evaluating ESA citizen-suit claim alleging violation of \u00a7 7(a)(2) under arbitrary-and-capricious standard);\n   <em>\n    Or.

Tidwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038073\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/716/982/#p987\">\n    716 F.Supp.2d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 987-88 (D. Or. 2010) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, there are meaningful distinctions between the claims presented in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   and those raised in this case. As discussed in more depth below, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   , unlike those here, did not bring a claim under \u00a7 9 of the ESA. In addition, the agency actions involved are very different. Here, Plaintiffs claim that the agency is \"violating [its] ongoing obligation under ESA Section 7(a)(2), after the issuance of the 2014 biological opinion and after the 2017 authorization of the fishery under the MMPA, by continuing to allow lobster fishing in a manner that is jeopardizing critically endangered right whales.\" Reply at 21. As Plaintiffs note, \"By definition, the administrative record related to those 2014 and 2017 decisions cannot include post-decisional evidence of harm to right whales from the lobster fishery, because that evidence did not exist at the time of the decisions and could not have been considered by Defendants in making those decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038073\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/716/982/#p987\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   , the allegation at issue here does not revolve around the jeopardy caused by a prior agency determination but, instead, an assertion that regardless of the reasonableness of the 2014 and 2017 actions, defendants are\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   violating \u00a7 7 of the ESA. This temporal distinction matters in terms of the appropriate scope of review. While the evidence necessary to adjudicate a\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   -type claim may well be contained in the administrative record or proceedings before the agency, the relevant information needed to determine whether there is ongoing and future jeopardy is far more likely to require discovery. As Plaintiffs put it, \"In effect, there can be no administrative record for incidents of unlawful take, as they do not constitute a final agency decision but instead subsequently flow from a decision's implementation.\" Reply at 15-16. The Court agrees that, in a \u00a7 7 case alleging ongoing and prospective violations of the ESA, the administrative record may well be insufficient to resolve the relevant claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   There is, additionally, a distinction to be made between the form of relief sought here versus that pursued in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the plaintiffs alleged that the agency's approval of the drilling project violated the ESA and moved for summary judgment on that claim. There is no indication in the opinion that they sought an injunction of any ongoing agency action, as they were instead challenging the Government's approval of the drilling plan. Here, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief under \u00a7 7(a)(2) of the ESA, which provides that the remedies for a substantive violation of the Act can include an injunction pending compliance. In order to show that they are entitled to such a remedy, Plaintiffs must \"make a showing that a violation of the ESA is at least likely in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. Burlington N.R.R., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517048\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/1508/#p1511\">\n    23 F.3d 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1511 (9th Cir. 1994) (considering preliminary injunction). The relevant inquiry for the Court, subsequently, is whether there is a \"definitive threat\" to the right whale under Defendants' current administration of their agency policies\n   and past actions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517048\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/1508/#p1511\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1512 n.8. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   , therefore, the relief at issue is not the propriety of a prior government act, but the enjoining or modification of the agency's ongoing administration of its oversight with respect to an endangered species. Again, the Court finds that confining the record to past agency determinations is far less appropriate when plaintiffs seek an injunction based on present-day agency actions and the risk of future harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Or. Nat. Desert Ass'n v. Kimbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700548\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/593/1217/#p1219\">\n    593 F.Supp.2d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219 (D. Or. 2009) (finding that magistrate judge did not err in holding that plaintiffs' \u00a7 7 claim supported \"introduc[ing] evidence obtained after administrative decisions were issued,\" as \"extra-record evidence is necessary for plaintiffs to meet the burden of proof required for obtaining injunctive relief pursuant to the ESA citizen-suit provision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Section 9 Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition to asserting that they are entitled to discovery based on their \u00a7 7 claim, Plaintiffs also argue that their \u00a7 9 count requires the submission of extra-record evidence. Their allegations under this provision are predicated on the assertion that Defendants have long acknowledged that the lobster fishery takes right whales by entanglement, but that, in contravention of the ESA, there is no incidental-take statement or permit authorizing any such take.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 10. Plaintiffs seek to hold NMFS liable for this alleged violation, as it is the federal agency responsible for authorizing and managing the ongoing operations of the fishery.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700548\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/593/1217/#p1219\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In doing so, they make clear that they are not holding the agency to account for any \"particular decision,\" but instead bringing suit to remedy its ongoing failure to prevent the unauthorized incidental take of right whales.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Plaintiffs assert that because they are seeking to enjoin ongoing and future actions resulting in such harm, there is no relevant administrative record upon which their \u00a7 9 claim can be decided and that they are thus entitled to discovery. In response, Defendants raise the same arguments as they levy against discovery under the \u00a7 7 claim - namely, that\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   precludes such extra-record evidence - that the cases cited by Plaintiffs are inapposite, and that judicial efficiency counsels in favor of relying on the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs again have the better of this issue. First, it can easily dispose of Defendants' reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   , as that case included no claim under \u00a7 9. In the years since that decision, moreover, at least one court in this district has permitted discovery on an ESA \u00a7 9 claim - a fact that is difficult to square with Defendants' argument that\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   precludes discovery in \u00a7 9 suits.

There is no indication in the record that either the district court or the court of appeals found this discovery improper in light of\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the district court explicitly noted that it had decided an earlier motion for summary judgment \"following several years of extensive discovery,\" and that it had then granted \"additional discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Feld Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870826\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/677/55/\">\n    677 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   61-62 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

It is hard to imagine how such an inquiry could be resolved on the basis of an administrative record underlying a past agency action, as such records are\n   unlikely to include evidence showing ongoing take or reflecting future potential harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nw. Coal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323480\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/1168/#p1170\">\n    920 F.Supp.2d at 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting discovery on ESA \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 9 claims and noting that \"there is no final agency action and therefore no closed administrative record for the Court to review\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on their ESA counts. This result reflects the intent of the Act to ensure the ongoing conservation of endangered species and to ensure that agencies charged with safeguarding such species fulfill their role as stewards. Permitting discovery will also best serve the interests of the Court in adjudicating the \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 9 claims, as Plaintiffs ask it to evaluate both the current and future risk Defendants' actions pose to the right whale. In order to accurately assess the alleged crisis of these cetaceans, the Court will benefit from a record that reflects the actual, ongoing effects of the lobster fishery on the species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion for Discovery. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
