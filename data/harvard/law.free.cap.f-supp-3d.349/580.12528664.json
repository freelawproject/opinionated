Applying these principles, the Fifth Circuit held that the claims in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab\n   </em>\n   were \"plainly collateral\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   , Family Rehab seeks only a hearing before the recoupment of its Medicare revenues. In its complaint, Family Rehab does not seek a determination that the recoupments are wrongful under the Medicare Act .... And Family Rehab's procedural due-process and\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims will not require the court to wade into the Medicare Act or regulations; those claims only require the court to determine how much process is required under the Constitution and federal law before recoupment. Because Family Rehab asks only that recoupment be suspended until a hearing, and because it raises claims unrelated to the merits of the recoupment, its claims are collateral.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ... Ultimately, Family Rehab seeks only the suspension of recoupment before a hearing, which is plainly collateral to the result of that hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 504. Plaintiff's claims in Counts One through Four and Six likewise seek only to suspend recoupment until Plaintiff receives its hearing, and do not challenge the merits of the recoupment. Accordingly, like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab\n   </em>\n   , they are collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Turning to the second prong of the collateral-claims exception, the Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab\n   </em>\n   held that \"[t]he combined threats of going out of business and disruption to Medicare patients are sufficient for irreparable injury\" such that full relief could not be obtained through a post-deprivation hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, Plaintiff produces evidence that at this time is uncontroverted that continued recoupment of the Medicare overpayment without access to a timely hearing will force Plaintiff to shut down and file bankruptcy, that Plaintiff has already lost most of its employees, and that \"all patients have already been or must soon be transferred to other\n   providers on an emergency basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehab\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has thus far made a showing that full relief cannot be obtained through a post-deprivation hearing. Accordingly, Plaintiff has established that the Court has \u00a7 1331 federal question jurisdiction under the collateral-claims exception over Plaintiff's claims in Counts One, Two, Three, Four, and Six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's claim for mandamus in Count Five, however, is not collateral. Unlike Plaintiff's other claims, Count Five does not seek to suspend recoupment, but rather alleges that \"this Court should compel Defendant to not use sampling to calculate this overpayment for failure of its duty to make available essential sampling documentation necessary for a Due Process challenge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Adjudicating such a claim would require the Court to examine the merits of the underlying dispute, in which Plaintiff challenges the sampling methodology used to calculate Plaintiff's total overpayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nor does the Court have mandamus jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201361\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[M]andamus jurisdiction exists if the action is an attempt to compel an officer or employee of the United States or its agencies to perform an allegedly nondiscretionary duty owed to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Randall D.
