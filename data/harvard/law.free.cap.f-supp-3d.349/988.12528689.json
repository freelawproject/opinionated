(First Am. Compl. (Docket No. 43).) Before the court are plaintiff's (Docket No. 58) and intervenor defendant California Forestry Association's (\"CFA\") (Docket No. 63) cross Motions for Partial Summary Judgment as to the claim for declaratory relief, and plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to defendants' Affirmative Defenses (Docket No. 60).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action stems from the Flat Fire, which ignited in July 2012 along a highway through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. On July 10, 2017, plaintiff brought a complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   against defendants Bundy and Kernen for damages resulting from the fire. (Compl. (Docket No. 1).) Plaintiff alleges that employees of defendants Bundy and Kernen negligently started the fire while transporting heavy logging equipment along the highway. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After an investigation, National Forest Service investigators determined that the fire started when defendants' equipment came unsecured and dragged along the highway, creating sparks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Ultimately, the Flat Fire burned approximately 1,608 acres of National Forest System lands, and an additional 80 acres of private land. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to its claims for damages, plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that Section 13009.2 is inapplicable as to claims brought by the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The California Legislature passed Section 13009.2 in 2012 as part of Assembly Bill 1492, a budget bill that addressed Timber Harvest Plans and imposed taxes on lumber products.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20Cal.%20Legis.%20Serv.%20289\">\n    2012 Cal.

Under this statute, any pecuniary damages sought must be quantifiable and cannot be unreasonable in relation to the prefire market value of the property. Public agencies can recover ecological and environmental damages, but the prefire fair market value of the property is a relevant factor in assessing the reasonableness of those damages. Finally, if public agency plaintiffs claim environmental damages, they cannot seek to enhance their pecuniary or environmental damages. The statute defines public agencies to include both the United States and California and any political subdivisions thereof. The statute does not apply to private plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Motions for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

California state courts have reached different results on the question of whether plaintiffs can receive a tree damage multiplier for fire damage under Civil Code Section 3346. In\n   <em>\n    Kelly v. CB &amp; I Constructors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a panel for the Second District of the California Court of Appeal held that the plain language of section 3346 authorizes an award of double damages for any injury to trees caused by the trespass of fire. 179 Cal.
