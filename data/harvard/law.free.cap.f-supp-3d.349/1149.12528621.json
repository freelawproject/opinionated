He graduated high school and attended \"a couple of years of college,\" but did not\n   receive a degree. AR at 45. From 1989 to 2011, Sida held semi-continuous employment, working as a heavy equipment operator, sandblaster, long-haul truck driver, and maintenance man.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 220.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sida filed applications for both Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\") and Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") under the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. and \u00a7 1381 et seq. (\"the Act\"), on November 6, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 191-98. Sida claimed disability beginning on November 1, 2010, based on a shattered left foot, post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"), depression, high blood pressure, and anxiety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 71. The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Sida's application initially and upon reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 79-80, 89-90. At his request, Sida received a de novo hearing before Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") Barry O'Melinn, at which Sida, Sida's attorney, and a vocational expert (\"VE\") appeared.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 32-70. On March 4, 2016, ALJ O'Melinn issued his decision, concluding that Sida is not disabled within the Act's meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 14-26. Sida appealed to the SSA Appeals Council, but it declined review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 1-3. As a consequence, ALJ O'Melinn's decision became the SSA Commissioner's final decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.210\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sida then timely filed his appeal with this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, filed June 13, 2017 (Doc. 1). Sida advances three grounds for relief. First, he argues that ALJ O'Melinn breached his duty to develop the administrative record regarding Sida's psychological impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 15-18. Next, he contends that ALJ O'Melinn improperly rejected the opinion of Caryn Stone, his treating licensed-mental-health counselor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 18-22. Last, he contends that ALJ O'Melinn's step five analysis was legally infirm and bereft of substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 22-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The ALJ's Decision\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn issued his decision on March 4, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 11. At step one, he concludes that Sida has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged disability onset date of November 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 16. At step two, ALJ O'Melinn finds Sida's bilateral shoulder pain and torn rotator cuff, along with his \"mental disorders variously diagnosed as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression[,] and anxiety,\" to be severe impairments. AR at 17. In contrast, ALJ O'Melinn finds Sida's hypertension, foot pain, thyroid and liver disorders, and alcohol abuse to be non-severe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At step three, ALJ O'Melinn concludes that none of Sida's impairments, alone or in combination, meet or medically equal the severity of a listed impairment in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Subpart P, App. 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 19-20. Specifically, ALJ O'Melinn considers Sida's mental impairments under Listing 12.04 (affective disorders) and 12.06 (anxiety-related disorders). ALJ O'Melinn determines that the evidence does not satisfy the paragraph B criteria of these Listings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[b]ecause the claimant's mental impairments do not cause at least two 'marked' limitations or one\n   'marked' limitation and 'repeated' episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration.\" AR at 20. He then explains his reasoning regarding paragraph B's four subparts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn begins by evaluating Sida's activities of daily living (\"ADLs\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 19. ALJ O'Melinn finds Sida to have only a mild restriction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 19. ALJ O'Melinn references Sida's testimony that \"he could do household cleaning and chores,\" along with Sida's self-reporting that he can clean, perform most house repairs, do yard work, or work with firewood for up to two hours per day. AR at 19. Moreover, ALJ O'Melinn focuses on Sida's self-reporting that, to the extent he has limitations in personal care, they \"[are] not due [to] mental functioning but rather lack of transportation or money.\" AR at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, ALJ O'Melinn finds Sida has only mild difficulties with social functioning. ALJ O'Melinn cites statements from Sida's \"Adult Function Report,\" AR at 236-45, in support, including that Sida can shop for basic needs when able to find transportation, and that Sida receives and maintains food stamps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 19. ALJ O'Melinn further observes that Sida visits his family on a regular basis, sees his girlfriend daily, and reports no general difficulties in getting along with others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, ALJ O'Melinn finds that Sida has moderate difficulties with concentration, persistence, and pace. ALJ O'Melinn describes Sida's accounts of difficulties, including difficulty following written instructions, finishing what he starts, and handling stress well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 19. ALJ O'Melinn does not, however, take all of Sida's self-reported challenges at face value. Indeed, while Sida \"reported he could not handle money by paying bills, counting change, etc.,\" ALJ O'Melinn emphasizes Sida's own explanation that \"the reason was due to [Sida's] lack of a job.\" AR at 19. Similarly, while Sida alleges memory problems, \"the only example he gave is walking from one room to another and forgetting what he was going to the new room to get.\" AR at 19. To ALJ O'Melinn, this problem represents \"a routine experience,\" which, when considered alongside Sida's other self-reporting, leads ALJ O'Melinn to find no more than a moderate difficulty in this area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn concludes his paragraph B discussion by finding that Sida \"has experienced no episodes of decompensation, which have been of extended duration.\" AR at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alongside his paragraph B findings, ALJ O'Melinn also considers whether Sida qualifies under the paragraph C criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn answers this inquiry in the negative, finding that \"the evidence fails to establish the presence of the 'paragraph C' criteria.\" AR at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After concluding that none of Sida's impairments satisfy an applicable Listing, ALJ O'Melinn moves to step four and assesses Sida's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 16-21. After stating that he had given \"careful consideration of the entire record,\" ALJ O'Melinn determines that Sida\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 [C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7] 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) except that he is further limited to occasional pushing or pulling with the lower left extremity. He is limited to frequently climbing ramps or stairs, occasionally climbing ladders, ropes or scaffolds, occasionally balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling, and occasional bilateral reaching. He can understand, carry out and remember simple instructions and make commensurate work related decisions, respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers and work situations, deal with routine changes in work setting, and maintain concentration persistence and pace for up to and including two hours at [a] time with normal breaks throughout the work day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   AR at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To develop Sida's RFC, ALJ O'Melinn relies on three separate grounds. First, ALJ O'Melinn renders an adverse credibility finding against Sida, opining that Sida's \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence[,] and limiting effects of [his] symptoms are not entirely credible.\" AR at 21. To support his finding, ALJ O'Melinn contrasts Sida's statements concerning the severity of his symptoms with evidence of record and finds that the evidence does not substantiate Sida's contentions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 21-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a threshold issue, ALJ O'Melinn addresses two allegations that Sida advances. First, ALJ O'Melinn challenges Sida's contention that the federal Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (\"DVR\") stopped assisting him because he was filing for disability. ALJ O'Melinn dismisses this supposition, opining that \"[i]t makes little sense that a vocational rehabilitation agency would refuse to work with a person with disabilities.\" AR at 21. ALJ O'Melinn concludes that Sida's allegation that the \"DVR would [n]ot work with him due to alleged disability is incredible.\" AR at 21. Similarly, ALJ O'Melinn questions Sida's account that \"he had to sell his sandblasting equipment to pay child support.\" AR at 21. ALJ O'Melinn contrasts this statement with Sida's testimony that he \"had his license revoked\" and had \"been incarcerated for non-payment of child support in the past.\" AR at 21. ALJ O'Melinn reasons that Sida's \"attempt to open his own business failed for reasons unrelated to disability,\" and finds that Sida's statements on both the closure of the sandblasting company and DVR's unwillingness to assist him based on disability \"undermine[s] his credibility and the merits of his claim.\" AR at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn also assigns \"little weight\" to Sida's allegations concerning the severity of his symptoms and, by O'Melinn's account, \"relied upon more credible evidence.\" AR at 21. ALJ O'Melinn begins this discussion by recalling Sida's statement that \"he has not healed from rotator cuff surgery and that his range of motion is limited, only being able to lift his left arm to shoulder height.\" AR at 21. Then, turning to the medical records,\n   ALJ O'Melinn notes that Sida was treated for shoulder pain in July and August 2013, and prescribed medication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 22. At a routine follow-up in October 2013, Sida reported that his shoulder pain continued, but that he had not started taking his medication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 22. The clinician observed that Sida smelled of alcohol and declared that he was at the appointment only to build up his case for disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 22. In the ALJ O'Melinn's eyes, this \"medication non-compliance coupled with the above statement by [Sida] diminishes the credibility of [Sida].\" AR at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn also discusses Sida's shoulder pain from 2014, which Sida describes as originating when he \"was fighting and fell on a chair.\" AR at 22. Falling out of a tree the next year aggravated Sida's injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 22. Sida underwent surgery in March 2015, \"and follow up appointments indicated steady improvement in pain level and range of motion.\" AR at 22. Clinical notes remark that Sida \"had full range of motion, still had some popping in the shoulder[,] but was not in any pain\" at his July 2015, follow up. AR at 22. Moreover, ALJ O'Melinn emphasizes that Sida participated in physical therapy from April through July 2015, for eleven visits, and that notes indicate that he \"reached maximum rehabilitation potential [and] no further physical therapy was needed.\" AR at 22. Based on these clinical observations, ALJ O'Melinn opines that, \"[w]hile the fact that [Sida] underwent surgery suggests the symptoms were genuine, this is offset by the fact that the record reflects the surgery was generally successful in relieving the symptoms.\" AR at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn closes his adverse credibility finding by comparing Sida's statements concerning his mental impairments to the medical evidence of record. Sida reports treatment from several providers for depression, PTSD, and anxiety beginning in 2013 at Ben Archer Health Center.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 22. Sida reports that, at that time, he \"hear[d] music in his ears at times along with ringing but denied visual hallucinations.\" AR at 22. At a follow-up appointment, Sida describes continued anxiety, but also relates that he has not started his prescribed medication and has stopped attending behavioral therapy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 22. Later treatment at La Frontera in 2014 and 2015 reveals a similar pattern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 23. Sida was treated for depression and anxiety, but treatment notes record further non-compliance with medication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 23. Nevertheless, \"treatment records note progress with medication effectiveness as they adjust the medication and amounts,\" including an escalation of Sida's Global Assessment of Functioning (\"GAF\") scores\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   from 35 to the 70s in the most recent tests of April and June 2015. AR at 23. ALJ O'Melinn drew two conclusions from Sida's mental health history: (i) that his \"non-compliance with medication demonstrates a possible unwillingness to do that which is necessary to improve his condition,\" which might indicate his symptoms are less severe than purported; and (ii) that, with proper treatment, Sida demonstrates \"significant improvement.\" AR at 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn also weighs the statements of Sida's girlfriend, Deborah Apodaca, as the second basis for his RFC finding. In ALJ O'Melinn's estimation, the statements that Apodaca provide concerning Sida's condition \"appear to only repeat the subjective complaints already testified\n   to and reported by [Sida].\" AR at 24. Furthermore, ALJ O'Melinn opines that Apodaca is neither a medical professional nor an uninterested party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 24. \"Most importantly,\" ALJ O'Melinn concludes, \"the clinical or diagnostic medical evidence that is discussed more thoroughly herein does not support [her] statements.\" AR at 24. Thus, ALJ O'Melinn finds Apodaca's statements \"not credible.\" AR at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, ALJ O'Melinn relies on the medical evidence of record. To begin, ALJ O'Melinn accords \"some weight\" to consultative examiner Dr. Marian Landau, D.O. AR at 23. Dr. Landau finds Sida has full motor strength in the proximal and distal muscle groups in the upper and lower extremities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 23. Dr. Landau finds that Sida has tenderness in his left forefoot, and ultimately diagnoses him with \"chronic left foot pain\" and uncontrolled hypertension. AR at 23. ALJ O'Melinn accords the opinion some weight, rather than significant weight, as he finds that Dr. Landau \"did not have the opportunity to review additional evidence only available at the hearing level regarding [Sida's] impairments, including medical improvement.\" AR at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ALJ O'Melinn also assigns \"some weight\" to the non-examining agency consultants' opinions who assessed Sida's physical impairments. AR at 23. These two doctors -- Dr. Karine Lancaster, M.D., and Dr. Tom Dees, M.D. -- both opine that Sida \"is capable of work at the medium exertional level except [he] is further limited to occasional push/pull with the left lower extremities, can frequently climb ramps and stairs, occasionally climb ladders, ropes[,] and scaffolds, occasionally balance, frequently crouch[,] and occasionally crawl.\" AR at 23. ALJ O'Melinn hesitates to grant these opinions more than \"some weight,\" as he finds Dr. Landau's opinions \"more consistent with the record as a whole,\" and also because neither Dr. Lancaster nor Dr. Dees has \"the benefit of considering the additional evidence that was available only after the reconsideration determination, including subsequent medical evidence and the hearing testimony.\" AR at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, ALJ O'Melinn considers the non-examining agency psychologists' opinions and accords their opinions \"little weight.\" AR at 23-24. These clinicians, Dr. Ralph Rabinowitz, Ph.D., and Dr. Thomas VanHosse, Ph.D., both rate Sida's mental impairments as \"less than non-severe.\" AR at 24. ALJ O'Melinn discounts their opinions, as neither has had the opportunity to review the record submitted at the hearing level, \"including mental health records from 2014 and 2015.\" AR at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Last, ALJ O'Melinn weighs the November 2015, medical assessment that Stone prepared.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 24. Stone assigns Sida: (i) \"moderate to marked limitations with memory, concentration[,] and pace functions\"; (ii) \"marked limitations in social interactions\"; and (iii) and \"moderate to marked limitations in adaptation functions.\" AR at 24. ALJ O'Mellin ascribes \"little weight\" to Stone's opinion for multiple reasons. First, he notes that Stone is not an acceptable medical source.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 24. Further, ALJ O'Melinn remarks that her opinion is \"quite conclusory, providing very little explanation of the evidence relied upon in forming that opinion.\" AR at 24. ALJ O'Melinn observes that Stone \"did not document positive objective clinical or diagnostic findings, and apparently relied quite heavily on the subjective report of symptoms and limitations provided by [Sida], and seemed to uncritically accept as true most, if not all, of what [Sida] reported.\" AR at 24. ALJ O'Melinn disapproves of this approach, as he finds that \"there exist good reasons for questioning the reliability of [Sida's] subjective complaints.\" AR at 24. Ultimately, ALJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   O'Melinn discounts Stone's opinion both for its reliance on Sida's subjective reports, and because it is \"inconsistent with [Sida's] admitted activities of daily living.\" AR at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the second phase of step four, ALJ O'Melinn discusses the testimony of VE Sandra Trost, who testified at Sida's administrative hearing that Sida had past relevant work as a heavy equipment operator (Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\"DOT\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   # 859.683-010), a sandblaster (DOT # 503.687-010), a janitor (DOT # 381.687-018), a groundskeeper (DOT # 406.687.010), and as a house repairer (DOT # 869.381-010).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 25, 30. Then, at the third and final phase of step four, ALJ O'Melinn finds that Sida is \"unable to perform past relevant work.\" AR at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At step five, ALJ O'Melinn relies on Trost's testimony to determine what jobs, if any, Sida could still perform. Trost takes Sida's RFC into consideration and opines that Sida can perform the occupations of furniture rental consultant (DOT # 295.357-018), with a specific vocational preparation (\"SVP\") level of 2 and 49,378 jobs in the national economy, and usher (DOT # 344.677-014), with an SVP level of 2 and 16,691 jobs in the national economy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 26. Notably, upon examination by Sida's counsel, Trost acknowledges that the position of furniture rental consultant represents a position with reasoning level three in the DOT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 68. Notwithstanding this admission, ALJ O'Melinn in his ruling states that, \"[p]ursuant to [Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") ] 00-4p,\" he has \"determined that the vocational expert's testimony is consistent with the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.\" AR at 26. Having accepted Trost's testimony, ALJ O'Melinn finds Sida \"capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.\" AR at 26. Accordingly, ALJ O'Melinn finds that Sida has not been under a disability, as the Act defines that term, during the relevant time period and denied his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When the Appeals Council denies a claimant's request for review, the ALJ's decision becomes the agency's final decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's review of that final agency decision is both factual and legal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maes v.

Sida challenges ALJ O'Melinn's step five findings on multiple fronts. First, he asserts that ALJ O'Melinn commits legal error by failing to resolve a conflict between Trost's testimony and the DOT concerning Sida's ability to perform the job of furniture rental consultant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 22-24. Additionally, Sida contends that ALJ O'Melinn did not perform the analysis\n   <em>\n    Trimiar v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527421\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/1326/\">\n    966 F.2d 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1992), requires for the remaining, borderline number of usher jobs that Trost identified in the national economy, thereby depriving his opinion of the substantial evidence required for affirmance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 24-27. Both arguments persuade the Court for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     ALJ O'MELINN COMMITTED MULTIPLE LEGAL ERRORS AT STEP FIVE\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Sida argues that Trost erroneously identifies the furniture-rental-consultant position as a position that he could hold with his assigned RFC. Sida initiates this challenge by recalling the relevant portion of ALJ O'Melinn's hypothetical to Trost, which limited Sida to the ability to \"understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions and make commensurate work-related decisions.\" Motion at 23-24 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting AR at 64-65). He argues that \"there is a discrepancy\" between this RFC and the reasoning development level which the DOT identifies as being necessary for the position of furniture rental consultant. Motion at 22. Sida explains that the reasoning development code for furniture rental consultant in the DOT is \"R3,\" which the DOT defines as requiring the worker to \"[a]pply commonsense understanding to carry out instructions furnished in written, oral, or diagrammatic form[ and d]eal with problems involving several concrete variables in or from standardized situations.\" Motion at 23 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to highlighting the textual conflict between the RFC and the DOT, Sida also directs the Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hackett v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   , where he contends the Tenth Circuit \"held that a level-two reasoning appeared to be consistent with an RFC where the claimant 'retains the attention, concentration, persistence, and pace levels required for simple and routine work tasks.' \" Motion at 23 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hackett v.

Thus, Sida concludes that \"ALJ O'Melinn's reliance upon inconsistent and unsupported VE testimony is legal error and is not substantial evidence supporting his Step 5 finding.\" Motion at 24. He bolsters his conclusion by reminding the Court both that it is ALJ O'Melinn's duty to resolve any conflicts between Trost's testimony and the DOT pursuant to SSR 00-4p, and that the Commissioner bears the burden at step five \"to prove that the claimant can perform other work existing in the national economy.\" Motion at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Talbot v.

Notably, she never concedes a conflict between Trost's\n   recommendation and the DOT. The Commissioner emphasizes instead that the reasoning level at issue is just one component of the General Educational Development (\"GED\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   calculus of the DOT, which \"embraces those aspects of education (formal and informal) that are required of a worker for satisfactory job performance.\" Response at 19 (emphasis omitted)(citing DICOT, App. C,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20688702\">\n    1991 WL 688702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Commissioner acknowledges the\n   <em>\n    Hackett v.

The first derives from SSR 00-4p, which imposes upon ALJs \"an affirmative responsibility to ask ... the VE ... if the evidence he or she has provided conflicts with information provided in the DOT.\" SSR 00-4p,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201898704\">\n    2000 WL 1898704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Here, ALJ O'Melinn conspicuously neglected to ask.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 60-68. Yet, in his decision denying Sida's disability claims, ALJ O'Melinn states that, \"[p]ursuant to SSR 00-4p, I have determined that the vocational expert's testimony is consistent with the information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.\" AR at 26. Unfortunately, he did no such thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Additionally, the Court will remand this matter because it is not apparent from the record or the parties' briefing that Sida has the ability to work as a furniture rental consultant under his present RFC. The Court recognizes that the Tenth Circuit's language in\n   <em>\n    Hackett v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   is not mandatory and, moreover, that the language may be dicta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hackett v.

Nevertheless, the same logic that persuaded the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hackett v.

Just as in\n   <em>\n    Hackett v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   , this limitation seems facially incompatible with a GED reasoning level 3 position where a worker must \"[a]pply commonsense understanding to carry out instructions furnished in written, oral, or diagrammatic form,\" and \"[d]eal with problems involving several concrete variables in or from standardized situations.\" DICOT, App. C,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20688702\">\n    1991 WL 688702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To the contrary -- but just as in\n   <em>\n    Hackett v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   -- Sida's RFC limitation more closely aligns with reasoning level 2, where a worker need only \"[a]pply commonsense understanding to carry out detailed but uninvolved written or oral instructions,\" and \"[d]eal with problems involving a few concrete variables in or from standardized situations.\" DICOT, App. C,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20WL%20688702\">\n    1991 WL 688702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, despite the Commissioner's position that \"there is no actual conflict in this case between the vocational expert testimony and the DOT,\" Response at 20, based on the DOT's plain language and on the guidance in\n   <em>\n    Hackett v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   , an actual conflict exists, and ALJ O'Melinn did not resolve it. In that failure, ALJ O'Melinn committed legal error requiring remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    D. WHAT REMAINS OF ALJ O'MELINN'S STEP FIVE LACKS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Notwithstanding ALJ O'Melinn's failure to resolve the conflict described above, a harmless error argument could be advanced based on the remaining position, as an usher, that ALJ O'Melinn identified. In fact, the Commissioner urges this course.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 20-21. The Commissioner observes that \"the second job identified by the vocational expert (Usher) has a GED reasoning level of 2,\" and, \"[c]onsequently, any alleged error by the ALJ relying on the Furniture Rental Consultant job as one Plaintiff could perform did not impact the ultimate outcome of this case.\" Response at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Sida identifies, however, a separate basis for reversal based on the usher position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   He begins by reminding the Court that \"[i]t is the Commissioner's burden at Step 5 to prove that a claimant retains the RFC to perform other jobs existing in 'significant numbers' in the national economy.\" Motion at 25 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Haddock v.

Sida then directs the Court to\n   <em>\n    Trimiar v.

Based on Trost's testimony that 16,691 usher positions exist in the national economy, Sida extrapolates that only 333.82 usher jobs exist per state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 26. Furthermore, he contends that this number does not rise to the significant level which the statute requires. Therefore, Sida concludes that, based on this \"dubious and borderline\" number of jobs, ALJ O'Melinn \"should have conducted the inquiry suggested by\n   <em>\n    Trimiar\n   </em>\n   in doubtful cases.\" Motion at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Commissioner responds that the Tenth Circuit \"has not established the number of jobs necessary to be considered significant because 'each case should be evaluated on its individual merits.' \" Response at 21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Trimiar v.

Similarly, she explains that \"[SSA] policy does not dictate what number of jobs may or may not be significant in a particular case.\" Response at 21. Rather, the Commissioner opines, \"a determination as to what is significant is left to the ALJ, weighing the statutory language and applying it to the particular facts.\" Response at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Applying these principles, the Commissioner contends that \"[t]his is what the ALJ did here.\" Response at 21. By her estimation, ALJ O'Melinn's finding is based on VE testimony, which the regulation allows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 21 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1566\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (2018) ). Additionally, the Commissioner cites to one unpublished Tenth Circuit decision for the proposition that as few as 11,000 jobs can constitute a significant number of jobs in the national economy.

Rather, ALJ O'Melinn considers this number only in conjunction with the 49,378 jobs identified for the position of furniture rental consultant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR at 26. Furthermore, he considered the sum of the two job positions against the backdrop of the numerous step five errors already identified\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1159-61. On these facts, the Court cannot say this analysis represents the \"exceptional circumstance\" where \"no reasonable administrative factfinder, following the correct analysis, could have resolved the factual matter in any other way.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The Court therefore will adhere to the Tenth Circuit's preference that the ALJ evaluate numerical significance in the first instance and further declines to supply a dispositive\n   finding of harmless error to conclude that there are a \"significant number\" of jobs available to Sida in the national economy.\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Barnhart\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In conclusion, ALJ O'Melinn's failure to resolve the conflict between the VE's testimony and the DOT regarding Sida's limitation to simple instructions and simple work-related decisions, and the reasoning-level-three job of furniture rental consultant which the VE identified, is reversible error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hackett v.
