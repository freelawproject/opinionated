LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Phyllis Davis, an asthmatic, alleges that defendant Echo Valley Condominium Association violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act when it did not accommodate her sensitivity to secondhand smoke by banning smoking throughout the condominium complex, including within private residences. The plaintiff also brought claims under state statutory and common law. Davis has moved for summary judgment on liability. Echo Valley and its former property manager, Casa Bella Property Management, Inc., also moved for summary judgment, arguing, among other things, that the accommodation Davis demands is unreasonable, particularly because smoking within one's home is not illegal. Davis has not identified evidence that creates a material question of fact on all the elements of her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Therefore, the Court will deny the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment, and dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Davis also contends that testimony from a heating contractor about the furnace duct work in Davis's building should be rejected for a variety of reasons. None of them have merit, so Davis's motion to strike his testimony will be denied as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Phyllis Davis is a breast cancer survivor, who has asthma and multiple-chemical sensitivity disorder. She says that her medical conditions substantially interfere with her ability to breathe when she is exposed to certain chemicals and irritants. A major offender is cigarette smoke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Davis lives in Unit 214 in the Echo Valley subdivision, a condominium she purchased on 2004. Defendant Echo Valley Condominium Association is responsible for governing and managing eight buildings in the Echo Valley subdivision. On November 10, 2014, defendant Casa Bella Property Management, Inc. contracted with Echo Valley to manage the property within the subdivision. Casa Bella's contract expired at the end of 2017, and it no longer provides property management services to Echo Valley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The units at Echo Valley are subject to a master deed and bylaws as amended, and to covenants, conditions, and restrictions found in those documents or created based on them. The bylaws vest in Echo Valley's board of directors the power to make rules \"necessary for the administration of the affairs of the Association,\" including \"[r]easonable regulations ... concerning the use of the common elements.\" The interior space of a condominium unit is not considered a \"common element\" within the master deed's definition. The bylaws prohibit \"immoral, improper, unlawful or offensive activity\" in the common elements and the individual units. There is no ban on smoking at the condominium complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Davis's Unit 214 is one of four in the building. It shares a common hallway and stairs with the three other units: Unit 114, Unit 115, and Unit 215. The parties dispute whether these spaces share a ventilation system that circulates air (including pollutants and contaminants) among the connected units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2012, former defendants Moisey and Ella Lamnin leased Unit 115 to defendant Wanda Rule. Rule occupied the unit until December 31, 2017. During Rule's tenancy, the plaintiff complained that Rule and her guests regularly smoked tobacco and other substances in Unit 115, which Davis says she could smell from her unit. On April 3, 2018, plaintiff's counsel informed defense counsel that \"someone in Ms. Davis' building has started smoking cigarettes and marijuana.\" When prompted for more detail as to the source of the smoke, plaintiff's counsel replied that he was \"investigating\" the source, but he believed that \"it may be coming from Unit 114.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Davis believes that the secondhand smoke has exacerbated her health conditions, and, as a breast cancer survivor, exposes her to an increased risk of cancer and cancer-related problems. A doctor at Davis's medical care facility stated that exposure to tobacco is detrimental to Davis's health and increases the risk of her suffering an asthma attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to tobacco-related smoke, Davis has complained that other smells and fumes were problematic. In a January 31, 2015 letter, Davis informed her neighbor that the cooking smells emanating from the neighbor's unit \"engulfed\" her condo and she \"almost had an asthma attack.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   She requested that her neighbor open her window and turn the exhaust fan on when frying or grilling. In that same letter, the plaintiff complained about and demanded accommodations relating to slamming doors and FedEx ringing the doorbells of other residents' units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Davis says that she has made the defendants aware of her medical conditions on several occasions and asked that the smoking issue be addressed. On March 1, 2016, Davis sent Colleen O'Rourke, an agent of Casa Bella, two emails that raised Davis's concerns about the smoking issue. In the first email, Davis asked O'Rourke what can be done to make owners accountable for smoke that enters the shared ventilation system and stated that they should be able to make smokers insulate their doors and vents. Davis wrote that asthmatics suffer when forced to breathe in second- and third-hand smoke toxins, and that something had to be done about the smoking nuisance that was affecting Davis's breathing and causing constant coughing and near asthma attacks. In the second email, Davis wrote that because of the heavy smoke, she must turn the heat up and open the windows in her condo so that she can breathe. O'Rourke promptly responded to Davis's emails and explained that because the Echo Valley bylaws and state law did not prohibit smoking in one's home, she did not believe anything could be done. The email suggested that Davis's complaint could be placed on the condo board's meeting agenda to see if the board would like an attorney's opinion on the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Davis took up O'Rourke on her offer and asked that her issue be placed on the upcoming board meeting agenda, seeking to have smoking designated a nuisance under the bylaws. She also suggested that the owner of Unit 115 reseal the gaps in his doors and reevaluate his vents. The item was taken up at the March 15, 2016, board meeting. Board member Tony Barker suggested that Davis and other aggrieved residents cover their door base openings to prevent the smell from coming into their units. The board apparently questioned whether smoking may legally be labeled a health nuisance and did not reach a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 29, 2016, O'Rourke sent a letter to the Lamnins that mentioned complaints regarding the heavy cigarette smoke emanating from Unit 115 and requested, on behalf of the condo board, that the Lamnins assist in keeping the smell contained to their unit. O'Rourke suggested that the odor could be prevented from spreading throughout the building by smoking outside on the balcony or deck, using air purifiers, or insulating the entry door. O'Rourke noted that there was no rule or regulation that prohibited smoking in one's home, but that it could be considered a nuisance to those who do not smoke. O'Rourke later testified that the board had agreed that the letter would be sent with the wording that Davis requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 21, 2017, the board held a meeting; the minutes reflect that Davis requested that another letter be sent to the owners of Unit 115 about the heavy smoking. Davis apparently told the board that the smoke was infiltrating common areas and other units, and the smell was horrendous and was bringing down the property value of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 6, 2017, the Association installed a fresh air system on Davis's furnace ductwork to help with the smoke problem. Mark Clor, the licensed contractor who worked on Davis's system, testified that he installed the fresh air system to allow Davis's furnace to draw in air from the outside of the building. Clor also averred that each unit has its own furnace\n   and ductwork. He testified at his deposition that after the fresh air system was installed, Davis told him that she thought it made a difference. He said that he was personally familiar with the heating and cooling system that services Davis's unit as well as the connected units and asserted that none of the units draw air from or ventilate air into the other connected units. He also stated that none of the connected units draw air from the common element stairway, and that the ducts that vent air into the common element stairway for heating purposes can be closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 24, 2017, the plaintiff's previous lawyer sent the Lamnins a letter detailing her health issues and asserting that by allowing their tenant(s) to smoke, the Lamnins were in breach of the condominium documents and committing common law nuisance. The lawyer demanded that the Lamnins take appropriate measures to assure that smoke will not continue to escape into Davis's unit or the common element areas of the building. He alternatively demanded that the Lamnins request their tenant(s) immediately to cease and desist from further smoking. Davis's lawyer asked the Lamnins to contact him with a proposal as to how they intended to eliminate the nuisance and continuing violation of condominium documents. The letter also was sent to Echo Valley, asserting that it served as a \"formal demand\" that Echo Valley take further action to provide relief, and warning that Davis intended to take legal action if the matter were not resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 17, 2017, Davis's former lawyer received a response from the Lamnins that denied any breach of condominium documents or the existence of a nuisance. The Lamnins took issue with the idea that any smoke emanating from their unit impaired or aggravated Davis's pre-existing health conditions, noting that neither the condominium's bylaws nor Michigan law prohibited smoking inside one's apartment. However, the Lamnins stated that Rule and her husband had notified them that they were willing to purchase and use an air purifier to clean the air in their unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Davis asserts that she discussed her asthma and expressed her concern about the smoking issue at multiple condo board meetings, and she made numerous verbal requests to O'Rourke and Echo Valley board members to address the problem. She also kept \"smoke logs\" beginning in May of 2017 documenting times when she smelled smoke. Former board president Tony Barker testified that when he was in Davis's hallway, he could smell a \"pretty significant amount of smoke,\" and that the smell was worse in Davis's building than in others. Barker admitted, though, that he could not speak to the odor in Davis's unit as he was never inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After this litigation commenced, the Echo Valley board proposed an amendment to the bylaws that would prohibit smoking on the property. Under Michigan law, the proposed amendment required two-thirds approval from all co-owners eligible to vote. The vote occurred on April 9, 2018, and the proposed amendment did not pass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Davis filed a four-count complaint against Echo Valley, Casa Bella, and the Lamnins, alleging violations of the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) (Count I) and Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (PWDCRA) (Count II), tortious nuisance (Count III), and breach of covenants (Count IV). Two months later, Davis filed her first motion for a preliminary injunction against the three defendants. At a status conference on November 7, 2017, the Court advised the plaintiff to amend the complaint to include the Lamnins' tenant. The next week, Davis filed an amended\n   complaint that named the tenant, Wanda Rule, as a defendant. Davis then filed a second motion for preliminary injunction against Ms. Rule. Davis did not serve the lawsuit on Rule until December 6, 2017. She did not serve notice of the preliminary injunction hearing on Rule until January 2, 2018. On January 5, 2018, the Court learned that Ms. Rule permanently moved out of Unit 115 on December 31, 2017. Rule never responded to the lawsuit, the parties agreed to resolve the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction by stipulation, and the Lamnins thereafter were dismissed from the case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 6, 2017, heating and cooling contractor Mark Clor installed a fresh air system on the plaintiff's furnace ductwork. Clor owns MC Home Heating &amp; Cooling in Garden City, Michigan, and he has been in the business for 35 years. Based on his own observations and his experience working on Echo Valley's heating and cooling systems since 2008, Clor testified that Davis's condominium does not share ventilation ductwork with any of the other three units in her building. Because the basement is open and all the furnaces and ducts were visible to him, he could say that each unit has its own furnace and ductwork that is separate from the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Characterizing Clor's testimony as an expert opinion, Davis argues that the Court should not let him testify (and presumably not consider his evidence on the summary judgment motions) because the defendants' answer to the complaint says that the ventilation systems are shared, which is a judicial admission foreclosing contrary evidence on the point; Clor's testimony is not based on sufficient facts or reliable methods (Clor did not examine a blueprint and was unable to point to any documentation to support his observation); the testimony is unreliable because it was contradicted by statements made by board members and was based on Clor's recollection from over a year ago; and the defendants did not furnish a timely expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   None of these arguments is persuasive.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Davis fails to recognize that the defendants filed an answer to the\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   complaint, which essentially nullifies its original answer as a pleading in the case. \" 'Generally, amended pleadings supersede original pleadings.' \"\n   <em>\n    Braden v.

An evidentiary admission does not preclude contrary proof to dispute a fact, and it certainly would not serve as a bar to Clor's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cadle Co. II v.

When Clor testified that the ventilation systems were separate, he was relating his own observation. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q.

The \"average juror\" would be capable of counting four furnaces, four heat runs, and four cold air return systems in the open basement and see that none of them connected to the others. Clor has specialized knowledge as a heating contractor of 35 years. But he did not have to employ that special knowledge in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Evidence Rule 701 authorizes non-expert witnesses to give opinions that are\n   \"(a) rationally based on the witness's perception; (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness's testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.\" Fed.

Other board members apparently gave their opinions that some of the units within a building shared ventilation systems. That testimony, however, merely establishes a fact dispute. It does not render Clor's testimony inadmissible, even if it is characterized as expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

Even if Clor's testimony can be characterized as opinion evidence under Evidence Rule 702, Clor was not required to prepare and sign a report because he was not \"retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case\" nor did his \"duties as the [defendants'] employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). Where a witness's \"opinion testimony arises not from his enlistment as an expert but, rather, from his ground-level involvement in the events giving rise to the litigation...he falls outside the compass of Rule 26(a)(2)(B).\"\n   <em>\n    Downey v.

Davis believes the first two closely related elements are met because without a prohibition on smoking, she does not have the equal opportunity to enjoy living in her unit and breathing without impairment. However, she previously has complained of non-tobacco smell aggravating her respiratory conditions. In January 2015, the plaintiff complained that the smell of her neighbor's cooking nearly caused her an asthma attack. The evidence Davis offers on this point is mostly anecdotal and conclusory.

This accommodation is necessary to ameliorate the conditions of Phyllis Davis's disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Abbo Letter, ECF No. 20-2, PageID.253. The\n   <em>\n    Matarese\n   </em>\n   court squarely rejected this type of conclusory opinion as insufficient to show that the proposed accommodation ameliorated the plaintiff's handicap specifically, and not just the burden shared by all individuals exposed to smoke. The plaintiff's complaints about other smells exacerbating her condition does not help her case. Without more, the plaintiff has not shown the accommodation she requested was necessary to afford her equal opportunity to enjoy her unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   More problematic is the reasonableness element. Davis argues that banning smoking throughout the complex is cost free. That argument, however, ignores the functional and administrative difficulties of such a measure. Davis demands that the Echo Valley Association Board adopt a position that the law does not permit. It is not illegal for an adult property owner to smoke in his or her own home. As noted earlier, nothing in the Echo Valley condominium documents prohibits smoking anywhere in the complex.

The proposal did not pass. In the wake of that decision, it is not reasonable to impose upon Echo Valley the administrative burden of implementing a use restriction upon co-owners in a way that violates the law. Imposing a smoking ban on all Echo Valley co-owners, the effect of which would be to restrict them from engaging in a lawful activity on their own property, cannot be accomplished in this case without a violation of existing law.

There is nothing else in the record to support Davis's claim that smoking in fact increases the rate of insurance. The board cannot be faulted for not instituting a no-smoking policy based on the possibility of increased insurance rates.

Mich. 2010) (Borman, J.), the plaintiff points to no evidence that cigarette smoke has infiltrated the ventilation system of her unit, or that any of the units have not been maintained in a safe, clean, or sanitary condition. In fact, Davis has not definitively identified any particular source of secondhand smoke at Echo Valley. On April 4, 2018, plaintiff's counsel represented to defense counsel that they were \"currently investigating the source of the smoke, and believe it may be coming from unit 114.\" Apr. 4, 2018 email, ECF No. 75-25, PageID.2403.

The bylaws do not define those terms; however, the parties apparently agree that tort principles supply the appropriate meaning. Davis relies exclusively on the deposition testimony of board members Genovese and Williams to support her position, but a closer reading of that testimony shows these board members did not admit violations of the bylaws, as the plaintiff attempts to represent. Genovese testified that cigarette smoke \"can be\" considered a nuisance for those who do not smoke, and Williams answered in the affirmative when asked if cigarette smoke annoyed her. But those acknowledgments about smoking in the abstract alone do not satisfy the plaintiff's burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Although Michigan courts have not addressed whether infiltration of secondhand smoke can be considered a nuisance, several courts around the country have weighed in on the issue. Although Davis did not cite any supporting authority in her summary judgment motion papers, she did refer in her motion for preliminary injunction to five decisions in support of her argument that cigarette smoke might be considered a private nuisance. None of them are particularly helpful to her position, since those decisions depend on the facts peculiar to each case, and Davis has not offered similar or analogous facts on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The first case,\n   <em>\n    Chauncey v.

Sup. App. Term 2011), for instance, the court concluded the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action for private nuisance because, \"[c]ritically, defendants were not\n   prohibited from smoking inside their apartment by any existing statute, condominium rule or bylaw. Nor was there any statute, rule or bylaw imposing upon defendants an obligation to ensure that their cigarette smoke did not drift into other residences.\" The plaintiffs alleged that their neighbors' excessive smoking infiltrated the plaintiffs' walls, causing them personal injuries, and that the condition was exacerbated by building-wide ventilation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n    927 N.Y.S.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court expressed sympathy for the plaintiffs' apparent discomfort, but it could not avoid the conclusion that \"the law of private nuisance would be stretched beyond its breaking point if we were to allow a means of recovering damages when a neighbor merely smokes inside his or her own apartment in a multiple dwelling building.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n    927 N.Y.S.2d at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the court concluded that \"in the absence of a controlling statute, bylaw or rule imposing a duty, public policy issues militate against a private cause of action under these factual circumstances for secondhand smoke infiltration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775059\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/32/12/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Other courts have reached the same conclusions.

The Michigan Clean Indoor Air Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20333.12601\">\n    Mich. Comp.

The legislature has not yet limited a person's right to smoke in his or her own home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Here, the plaintiff does not point to any specific evidence of the extent or amount of secondhand smoke being generated at Echo Valley, or any evidence of the extent of harm to her body. She mentions elsewhere in her briefing that other residents have complained about smoking at Echo Valley, but she has not presented that information in such a way that would give the Court a basis to depart from the reasoning of other courts. General observations about smoking at hotels or other residences do not establish that smoking at Echo Valley is so unreasonable as to trigger the Board's enforcement obligation under the bylaws. There is nothing that suggests that the smoking habits of the residents of Echo Valley are unique or that they present any special danger to the plaintiff. It is, of course, possible to imagine an extreme scenario where cigarette smoke could be considered a nuisance\n   or annoyance, as illustrated by some of the cases the plaintiff cited. But without some evidence that the cigarette smoke concentration and accompanying odors extend beyond \"the annoyances one must endure in a multiple dwelling building,\" Davis cannot show that the secondhand smoke at Echo Valley constitutes an \"offensive activity,\" \"an annoyance or a nuisance\" that the Board is compelled to eradicate through its contractual enforcement powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The defendants, therefore, are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law on Count IV of the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The plaintiff has not offered sufficient justification to exclude the testimony of Mark Clor.
