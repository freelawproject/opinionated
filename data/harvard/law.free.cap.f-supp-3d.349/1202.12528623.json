CORRIGAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this \u00a7 1983 civil rights and state wrongful death case, the Court must determine whether a law enforcement officer who prevents civilian bystanders from performing CPR on a suicidal teenager without explanation, is nonetheless entitled to qualified and statutory immunity. After Plaintiff Jolene Waldron's fourteen-year-old son, Anthony Ybarra, Jr., hung himself, neighbors and family cut him down and began administering CPR-until Defendant Deputy Gregory Spicher arrived and ordered them to stop. Anthony subsequently died, and Waldron filed suit against Spicher in his individual capacity and against the Sheriff of Marion County, now Billy Woods, in his official capacity. Waldron has asserted a \u00a7 1983 claim against Spicher, and Florida wrongful death claims against Spicher and Woods. Currently before the Court are Spicher's Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 48), Woods's Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 45), Defendants' Joint Motion to Exclude the Opinions of the Plaintiff's Expert Mazyar Rouhani, M.D., (Doc. 41), and Waldron's Motion to Strike or Limit Opinion Testimony Regarding Defendants' Expert, Dr. Kris Sperry, (Doc. 42). The Court received responses to each motion. (Docs. 43; 44; 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 14, 2014, Anthony was informed that he was no longer allowed to attend Belleview High School.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 47-1 at 44-47). The news upset Anthony, and on the ride home he and his mother picked up Anthony's younger sister, but no one spoke about the meeting. (Doc. 47-1 at 61-64, 124-26). They arrived home around 3:00 p.m., (Doc. 47-1 at 61-62), but Waldron left around 3:40 p.m. to pick up her other son from school. (Doc. 47-1 at 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The school was close by, and she returned home around 3:50 p.m. (Doc. 47-1 at 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Waldron noticed that Anthony was not in the living room or kitchen, so she asked Anthony's sister where he went. (Doc. 47-1 at 64). She stated that Anthony had run outside as soon as Waldron had left. (Doc. 47-1 at 64). Waldron thought that Anthony was trying to clear his head, so after yelling for him with no response, she went inside to make a sandwich. (Doc. 47-1 at 65-66). Soon thereafter, Anthony's younger brother said that he could see Anthony out his bedroom window, but that Anthony's feet were not touching the ground. (Doc. 47-1 at 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Waldron immediately ran outside followed by her two other children, where she found Anthony hanging from a tree by a ligature created from two belts tied together. (Doc. 47-1 at 67-68). When she reached him, Anthony was still swaying. (Doc. 47-1 at 72-73). Anthony's brother ran back to the house to get Waldron's phone, but he could not find it. (Doc. 47-1 at 70). So Waldron ran back to the house and got her phone, but her call to 911 was disconnected. (Doc. 47-1 at 69). Anthony's brother ran and got a knife to cut Anthony down, but he could not reach the belts. (Doc. 47-1 at 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During this time, Waldron's neighbors, Christina and Ronald Jay Timson, heard her screams and came over. (Doc. 47-1 at 71-72). It was approximately one minute from when Mr. Timson originally heard Waldron's screams to when he arrived at the scene. (Doc. 48-2 at 13). Mrs. Timson called 911, (Doc. 52), while Mr. Timson, a former paramedic, summoned Waldron to get a knife so he could cut Anthony down. (Docs. 47-1 at 72; 48-1 at 12). Waldron did not see the knife that Anthony's brother had retrieved, so she ran back to her house and grabbed a butcher knife, which Mr. Timson used to free Anthony from the ligature. (Docs. 47-1 at 71-72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When they cut Anthony down, Waldron stated that he was not cyanotic,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and after Mr. Timson began CPR, Waldron observed Anthony exhale at least once. (Doc. 47-1 at 72-73). Mr. Timson checked Anthony's body temperature, airway, and pulse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 48-2 at 13). Mr. Timson could not tell if Anthony was cyanotic because of Anthony's ethnicity, which he described as some type of \"African-American descent ... some type of nonwhite ethnicity.\" (Doc. 48-2 at 13). He observed that Anthony had a very faint pulse on his carotid artery and was not cold to the touch. (Doc. 48-2 at 14, 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While Mr. Timson was performing CPR, Waldron called Karen VanEs, her boyfriend's mother, who was a nurse and lived nearby. (Doc. 47-1 at 72-73). Mrs. VanEs remembers her husband, Steven VanEs, answering the phone at 4:04 p.m. (Doc. 48-3 at 25). She remembered the specific time because she had been working nights and was awoken by the sound of someone yelling on the phone. (Doc. 48-3 at 25). Mr. and Mrs. VanEs arrived less than three minutes later, (Doc. 48-3 at 26), and Mrs. VanEs jumped out of the car and began assisting Mr. Timson with CPR. (Doc. 47-1 at 76). The 911 recording indicates that Mr. Timson performed CPR for at least four minutes before Mrs. VanEs arrived. (Doc. 51). Mrs. VanEs stated that when\n   she arrived, Anthony was not blue and was warm. (Doc. 48-3 at 54-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A few minutes after Mrs. VanEs reached Anthony, Deputy Spicher arrived on scene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 48-3 at 36; 47-1 at 77). Waldron testified that Spicher walked up to the scene, and without examining Anthony, ordered Mrs. VanEs and Mr. Timson to stop CPR. (Doc. 47-1 at 78, 140-41). According to Waldron, Spicher's initial command fell on deaf ears, until he reiterated, \"I said stop and back away.\" (Doc. 47-1 at 79, 142). Mr. Timson also recalled that Spicher showed up, surveyed the scene, and asked that he and Mrs. VanEs step away. (Doc. 48-2 at 21). Mrs. VanEs remembers Spicher telling her and Mr. Timson to step away, but that she protested, claiming she felt a radial pulse. (Doc. 48-3 at 36- 37). Spicher told her she felt a pulse because she was doing CPR. (Doc. 48-3 at 37). Mr. VanEs remembers walking up to Anthony at the moment Spicher told Mrs. VanEs and Mr. Timson to stop CPR, and in response to Mrs. VanEs's objection he heard Spicher respond: \"I said to stop.\" (Doc. 48-4 at 16-17). At that point, Mrs. VanEs and Mr. Timson ceased CPR, (Doc. 48-2 at 22), and Mr. VanEs heard Spicher call over his radio that it was a 10-7 and not to rush,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 48-4 at 17). Mrs. Timson also saw Mr. Timson back away from Anthony as soon as Spicher arrived, but she did not hear what was said. (Doc. 48-1 at 17). No one saw Spicher check Anthony for signs of life. (Docs. 47-1 at 78, 140- 41; 48-2 at 21; 48-3 at 69; 48-4 at 33-34; 48-5 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A short but indeterminate amount of time later,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a fire truck arrived, followed shortly after by an ambulance. The team of EMTs from the firetruck were directed to Anthony. (Docs. 48-3 at 38; 48-6 at 16). However, Spicher stopped the group and\n   only allowed EMT Warren to approach Anthony. (Docs. 47-1 at 82; 48-6 at 16). Warren physically assessed Anthony and noted that he was severely cyanotic, his neck was elongated, his arms, legs, neck, back, and abdomen were warm, and he had no lividity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 48-6 at 17-19, 41). Warren then used his Lifepak 12 monitor via fast patches to determine that Anthony had a pulseless electrical activity (\"PEA\") rhythm of twenty-four beats per minute. (Doc. 48-6 at 16, 20-21); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47-1 at 82).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon discovering that Anthony had a PEA, Warren attempted to have Spicher allow Lieutenant Kevin Christensen, the senior paramedic, to come over to Anthony, but Spicher was on the phone and did not hear Warren. (Doc. 48-6 at 23). Warren yelled louder, which alerted Christensen, and he immediately went to Warren and Anthony. (Doc. 48-6 at 23). The two began CPR, and the remaining paramedic from Warren's group, and the ambulance's rescue crew, went to assist. (Doc. 48-6 at 23). The EMTs placed Anthony on a stretcher and transported him via ambulance to The Villages Regional Hospital. (Doc. 48-6 at 24). On the way to the hospital, Anthony sustained return of spontaneous circulation (\"ROSC\"). (Doc. 48-6 at 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the ambulance departed, Spicher approached Waldron and told her: \"I don't want to get your hopes up, but they found a pulse.\" (Doc. 47-1 at 83). Later at the hospital, Spicher told Waldron: \"It could have been worse; there could have been a loaded gun in the house.\" (Doc. 47-1 at 87). Anthony was air lifted to Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida, where he survived for more than a week. (Doc. 47-1 at 87-88). But unfortunately, Anthony died without regaining consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Spicher's recollection of several important events differs from other witnesses'. First, Spicher states that he checked Anthony for signs of life. (Docs. 48-8 at 2-3; 54-1 at 9, 13). Spicher claims that Anthony was very cyanotic, had no carotid pulse, had pooling and muddling of the blood along his chest and back, and had cold limbs. (Docs. 48-8 at 2-3; 54-1 at 13). Second, although Spicher agreed that he did not have the authority to declare someone deceased, he claims it was a custom for Marion County Sheriff's Office deputies to do so. (Doc. 54-1 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the incident, the Marion County Sheriff's Office conducted an Internal Affairs investigation which concluded that \"Spicher's actions at the time of his arrival, in as far as his commands to civilians, were not proper as to his role of a law enforcement officer and the Marion County Sheriff's Office.\" (Doc. 45-2 at 15). Additionally, EMT Warren stated that Anthony did not meet the \"death-in-the-field\" protocol because Anthony had cardiac activity. (Doc. 48-6 at 50). In support of its decision, the Internal Affairs report states: \"CPR training will teach you that you don't cease CPR once it begins, unless the person administering it is relieved by medical personnel or becomes exhausted. Deputy Spicher made, what he believed at the time, a correct decision when giving the order [to cease CPR]; however, he lacked the facts to do so.\" (Doc. 45-2 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Waldron filed a three-count Amended Complaint, alleging medical indifference in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Spicher (Count I), wrongful death under Florida law against Woods (Count II), and wrongful death under Florida law against Spicher (Count III). (Doc. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Spicher seeks summary judgment in his favor, claiming he is entitled to qualified immunity because the undisputed material facts show that he did not violate a clearly established constitutional right. (Doc. 48 at 2). Additionally, Spicher asserts that he is entitled to statutory immunity on the Florida wrongful death claim, and that the evidence fails to support a claim for punitive damages. (Doc. 48 at 2). Woods claims that Spicher was not negligent, and therefore he cannot be vicariously liable, or alternatively, that he is entitled to statutory immunity. (Doc. 45 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Deputy Spicher's Qualified Immunity Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Spicher claims that he is entitled to qualified immunity because his actions did not amount to deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. (Doc. 48 at 15). Further, he asserts that his actions were reasonable under the circumstances and that the brief time CPR was halted does not shock the conscience. (Doc. 48 at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions.

In complete disregard of Anthony's serious medical needs, Spicher arrived on scene and, without assessing Anthony, ordered Mr. Timson and Mrs. VanEs to stop CPR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 7-1 at 78, 140-41; 47-1 at 78-79, 140-42; 48-2 at 21; 48-3 at 36-37, 69; 48-4 at 16-17, 33-34; 48-5 at 18).

However, even if Spicher had the authority to do so, he did not have the facts necessary to declare Anthony dead, and nothing prevented his\n   further triage of Anthony.

(Doc. 41 at 9-13). Rouhani is an emergency medicine physician and has chaired and directed emergency medicine\n   departments at several healthcare institutions. (Doc. 43-1). He has also taught at several medical schools and has conducted medical research. (Doc. 43-1 at 2-3). His primary opinion is \"that Anthony Ybarra would have survived the hanging and may have been neurologically intact if he would have continued to receive continuous CPR by bystander and EMS.\" (Doc. 41-1 at 3). However, Defendants assert that this opinion has not been tested, was not subjected to peer review, is unsupportable because Rouhani's experience concerning hanging victims is lacking, and is only based on the temporal relationship of Spicher's command to Anthony's death, which without more is insufficient. (Doc. 41 at 9-12).

Defendants assert that Rouhani's opinions are inadmissible because they are based on flawed reasoning and speculation. (Doc. 41 at 5). First, they argue that Rouhani has made no assumption about how long Anthony was hanging, but that such information is critical to determine whether Anthony could have survived had he received continuous CPR. (Doc. 41 at 5-6). However, Rouhani stated that he did not need to make an assumption about how long Anthony had been hanging because his opinions were based on Anthony's condition as relayed by the bystanders, paramedics, and hospital personnel. (Doc. 41-2 at 58). Rouhani stated that Anthony's legs were moving when he was found, (Doc. 41-2 at 55-56); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47-1 at 72-73 (stating that Anthony was still swaying when his mother reached him) ), and that he did not have lividity or pooling, (Doc. 41-2 at 118). These two factors, along with others, indicate to Rouhani that Anthony had not been hanging for a prolonged period. (Doc. 41-2 at 55-56). Rouhani, based on his experience, believes that regardless of how long Anthony was actually hanging, his condition when found indicates that he could have survived had he received continuous CPR and other hospital care. (Docs. 41-1; 42-1 at 55-56, 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, Defendants contend that Rouhani's opinions are speculative and flawed because \"Rouhani cannot express any opinion within either a reasonable degree of probability or certainty as to what [Anthony's] condition would have been if CPR would have continued.\" (Doc. 41 at 7). Defendants are correct in that Rouhani cannot put a numerical probability on Anthony's survival had CPR been continuous. However, Rouhani states that if you have two victims who go into cardiac arrest : \"If you get continuous CPR as opposed to interrupted CPR, the patient with continuous CPR would have a better neurologic outcome and perhaps survive and walk out of the hospital. If you have interrupted CPR, all the studies show that you have a worse outcome.\" (Doc. 41-2 at 67). Rouhani relies on several studies that provide statistics for resuscitation efforts and hospital care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 41-1 at 3; 41-2 at 85-86);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    387 F.3d at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that an\n   expert's opinion on an \"unclear, imprecise and ill-defined\" probability was properly excluded because the expert could offer no reliable foundation or basis for his opinion). Therefore, Rouhani has \"good grounds\" for his opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    at 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Next, Defendants contend that Rouhani's opinions are unreliable because they have not been tested and were not subject to peer review. (Doc. 41 at 9). However, testing or peer review of a scientific opinion is not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    387 F.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors are illustrative and not exhaustive);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p593\">\n    509 U.S. at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p593\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that testing and peer review are \"relevant, though not dispositive, consideration[s] in assessing\" the reliability of scientific expert evidence). Here, Rouhani relied on eight studies and his professional experience to reach his opinions, (Doc. 41-2 at 82-89), and Defendants have not argued that these studies lack scientific validity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p593\">\n    509 U.S. at 593-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p593\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Lastly, Defendants attack the reliability of Rouhani's opinions on the basis that they are founded on unreliable methodology. (Doc. 41 at 10). Specifically, Defendants contend that: (1) Rouhani's limited experience with hanging victims is insufficient to form the basis of his opinion; and (2) Rouhani's opinion cannot establish causation solely because Spicher's command was given in close temporal proximity to Anthony's death. (Doc. 41 at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants state that \"Rouhani's limited experience with hanging resuscitations, casual conversation with another medical professional cannot [sic] be a widespread accepted theory for offering such speculative opinions.\" (Doc. 41 at 11). Defendants fail to mention the eight cited studies in Rouhani's report, (Doc. 41-1 at 4-5), and the hundreds of other reports and specialized knowledge that Rouhani relied upon, (Docs. 41-2 at 21, 88, 113; 43-1 at 2-3). It is the combination of Rouhani's experience and these studies that form the basis of his opinions. The director of the emergency medicine department at a renowned hospital has a vested interest in understanding the importance of administering continuous CPR, even if he is unable to observe those patients' outcomes because they are elevated to higher levels of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that the temporal proximity of Spicher's actions to Anthony's death is insufficient to establish that Spicher's actions caused Anthony's death. (Doc. 41 at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Guinn v. AstraZeneca Pharm. LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3921175\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1245/#p1254\">\n    602 F.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1254 (11th Cir. 2010) ). However, this proposition from\n   <em>\n    Guinn\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. To the contrary here, the temporal proximity of Spicher's actions to Anthony's death is vital to causation. The parties dispute whether Anthony could have lived had Spicher not interrupted CPR, and the timing of Spicher's actions is a disputed material fact. Thus, Rouhani can appropriately formulate his opinions from the timeline of events in concert with his experience and scientific research. Therefore, Rouhani's opinions are reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Rouhani's opinions will assist the trier of fact\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To assist the trier of fact, expert testimony must concern matters beyond the understanding of the average juror.\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    387 F.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants contend that Rouhani's opinions should be excluded as unhelpful to the jury because he improperly opines on the credibility of other witnesses. (Doc. 41 at 13). However, such contentions are not reasons to exclude his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Rouhani's opinions concerning the harms of interrupting CPR are not within the knowledge of an average juror and are therefore helpful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    387 F.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rouhani states in his deposition that he disbelieved some of Spicher's statements\n   because they were contradicted by other evidence in the case. (Doc. 41-2 at 60-62).

Throughout his career, Sperry saw more than one thousand hanging deaths and possibly two thousand. (Doc. 45-1 at 41). He has been a professor in the pathology department at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, and the Medical College of Georgia. (Doc. 44-1 at 2-3). Sperry has reviewed approximately thirty to fifty cases involving the hanging of an individual under the age of eighteen. (Doc. 45-1 at 47-48). He has published articles and given lectures on asphyxiation. (Doc. 44-1 at 7-23). Sperry's experience makes him qualified to render an opinion on when and how Anthony died, something he did in the regular course of his employment of more than thirty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Sperry's opinions are reliable\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Waldron asserts that Sperry's opinions are unreliable because he does not show how his experience supports his conclusions and that he fails to cite any studies. (Doc. 42 at 5-8). Defendants contend that Sperry explains how his experience led to his opinions. (Doc. 44 at 11-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Sperry's opinion that Anthony had sustained irreversible brain death before Spicher arrived is admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    387 F.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sperry said that he reviewed medical records, autopsy reports, and tissue slides to determine the cause and manner of death, an approach he used more than one thousand times during his career. (Doc. 45-1 at 49). His ample experience in determining the manner and cause of death in hangings using the same procedures here makes his opinions reliable. (Doc. 45-1 at 41, 47-48). Waldron also attacks Sperry's statement that \"[f]or many years the survival in these cases was dismal, being consistently less than 5%.\" (Doc. 42-1 at 6). Waldron asserts that Sperry could not name any study that supports that statistic. (Doc. 42 at 8-9). Defendants contend that Sperry relies upon many medical studies he has read, and that Waldron failed to ask for the articles during Sperry's deposition or through discovery. (Doc. 44 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Sperry will need to further explain the basis for his statistical opinions if they are to be admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1261\">\n    387 F.3d at 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite Defendants' contention that Waldron had an opportunity to ask Sperry about the studies and failed, the burden of proving an expert's reliability is on the party offering his opinions-in this case Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook ex rel.

But she was not documenting when events occurred, and when pressed in her deposition could only say that it was a short while. (Doc. 47-1 at 79). Mrs. Timson said it was \"minutes\" from when Spicher arrived until the EMTs arrived. (Doc. 48-1 at 17). Mr. Timson said it was \"within a minute.\" (Doc. 48-2 at 23).

It is also unclear at what time Spicher declared a \"signal 7\"-it could have been at 4:07:34 p.m. or at 4:08:14 p.m. (Doc. 50-1 at 2). Defendants claim that the \"signal 7\" was called in at 4:08:14.

Third, the panel in\n    <em>\n     Cottrell\n    </em>\n    found no deliberate indifference where the plaintiff failed to prove the \"subjective intent element prescribed in\n    <em>\n     Farmer\n    </em>\n    \" and, therefore, did not reach whether\n    <em>\n     Farmer\n    </em>\n    requires \"more than mere negligence\" or \"more than gross negligence.\"\n    <em>\n     Cottrell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571919\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/1480/#p1490\">\n     85 F.3d at 1491-92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
