WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff The Pike Company (\"Pike\") commenced this action on April 20, 2018, against Defendant Tri-Krete Limited (\"Tri-Krete\") for breach of contract. (Dkt. 1). On June 25, 2018, Tri-Krete filed an Answer, denying all material allegations in the Complaint and setting forth various affirmative defenses. (Dkt. 5). Tri-Krete also asserted several counterclaims against Pike, which included common law causes of action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, and violations of the New York Prompt Payment Act, N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7\u00a7 756 - 758 (\"PPA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Contemporaneously with the filing of its Answer, Tri-Krete filed a motion to stay this action and to compel arbitration based upon the alleged PPA violations. (Dkt. 7). Within the days thereafter, Pike responded with a motion to stay arbitration. (Dkt. 9). Pike subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the arbitration proceedings. (Dkt. 22). For the following reasons, Tri-Krete's motion to stay this action and compel arbitration (Dkt. 7) is granted, Pike's motion to stay arbitration (Dkt. 9) is denied, and Pike's motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 22) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pike served as the construction manager contractor with Marist College on a campus housing project located in Poughkeepsie, New York (the \"Marist Project\"). (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3). Pike awarded Tri-Krete a subcontract to complete architectural precast work for the Marist Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). The parties executed a Master Subcontract Agreement and a Work Order, dated October 2, 2015, and June 14, 2016, respectively (collectively, the \"Subcontract\"), which governed their relationship as it related to the Marist Project. (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Subcontract \"required payment applications to be submitted by uploading the application to an online invoicing system called Textura.\" (Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 at 30 (\"Unless otherwise directed or authorized, in writing, by Contractor, all Applications for Payment and supporting documents for Subcontractor and its sub-subcontractors and suppliers, shall be in electronic format and shall be submitted to Contractor using the\n   <em>\n    Textura\n   </em>\n   Payment Management System....\") ). Pike needed to make the Textura system accessible every month so that Tri-Krete could submit the required payment application by the 25th day of that month. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 9). According to Pike, \"[s]ubcontractors submit 'pencil copies' of their payment applications via Textura,\" which then generate electronic reports. (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 9). Once submitted, \"[t]he pencil copy is reviewed by Pike,\" and \"[i]f appropriate, the pencil copy is approved in the system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pike would also notify Tri-Krete if the \"invoice require[d] any modification.\" (Dkt. 11 at 30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Tri-Krete's Vice President, Adam Bombini (\"Bombini\"), the company submitted Payment Application 12 (\"App 12\") and Payment Application 13 (\"App 13\") to the Textura system on June 24, 2017, and July 22, 2017, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 25). Bombini states that Pike never asked for additional information nor did it expressly reject App 12 or App 13. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pike's Project Director, Daniel L. DeCarlo (\"DeCarlo\"), and Pike's Senior Project Manager, Gloria Ciminelli (\"Ciminelli\"), dispute the veracity of these submission dates, and instead they contend that App 12 and App 13 were both submitted on July 19, 2017. (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 10; Dkt. 34-1 at \u00b6 15). Furthermore, DeCarlo also states that on July 24, 2017, Pike informed Tri-Krete that it was in default of certain obligations under the Subcontract, and that Pike was incurring \"significant expenses and damages that exceeded Tri-Krete's pending payment application.\" (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 10-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, DeCarlo refers to email communications, taking place between August 3, 2017, and August 4, 2017, in which he demanded that Bombini \"immediately deliver a detailed accounts receivable/payable report for all Tri-Krete sub-subcontractors, vendors and suppliers, including documentation showing any unpaid cost liabilities related to Tri-Krete's performance.\" (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 12). DeCarlo insists that due to \"the pending notices of default\" and his unsatisfied demand for certain documentation, Tri-Krete \"was clearly on notice that its payment application No. 12 was not approved and was disputed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After July 2017, the parties apparently abandoned the Textura invoicing system. According to Bombini, Pike \"locked Tri-Krete out of Textura so Tri-Krete could not submit [invoices 8880, 8893, 8894, 8915, and 8916] via Textura.\" (Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 102). According to Ciminelli, Tri-Krete \"was not issued an invitation through Textura to submit further payment applications\" due to Tri-Krete's \"continued defaults, its failure to provide requested information, the unapproved status [of App 12 and App 13], and Pike's resulting damages.\" (Dkt. 34-1 at \u00b6 16). DeCarlo also avers that \"Pike has no record of ever having received\" invoices 8880, 8893, 8894, 8915, or 8916 in 2017, and that, in any event, \"these invoices were not the form of payment application used on the Project, do not include all of the necessary documentation to establish Tri-Krete's entitlement to payment, and do not constitute proper payment applications under the terms of the Subcontract.\" (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between May 9, 2017, and September 12, 2017, Tri-Krete submitted approximately 20 requests for contract revisions to Pike, asking for Pike to issue a \"change order\" modifying the Subcontract due to additional work completed by Tri-Krete. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at 8-20). During this period, Tri-Krete received a letter from Pike, dated August 25, 2017, which denied contract revision numbers 005, 006, 007, 008, 010, and 018 (as it pertained to \"Credit for UCP/Slaw Panels\"). (Dkt. 32-17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 48). According to Bombini, Tri-Krete received no other correspondence rejecting any of the requests for contract revisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 101). It also appears that Tri-Krete memorialized its request for these contract revisions in a single invoiced submission, dated December 7, 2017, and identified as invoice number 8946. (Dkt. 32-34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-1 at \u00b6 98). On behalf of Pike, DeCarlo contends that these contract revisions \"are unapproved change order requests and claims that have been denied by Pike as untimely, unsupported and barred by the terms of\n   the Subcontract,\" and these claims \"do not constitute proper and approved payment applications under Tri-Krete's Subcontract.\" (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-1 at (Cimminelli averring that by December 7, 2017, \"Tri-Krete was well aware ... that [Pike] had rejected, expressly or by the terms of the [S]ubcontract, each of the requests for change order listed\" in invoice number 8946) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 20, 2018, Pike commenced this action alleging breach of the parties' Subcontract. (Dkt. 1). By letter dated May 8, 2018, Tri-Krete notified Pike of various alleged violations of the PPA. (Dkt. 7-5). Tri-Krete asserted, among other things, that Pike had \"unreasonably withheld approval\" of App 12, App 13, invoice numbers 8880, 8893, 8894, 8915, and 8916, and all requested contract revisions, and that Pike had \"failed to give Tri-Krete a written notice of withholding specifying conditions for withholding payment and identifying the amount to be withheld.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Tri-Krete also expressed its intention to refer the matter to the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") for expedited arbitration if the parties could not resolve the purported violations within 15 days of Pike's receipt of the letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Tri-Krete filed a Demand for Arbitration with the AAA on June 11, 2018, and notified Pike the next day. (Dkt. 7-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 25, 2018, Tri-Krete filed its Answer in this action, denying all material allegations in the Complaint, setting forth various affirmative defenses, and asserting several counterclaims against Pike, which included causes of action for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violation of the PPA. (Dkt. 5). On the same day, Tri-Krete filed the pending motion to stay this action and to compel arbitration of its PPA claims. (Dkt. 7). On July 7, 2018, Pike filed the pending motion to stay arbitration (Dkt. 9), arguing that the PPA's arbitration provision did not apply to Tri-Krete's claims (Dkt. 9-1). On August 29, 2018, Pike filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the Court enjoin any further arbitration proceedings. (Dkt. 22). Each party opposed the other's respective motions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14; Dkt. 15; Dkt. 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 19, 2018, the Court heard oral argument. (Dkt. 27; Dkt. 28). The Court requested further submissions; Tri-Krete filed an affidavit with additional exhibit submissions on October 2, 2018 (Dkt. 29; Dkt. 32; Dkt. 33), and Pike filed two responsive affidavits and associated exhibits on October 15, 2018 (Dkt. 34). A telephone status conference was held on October 17, 2018 (Dkt. 37), and on October 25, 2018, Pike filed a further affidavit and letter (Dkt. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Pike's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Subcontract expressly provides Pike with the option of accepting or rejecting any demand for arbitration for \"[a]ll claims, disputes and other matters in question between [Tri-Krete] and [Pike] arising out of or related to the Subcontract....\" (Dkt. 11 at 60-61;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20756\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If a demand for arbitration is filed by [Tri-Krete], [Pike] shall advise [Tri-Krete], within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such a demand for arbitration, if [Pike] exercises the option to arbitrate or rejects arbitration; such election, once made, shall be binding.\") ).

Bill Jacket, 2009 A.B. 6493, Ch. 417. Furthermore, an extensive analysis by a court of whether the PPA has been violated,\n   and any related affirmative defenses, would leave very little for an arbitration panel to resolve. It is doubtful that the state legislature contemplated that the AAA would play so minimal a role in resolving alleged PPA violations when the aggrieved party demands expedited arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, the material question before this Court is whether the prerequisites of \u00a7 756b(3) have been satisfied. Pike does not dispute receipt of Tri-Krete's May 8, 2018, letter (Dkt. 9-2 at \u00b6 7), which outlines various alleged PPA violations, including that Pike \"unreasonably withheld approval\" of App 12, App 13, invoices 8880, 8893, 8894, 8915, and 8916, and the requested contract revisions numbered one through twenty (Dkt. 7-5);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20756\">\n    N.Y.

Tri-Krete also notified Pike that the parties were \"obliged to attempt to resolve the above-referenced violations,\" and requested that Pike or its attorneys contact Tri-Krete and/or its attorneys. (Dkt. 7-5 at 1). Tri-Krete further indicated that it intended to refer the matter to the AAA for expedited arbitration if the parties were unable to resolve the matter within 15 days from the date Pike received the letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). There is no question that the disputes were not resolved and Tri-Krete referred its alleged PPA violations to the AAA \"not less than fifteen days of the receipt of third party verification of delivery of the complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20756\">\n    N.Y.

Accordingly, Pike's motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 22) is denied on the ground that the alleged PPA violations are arbitrable before the AAA panel, and thus, Pike has not demonstrated that irreparable harm will result from compelling continued arbitration proceedings. Furthermore, to the extent Tri-Krete's motion to compel arbitration seeks to arbitrate the alleged PPA violations now pending before the AAA (Dkt. 7), its motion is granted, and Pike's competing motion to stay that arbitration (Dkt. 9) is denied. Importantly, the Court's conclusion should not be interpreted as endorsing Tri-Krete's position that it is entitled to payment of any of the amounts asserted as due from Pike. As discussed in further detail below, the merits of Tri-Krete's claims and Pike's defenses to those claims must be evaluated, at least in the first instance, through arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Issues Not Subject to Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court pauses to emphasize that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   arbitrable claims-and the only claims referred to arbitration-are the alleged PPA violations set forth in the May 8, 2018, letter and encompassed by Tri-Krete's fourth counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 5 at 6-7; Dkt. 7-5). To be sure, Tri-Krete's counterclaims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and unpaid labor and materials seek similar, if not identical, monetary relief as that which is sought by its fourth counterclaim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 5 at 4-8). However, Tri-Krete's first, second, and third counterclaims are not subject to resolution in arbitration, as the AAA's authority to issue an arbitral award is limited to the \"alleged violation\" of the PPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Bus.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20756\">\n    N.Y.

The merits of those\n   remaining counterclaims must instead be resolved through litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Pike's breach of contract cause of action is also not arbitrable. While Pike may argue to the AAA panel that Tri-Krete's purported breaches of the Subcontract represent defenses to its obligations under the PPA, the arbitral opinion and award should be based upon Pike's compliance or non-compliance with the PPA. In other words, the AAA panel is without jurisdiction to determine whether Pike has asserted a meritorious common law cause of action for breach of contract. This is so even if the AAA panel finds it necessary to determine whether Tri-Krete materially breached the Subcontract in order to resolve the alleged PPA violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     This Action Will be Staved Pending Arbitration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Having determined that some, but not all, of the claims before this Court are subject to arbitration, the Court must now decide whether to stay the balance of this matter pending the resolution of the arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JLM Indus., Inc. v.

Apr. 15, 2011) (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Aside from arguing, in general, that a stay of this action would be in the interests of judicial economy (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7-2 at 7-8), Tri-Krete offers little reason for this Court to find a stay to be justified. Nonetheless, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court will stay this action for the following reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cosmotek Mumessillik Ve Ticaret Ltd. Sirkketi v.

(Dkt. 1). Whether Tri-Krete has breached the Subcontract raises an issue that is \"common to the arbitration and the court proceeding\" because Pike has raised this issue as a defense to its obligations under the PPA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 9-1 at 7). Indeed, while the arbitration will not reach the merits of Pike's breach of contract claim, it may \"finally determine\" the factual issue of whether a breach of the Subcontract occurred in deciding whether Pike has a viable defense to the alleged PPA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Tri-Krete has also asserted several counterclaims arising from Pike's alleged breaches of the Subcontract and alleged unjust enrichment derived from the labor and materials supplied by Tri-Krete. (Dkt. 5 at 4-6). The resolution of the alleged PPA violations may provide the Court with insight as to whether Pike failed to make payments owed to Tri-Krete pursuant to the billing cycle established under the Subcontract, and as such, could have significant bearing on at least some of Tri-Krete's non-arbitrable allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hikers Indus., Inc. v.
