(\"Motion,\" D.E. 31.) Plaintiff Julie Lienemann filed a response on September 27, 2018, (\"Response,\" D.E. 41), to which Cruise Ship Excursions, Inc. filed a Reply on October 4, 2018, (\"Reply,\" D.E. 45). Upon review of the Motion, Response, Reply, and the record, the Court finds as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Cruise Ship Excursions, Inc. (\"Defendant\") is a U.S. Virgin Islands corporation with its principal place of business located in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Carnival is a Panamanian corporation with its principal place of business located in Miami, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 1, 2003, Defendant and Carnival entered into a Standard Shore Excursion Independent Contractor Agreement. (\"Agreement,\" D.E. 10-1 at 6-9.) Pursuant to this Agreement, Carnival agreed to sell various catamaran excursion tickets to its passengers and Defendant agreed to provide excursions to Carnival's passengers. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 10.) The Agreement contains a consent to jurisdiction provision which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Litigation\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ...

The Amended Complaint alleges that the Agreement \"involved consideration not less than $250,000, or was related to an obligation arising out of a transaction involving in the [aggregate] not less than $250,000.\" (D.E. 27 \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that in May 2017, Plaintiff suffered significant injuries while aboard a catamaran owned by Defendant while participating in an excursion as part of her Carnival cruise vacation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13.) In April 2018, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit against Defendant and Carnival. (D.E. 1.) On August 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed the operative Amended Complaint which asserts claims against Defendant for negligence (Count I) and third-party beneficiary breach of contract (Count III).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 3, 2018, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction.

Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When deciding the issue of personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), a court must conduct a two-part inquiry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   First, the court must determine whether the applicable state statute governing personal jurisdiction is satisfied. [Second, i]f the requirements of the long-arm statute are satisfied, then the court must inquire as to, (1) whether defendant has established sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Florida; and (2) whether the exercise of this jurisdiction over defendant would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Future Tech.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of specific jurisdiction over Defendant because the claims do not arise from or relate to Defendant's actions or contacts with Florida. (Mot. at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wolf v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12399478\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/683/786/#p793\">\n    683 F. App'x 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 793 (11th Cir. 2017) ).) Defendant further argues that Plaintiff cannot invoke Sections 685.101 and 685.102, Florida Statutes, to establish jurisdiction because she was not a signatory to the Agreement, and the claims do not arise out of the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff argues that pursuant to the consent to jurisdiction provision contained in the Agreement, Defendant has consented to personal jurisdiction in this Court and, therefore, principles of waiver and estoppel preclude Defendant from seeking dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. (Resp. at 4, 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Steffan v.

Fla. Aug. 1, 2017) ).) Although\n   <em>\n    Steffan\n   </em>\n   did not speak in terms of \"waiver\" or \"estoppel,\" it is directly on point and persuades the Court that it has personal jurisdiction over Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Steffan\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, a Carnival cruise passenger, was injured while participating in an excursion offered by \"Chukka,\" a Turks &amp; Caicos corporation, which he had purchased from Carnival.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204182203\">\n    2017 WL 4182203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 1. Carnival and Chukka had previously entered into a Standard Shore Excursion Independent Contractor Agreement that is virtually identical to the one at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The Agreement contained a consent to jurisdiction provision in which Chukka \"consent[ed\n   ] to the personal jurisdiction over it and to the venue of the courts serving the Southern District of Florida in the event of any lawsuit to which Carnival is a party and which is related to, in connection with, arising from or involving the Shore Excursion or the terms of this Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff sued Chukka in this Court for negligence and third-party breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chukka moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, arguing that it had no connection with Florida whatsoever, and had never entered into a contract with Carnival intending to provide protection for its passengers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In a thorough and well-reasoned order, Judge Altonaga rejected Chukka's argument, finding that it had consented to personal jurisdiction in this Court by entering into the Standard Shore Excursion Independent Contractor Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-7. Judge Altonaga found that although Florida has not always authorized the exercise of jurisdiction upon consent alone, the current state of Florida law permits it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-6. Specifically, in 1989, the Florida legislature enacted Section 685.101 and 685.102, Florida Statutes. Section 685.101 authorizes contracting parties to choose to be bound by Florida law even if the contract does not bear a relation to Florida:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties to any contract ... in consideration of or relating to any obligation arising out of a transaction involving in the aggregate not less than $250,000, the equivalent thereof in any foreign currency, or services or tangible or intangible property, or both, of equivalent value, ... may, to the extent permitted under the United States Constitution, agree that the law of this state will govern such contract ... in whole or in part, whether or not such contract ... bears any relation to this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20685.101\">\n    Fla.

In turn, Section 685.102 creates a parallel grant of jurisdiction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Notwithstanding any law that limits the right of a person to maintain an action or proceeding, any person may, to the extent permitted under the United States Constitution, maintain in this state an action or proceeding against any person or other entity residing or located outside this state, if the action or proceeding arises out of or relates to any contract, agreement, or undertaking for which a choice of the law of this state, in whole or in part, has been made pursuant to s. 685.101 and which contains a provision by which such person or other entity residing or located outside this state agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20685.102\">\n    Fla.
