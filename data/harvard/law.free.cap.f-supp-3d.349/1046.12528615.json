Ex. T-1215, Stipulated Facts (\"SF\") 59, 84.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 22,000-acre Tulalip Reservation is located within the State of Washington and Snohomish County, approximately 35 miles north of Seattle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , SF 86. Quil Ceda Village, 2,100 acres of land held in trust by the U.S. government for the benefit of the Tribes, is located within the Tulalip Reservation, bordered by the Interstate-5 highway on the east, and roughly on the north and south by 112\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and 88\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Streets, respectively. Ex. T-1215, SF 87; Ex. T-12. Over the last 20+ years, Tulalip has turned this once-undeveloped 2,100-acre section of tribal land into the thriving Quil Ceda Village commercial center, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors and customers a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Today, Quil Ceda Village is home to dozens of commercial and retail businesses. Several of these businesses are owned by the Tulalip Tribes, including the Tulalip Casino and the Tulalip Resort Hotel. Many of the businesses at Quil Ceda Village, however, merely lease land from Tulalip, and are neither Indian-owned nor operated, and employ few members of the Tulalip Tribes. Transcript of Trial (\"Tr.\"), at p. 397. These include stores such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Cabela's, and the 100+ retail stores located in the Seattle Premium Outlets Mall, including Calvin Klein, a Levi's Outlet Store, a NIKE Factory Store, and The North Face.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Expert Witness Report of Mukesh Bajaj, Ex. S-605 at 5. By and large, customers of these businesses are not tribal members, but travel to QCV from outside the reservation. None of the goods sold by these businesses are produced by Tulalip or on the Tulalip reservation. Ex. S-596, SF 587.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State of Washington and Snohomish County collect tens of millions of dollars in taxes annually from the non-Indian owned businesses at Quil Ceda Village.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. T-1215, SFs 9, 29. Tulalip claims that Defendants' collection of taxes, including the combined 8.9% sales tax, precludes Tulalip from collecting its own taxes from these businesses. Compl. \u00b6 1. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs stated two claims that have survived a motion for summary judgment: (1) that federal law preempts Defendants' administration and enforcement of State and County taxes; and (2) that the taxation at issue interferes with Tulalip's sovereign right to make and be governed by its own laws.

For cases involving matters of Indian sovereignty, the Supreme Court held, \"questions of pre-emption ... are not resolved by reference to standards of pre-emption that have developed in other areas of the law, and are not controlled by 'mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cotton Petroleum Corp. v.

Instead, recognizing \"the broad power of Congress to regulate tribal affairs\" and \"the semi-autonomous status of Indian tribes,\" the Court held that even in the absence of an express Congressional statement of preemption, federal law may still preempt a state's attempt to exercise authority over activity on Indian land.\n   <em>\n    Ramah Navajo Sch.

Bureau of Revenue of New Mexico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636649\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/832/#p837\">\n    458 U.S. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 837,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636649\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/832/#p837\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636649\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/832/#p837\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), citing\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p145\">\n    448 U.S. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p145\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nevertheless, the\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   Court continued, unlike in cases where on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, \"[m]ore difficult questions arise where, as here, a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p145\">\n    448 U.S. at 144, 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p145\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases involving \"more difficult questions\" such as those before this Court, courts have repeatedly employed a flexible, fact-intensive inquiry into certain factors bearing on the question of whether federal law limits taxes that may be imposed by the State.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barona Band of Mission Indians v. Yee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3579846,7346591\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/1184/\">\n    528 F.3d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1189 (9th Cir. 2008),\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   at 142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787603\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/136/#p145\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These factors include \"the degree of federal regulation involved, the respective governmental interests of the tribes and states (both regulatory and revenue raising), and the provision of tribal or state services to the party the state seeks to tax.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414414\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/734/#p736\">\n    50 F.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (9th Cir. 1995) (citation omitted). The Court's focus in this case, therefore, is on: (1) the comprehensiveness of federal regulation over the activity that is subject to taxation; (2) the weight of the respective interests the parties have in whether the taxes at issue are allowed; and (3) the value of the services the parties provide to the Quil Ceda Village customers and businesses, on whom the burden of the taxes at issue falls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As this Court has already noted in this case, Plaintiffs' claims require \"a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake, an inquiry designed to determine whether, in the specific context, the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Tulalip Tribes v. State of Washington\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:15-CV-00940-BJR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2058836\">\n    2017 WL 58836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (W.D.

Plaintiffs argue that under such inquiry, the federal and tribal interests in this case \"overwhelm\" the Defendants' interests. It must be emphasized, however, that the\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   balancing test does not take place in a vacuum; the right to tax does not merely fall to the party whose interests are greatest, or that has provided the most value in government services to the taxpayers at issue. Instead, although\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   and its progeny prescribe a fact-intensive balancing test as part of the preemption analysis, the balancing takes place within the context of the underlying question, which is whether federal law preempts \"the plenary power of the States over residents within their borders.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636649\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/832/#p837\">\n    458 U.S. at 836-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636649\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/832/#p837\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClanahan v.

Ultimately, \"State jurisdiction is preempted by the operation\n   of federal law if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests\n   <em>\n    reflected in federal law\n   </em>\n   , unless the State interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of State authority.\"\n   <em>\n    New Mexico v.

Ex. T-6. Using federal funds, Tulalip purchased the land in 1949, and in 1959 entered into a long-term lease with the Boeing Corporation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187972\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/324/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Boeing used the land for a test site until the late 1990s, when it exercised a right to terminate the lease. Tr. at p. 96; Ex.

Tr. at p. 325. The land was potentially contaminated from years of misuse, and was essentially raw, undeveloped land, with \"no roads or utilities, including water, sewer, phone, cable, fiber, natural gas, or electricity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Because there was limited access to the Village from the adjacent I-5 highway, Tulalip undertook, with financial support from the federal government, the task of engineering and constructing an I-5 interchange at 88\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, the southernmost border of QCV. Ex. T-1218, SFs 1404, 1406, 747. Using tribal and some federal funds, Tulalip also built a road network within the Village, and infrastructure for water, sewer, electrical, gas, and telecommunications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187972\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/324/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tulalip retained control of the overall commercial development of QCV, fulfilling the real estate development functions itself. Ex. T-1215, SF 481. Tulalip contributed most of the funding towards the infrastructure projects, estimated at an investment of over $150 million. Ex. T-51. The federal government made substantial financial contributions to the development, estimated at over $50 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. U-153, U-483, U-484.

Retail Tenants at Quil Ceda Village\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As infrastructure construction at the Village continued throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Tulalip was simultaneously marketing development opportunities to outside parties and negotiating with prospective business tenants. Quil Ceda Village secured its first anchor tenants, Walmart and Home Depot, in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Ex. T-1215, SF 484; Ex. T-1218, SFs 552, 554. Tulalip and the retail developer Chelsea Property Group entered into a lease in 2004 for what would become the 550,000-square-foot Seattle Premium Outlets (\"SPO\") mall. Ex. T-1230, SF 565. In 2011, Tulalip entered into a build-to-suit lease with Cabela's retail store. Ex. T-1215, SF 497. By 2016, dozens of non-tribal businesses had opened and were operating within Quil Ceda Village, including, in addition to those already noted, a Bank of America (2004); a McDonalds (2007); an Olive Garden (2010); a Ram Restaurant and Brewhouse (2012); and a Panera Bread restaurant (2014). Ex. T-1215, SF 484. Tulalip also opened a number of its own businesses at QCV during this period,\n   most notably the Tulalip Casino (2003), the Tulalip Resort Hotel (2008); The Tulalip Retail Center mall (2001); an amphitheater (2005); and a pharmacy (2008).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187972\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/324/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , SF 490.

The Tulalip Leasing Act thus gave rise to circumstances in which state and local taxation of activity on tribal land is\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   an interference in the federal government's authority, not more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, even if the Tulalip Leasing Act, in conjunction with other federal leasing regulations of tribal land, were considered a \"comprehensive\" regulatory framework, it would at most be one governing the\n   <em>\n    leasing\n   </em>\n   activities of the Tribes. But this case is not about a tax on lease revenues, a possessory interest tax, or any other tax touching on the scope of the Tribes' authority to lease or otherwise use its lands. Indeed, the taxes at issue in this case are not even on the development or operation of Quil Ceda Village itself but, most broadly defined, on the sale of goods that takes place at the Village. The cases are clear that the existence of extensive federal regulation in leasing on tribal land does not operate to preclude state taxation of non-leasing activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gila River II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047420\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1232/#p1236\">\n    91 F.3d at 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"mere existence of federal oversight over leasing of Indian lands\" does not preempt state sales tax where \"tax would not interfere with the use and development of the Tribe's property.\");\n   <em>\n    Stranburg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340087\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1324/#p1339\">\n    799 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding extensive federal regulation on leasing preempted state tax on rent paid to tribe by non-Indian lessees, but not state utility tax).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, federal regulation over the activities that are subject to the taxes at issue in this case is far from the sort of \"extensive\" or \"pervasive\" regulation courts have found in those\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   cases in which state and/or local taxation was preempted by federal law. The federal involvement that does exist related to Quil Ceda Village-largely related to leasing and one-time contributions to infrastructure projects-can hardly be said to \"leave no room\" for state and local taxation of the retail and commercial activity by non-Indians in the Village.

The Court has found this is not the case here.

Here, these interests have found their clearest expression in the substantial financial investment the United States has made in construction of the infrastructure supporting Quil Ceda Village, over the years totaling $50 million, or 19% of the total cost of construction of QCV infrastructure. Ex. T-51. In the absence of a pervasive regulatory scheme governing this interest in tribal economic development, however, courts have routinely found that even where \"the federal government has expressed an interest in assisting tribes in their efforts to achieve economic self-sufficiency ... that interest does not, without more, defeat a state tax on non-Indians.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Cmty. v.

The taxes do not interfere with or in any direct, measurable sense reduce the lease payments the Tribes will continue to collect from businesses at QCV, or other revenues collected from Indian-run businesses within the Village, which Defendants established at trial are substantial. Who collects the taxes likewise does not have a direct, measurable effect on tribal employment at QCV, or on the sustainability of tribal- and member-owned businesses that support activity at the Village, or on any of the other factors driving Tulalip's economic development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Tulalip is by all accounts in excellent financial health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Menenberg Report, Ex.

Evidence presented at trial does not support a conclusion that the federal goal of economic development on the reservation generally, and at Quil Ceda Village in particular, has been hindered by the State and County taxes at issue in this case. As Plaintiffs have acknowledged, \"Tulalip has dramatically fulfilled the core federal goals of encouraging tribal self-determination and economic development,\" despite collection of State and County taxes from the very inception of QCV.

At trial, Plaintiffs presented evidence supporting their claim that employment of Tulalip members and economic independence of the Tribes were the primary factors driving development of Quil Ceda Village. The Tulalip unemployment rate in the 1970s was 76%, with many members subsisting on fisheries and timber income. Tr. at p. 361;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at p. 289. Today, Tulalip's unemployment rate, which had fallen to 26% by 2000, now stands at 6-7%, due in large part to the success of Quil Ceda Village, and Tulalip's concerted efforts to harness that success to provide employment and career opportunities for its members.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   testimony of Teri Gobin, Tr. at pp. 361, 390.

The State and County impose the taxes at issue on commercial activities at the Village, just as they do on similar transactions throughout the State of Washington and Snohomish County, respectively, without regard to any \"experience\" the Tribes may incidentally be providing. The taxes here are paid by non-Indian customers on non-Indian goods imported from off the reservation, and on the \"privilege of doing business,\" which the non-Indian businesses, not the Tribes, enjoy. The imposition of state taxing authority at issue here is not on the Tribes' \"active role in generating activities of value on its reservation,\" but on the value of the non-tribal goods being sold, and the Tribes' interest is therefore at a minimum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yavapai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11975422\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/1107/#p1111\">\n    117 F.3d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    SaltRiver\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gila River II\n   </em>\n   both teach that the Tribe must have \"an active role\" in the creation of the value taxed in order to establish preemption.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Properly viewed in this light, the only tribal interest the State and County taxes actually \"interfere or are incompatible with\" is the Tribes' ability to collect the full measure of its own sales tax from the non-Indian businesses at QCV.

T-1240, SF 931;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   testimony of Dierk Meierbachtol, Chief Legal Officer with the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tr. at pp. 1413-45. Furthermore, it is reasonable to conclude that many of the employees and customers have been educated by the Washington public school system to at least some extent. Without question, all operations at Quil Ceda Village derive substantial, critical benefits from the high-quality public education Washington provides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bajaj Report, Ex. S-605.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition, approximately 17% of Washington's General Fund-$3.4 billion in 2017-goes towards funding social and health services within the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Judy Fitzgerald, Chief Financial Officer, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, Ex. S-611, \u00b6 7. These services include payments to Temporary Assistance for Needy Family and Basic Food assistance programs, and support for nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, and juvenile rehabilitation services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. An additional $4 billion from the General Fund provides Medicaid health coverage, and nearly $1 billion supports the State's correctional system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Megan Adkinson, Chief Financial Officer for the Washington Health Care Authority, Ex. S-598, \u00b6 6; Decl. of Julie Martin, Department of Corrections, Ex. S-590, \u00b6 14. Washington also funds and administers programs and enforces regulations related to workplace safety, worker's compensation, unemployment insurance, business licensing, and consumer protection. Such services are generally available to customers and businesses at Quil Ceda Village. Ex. S-609, SF 521; Ex. S-609, SFs 516-18; Ex. S-612; RCW 19.86.080. The Washington State Patrol patrols the stretch of the Interstate 5 highway, which the State owns and maintains, that borders the reservation and Quil Ceda Village. Tr. at p. 1288-89; Tr. at p. 1191. The necessity of these and other State-provided services to a civilized society generally, and operations at Quil Ceda Village specifically, cannot be reasonably disputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bajaj Expert Report, Ex. S-605. (\"[B]usinesses need a high-quality business environment, including a well-educated workforce, good telecommunications and transportation infrastructure, well-functioning regulatory systems, an efficient court system and a well-functioning legal system, and enough potential customers with sufficient buying power.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Snohomish County also provides countywide services that are available to Quil Ceda Village businesses and customers, and the Tulalip Tribes. For example, although the Tulalip Police Department serves as the primary law enforcement agency on the reservation and within the Village, the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office provides additional law enforcement support both within and surrounding Quil Ceda Village and the Tulalip Reservation, including access to the 911 emergency call system, Search and Rescue resources, and background checks for pawned gun sales and pistol transfers. Ex. C-179, SFs 1155, 1158; C-183, \u00b6 5; C-176, \u00b6 9; C-177. Services provided by the Snohomish County District Court and Snohomish County Superior Court are available to businesses, residents, and visitors to the Tulalip reservation and Quil Ceda Village, just as they are to Snohomish County residents and visitors generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. C-164, C-165, C-199. Snohomish County also maintains a Medical Examiner's Office, which between 1999 and 2015 tracked 562 deaths within the Tulalip reservation, plus ten at Quil Ceda Village. Ex. C-189; Ex. C-190, SFs 1100, 1101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Undeniably, Plaintiffs provide many of the government services available within Quil Ceda Village. Given the litany of services Defendants also provide, however, the Court declines to wade into the impossible\n   task of weighing the relative value of what are patently unquantifiable services provided by the parties. It is sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   and progeny to conclude that \"[t]his is not a case in which the State has had nothing to do with the on-reservation activity, save tax it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cotton Petroleum Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"604915\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/163/#p176\">\n    490 U.S. at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"604915\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/163/#p176\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding state tax not preempted where state provided some services available to taxpayers);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ute Mountain Ute Tribe v.

Defendants also supply these and other services to the taxpayers living outside the Tulalip reservation that enable them to travel to QCV and engage in the commercial transactions related to the taxes at issue. These services more than justify imposition of the taxes at issue. Nothing in the case law requires an examination closer than this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe v. Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11975422\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/1107/#p1111\">\n    117 F.3d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1116 (9th Cir. 1997) ;\n   <em>\n    Gila River II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047420\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/91/1232/#p1236\">\n    91 F.3d at 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Tribe's insistence that there be a direct connection between the state sales tax revenues and the services provided to the Tribe is similarly meritless. As observed in\n   <em>\n    Salt River\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court has noted that there is no requirement that a tax imposed on non-Indians for reservation activities be proportional to the services provided by the State.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court finds that the State and County's interest in raising revenue, particularly in light of the fact that they provide many of the services to the taxpayers related to the activities being taxed, weighs decisively against preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    4. The Balance of Interests Does Not Justify Preemption of State and Local Taxes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having applied the law gleaned from cases invoking a\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   analysis to the evidence produced at trial, the Court finds that the taxes at issue in this case are not preempted by federal law. The most relevant factors are that (1) there is an absence of a \"pervasive\" and \"comprehensive\" federal regulatory scheme governing the taxed activity; (2) transactions subject to tax are between non-Indian parties, involving goods produced off-reservation; (3) Tulalip has been unable to demonstrate more than a financial interest implicated by State and County taxation; (4) the State and County have a substantial interest in enforcing generally applicable taxes within their borders; and (5) the State and County have not abdicated their responsibility for providing services to Tulalip or the taxpayers in exchange for those taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Tribal Sovereignty Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Courts have repeatedly observed that interference with tribal sovereignty poses an independent barrier to state and local taxation on tribal land, but there is little case law offering guidance on how a tribe's sovereignty claim should be evaluated. Existing law, however, counsels against a finding that the collection of taxes at issue in this case infringes on tribal sovereignty. First, Tulalip's sovereignty interests here are at a minimum, where the taxes in question are keyed solely on goods manufactured off the reservation, and on transactions between non-\n   Indians.\n   <em>\n    Colville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/#p155\">\n    447 U.S. at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182119\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/134/#p155\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, as outlined above, the only sovereignty interest being impeded in this case is the Tribes' ability to collect the full measure of its own taxes-an interest that is essentially little more than financial. While this interest is valid, there is no evidence in the record that the State and County collection of taxes here has impeded the Tribes' ability to thrive financially.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Menenberg Report, Ex. S-579. The governments of the Tulalip Tribes and the Consolidated Borough of Quil Ceda Village have also thrived, irrespective of the imposition of State and County taxes, as Tulalip's experts and others testified at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   testimony of Joseph Kalt, Tr. at p. 703 (\"Tulalip Tribes, through their undertaking of the Quil Ceda Village development and governance, represent a prime example, actually, of economic success and development under federal policies of self-determination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Perhaps most tellingly, Plaintiffs have been unable to point the Court to a single case upholding a tribe's sovereignty claim in the wake of a failed\n   <em>\n    Bracker\n   </em>\n   preemption claim. This case is not one for setting such a precedent. The taxes at issue are not taxes on tribal businesses, on tribal goods, on tribal members, or on tribal government. These taxes have interfered only, as the Court has already observed, with the Tribes' ability to collect the full measure of its own taxes at Quil Ceda Village. Not a single modern case has found an infringement of tribal sovereignty under similar circumstances. The Court does not do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Tulalip has spent the last several generations developing, constructing, and maintaining one of the premier commercial and retail destinations in Western Washington. These efforts have produced rewards in the form of revenues from leases and from the Tulalip-owned businesses at QCV. Tulalip now seeks to enhance those revenues by replacing the State and County taxing authority with its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The case law dictates that the path to preemption of state general taxation authority is a narrow one. In the absence of an extensive federal regulatory scheme governing the activity being taxed, Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent has all but closed the door on preemption of a state's generally applicable tax on activities between non-Indians, concerning non-Indian goods, on an Indian reservation, particularly where the State has not \"abdicated\" responsibility to the tribe and continues to provide government services to the taxpayers in question. Not a single case has found preemption under facts materially similar to those here, and none of the cases has suggested a justification for preemption in such circumstances, or issued an invitation to create one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby finds in favor of Defendants on all claims, and dismisses this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The individual named Defendants are Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, Washington State Department of Revenue Director Vikki Smith, Snohomish County Treasurer Kirke Sievers, and Snohomish County Assessor Linda Hjelle.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Court has adopted the use of the term \"Indian,\" commonly used by federal courts and by all parties in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    During trial, the parties introduced exhibits listing and articulating relevant facts to which all parties have stipulated.
