The Court denied the motion from the bench but reserved the right to enter a written opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Entry, ECF No. 345. This is that opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Tobacco Companies argue that Ms. Starbuck is precluded from claiming that Mr. Starbuck suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (\"COPD\") or that COPD caused his death. Defs.' Mem. 1. The Tobacco Companies base their argument on various statements made by the Starbucks' counsel during status conferences and sidebars before or during the trials in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Starbuck II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-8.

Carr (\"Jury Trial May 12, 2014\") 133-34, ECF No. 291-2, the argument that he suffered from COPD. Seizing on these statements, the Tobacco Companies advance various theories about why Ms. Starbuck is precluded from arguing in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck III\n   </em>\n   that her husband suffered from COPD. The Tobacco Companies argue that (1) the Starbucks' counsel's statements were a stipulation or judicial admission that Mr. Starbuck did not have COPD, Defs.' Mem. 1, 9-14; (2) the doctrine of equitable estoppel or inconsistent positions precludes Ms. Starbuck from claiming that her husband had COPD,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 14-16; and (3) Mr. Starbuck waived any claim he had COPD,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 14-16. Alternatively, the Tobacco Companies argue that the Starbucks' counsel's statements are admissions by a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A) and ought be admitted at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Tobacco Companies' arguments are based on a misapplication of the doctrines of judicial admission, equitable estoppel, and waiver, and Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A) does not apply. The Court denies the motion for the reasons below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Equitable Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For ease of analysis, the Court considers the doctrine of equitable estoppel first. \"Equitable estoppel is based on principles of fair play and essential justice and arises when one party lulls another party into a disadvantageous legal position.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida Dep't of Health &amp; Rehab. Servs.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    S.A.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9343856\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/835/1091/#p1096\">\n    835 So.2d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1096 (Fla. 2002). \"The elements of equitable estoppel are (1) a representation as to a material fact that is contrary to a later-asserted position, (2) reliance on that representation, and (3) a change in position detrimental to the party claiming estoppel, caused by the representation and reliance thereon.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190459\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/881/1079/#p1084\">\n    881 So.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1084 (Fla. 2004) (citing\n   <em>\n    State Dep't of Revenue\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9556456\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/403/397/#p400\">\n    403 So.2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400 (Fla. 1981) ). \"Moreover, the party asserting equitable estoppel must prove that he or she reasonably relied on the conduct of the other party.\" 22 Fla.

Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11478729\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/85/1297/#p1301\">\n    85 F.Supp.2d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1301 (S.D. Fla. 1997) (applying Florida law) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Tobacco Companies' equitable estoppel argument fails because they do not show reliance or a detrimental change in position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. 14-16. They furnish no explanation of how, for purposes of the third trial, they relied on the Starbucks' counsel's prior statements about not pursuing liability for COPD in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Starbuck II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11478729\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/85/1297/#p1301\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tobacco Companies also point to nothing demonstrating how they detrimentally changed their position in reliance on these prior statements. The closest they come to such a showing is a conclusory assertion that \"Plaintiff's counsel\n   <em>\n    affirmatively\n   </em>\n   sought to prevent Defendants from raising issues about COPD.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Even if this statement were true with respect to the first two trials, it says nothing about how the Tobacco Companies detrimentally changed their position for the third trial in reliance on the prior statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Tobacco Companies addressed the issue of detrimental reliance for the first time at oral argument. There, the Tobacco Companies represented that had they believed Mr. Starbuck would pursue a claim for COPD in the third trial, they would have deposed him about the progression of the disease before he passed away on October 18, 2016. The Tobacco Companies alleged that they did not do so because they believed Mr. Starbuck had conceded he did not have COPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Tobacco Companies' representation that they would have retaken Mr. Starbuck's deposition strikes the Court as hindsight speculation. The Tobacco Companies knew, at the very least, that Mr. Starbuck still planned to sue them for damages related to lung cancer, but that did not prompt them to retake his deposition at any point during the two years\n   between the grant of a retrial in 2014 and Mr. Starbuck's death in 2016. The Tobacco Companies did not explain why a claim based on COPD would have prompted them to retake Mr. Starbuck's deposition, when his claim based on lung cancer (of which they were aware) did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court is not convinced that the Tobacco Companies were prejudiced. An inability to retake Mr. Starbuck's deposition before his death did not put them in any worse of a position than typical defendants in a wrongful death or survival action. The defendant in a wrongful death or survival action is often unable to depose the decedent because the decedent is usually dead before the lawsuit begins. Moreover, the Tobacco Companies were still able to depose Mr. Starbuck's wife, treating physician, and expert witnesses, all of whom could provide, individually or in combination, the same (if not more) information than could Mr. Starbuck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case Management Order 2-3, ECF No. 283. Thus, the fact that the Tobacco Companies were unable to retake Mr. Starbuck's deposition does not meaningfully prejudice them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition, after\n   <em>\n    Starbuck II\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Starbuck filed a Second Amended Complaint, putting the Tobacco Companies on notice that she planned to allege that Mr. Starbuck suffered from COPD. Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 42. Pursuant to its Case Management Order, the Court opened a new discovery period on May 9, 2018, during which Ms. Starbuck provided updated expert reports expressing opinions that Mr. Starbuck had COPD, that smoking cigarettes caused it, and that COPD contributed to his death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n 7 &amp; Exs. A-E. The Tobacco Companies had ample warning that Ms. Starbuck was pursuing a claim based on COPD and ample opportunity to depose her or her experts on the topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, this argument did not appear in the Tobacco Companies' motion, memorandum, or reply. A party cannot raise new arguments in support of summary judgment for the first time in a reply brief,\n   <em>\n    WBY, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeKalb Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12400131\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/695/486/#p491\">\n    695 F.

Thus, the Tobacco Companies' arguments in support of the reliance and detrimental-change-of-position elements are not properly before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Considering these facts, as well as the Tobacco Companies' failure to show reasonable reliance or a detrimental change in position, the Court rejects their theory of equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At the time counsel said Mr. Starbuck was going to \"drop\" or \"withdraw\" the issue of COPD, Mr. Starbuck was still alive, and the final chapters of his life had not been written. Mr. Starbuck would go on to live two more years, during which time additional evidence may have emerged that he suffered from COPD. Indeed, the cause of Mr. Starbuck's death could not have been ascertained until after he died. Neither Mr. Starbuck nor his attorney could have predicted the cause of his death. Mr. Starbuck could not have possessed all the material facts in 2014 knowingly to waive his (or his successor's) right to seek damages based on COPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nor did the statements and actions of Mr. Starbuck's counsel evince an unmistakable intent forever to waive the right to seek damages based on COPD. Though not itself dispositive, Mr. Starbucks' counsel never used the word \"waive\" or a variation thereof regarding COPD. Rather, Mr. Starbuck's attorney said during pretrial conferences and sidebars that he was going to \"drop,\" Tr. Telephone Conference April 28, 2014 at 5, or \"withdraw,\" Jury Trial May 12, 2014 at 133-34, COPD from the case. The best interpretation of these statements is that counsel was conveying that he would not argue that Mr. Starbuck suffered from COPD\n   <em>\n    at those very trials\n   </em>\n   , to (1) simplify the issues for the jury and (2) conform Mr. Starbuck's theory of the case to the evidence as it existed at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Take for example the statement made by the Starbucks' counsel in a telephonic pretrial conference in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. BYRD [Plaintiff's counsel]: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Byrd on behalf of Mr. Starbuck. Obviously, just as you said, there are some things in the instructions that we don't like and we would object to.... But I think on the whole, you know, it's a sound set of jury instructions....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I will inform the Court of one thing that I think will, frankly, benefit everything. It's a decision that we have just come to a conclusion on and actually affects some things that the defendants have filed, which we were hoping that they would not file until we did, but I believe to help proceed -- to make sure the Court -- we can do this efficiently,\n   <em>\n    it is our intention on behalf of Mr. Starbuck to drop our COPD claim; which, number one, would make the verdict form a little bit simpler; and it sort of certainly streamlines the issues in the case\n   </em>\n   . We're just talking about lung cancer. Now, we will be seeking all of the damages from his lung cancer, and we certainly have theories and evidence and things to support -- we will tell the jury that not only did he have to deal with lung cancer but that his lung cancer led to -- whether you call it ARDS or COPD or whatever, the lung cancer surgery led to breathing problems that he has to live with even to this day and on. We'll certainly seek all those damages because they stem from lung cancer. To the extent we can show they stem from lung cancer, we're going to do that. But we are not going to seek a separate disease of COPD individual [sic] on its own.\n   <em>\n    I think that will streamline\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    some things. That will probably change question 2 in your verdict form.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Tr. Telephone Conference April 28, 2014 at 5-6 (emphasis added). Mr. Byrd's entire statement suggests that Mr. Starbuck was dropping COPD for the strategic purpose of simplifying the issues and streamlining the verdict form. Likewise, when Mr. Byrd stated in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   that Mr. Starbuck would \"withdraw the COPD,\" Jury Trial May 12, 2014 at 134, it was in the context of a sidebar discussion regarding the testimony he planned to elicit from Mr. Starbuck's treating physician. These statements do not suggest an intent\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   to forego any claim based on COPD, including for purposes of a future retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The record also suggests that the Starbucks' counsel withdrew the issue of COPD from the previous trials in order to conform Mr. Starbuck's theory of the case to the evidence. One of the Tobacco Companies' experts, Dr. Frazier, issued a report before\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   concluding that Mr. Starbuck did not have COPD, which may have encouraged Mr. Starbuck's lawyer to drop the issue from the trials in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Starbuck II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. C, Jury Trial Proceedings Honorable Mark W. Bennett (\"Jury Trial Dec. 11, 2014\") 139-40, 294-95, ECF No. 310-3. The record reflects that as a matter of trial strategy, the Starbucks' attorney wished to focus on lung cancer because he believed Florida law enabled the jury to consider damages and complications arising from lung cancer surgery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   MR. BYRD: They're comparing apples and oranges. They're talking about COPD --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: I don't want to hear about COPD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   MR. BYRD: Exactly. That's my point. We took it out of the case, as we have a right to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: At any rate, if you want [Dr. Amgott] to be able to give his opinion, that's fine with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   MR. BYRD: If he's going to come and testify, I'm not going to stop him from testifying, but he needs to be restricted to what he said in his opinion. We don't have to tell them the theory of our case.

COPD doesn't matter to this argument whatsoever. But the point is, lung cancer -- we've always said we want the damages from lung cancer surgery. We have good Florida jury instruction law that we need to talk about that talks about surgical -- you know, the complications from surgery. They're fully on notice, and they had Dr. Burns' expert testimony saying that lung cancer surgery caused the ARDS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Jury Trial Dec. 11, 2014 at 142. Again, however, Mr. Byrd's statements do not manifest a clear intent knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily to waive the right to seek damages based on COPD for all time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Starbuck summed it up well, observing that Mr. Starbuck's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   decision to pursue only damages for lung cancer at most relinquished his right to pursue COPD damages\n   <em>\n    in the earlier trials in this case\n   </em>\n   . He did not evince a 'clear intent' to forego theories of recovery in a future trial based on harm he had not yet experienced, i.e., two more years of COPD and his eventual death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Pl.'s Opp'n 13 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court agrees. As such, Mr. Starbuck did not waive the right to assert a\n   claim based on COPD for purposes of the third trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Judicial Admission or Stipulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Tobacco Companies argue that Ms. Starbuck cannot maintain any claims based on COPD because her husband's lawyer made judicial admissions in the first two trials that conclusively removed this issue from the litigation. Defs.' Mem. 9-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument fails for two reasons. First, Mr. Byrd's statements regarding COPD in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Starbuck II\n   </em>\n   do not constitute judicial admissions. Second, even if Mr. Byrd's statements were judicial admissions for the earlier trials, they do not bind the parties in this retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A judicial admission is a statement by a party or its counsel that removes a factual issue from dispute in a litigation and binds both parties on trial and appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meridian Yachts, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034217\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/1151/#p1178\">\n    575 F.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1178 (11th Cir. 2009) (\"[F]acts judicially admitted are facts established not only beyond the need of evidence to prove them, but beyond the power of evidence to controvert them.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Trade Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1089831\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/124/104/#p106\">\n    124 F.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (5th Cir. 1941) ).

The Court rejects this argument because counsel's statements were not admissions\n   of fact at all, but merely articulations of counsel's conception of the legal theory of the case. A rule that would admit counsel's statements in\n   <em>\n    Starbuck I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Starbuck II\n   </em>\n   under 801(d)(2)(A) would have the unwelcome effect of discouraging lawyers from streamlining trials by removing certain issues from contention. Were this Court to adopt such a rule, lawyers would be hesitant ever to narrow the issues in dispute, lest such choices be turned into evidentiary admissions in a future trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
