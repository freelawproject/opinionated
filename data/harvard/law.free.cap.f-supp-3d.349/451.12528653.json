Approximately one hour after his arrest, Holloway performed a breathalyzer test which registered a blood alcohol content (\"BAC\") of 0.131 percent.

(Doc. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 19-20). After Holloway was arrested for suspected drunk driving, the officer administered a breathalyzer test and Holloway registered a BAC of 0.192 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Holloway was charged with driving under the influence in violation of 75 PA. CONS.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). He pled guilty to driving under the influence at the highest rate of alcohol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). This 2005 DUI conviction was Holloway's second offense and was graded as a misdemeanor of the first degree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In Pennsylvania, a misdemeanor of the first degree carries a maximum possible sentence of five years' imprisonment. 18 PA. CONS.

If an individual is convicted of a second DUI offense at the highest rate of alcohol,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pennsylvania requires the individual to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , serve no less than 90 days' imprisonment and pay a minimum fine of $1,500. 75 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 3804(c)(2)(i)-(iv). Holloway was sentenced to serve 90 days' work release, pay a fine of $1,500, complete any recommended drug and alcohol treatment, and serve 60 months' probation. (Doc. 61-1\n   \u00b6 25). Through the work release program, Holloway reported for work each day and occasionally worked overtime hours but was otherwise confined to the Cumberland County Prison for the remainder of each day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 72-1 at 7-8). He completed his sentence in March 2006.

Holloway's firearm application was denied following an instant background check, and Holloway appealed the denial.

The Pennsylvania State Police affirmed the background check results and noted that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), Holloway's 2005 DUI conviction prohibited him from purchasing a firearm.

He seeks a declaration that his 2005 DUI conviction does not justify his disarmament under Section 922(g)(1) as well as a permanent injunction against defendants' continued enforcement of the felon-in-possession ban as pertains him. The court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and dismissed Holloway's first motion for summary judgment as premature. After a period of discovery, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions are fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Through summary adjudication, the court may dispose of those claims that do not present a \"genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and for which a jury trial would be an empty and unnecessary formality.

The government correctly notes that Holloway's sentence was \"more severe\" than those of the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, neither of whom served any jail time. (Doc. 78 at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/#p339\">\n    836 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ambro, J., plurality opinion) ) ). However, one\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   plaintiff did receive a suspended sentence of 180 days' imprisonment, reflecting discretionary authority that Holloway's sentencing judge lacked.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/#p339\">\n    836 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ambro, J., plurality opinion)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   75 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 3804(c)(2)(i). Without discounting the significance of 90 days' imprisonment, Holloway's sentence was relatively minor as compared to both the threshold term of imprisonment of more than one year defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), and the maximum possible punishment of five years' imprisonment he faced under Pennsylvania law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 1104(1). Holloway's participation in the work release program is of particular note. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). A sentencing judge has discretion to assign an individual convicted of a DUI offense to a daytime work release program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   75 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 3813. Holloway's assignment to such a program undergirds the relatively minor nature of his sentence and suggests that the sentencing judge did not find Holloway to pose a significant risk to public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   All 50 states criminalize driving with a BAC of .08 percent or higher. (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 56). But in determining whether a cross-jurisdictional consensus existed as to the\n   seriousness of the offenses at issue in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit also considered how many states prescribed a maximum sentence that \"meet[s] the threshold of a traditional felony (more than one year in prison).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/#p339\">\n    836 F.3d at 352-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ambro, J., plurality opinion). Beyond its uniform illegality, the manner in which a DUI offense is punished varies by state and depends on a multitude of factors. In this case, salient sentencing factors from state to state are the BAC level and the number of prior offenses. Defendants maintain that there is a cross-jurisdictional consensus as to the severity of Holloway's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Holloway's 2005 DUI conviction was his second offense within three years and he had a BAC of .192 percent. For a second DUI offense, 40 states prescribe a maximum term of imprisonment of one year or less. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58-4 at 7-31). Ten states enforce a maximum term of imprisonment of more than one year for a second DUI offense, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10, 13, 15-16, 21-23, 28), only four of which classify the second DUI offense as a felony, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 13, 21, 23). Defendants note that 48 states impose enhanced penalties for DUI offenses when the driver's BAC exceeds a \"particularly high threshold.\" (Doc. 58 \u00b6 58; Doc. 61 at 21). These enhanced penalties for elevated BAC levels include increased fines, license suspension, installation of ignition interlock devices, and heightened minimum terms of imprisonment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58-4 at 7-31). However, only three states increase the maximum possible term of imprisonment above one year for a BAC of .16 or higher during a second offense. (Doc. 58-4 at 12, 24, 26). The government has not shown there is a consensus regarding the seriousness of a generic second DUI offense, let alone a second DUI offense at a high rate of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Additional Factors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties urge the court to consider two additional factors in evaluating the seriousness of Holloway's offense. Holloway contends that, under Pennsylvania law, he would not be prohibited from owning a firearm after a second DUI offense at the highest rate of alcohol. (Doc. 59 at 13-14). Defendants contend that Holloway's DUI offense evinces a manifest disregard for the safety of others. (Doc. 61 at 22-23). We take these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, a person who has three or more DUI convictions within a five-year period is prohibited from transferring or purchasing firearms. 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 6105(c)(3) (citing 75 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 3802 ). This prohibition does not extend to firearms possessed prior to the third DUI conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamborsky v. Pa. State Police\n   </em>\n   , No. 1359 C.D. 2016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203122215\">\n    2017 WL 3122215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Pa. Commw. Ct. July 24, 2017). Upon proper application, Pennsylvania courts must grant firearm disability relief after a period of ten years to any person subject to the prohibition of Section 6105(c)(3). 18 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 6105(e)(2). In enacting Section\n   6103(c)(3), it is unclear whether the Pennsylvania General Assembly considered the federal firearms prohibition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), or its interplay with Pennsylvania's DUI offense classification and punishment scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the limited circumstances under which the Commonwealth prohibits DUI offenders from transferring and purchasing new firearms suggests that it views Holloway's offense less seriously than defendants claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is beyond peradventure that driving under the influence of alcohol significantly increases the likelihood of accidents and accident-related fatalities. In 2016 alone, there were over 10,000 fatalities nationwide stemming from alcohol-related driving accidents; 62 percent of drivers in those accidents had a BAC in excess of the legal limit. (Doc. 61-2 at 100). And 67 percent of those 2016 alcohol-related driving fatalities arose from accidents where at least one driver had a BAC of .15 percent or higher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105). A study of 2007 motor-vehicle-accident data revealed that individuals with a BAC of .15 percent or higher were between approximately 112 and 200 times more likely to be involved in any fatal motor vehicle accident depending on the age of the driver. (Doc. 61-3 at 43). Based on these studies, defendants contend that recidivist drunk driving evinces a manifest disregard for the safety of others. (Doc. 61 at 22). The majority of states, including Pennsylvania, require first time DUI offenders to attend a DUI or substance abuse program as part of their sentence, rendering repeat offenses more egregious. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58-4 at 7-31); 75 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7 3804(a)(1)(iii)-(iv). A second DUI offense, regardless of BAC level, certainly demonstrates maladjustment and a reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Consideration of All Factors\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After a careful weighing of the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   factors, the court concludes that Holloway's crime was not a \"serious offense\" within the ambit of Section 922(g)(1). A second DUI offense at the highest rate of alcohol, is a misdemeanor under Pennsylvania law and no showing of violence or attempted violence is required for conviction. All states take DUI offenses \"seriously\" by criminalizing such conduct, but there is no cross-jurisdictional consensus on the seriousness of such an offense. Only a handful of states classify a second DUI offense as a felony or impose a maximum penalty of more than one year imprisonment. Fewer still increase the maximum possible term of imprisonment above one year when the offender drives at a high rate of alcohol (BAC greater than .15 percent). Despite the panoply of penalties available, the sentencing judge chose not to impose a sentence above the mandatory minimum term of 90 days' imprisonment and permitted Holloway to participate in a work release program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants' proffered factors do not tip the scales against Holloway. That driving under the influence is risky behavior is undisputed. It places others in danger of bodily harm. Yet only seven states permanently suspend a repeat DUI offender's driving privileges, and only after a third DUI conviction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58-4 at 7, 10, 19, 22, 24, 28-29). The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has clearly indicated that a repeat DUI offender is not so unvirtuous that he or she must be disarmed until a third DUI conviction in five years and, even then, the disability has an automatic ten-year expiration date. Holloway has distinguished\n   himself from the class of persons historically barred from possessing a firearm by establishing that his crime of conviction was not sufficiently serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

It relies heavily on an expert report\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support the proposition\n   that individuals like Holloway \"are substantially more likely to intentionally use firearms to harm others, inflict self-harm, and cause inadvertent harm.\" (Doc. 61 at 25-27 (citing Doc. 61-4) ). The expert report states that individuals with alcohol dependency or abuse are more prone to violence and cites one study that suggests just over 50 percent of DUI offenders were alcohol dependent. (Doc. 61-4 at 4-5 &amp; n.8). It further notes that alcohol abuse is often comorbid with mental illness and is strongly linked with domestic violence, youth violence, violent crime, and road rage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7). But nothing in the record suggests that Holloway was ever diagnosed with or suffered from alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse, or mental illness.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). In support of this proposition, the report cites two studies which collected data on individuals with at least one prior misdemeanor conviction for a crime of violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14 &amp; n.50) Both studies found that barring said individuals from purchasing firearms reduced the commission of future crimes involving firearms or violence, and intimate partner homicides, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants can draw no reasonable conclusion from these studies about the risk posed by Holloway's potential possession of a firearm as his disqualifying misdemeanor was nonviolent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   One study identified by the report found 32.8 percent of handgun purchasers who had prior alcohol convictions were arrested for a subsequent crime involving violence or firearms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 &amp; n.34). The study's regression analysis revealed that individuals with just one prior alcohol-related conviction were four times as likely to be arrested for a firearm-related offense or a crime of violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). The data set utilized by the study consists of persons who purchased a handgun from a California retail firearms dealer in 1977. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Without questioning the validity of the study's methodology, we find that this study alone does not adequately establish a substantial fit between Holloway's disarmament and the government's compelling interest in preventing armed mayhem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Holloway contends that the federal government's history of granting relief from federal firearms disabilities to deserving persons undercuts defendants' arguments at step two. Prior to 1993, the United States Attorney General had the authority to grant relief to persons prohibited under federal law from obtaining and possessing firearms.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Because there is no adequate legal remedy to compensate Holloway's constitutional injuries, declaratory and injunctive relief will ensure that Holloway does not continue to suffer irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As to the respective hardships between the parties, we fail to ascertain any real hardship defendants would suffer from an award of permanent injunctive relief. Defendants have identified none, save for their arguments regarding the risk Holloway poses based on his second DUI conviction, which we have squarely addressed. Holloway,\n   <em>\n    per contra\n   </em>\n   , would continue to suffer the Second Amendment injury described in this opinion if a permanent injunction were not granted. The balancing of hardships thus militates in favor of Holloway's\n   requested injunction.

Holloway's disqualifying conviction was not sufficiently serious to warrant deprivation of his Second Amendment rights, and disarmament of individuals such as Holloway is not sufficiently tailored to further the government's compelling interest of preventing armed mayhem.
