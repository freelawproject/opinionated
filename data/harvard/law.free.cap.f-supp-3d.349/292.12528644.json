(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) On June 12, 2018, this Court\n   issued an Order dismissing Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order.) Plaintiffs move for leave to file a proposed First Amended Complaint (the \"FAC,\" Pls. Letter, Ex. A, ECF No. 58-1). Plaintiffs' motion is DENIED, because the proposed amendments would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the FAC, as in the original complaint, Plaintiffs allege that they each signed a Customer Agreement to open a trading account with Defendant. (FAC \u00b6 25;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 (\"Customer Agmt.\"), ECF No. 58-1; Compl. \u00b6 32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Plaintiffs also allege that they each signed a document entitled \"Portfolio Margin Risk Disclosure Statement,\" which is referred to in the FAC as the \"Disclosure Agreement.\" (FAC \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 2 (\"Disclosure Agmt.\"), ECF No. 58-3; Compl. \u00b6 34.) In their original complaint, Plaintiffs asserted two breach of contract claims-one for a breach of the Customer Agreement and one for a breach of the Disclosure Agreement. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-92.) Additionally, Plaintiffs asserted claims for promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and declaratory and injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Order, this Court found that the provisions of the Customer Agreement that Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant breached \"serve[ ] to 'inform [Plaintiffs] that [their] trades are constrained by the rules of governing regulatory agencies' and do[ ] not impose any obligations on Defendant.\" (Order at 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gurfein v.

App'x 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 413-14 (2d Cir. 2009) ). Similarly, this Court found that the Disclosure Agreement is merely \"an 'acknowledgment that [Plaintiffs'] trades are subject to applicable rules and regulations' \" and, as such, \"does not 'impose any contractual obligations on' Defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gurfein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882838\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/410/#p413\">\n    312 F. App'x at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   413 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the FAC, Plaintiffs assert two claims (one for breach of contract and one for breach of implied contract) based on Defendant's \"breach[ ] [of the] Disclosure Agreement\n   <em>\n    as modified by\n   </em>\n   the 2014 Agreements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 74, 81 (emphasis added).) The 2014 Agreements consist of: (1) a bulletin posted on Defendant's website in April 2014 (\"Article 2175\") and (2) a May 14, 2014 email to investors (the \"May 2014 Email\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28;\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 3 (\"Article 2175\"), ECF No. 58-4;\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 4 (\"May 2014 Email\"), ECF No. 58-5.) Article 2175 lists \"ETN products which will no longer be eligible for Portfolio Monitoring\n   ... during the week beginning May 19, 2014.\" (Article 2175 at 1.) Plaintiffs allege that Article 2175 remained on Defendant's website until at least January 2016. (FAC \u00b6 27.) The May 2014 Email states, \"Pursuant to a recent decision by FINRA whereby ... ETNs ... will no longer be eligible for portfolio margining, these securities, including options having an ETN as an underlying [sic], will be phased out of the program by OCC during the week of May 19, 2014.\" (May 2014 Email.) The May 2014 Email also states that Defendant's customers should \"refer to [Article] [ ]2175 for a list of the ETNs and options impacted by this change.\" (May 2014 Email.) In addition to their contract-based claims, Plaintiffs also assert claims for promissory estoppel and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPLAINT ARE FUTILE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that their new \"breach of contract claims now rest upon the theory that additional promises and commitments by [Defendant] made in ... the 2014 Agreements[ ] exceed those [obligations] imposed by FINRA.\" (Pls. Letter at 2.) However, neither the Disclosure Agreement nor the 2014 Agreements indicate that Defendant agreed to assume obligations beyond those imposed by FINRA. As in the original complaint, Plaintiffs expressly allege in the FAC that the Disclosure Agreement is \"FINRA mandated\" and \"modeled after FINRA NTM 08-09.\" (FAC \u00b6 70 (citing Disclosure Agmt.);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 88 (citing same).) Thus, Defendant's provision of the Disclosure Agreement to potential customers simply reflects Defendant's compliance with FINRA rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As explained in the Order, \"no private right of action exist[s] ... for violations\n   of ... FINRA rules.\" (Order at 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lobaito v. FINRA\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 6011 (GBD) (alteration and omissions in original).) Plaintiffs assert that their breach of contract claims no longer rest on the \"legal theory that FINRA Rule 4210(g) was an\n   <em>\n    actionable element\n   </em>\n   of the parties' agreements.\" (Pls. Letter at 2 (emphasis added).) However, Plaintiffs' contract claims are still premised on the theory that Defendant included securities in its calculation of portfolio margin that were ineligible for such treatment. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 73, 81, 86 (alleging that Defendant breached the Disclosure Agreement and 2014 Agreements \"[b]y including ETNs in its calculation of portfolio margin levels for the accounts of Plaintiffs and Class members\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83, 90 (same).) The eligibility of products for portfolio margin treatment is governed by FINRA Rule 4210.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FINRA Rule 4210(g) (listing products to which \"members may elect to apply the portfolio margin requirements\"). Thus, the gravamen of Plaintiffs' claims is still that Defendant violated Rule 4210. As explained in the Order, Plaintiffs cannot create a private right of action for violation of Rule 4210 by \"styling their claim as a breach of contract.\" (Order at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gurfein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882838\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/312/410/#p413\">\n    312 F. App'x at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that the 2014 Agreements reflect Defendant's \"decision to implement Article 2175,\" which was made \"without regard to FINRA rules or regulations.\" (Letter from Frederic S. Fox to this Court dated Aug. 27, 2018 (\"Pls. Reply Letter\"), ECF No. 64, at 5.) However, while the 2014 Agreements do not expressly cite FINRA rules or regulations, it is clear that the 2014 Agreements were made in response to a decision by FINRA. The May 2014 Email expressly states, \"\n   <em>\n    Pursuant to a recent decision by FINRA\n   </em>\n   whereby Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) will no longer be eligible for Portfolio Margining, these securities, including options having ETNs as underlying [sic], will be phased out of the program by OCC during the week of May 19, 2014.\" (May 2014 Email (emphasis added).) The May 2014 Email then directs customers to \"refer to [Article] [ ]2175 for a list of ETNs and options impacted by this change.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, the 2014 Agreements inform Defendant's customers of FINRA's decision and the impact of that decision on their portfolios. Because the 2014 Agreements, at most, reflect Defendant's commitment to comply with FINRA's decision, the 2014 Agreements do not impose any obligations on Defendant in excess of those imposed by FINRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moreover, even if this Court were to find that the 2014 Agreements imposed obligations beyond those imposed by FINRA, the Customer Agreement, which Plaintiffs signed in 2015, contains an integration clause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Customer Agmt. at 11 (signed by Hauptman on June 19, 2015); Letter from Christian T. Kemnitz to this Court dated Aug. 2, 2018 (\"Def. Letter\"), Ex. B, ECF No. 61-2 (identical Customer Agreement signed by Moss on June 2, 2015).) The Customer Agreement states that it \"governs the relationship between Customer[s] and [Defendant],\" and the integration clause states that \"this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties, who have made no other representations or warranties.\" (Customer Agmt. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 32(B).)

(Pls. Reply Letter at 3-4.) Plaintiffs assert that the Customer Agreement \"has been specifically found not to create any obligation to [sic] Interactive Brokers [LLC] with respect to portfolio margin accounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) But Plaintiffs' assertion is incorrect. In the Order, this Court found that the particular provisions of the Customer Agreement cited by Plaintiffs did \"not impose any obligations on Defendant.\" (Order at 15.) However, this Court did not find that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   provision of the Customer Agreement imposed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   obligations regarding portfolio margin. Paragraph 11 of the Customer Agreement, entitled \"Margin,\" contains provisions other than those cited by Plaintiffs that impose obligations on both parties. (Customer Agmt. \u00b6 11.) The fact that Plaintiffs have not alleged that those provisions impose the specific obligation that Plaintiffs alleged was breached-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an obligation not to use ETNs in the calculation of portfolio margin-is immaterial. Because the Customer Agreement addresses the subject matter at issue and states that it is the \"entire agreement between the parties,\" the parol evidence rule forbids the introduction of the 2014 Agreements to \"add to or vary the terms of the Customer Agreement.\n   <em>\n    In re Altro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663216\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/372/#p375\">\n    180 F.3d at 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim for breach of an implied contract also fails.

Although Plaintiffs argue that their quasi-contract claims are now premised on the Disclosure Agreement and the 2014 Agreements, Plaintiffs do not dispute\n   that the Customer Agreement is a valid contract. (Pls. Reply Letter at 7.) The Customer Agreement states that it \"governs the relationship between Customer[s] and [Defendant].\" (Customer Agmt. \u00b6 1.) As explained in the Order, \" 'quasi-contract claims'... must be dismissed as duplicative of a breach of contract claim when, as here, there is a 'valid and enforceable written contract governing ... the same subject matter.' \" (Order at 16 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nahabedian v.

Because that document is listed on the docket as the \"Amended Complaint,\" it was cited in this Court's June 12, 2018 Memorandum Decision and Order (the \"Order,\" ECF No. 57), as \"Am. Compl.\" However, Plaintiffs refer to their proposed amended pleading as their \"First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Letter from Frederic S.

Because, as explained\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , the Customer Agreement is a valid express contract that governs the subject matter at issue and contains an integration clause, the 2014 Agreements cannot form the basis of a separate implied contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Defendant's motion for leave to file a sur-reply, (ECF No. 65), is DENIED as moot.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
