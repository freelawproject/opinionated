Postal Inspectors had reasonable suspicion to detain the Subject Parcel, and\n   the Subject Parcel's retention was for a reasonable length of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The search of Defendant's residence did not rely upon the fruit of an unlawful search or seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Chase Williams' Motion to Suppress (ECF No. 21) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INDICTMENT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant Williams is charged in the\n   <strong>\n    Indictment\n   </strong>\n   filed on June 27, 2018 (ECF No. 13) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Count I\n   </strong>\n   for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of 500 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II\n   </strong>\n   for attempting to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846 ; and,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Count III\n   </strong>\n   for possession with intent to distribute a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 14, 2018, a criminal complaint was filed against Defendant.

The Court found Defendant Williams had no basis for an expectation of privacy in the parcel and therefore lacked standing to challenge the detention and search of the parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the hearing, the Parties stipulated and agreed to the facts as stated in the Government's three exhibits in order to allow the Court to reach Defendant's Fourth Amendment challenges to the detention and search of the Subject Parcel.

(Affidavit of Postal Inspector Brian W. Shaughnessy at \u00b6 7, attached to the Application for Search Warrant, as Government Exhibit 2). They identified the Subject Parcel as appearing suspicious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Subject Parcel was addressed in handwriting to \"Anne Langorio, 572 Kaiola Pl, Kihei, HI 96753.\" (Subject Parcel Shipping Label, Government Ex. 1). The handwritten return address was \"Jennifer Sanchez, 8847 Mandalay Way, Elk Grove, CA 95624.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Inspector Covert contacted United States Postal Inspector Brian W. Shaughnessy in Honolulu and immediately mailed\n   the Subject Parcel to him. (Shaughnessy Affidavit at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, Government Exhibit 2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Inspector Shaughnessy took possession of the Subject Parcel on Saturday. A canine narcotics detector was not available until Monday. On Monday, canine narcotics detector \"Alan\" alerted to the presence of the odor of a controlled substance in the Parcel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the alert, Inspector Shaughnessy applied for and obtained a federal search warrant to search the Parcel. Inspector Shaughnessy executed the search warrant and found cocaine in the Parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Federal agents then applied for and obtained a second federal search warrant to install a beeper and tracking device in the Parcel. (Affidavit of Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent Erik W. Klapmeier at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, attached to the Criminal Complaint, Government Exhibit 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Subject Parcel was transferred from the island of Oahu to the island of Maui. A controlled delivery of the Parcel was attempted. The residence was unoccupied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). The Postal Inspector left a notice of delivery at the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Later that same afternoon, a postal employee received a telephone call from an unknown male who asked that the parcel be redelivered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A second attempt at a controlled delivery of the Parcel was made immediately that afternoon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   During the second controlled delivery, a man, later identified as Eduard Rivera, drove up to the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Eduard Rivera accepted the Parcel from the undercover Postal Inspector who stated that it was for \"Anne Langorio.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rivera said, \"no, it is for my brother.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rivera took possession of the Parcel and took it into the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The beeper then emitted a rapid tone, indicating the Subject Parcel was opened. Agents approached the residence, and Rivera was detained in the doorway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The agents tracking the beeper knocked and announced \"police\" and proceeded through the apartment. While in the residence, the agents observed that pieces of packaging from the Subject Parcel were in the living room of the residence. Agents then discovered an internal stairwell from the upstairs residence directly to the ground level where they observed a screened-in window that was pushed out from the inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Agents were searching the surrounding area when a neighbor advised them that an unknown male had jumped the fence from the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). The male was later positively identified by the neighbor as Defendant Williams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Agents observed Defendant Williams two blocks away from the residence. He was detained without incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Federal agents applied for and obtained a third search warrant for Defendant Williams' residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17; Mag. No. 18-00629RLP). A search of the residence resulted in officers seizing 86.8 gross grams of cocaine, 406.8 gross grams of marijuana, and paraphernalia including packaging materials, small plastic bags, spoons with cocaine residue, and two small scales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The agents never found the Subject Parcel with the beeper or the pseudo-cocaine contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Defendant Williams Lacks Standing To Contest The Detention And Search Of the Subject Parcel\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that persons shall be \"secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   U.S. Const.

Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396598\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/923/#p926\">\n    280 F.3d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 928-29 (9th Cir. 2002) (finding the six-day delay in delivery in the parcel was reasonable given the diligence of the officers and the investigation over the course of a weekend).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Search Of Defendant's Residence Was Lawful\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendant has not demonstrated that he suffered a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. He does not have standing to challenge the seizure and search of the Subject Parcel. Even if Defendant had standing, there was reasonable suspicion to detain the package and there was no unreasonable delay in delivery of the Subject Parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Defendant attempts to challenge the search of his residence based on alleged \"tainted derivative evidence.\" (Motion to Suppress at p. 9, ECF No. 21). Defendant argues \"[t]he search of Defendant Williams residence would never have happened but for the illegal detention of the parcel to begin with.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The search of the Defendant's residence was conducted pursuant to a third search warrant obtained by law enforcement on Wednesday, June 13, 2018. Law enforcement obtained three different search warrants in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Following the execution of the second search warrant, Defendant Williams was detained two blocks from his residence. (Klapmeier Affidavit at \u00b6 13). Law enforcement discovered Sirchie powder on Defendant's hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Pieces of packaging from the Subject Parcel were in the living room of the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). The pseudo-cocaine packaging was not located in the living room or on the path of where Defendant Williams had fled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Law enforcement then obtained the third and final search warrant in order to search his residence. (Klapmeier Affidavit at \u00b6 17, Government's Exhibit 3; Mag. No. 18-00629RLP).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The evidence obtained from Defendant's residence is not subject to the exclusionary rule. The exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy. It results in the suppression from the government's case in chief the evidence which has been derived from an illegal search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

The exclusionary rule is not applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Defendant has not challenged the validity of the third search warrant authorizing the search of Defendant's residence. The United States Supreme Court has explained that evidence obtained pursuant to a facially-valid search warrant is admissible if the executing officers acted in good faith and in objectively reasonable reliance on the warrant.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
