Plaintiffs C.F.C., S.C.C., WeCount!, Inc. (\"WeCount\"), and Florida Immigrant Coalition, Inc. (\"FLIC\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a response in opposition (DE 32), and Defendant replied (DE 36). For the reasons below, the County's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for a hearing (DE 33) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the County on July 20, 2018. (DE 1). On September 9, 2018, before Defendant had responded, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. (DE 22). The amended complaint alleges that the County's policy and practice of honoring detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") violates Plaintiffs' rights under both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and also the parallel provisions of the Florida state constitution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief and money damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For purposes of ruling on the motion to dismiss, the Court accepts the following facts alleged in the amended complaint and contained in the exhibits as true. Plaintiffs S.C.C. and C.F.C. are residents of Miami-Dade County, Florida. (DE 22 at 4). C.F.C. is also a member of WeCount.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff WeCount is a \"community-based, non-profit organization with a membership comprised of Florida residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Its stated mission is to \"build the power of the immigrant community of Homestead through education, support, and collective action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff FLIC is a \"non-profit statewide coalition of more than 65 member organizations and over 100 allies\" whose stated mission is to \"grow the connection, capacity, and consciousness of immigrant families, organizations and communities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 6, 2018, S.C.C. was arrested for driving with a suspended license and for driving without a valid license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The arresting officer took S.C.C. to Metro\n   West Detention Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 7, 2018, ICE issued an immigration detainer request form listing S.C.C. as its subject. (DE 22, Ex. A). The detainer form stated that S.C.C. was \"a removable alien\" under civil immigration law and asked local law enforcement to hold him for up to 48 hours after he would otherwise be released from their custody.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Because of the detainer, S.C.C. was \"not placed in a diversion program\" at his arraignment and remained in the County's custody for over a month awaiting trial because he was not eligible for pretrial release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. S.C.C.'s criminal case was set for trial on July 16, 2018, but, after the state attorney requested a continuance in the case, the state court judge reduced S.C.C.'s bail to $2.00, which S.C.C. paid on July 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead of releasing S.C.C. after he paid bail, the County re-arrested him based on the detainer from ICE and held him until the following day, July 21, 2018, when ICE took custody of S.C.C. and moved him to an ICE detention facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 12, 2018, while out shopping with her family, C.F.C. was involved in a minor car accident in the parking lot of a grocery store.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Police officers from the Homestead Police Department arrived and, after speaking with C.F.C. and the other driver, arrested C.F.C. for driving without a license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. C.F.C.'s family paid her bail that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite the fact that an unknown officer told C.F.C. she would be released at 4:00 p.m. on May 12, 2018, the County refused to release her and instead re-arrested her pursuant to a detainer from ICE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 14, 2018, ICE took custody of C.F.C. and, at the time of the amended complaint, she remained in ICE's custody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The detainer forms issued for both S.C.C. and C.F.C. did not allege probable cause to believe that they had committed a crime and the detainers were not issued by a neutral magistrate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Instead, the detainer form asserted that \"[p]robable cause exists that [S.C.C] is a removable alien\" and, as support for this assertion, a box on S.C.C.'s detainer form had been checked next to an option stating that ICE's probable cause was based on \"biometric confirmation of the subject's identity and a records check of federal databases that affirmatively indicate, by themselves or in addition to other reliable information, that the subject either lacks immigration status or notwithstanding such status is removable under U.S. immigration law.\" (DE 22, Ex. A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   S.C.C. and C.F.C. allege that the County re-arrested them on July 20, 2018 and May 12, 2018, respectively, pursuant to a recent change in policy that, in effect, requires Miami-Dade Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation Department (\"MDCR\") staff to \"honor all immigration detainer requests.\" (DE 22 at 28). This policy reversed the County's previous policy, which had been in place since December 2013 and significantly circumscribed the County's authority to arrest individuals pursuant to immigration detainer requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. The 2013 policy stated that MDCR could honor detainer requests from ICE only if (1) \"the federal government agrees in writing to reimburse Miami-Dade County for any and all costs relating to compliance with [ICE] detainer requests\"; (2) \"the inmate that is the subject of such a request has a previous conviction for a Forcible Felony ...\"; and (3) the inmate has, at the time the\n   County received the detainer request, \"a pending charge of a non-bondable offense ....\" Miami-Dade Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, Resolution 1008-13, at 5 (Dec. 3, 2013), http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/legistarfiles/MinMatters/Y2013/132196min.pdf. Because the federal government declined to reimburse the County for any expenses associated with detainers, MDCR stopped arresting individuals based on detainer requests in January 2014. (DE 22 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2016, the Board ratified its position when it unanimously opposed statewide legislation that would preempt its anti-detainer policy and \"require ICE detainers to be honored.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Resolution 77-16, which the Board passed on January 20, 2016, cited the fact that \"federal courts have found that local law enforcement agencies that detain individuals on the sole authority of a detainer request violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, exposing such agencies to legal liability unless there has been an independent finding of probable cause to justify detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board's resolution goes on to state that \"while criminal detainers are subject to multiple procedural safeguards, including a requirement of court approval, [ICE] detainer requests lack comparable protections ... [because] a judge is not required to review or approve an immigration detainer.\" Miami-Dade Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, Resolution 77-16, at 5-6 (Jan. 20, 2016), http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/legistarfiles/MinMatters/Y2015/153028min.pdf. The Board noted that \"a judge is not required to review or approve an immigration detainer,\" and that a detainer \"may be issued by a single Immigration[ ] and Customs Enforcement officer when there are no immigration proceedings pending.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. \"[T]his process,\" the Board found, \"does not meet the U.S. Constitution's minimum standard for authorizing detention after an inmate is scheduled to be released.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite the County's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   clear position on the legality and efficacy of honoring all detainer requests, on January 26, 2017, Miami-Dade County Mayor Gimenez reversed course, issuing a memorandum to MDCR that ordered it to \"honor all immigration detainer requests.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 22, Ex. B). The directive was not preceded by any public notice or opportunity for debate, nor did it mention the Board's 2013 resolution limiting MDCR's authority to hold people pursuant to detainer requests and the myriad legal concerns with honoring detainers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 17, 2017, the Board ratified the Mayor's directive and amended its 2013 Resolution (1008-13) to direct the Mayor \"to ensure that, related to immigration detainer requests, Miami-Dade County ... is cooperating with the federal government to the extent permissible by law.\" Miami-Dade Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, Resolution 163-17 (Feb. 17, 2017), http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/matter.asp?matter=170440&amp;file=false&amp;yearFolder=Y201.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   MDCR is following the Mayor's directive-as\n   ratified by the Board's resolution-and, since January 26, 2017, has maintained a policy and practice of re-arresting individuals in its custody after their criminal custody has ended on the sole basis that the person is the subject of an immigration detainer request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The amended complaint contains five counts against the County. Counts I and II are brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and allege that the County violated Plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. (DE 22 at 27-30). Counts IV and V are brought under the parallel provisions of the Florida Constitution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(DE 22 at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The County moved to dismiss with prejudice on the grounds that: (1) this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims; (2) Plaintiffs lack standing to seek retrospective declaratory relief; (3) Plaintiffs failed to state\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the County under Section 1983 ; (4) Plaintiffs failed to allege viable claims under Florida law, and; (5) Plaintiffs failed to include the federal government, an allegedly indispensable party, as a defendant.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court assumes as true all well-pled factual allegations and determines whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The County Lacked Authority under State Law to Arrest C.F.C. or S.C.C. for a Civil Immigration Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The County maintains that it had authority under two provisions of Florida law to detain C.F.C. and S.C.C. on behalf of the federal government for alleged civil immigration offenses. Plaintiffs respond that these state law provisions are not independent sources of authority for the County to arrest individuals for civil immigration violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Florida Statute Section 950.03\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, the County argues that it had authority to arrest C.F.C. and S.C.C. under Florida Statute Section 950.03, which provides that \"[t]he keeper of the jail in each county within this state shall receive into his or her custody any prisoner who may be committed to the keeper's charge under the authority of the United States and shall safely keep each prisoner according to the warrant or precept for such commitment until he or she is discharged by due course of law of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20950.03\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 950.03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs contend that this statute-enacted in 1847-is irrelevant here because, rather than operating as an independent source of arrest authority, it instead authorizes jailers to hold prisoners who have already been validly arrested by federal officers. (DE 32 at 17-18). Moreover, the County agrees that C.F.C. and S.C.C. were in its sole custody-not being \"receive[d] into\" its custody-when they were detained pursuant to the detainer requests from ICE. (DE 23 at 2, 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Section 950.03 is not an independent source of authority under which the County could lawfully arrest C.F.C. and S.C.C. solely on the basis of a detainer. As discussed above, the County did not have authority under federal law to arrest C.F.C. and S.C.C. based on a detainer, and this archaic Florida statute adds nothing to the County's arrest authority. Accordingly, the Court finds that Section 950.03 does not support the County's arrest of C.F.C. and S.C.C. pursuant to a detainer based on alleged civil immigration violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Florida Statute Section 901.18\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The County also points to Florida Statute Section 901.18 for the proposition that it is immune from civil liability under Florida law because the County's arrest of C.F.C. and S.C.C. amounted to \"aid[ing] a peace officer.\" (DE 23 at 18). Section 901.18 provides that \"[a] person commanded to aid a peace officer shall have the same authority to arrest as that peace officer and shall not be civilly liable for any reasonable conduct in rendering assistance to that officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20901.18\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 901.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs argue that the County's position with respect to this provision of Florida law is untenable because the County's interpretation would \"require every person who is asked to make an arrest to make that arrest\" and, thus, there would be no limit to the arrests that federal agencies could demand of local officers. (DE 32 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court again agrees with Plaintiffs' reading of the statute. It cannot be that Section 901.18 applies in the context of federal officials coordinating with the County to arrest individuals for civil immigration purposes. If an ICE official (or any other federal officer) is a \"peace officer\" under Section 901.18, then ICE officials could \"command\" the County and its officers to arrest individuals-pursuant to detainers or, presumably, for any other reason-and the County would be required to comply by \"render[ing] assistance as directed\n   by the officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20901.18\">\n    Fla.

Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781062\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/1263/#p1280\">\n    344 F.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1280 (11th Cir. 2003) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The County argues that, unless the federal government is joined as an indispensable party: (1) the Court may not be able to accord complete relief to the parties because the proximate cause for the alleged harm is not a party to the case; (2) the County could be subject to incurring inconsistent obligations because it is the sole defendant but was acting under the authority of a non-party; and, (3) the individual with knowledge of the basis for the detainer's probable cause determination (the ICE officer) is not a party. (DE 11, at 17). Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that the County will not be subject to inconsistent obligations because: (1) the County owes no legal duty to the federal government to comply with voluntary detainer requests; (2) the County's independent decision to honor detainer requests does not give the federal government any legally-protected interest at stake in this case; and (3) the Court's decision would not interfere with any legal obligation of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the federal government is not an indispensable party to this action. First, based on the allegations in the amended complaint, the Court can accord complete relief to the current Parties without additional litigants being joined. Plaintiffs challenge the County's policy of complying with voluntary requests from a federal agency as unconstitutional. Taking these allegations as true, it would not be necessary to join the federal government in order to rule on the constitutionality of the County's policy or whether the policy caused Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights to be violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Further, although the United States filed a statement of interest in this matter (DE 27), there is nothing in the record at this stage to suggest that the U.S. Government is \"so situated that disposing of the action\" in its absence would \"impair or impede the [Government]'s ability to protect the interest\" or \"leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). While the U.S. Government may have a legitimate interest in carrying out immigration enforcement, it certainly does not have a legitimate interest in ensuring that the County does so.\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526347\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/855/#p874\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874 (N.D. III. 2018) (prohibiting the Department of Justice from conditioning\n   federal grants on cooperation with federal immigration enforcement). And the U.S. Government has no interest involving the County's allegedly unconstitutional policy because this policy pertains to a voluntary decision the County has made to honor ICE detainers. Finally, proceeding without the U.S. Government would not, as the County suggests, leave it subject to incurring inconsistent obligations because the County is not obliged to honor ICE detainer requests and has instead freely and deliberately chosen to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that the U.S. Government is not an indispensable party that need be joined under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 in order for this matter to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that the County's motion to dismiss (DE 23) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The County shall file an answer to the amended complaint within 14 days of the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE AND ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in chambers in Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    14\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of December, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Although Plaintiffs did not attach C.F.C.'s detainer form to the amended complaint, the same detainer form was in effect at the time of both individual Plaintiffs' arrests. The Court therefore assumes for purposes of ruling on the motion to dismiss that C.F.C.'s detainer form was substantively identical to S.C.C.'s, which is Exhibit A to the amended complaint.

A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    The Board's 2016 resolution-which expressed in no uncertain terms that detaining individuals on the sole basis of an immigration detainer is illegal-was drafted by the Miami-Dade County Attorney's Office, which is now defending the County's current policy and practice of honoring all detainer requests.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The Parties appear to agree that the Mayor's directive-while clearly the impetus for the County's policy reversal-did not have the force of law until ratified by the Board's resolution on February 17, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    This resolution also states that the County \"will continue to require the federal government to show probable cause on all immigration detainer requests.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5.
