BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Motion to Stay. The Court held a\n   hearing on June 5, 2018. The primary issue is whether the Court should stay the case for a determination of Plaintiff Majestic Howard's competency after the Honorable Judge Pedro G. Rael, District Judge for the Counties of Cibola, Sandoval, and Valencia, Thirteenth Judicial District Court, State of New Mexico, declared Howard, a defendant in a state criminal trial, incompetent and while Howard awaits results of guardianship proceedings before the Honorable Carl J. Butkus, District Judge for the County of Bernalillo, Second Judicial District Court, State of New Mexico. The Court granted the Motion to Stay on August 6, 2018 in its Order, filed August 6, 2018 (Doc. 61), because questions about Howard's competency put his counsel in the case in a difficult position, and the Defendants could obtain the discovery they desire after Howard resolves competency questions. The Court stays the case in federal court pending a determination of Howard's competency and orders the parties to provide the Court case status reports every forty-five days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court takes its facts from the Complaint for Violations of Civil Rights Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1988 and the New Mexico Tort Claims Act and for Damages, D-202-CV-2017-04545 (Second Judicial District Court, County of Bernalillo, State of New Mexico, filed June 23, 2017), filed in federal court August 21, 2017 (Doc. 1-1)(\"Complaint\").

Franco asks to unseal documents about Howard's competency from nine criminal cases, because: (i) Howard has not responded to Franco's discovery requests; (ii) Howard retained competency to file the\n   present case; (iii) Howard has alleged incompetency in several cases proceeding this one; (iv) Franco cannot evaluate the Motion to Stay without the requested documents; and (v) Howard puts his competency at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Unseal Criminal Records at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court held a hearing on the Motion to Stay on June 5, 2018.

The Court asked \"what concern\" the delay in discovery raises, because \"[i]t's hard for [Howard's counsel] to get the discovery into [the Defendants'] hands\" if Howard is incompetent.

The City of Albuquerque contended that filing suit is inconsistent with asserting incompetency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:23-8:9 (Nixon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Franco contended that he doubted Howard's incompetence based on the timeline leading to the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 12:19-14:7 (Martinez).

Addressing the Defendants' concerns about the documents under seal in state criminal proceedings, Howard argued that the guardianship proceeding involved confidential mental health concerns, and Howard could share the information after the proceeding, when the parties could re-litigate the issue before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:19-27:17 (Gorence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Franco objected to relying on the state court's incompetency findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 14:12-15:6 (Martinez).

In response to the Court's question about what he wanted to do \"with the case itself,\" Tr. at 22:17 (Court), Franco requested that, after Judge Butkus' decision, the parties argue Howard's competence before the Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:18-23:1 (Martinez).

According to Franco, the guardian ad litem would have to intervene, and the Court would have to reach findings on Howard's competence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 24:10-19 (Martinez).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court concluded that it would stay the case, because competency issues \"put[ ] the defense lawyer in the criminal case and plaintiff's lawyer in this case in a difficult position of figuring out what they can really do and can't do without a client.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:5-8 (Court).

The Defendants object to Howard's claims of incompetency and seek responses to previous discovery requests and sealed documents related to Howard's mental state.

June 2, 2017) (Browning, J.)(internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Powell v. Symons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882171\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/301/#p303\">\n    680 F.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (3d Cir. 2012) ). Thus,\n   the Court has a duty to ensure that Howard is competent. While the Motion to Stay does not ask the Court to reach a determination about Howard's competency, rule 17(c) puts pressure on the Court to consider seriously the concerns Howard raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because Howard requests to stay his own efforts to obtain relief, the Court finds the motion compelling. Howard obtains little if adjudicated incompetent. He will, in fact, likely suffer from a determination of incompetency. Such a decision may deprive Howard of his own testimony -- his likely only or at least most favorable testimony -- before a fact-finder severely limiting his ability to present his case. Howard's case, after all, depends on his story about the events in October, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Defendants complain about delays in discovery and an inability to obtain desired information. The Court, however, concludes that the delays are reasonable given the doubts about Howard's competency. Howard's counsel cannot provide sound discovery responses when the client may not comprehend that he is involved in litigation. Howard's counsel should consider Howard's decisions in litigating the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Howard's potential incompetency raises, at a minimum, practical challenges to progressing the litigation at this time. At the hearing, the Defendants cited\n   <em>\n    Regency Health Services v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   to argue that incompetency is not an excuse for ignoring discovery requests, but the excerpt quoted reveals that, in that case, a guardian filed suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the facts are distinguishable from the situation here, where the Defendants ask Howard's counsel to proceed despite concerns about the client's competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court also concludes that staying the case will not impair the Defendants' ability to address their concerns about discovery or their doubts about Howard's incompetency. Howard can satisfy the Defendants' discovery requests after the case resumes. Howard offers to provide the Defendants the sealed documents pursuant to \"an appropriate confidentiality order\" following the proceedings before Judge Butkus. Tr. at 26:20-21 (Gorence.) Thus, the stay will not deprive the Defendants of this information. Likewise, Howard concedes that the Defendants could litigate competency before the Court \"if [they] want[ ] a second bite at the apple\" if the Court and the Defendants do not \"want to ... give full faith and credit to a state judge.\" Tr. at 26:23-27:2 (Gorence). Accordingly, the stay will not prejudice the Defendants much, if at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court, thus, concludes that a stay is warranted. Accordingly, in its Order, the Court ordered that: (i) Plaintiff's Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Determination of Competency and Memorandum in Support, filed March 12, 2018 (Doc. 32), was granted; (ii) the case was stayed pending a determination of Howard's competency; and (iii) the parties should give the Court status reports every forty-five days of the case's progress.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Law enforcement use bait vehicles to catch thieves stealing cars or items from cars.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bait car, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_car.
