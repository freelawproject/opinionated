The conditions require that grant recipients (i) provide the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (\"ICE\") access to their correctional facilities for immigration enforcement purposes, (ii) provide notice to ICE of the release date for detainees, and (iii) certify their compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a statute which prohibits state and local governments from restricting information-sharing\n   with the Department of Homeland Security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   These new conditions have sparked litigation around the country.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-cv-03894;\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-cv-05720;\n   <em>\n    United States v. California\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-cv-490-JAM;\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-cv-07215-R. In the two separate, related actions captioned above, the State of California and the City and County of San Francisco challenge the conditions requiring access, notice and compliance with Section 1373, as well as the constitutionality of Section 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DOJ has lost each time these issues have been raised thus far. It continues to withhold grant funding to six states and several local jurisdictions, including California and San Francisco, which it believes do not comply with the Byrne JAG program conditions for fiscal year 2017. California requests that I enjoin DOJ from imposing the conditions, award the State the grants for which it is eligible, and declare that certain California laws identified by the State comply with the Section 1373. Alternatively, it seeks declaratory judgment finding Section 1373 unconstitutional on its face. Similarly, San Francisco requests that I enjoin enforcement of the conditions, issue declaratory judgment that San Francisco's sanctuary city laws comply with Section 1373, and issue an injunction restraining the DOJ from withholding Byrne JAG funding to San Francisco because of Section 1373. Both ask that the scope of the injunction be nationwide. DOJ responds with its own motions for summary judgment, essentially urging that I reject the requests of California and San Francisco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In agreement with every court that has looked at these issues, I find that: the challenged conditions violate the separation of powers; Section 1373 is unconstitutional; the Attorney General exceeds the Spending Power in violation of the United States Constitution by imposing the challenged conditions; the challenged conditions are arbitrary and capricious; California's and San Francisco's laws comply with Section 1373 as construed in this Order; California is deserving of the mandamus relief it seeks; and both parties are entitled to a permanent injunction. Because the requisites for a nationwide injunction are met as a result of the unconstitutionality of Section 1373 and the uniform effect of DOJ's conditions on Byrne JAG grantees around the country, I will follow the lead of the district court in\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   and issue a nationwide injunction but stay its nationwide effect until the Ninth Circuit is able to address it in the normal course on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

No party disputes that the Attorney General has some discretion to make grants in the statute.

San Francisco argues that Section 10102(a) did not give DOJ authority to impose conditions because the power of \"placing special conditions\" on and \"determining priority purposes\" of grants refers to powers that have to be vested by some other statutory authority and are not enumerated in Section 10102. California contends that the access and notice conditions are not justified by Section 10102(a)(6) because it only permits the OJP to place special conditions on all grants to \"high-risk\" grantees. California also asserts that Section 1373 identifies a \"special award condition\" to COPS grants as a \"high-risk condition\" but refers to other conditions as \"award terms and conditions\" only. CA RJN Ex. 31 at 5, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   DOJ counters that Section 10102(a)(6) must be interpreted to grant the Assistant Attorney General discretion to impose the conditions given that the statute was amended to add the \"special conditions\" and \"priority purposes\" language. To give the amended language no power would therefore contravene the canon of statutory construction against surplusage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

DOJ emphasizes the absence of any language limiting \"special conditions\" on only \"high-risk\" grantees when the text grants authority to place conditions on \"all grants.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010102\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). It interprets \"determine priority purposes\" broadly as including the authority to prioritize federal grant funds to further federal policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   DOJ's interpretation that Section 10102 establishes an independent grant of authority to impose the challenged conditions contradicts the plain meaning of the statute. The Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/#p293\">\n    888 F.3d at 284-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the district court's order in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 616-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , are particularly instructive. They found, and I agree, that DOJ asserts its independent authority to place \"special conditions\" on grants to determine \"priority purposes\" based on the subordinate clause in the last\n   sentence of Section 10102. The clause begins with the word \"including,\" conveying a reference to part of a whole. In this statute, \"placing special conditions\" and \"determining priority purposes\" refers to part of the powers that the Assistant Attorney General could have that were described earlier in the sentence. Those powers depend on the authority \"vested in the Assistant Attorney General pursuant to this chapter or by delegation of the Attorney General.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010102\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No portion of the same chapter authorizes the conditions explicitly. The Attorney General lacks the power to impose additional conditions on Congress's exercise of the Spending Power independent of Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the Byrne JAG program statute does not reference Section 10102 and does not provide the authority to impose the notice and access conditions as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec. II.A.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition, the statutory structure of Section 10102(a)(6) does not support DOJ's broad interpretation of its power to impose the challenged conditions. Section 10102(a)(6) is in a different subchapter than the Byrne JAG statute and there is no text expressly applying it to the Byrne JAG program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/#p293\">\n    888 F.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A clause in a catch-all provision at the end of a list of explicit powers would be an odd place indeed to put a sweeping power to impose any conditions on any grants-a power much more significant than all of the duties and powers that precede it in the listing, and a power granted to the Assistant Attorney General that was not granted to the Attorney General.\"). Ultimately, if such a broad power was not granted to the Attorney General under Section 10102(a)(6) or elsewhere, by the statute's plain meaning the Assistant Attorney General does not hold such power either.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress is unlikely to ground the Attorney General's authority to impose substantive conditions in a subsection dedicated to conferring power on the AAG.\").

First, it asserts that the Tenth Amendment and the\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   opinion are inapposite because the certification condition is for a voluntary federal grant program. It argues that applicants can simply decline to participate in the Byrne JAG program, making the Spending Clause the appropriate legal battleground as opposed to the Tenth Amendment's anti-commandeering principle. But this argument \"ignores that Section 1373 is an extant federal law with which [California or San Francisco] must comply, completely irrespective of whether or not [it] accepts Byrne JAG funding.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526347\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/855/#p865\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d at 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . San Francisco and California challenge the certification condition because Section 1373 is unconstitutional; they do not necessarily challenge the Attorney General's power to impose other grant conditions requiring compliance with \"all other applicable Federal laws\" that are consistent with the Byrne JAG program statute language. For these reasons, the voluntariness of the grant program does not remove a challenge to a potentially applicable federal law, here Section 1373, from the scope of the Tenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, DOJ contends that, regardless of\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , the federal government has \"broad, undoubted power\" over immigration,\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , 567 U.S. at 394,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p394\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that statutes like Section 1373 are presumed to be a constitutional exercise of that power.\n   <em>\n    Reno v.

It insisted that the INA is a broad regulatory scheme over individuals, unlike PASPA in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   which involved direct regulation of the states to enforce a specific sports betting policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Proceeding at 8-9 (CA Dkt.

The Court also explained how\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   involved \"standards governing alien registration,\" and in turn conferred \"a federal right to be free from any other registration requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    at 1481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Here, Section 1373 applies regardless of any State's attempt to regulate immigration, and in fact restricts States in unrelated criminal justice contexts completely outside the scope of the INA. Section 1373, as already discussed, does not regulate private actors or provide private actors with any additional rights in the INA's statutory scheme. DOJ's preemption argument fails on this distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   I turn now to analyzing Section 1373 and the anti-commandeering case law.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   provided a non-exhaustive set of three policy reasons that make adhering to the anticommandeering principle important. First, the principle is \"one of the Constitution's structural protections of liberty,\" dividing federal and state authority \"for the protection of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    at 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation and citation omitted). Second, it \"promotes political accountability\" against the backdrop that voters are unable to place credit or blame when the roles of the State and Congress are blurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, it prevents the federal government from \"shifting the costs of regulation to the States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These three concerns are relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Section 1373 contravenes the idea that liberty is best served by the Constitution's intended division of \"authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p157\">\n    505 U.S. at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p157\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). DOJ argues that Section 1373 requires states and local governments to allow the disclosure of an immigrant's address, location information, release date, date of birth, familial status, contact information, and any other information that would help federal immigration officials perform their duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sherman Decl. Ex. B (Defs. Interrog. Resp. 17); Ex. E (Defs. RFA Resps. 9-16). To comply with that interpretation, California and San Francisco would need to submit control of their own officials' communications to the federal government and forego passing laws contrary to Section 1373. They would also need to allocate their limited law enforcement resources to exchange information with the federal government whenever requested instead of to the essential services (like enforcing generally applicable criminal laws) they believe would most benefit their respective communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As DOJ interprets Section 1373 today, the statute requires communications by state and local governments in ways that create an appearance of a uniform federal/state/local immigration enforcement policy indiscernible to San Francisco or California residents.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When Congress itself regulates, the responsibility for the benefits and burdens of the regulation is apparent.\").

Second, because all the other conditions in Section 10153(a) apply to the grant itself, the statutory context does not support imposing a condition beyond the grant administration process.

Access and Notice Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   California asserts that the access and notice conditions do not provide clear notice of what is required to comply. There is no statute providing guidance about the condition requirements, and the award letters presumably outlining the terms of compliance do not explain the requirement that a state or local statute, rule, regulation, policy, or practice, must be in place and \"designed to ensure\" federal agents have access to and get notice concerning individuals in correctional facilities and their release date information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ RJN, Ex.

California also takes issue with DOJ's lack of explanation about whether the TRUTH Act disqualifies it from satisfying the access condition, and\n   what state entities in the California Board of State and Community Corrections, which receives the Byrne JAG funds, are included in the award letter language \"program and activity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sherman Decl.

San Francisco asserts that the notice condition, requiring notice \"as early as practicable,\" is unclear and that the award letter language does not acknowledge times when notice is impossible because inmates are released with little or no notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lee Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. E at \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56; DOJ RJN, Ex. B \u00b6\u00b6 55, 56. Further, San Francisco believes it is unclear from the DOJ's briefing in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v.

In 2007, DOJ's Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") evaluated San Francisco's compliance with Section 1373 and concluded that even though ICE officials objected to its policies, there was no concern about the flow of information between the two agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lee Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex.

B \u00b6\u00b6 53-55. In October 2016, DOJ contends that OJP also issued \"guidance\" on compliance with the Section 1373 certification condition.

In a November 15, 2017 letter to San Francisco, DOJ expressed that it was concerned that San Francisco's sanctuary city policies violate Section 1373 since they prohibit notifying ICE of release state or personal information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lee Decl. \u00b6 14, Ex.

It also emphasizes DOJ's increasing focus on removing classes of immigrants who have incurred civil penalties but have not been convicted of any crime, which is beyond the criminal justice goals of the Byrne JAG program.

DOJ cannot justify its certification condition on this record, which did not assess any of the reasons DOJ imposed the certification condition and which offered recommendations to DOJ specifically in response to DOJ's decision to notify applicants of the certification condition.

At most it demonstrates another tautology where the DOJ is justifying its conclusion to impose the conditions in this lawsuit based on a separate document that also makes an unsupported conclusion about the Section 1373 compliance condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Fourth, relying on the Backgrounder on Grant Requirements, DOJ contends that the challenged conditions had a \"goal of increasing information sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement ... to enforce the law and keep our communities safe.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Backgrounder, AR-00993. I addressed the Backgrounder thoroughly in my prior Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 21 (finding that it was unclear that the certification condition had the requisite rational connection to the facts in the Backgrounder). There is not a clear link, or at least the government has not been able to provide one, between localities keeping release dates or contact information confidential and more dangerous or less safe communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Finally, DOJ relies on a 2017 press release by the Attorney General proclaiming that sanctuary city policies \"make all of us less safe because they intentionally undermine our laws and protect illegal aliens who have committed crimes.\" DOJ Press Release No. 17-826, AR-00992. The Attorney General contends that \"[t]hese [sanctuary city] policies also encourage illegal immigration and even human trafficking by perpetuating the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The press release expressly communicates the DOJ's \"top priority of reducing violent crime\" by encouraging jurisdictions to \"change their policies and partner with federal law enforcement to remove criminals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Much of the rhetoric discussed in this document tracks with the DOJ's Backgrounder in the administrative record, such as the contentions that sanctuary city policies make communities less safe, encourage illegal immigration, and allow crimes to be committed. However, also like the Backgrounder, this press release lacks any demonstrable linkage between allowing local government to maintain immigration confidentiality and less safe communities. As noted in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   , some claims in the press release are also \"factually untrue\" with respect to California's laws and policies.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   624 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DOJ Press Release No. 17-826, AR-00992 (claiming that sanctuary policies nationwide \"perpetuat[e] the lie that in certain cities, illegal aliens can live outside the law,\" and \"protect illegal aliens who have committed crimes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   It is worth emphasizing that the evidence before me indicates the opposite of DOJ's rhetoric. In contrast to DOJ's unsubstantiated view, California shows that imposing the challenged conditions may damage its law enforcement efforts. In support of its sanctuary policies, the California Assembly Committee on Public Safety relied on a study finding lower likelihoods of contacting law enforcement by Latinos (44 percent), undocumented immigrants (70 percent), and U.S.-born Latinos (28 percent) who were victims of a crime, for fear of police inquiring into their immigration status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CA RJN Ex. 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Wong Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-38 (sharing similar results in a separate study of San Diego undocumented Mexican nationals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   This evidence is not isolated to California. A letter from the Mayor of New Orleans to the Attorney General explains the work their law enforcement does in coordination with federal officials and why the conditions and rhetoric of the Executive Branch are hindering their work to make communities safer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-00487 (\"Fear\n   within immigrant communities pushes individuals and families, undocumented or not, into the shadows, and makes the task of protecting everyone much more difficult for law enforcement.\"). A second letter from the City Solicitor of Philadelphia explains its view that trust between law enforcement and residents, regardless of immigration status, leads to safer communities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-00640 (\"gain[ing] the trust and cooperation of ... residents, crime victims and witnesses ... regardless of their immigration status\" makes the \"community stronger and ... streets safer.\"). The record also includes a letter from Milwaukee County's Corporation Counsel to the Acting Assistant Attorney General, stating that its local policies make the community safer and that the conditions will undermine those policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-00722 (finding that its resolutions \"make the community safer by fostering trust between residents and local law enforcement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Amici prosecutors and law enforcement leaders provide many other studies showing that interjecting federal immigration enforcement into local law enforcement weakens trust, which is vitally important to community-oriented policing and reducing crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amicus Brief (CA Dkt. No. 130; SF Dkt. No. 136-1). Not only do Latinos and undocumented immigrants become less likely to contact law enforcement if they are victims or witnesses of a crime, but 85 percent of immigrant families are mixed-status households, meaning that the fear or lack of trust extends to United States citizens who worry about the deportation of their family members or close relatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Anita Khashu, The Role Of Local Police: Striking a Balance Between Immigration Enforcement and Civil Liberties, Police Found.

Interpreting Section 1373\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Assuming for the moment that Section 1373 is not unconstitutional on its face, I need to consider what it requires. DOJ asserts that Section 1373, at a minimum, includes contact information and release status information for any detained immigrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Mot. for Summ. J. at 29;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sherman Decl. Ex. B (Defs. Interog. Resps. 6, 17).

J. at 25-27. This familiar disagreement about Section 1373 has already been analyzed and resolved by three district courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Steinle v. City &amp; Cnty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   , the Hon. Joseph C. Spero found that Section 1373 was void of anything addressing inmate release dates because by its terms it only governed citizenship or immigration status information.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270190\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/994/#p1015\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1015 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (\"no plausible reading of [ Section 1373 ] ... encompasses the release date of an undocumented inmate.\"). The court found no need to interpret legislative history because a plain reading of the statute is so clear. Following\n   <em>\n    Steinle\n   </em>\n   , in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   the court concluded that Section 1373\"does not require advance notice of an individual's release from custody.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525102\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/289/\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

San Francisco's Sanctuary City Ordinances Comply with Section 1373\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   San Francisco also requests a declaratory judgment that its sanctuary city laws, Chapters 12H and 12I, comply with Section 1373. DOJ disputes declaratory relief because it asserts the San Francisco laws prohibit providing contact information and the release status of detainees. Because I do not interpret Section 1373 broadly to require state and local governments to share contact information and release status information with federal immigration\n   officials, I find that San Francisco's sanctuary city laws comply with the federal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Chapter 12H prohibits San Francisco employees from \"disseminat[ing] information regarding release status of any individual or any other such personal information\" and allows them to communicate that information if required to by federal law. SF Admin. Code \u00a7 12H.2. The term \"personal information\" is defined expressly in Chapter 12I as \"any confidential, identifying information about an individual, including, but not limited to, home or work contact information, and family or emergency contact information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SF RJN Ex. A. San Francisco's Board of Supervisors also amended this chapter in 2016, changing restrictions on communicating \"immigration status\" to \"release status.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SF RJN Ex. G. Chapter 12I prohibits responding to detainer requests from federal immigration officials and allows employees to notify federal officials of inmate release status in certain limited circumstances. SF Admin. Code \u00a7 12I.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   There is no dispute that Chapters 12H and 12I prohibit sharing contact information and release dates with ICE, but that is not a requirement of Section 1373. Still, the DOJ interprets Chapter 12H as violating Section 1373 even under the court's interpretation, based on its language prohibiting employees from \"assist[ing] in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.\" SF Admin. Code \u00a7 12H.2. In reply, San Francisco contends that this general prohibition should not control where elsewhere in the chapter there is specific language that only prohibits employees from sharing release status information and personal information. I agree and do not read Chapters 12H and 12I so broadly where a narrower reading harmonizes the sanctuary city laws with Section 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Neither Chapter 12H or 12I concerns communications about information on an individual's immigration and citizenship status. San Francisco's six departments that received Byrne JAG funds: the Department of Children Youth &amp; Their Families, Adult Probation, Sheriff's Department, Police Department, District Attorney's Office, and Public Defender's Office, either administer policies that are consistent with San Francisco's Sanctuary City laws or do not have policies that involve Chapters 12H and 12I.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fletcher Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Hennessy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 17-18; Sainez Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11 (outlining policies consistent with San Francisco's sanctuary city laws),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Chyi Decl. \u00b6 27; DeBerry Decl. \u00b6 5; Adachi Decl. \u00b6 5 (describing the lack of policies related to Chapters 12H and 12I).

J. at 33-34. It also believes the City Attorney's Office's written public guidance on interacting with ICE agents give employees the impression that they should refuse to speak with federal immigration officials because it lists what employees \"are not required\" to do for ICE agents and italicizes negatives like the word \"not.\" I do not agree that the format of the documents is significant or dispositive of compliance with Section 1373. What is required, and what is apparent in the documents, is that they do not prohibit information-sharing of an individual's immigration status. San Francisco's\n   sanctuary city laws, Chapters 12H and 12I, comply with Section 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Like the Ninth Circuit, I disagree with DOJ's wholesale arguments against nationwide injunctions; the scope of nationwide injunctive relief is not limited to class actions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bresgal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548583\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/843/1163/#p1170\">\n    843 F.2d at 1170-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining over-breadth by the relief the parties are entitled to, not by the threshold issue of whether there is a certified class action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   DOJ expressed additional concern that nationwide injunctions prevent \"legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.\"\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2425\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2425,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613035\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2392/#p2425\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring). I share that concern. Indeed, the issues in this case are the same issues before the Third and Seventh Circuits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ. Mot. for Summ. J. at 40 (noting that granting a nationwide injunction would authorize relief that the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   Seventh Circuit might itself reject). DOJ called nationwide injunctions a \"one-way-ratchet\" that allows plaintiffs to have relief on behalf of all others, while the government cannot preclude all plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/#p293\">\n    888 F.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Manion, J., dissenting in part). That is also a fair point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Amici assert, on the other hand, that because there is a narrow constitutional issue in dispute with little variance in the DOJ's arguments and defenses, this does not appear to be the type of situation in which allowing more cases to percolate in federal courts would be of much benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amicus Brief at 11 (SF Dkt. No. 137-1). In addition, a nationwide injunction would not implicate some of the other concerns raised in the DOJ's briefing. In\n   <em>\n    L.A. Haven Hospice, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that \"a nationwide injunction would not be in the public interest because it would significantly disrupt the administration of the Medicare program ... and would create great uncertainty.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n    638 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A nationwide injunction would not disrupt the administration of the Byrne JAG program, a formula grant program that does not independently give the Attorney General authority to impose additional conditions not conferred by Congress. Public interest would be served, as I stated earlier, because an injunction would bring \"clarity to all parties and to citizens dependent on public services.\"\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517815\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/1225/\">\n    897 F.3d at 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without a nationwide injunction when the court finds a constitutional violation, there is even greater likelihood that relief limited to the parties \"would not cure the constitutional deficiency, which would endure in all [its] applications.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276595\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/554/#p605\">\n    857 F.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (4th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   California and San Francisco have shown that Section 1373 is unconstitutional and that the challenged conditions violate the separation of powers. In consideration of the factual record, including the structure of the Byrne JAG program and the harm to jurisdictions across the country, I find that this case justifies nationwide relief under\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517815\" index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/1225/\">\n    897 F.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That said, this Order alternatively relies on my narrow interpretation of Section 1373 as it applies to California's and San Francisco's \"sanctuary\" laws and practices. If the Ninth Circuit agreed with those alternative findings, but disagrees about the constitutionality of Section 1373, a nationwide injunction would be inappropriate because the laws and practices of each \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction differ. Accordingly, I grant the injunction in favor of California and San Francisco and stay its nationwide scope until the\n   Ninth Circuit has the opportunity to consider it on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. MANDAMUS RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   California also seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the Attorney General to disburse Byrne JAG and COPS grant funding because the challenged conditions are unlawful under the APA. The APA authorizes the court to \"compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

The first factor, the \"rule of reason,\" is the most important but is not determinative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Core Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3572400,3655364\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/531/849/\">\n    531 F.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 855 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The court is still required to consider all factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re A Cmty. Voice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265930\" index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/779/#p786\">\n    878 F.3d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Each factor supports mandamus relief for the Byrne JAG grant and COPS grant funding. For the first two factors, delays beyond a year time frame preclude recipients from receiving their awards when they need them to support more immediate projects or programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525102\" index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/289/\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"it bears emphasis that Congress specifically set the JAG Program as an annual award, and the DOJ's delay has precluded the City from receiving the intended award at such time as the City can make timely use of it.\"). The Byrne JAG program is a formula grant that requires the Attorney General to disburse funds annually, and the COPS grant is a competitive program California applies for and has traditionally received each year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Factor three favors relief because the delay impacts human health and welfare, particularly for California as the COPS and Byrne JAG funds aid task forces aimed at stopping illicit drug trafficking and go towards funding court programs to reduce recidivism of at-risk youth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jolls. Decl. \u00b6 10; Caligiuri Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-25. Similarly, factor five supports relief because the human welfare and community safety concerns that California's grant funding addresses are at risk of being discontinued for lack of funding and are prejudiced by this delay. Expediting this matter, as discussed in factor four, would not prejudicially affect the federal government's tangentially related interest in federal immigration enforcement. Finally, the sixth factor, if it has any weight at all here, would favor relief because DOJ is withholding grant funding based on conditions that violate the separation of powers. I will GRANT California's request for mandamus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   For the reasons stated, California and San Francisco's motions for summary judgment are GRANTED and the DOJ's motions for summary judgment are DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judgment will be entered accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    They are not dispositive in any event.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    Even if there were independent authority granted by Section 10102(a)(6), courts hearing the parallel cases found that the language \"placing special conditions on all grants\" is most likely a term of art for the additional conditions placed on \"high-risk grantees\" only.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Philadelphia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277896\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/579/#p588\">\n     280 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    617 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Chicago\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/#p293\">\n     888 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    285 n.2 (noting a possible term of art but not analyzing further).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    DOJ also asks the court to consider whether Section 1373's language can operate as an independent grant condition regardless of the validity of Section 1373.
