After careful consideration of the requisite filings and the record, the Court grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of a real estate project owned by Manor Glenn Investments, LLC (\"Manor Glenn\"). The Plaintiffs in this action are the thirteen limited liability companies (\"LLC\") which are all members of Manor Glenn. (ECF. No 40-1, \u00b6 4). All of the members of Plaintiff LLCs, with the exception of one Texas resident, are foreign investors from Argentina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-33). Defendants are: (1) Manor Glenn, (2) Team Real Estate Management, LLC; (3) Team Real Estate Development, LLC; (4) seven individual residents and citizens of Florida, who are alleged members of Team Real Estate Development, LLC (5) Atlanta R.E. Investment Group LLC; and (6) Team Real Estate Title Services, LLC, which are alleged to be joint ventures. The Defendants are all alleged to be Florida Limited Liability Companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-53).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), the operative complaint in this action, in early 2014, Defendant Team Real Estate Management, LLC began soliciting foreign investors to fund a real estate project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56). The project entailed forming a manager-managed LLC called Manor Glenn, LLC, which would purchase some property in College Park, Georgia and convert it into condominiums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 59). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants contacted Plaintiffs to solicit investments, and in concert, represented to Plaintiffs that their investment in Manor Glenn would yield a guaranteed 12% return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that Defendant Team Real Estate Management, LLC, by and through its members and managers, solicited a total of $3.2 million from Plaintiffs and others to capitalize Manor Glenn. Each Plaintiff purchased ownership interest in Manor Glenn at a value of $32,000.00 for each percent of the LLC (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). On May 6, 2014, through the Member Interest Transfer Agreement, all ownership interest in Manor Glenn was transferred to Plaintiffs in proportion to their investments. (ECF No. 40-1). On the same day, the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement became effective. (ECF No. 40-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Team Real Estate Management consistently failed to provide an accounting of Manor Glenn, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). Prior to filling the lawsuit, individual Plaintiffs made requests\n   to Defendants for status updates and accounting of funds, including the balance of the Team Real Estate Title Services, LLC's escrow account, which were ignored. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66, \u00b6 111). When Defendants gave Plaintiffs access to a financial spreadsheet, the records indicated checks and bills being paid to and by unrelated entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67, 110).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that since the initial offering, Defendants lied to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59). For example, Defendants represented that the purchase price of the property was $2,482,400.80, but it was in fact $1,725,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60). Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that there was a willful diversion of corporate assets to the personal project of its manager as well as grossly negligent operation and supervision of Manor Glenn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). Other examples of Defendants misconduct include: (1) committing waste by allowing the property to deteriorate significantly until Defendants' removal as managers in late 2015 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65); (2) failing to start construction (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74); (3) failing to provide security for the property (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74); (4) failing to report in a timely manner the theft of air conditioning units that were stolen from the property on February 23, 2015 to authorities and insurance agency (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85); (5) refusing to provide an Examination Under Oath to Seneca Insurance concerning the theft of the air conditioning units (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87); (6) failing to provide regular status reports (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85); (7) failing to maintain adequate insurance coverage (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); (8) paying the manager a management fee in contravention of the Operating Agreement (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80); (9) beginning the conversion of property to condominiums in contravention of the Operating Agreement (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a result of the alleged wrongdoings, Plaintiffs filed this fifteen-count action alleging breach of contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty in violation of Florida state law, and accounting, among other counts. Defendants filed the instant Motion arguing that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and that Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action as to all Defendants. [ECF No. 48 at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the SAC on three grounds: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) failure to state a cause of action; and (3) failure to plead with specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When deciding Rule 12(b) motions to dismiss, a district court first addresses any jurisdictional challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruhrgas AG v.

Further, Defendants contends that once Manor Glenn is realigned as a plaintiff, complete diversity is destroyed because at the end of Manor Glenn's management chain is Candelaria Barrera-a Florida resident.

It is difficult to make out what valid contract was allegedly breached and what were those material breaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, Plaintiffs seem to allege that they had a contractual relationship with Defendants pursuant to their Restrictive Member Agreement and the Operating Agreement attached to the complaint as Exhibits A and B. (ECF No. 40, \u00b6 73). However, the purpose of the Restrictive Member Agreement-which contains a merger clause-was to transfer all interest in Manor Glenn from Atlanta R.E.

Plaintiffs have not alleged that the transfer of interest in Manor Glenn did not occur. Therefore, there is no alleged breach of the Restrictive Member Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached the Operating Agreement, attached to the complaint as Exhibit B.

The Operating Agreement, however, makes no mention of individual Defendants alleged to be members of Team Real Estate Management.

Each count is identical; Plaintiffs simply switch out the Defendants' names. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40, pp. 26-36). To sustain a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under Florida law, a plaintiff must sufficiently plead (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty, (2) breach of a fiduciary duty, and that the breach proximately caused the plaintiff's damages.\n   <em>\n    Gracey v.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40, \u00b6\u00b6 133-137). Plaintiffs fail to allege\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   that could show this Court that each individual Defendant is plausibly liable for a breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim against Defendant Team Real Estate Title Service, LLC for breach of fiduciary duty also fails. Plaintiffs assert that Team Real Estate Title Service, LLC \"held positions of trust with regard to Manor Glenn and therefore had respective fiduciary duties....\" (ECF No. 40, \u00b6 178). Further, Plaintiffs state that Defendant breached its duties by \"failing to properly supervise the disbursements of the investors' monies in violation of standard general practices in the real estate development industry.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 180).

Negligence (Count XIII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim for negligence suffers the same defects as the preceding counts for breach of fiduciary duty. To sustain a claim for negligence a plaintiff must show that \"(1) defendants owe plaintiffs\n   a duty, (2) defendants breached the duty, (3) defendants' breach injured plaintiffs, and '(4) [plaintiffs'] damage [was] caused by the injury to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's breach of duty.' \"\n   <em>\n    Resnick v.

(ECF No. 40, \u00b6 170-172). Again, Plaintiffs do not allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief.

Unjust Enrichment (Count XIV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs unjust enrichment count must be dismissed because Plaintiffs cannot pursue a quasi-contract claim for unjust enrichment if an express contract exists between the parties. (ECF No. 48, p. 17). This proposition, while true, is only operative upon a showing that an express contract exists-not upon a mere allegation of an express contract.\n   <em>\n    Samana, Inc. v. Lucena,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4307641\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/156/1373/#p1374\">\n    156 F.Supp.3d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1374 (S.D.

Fla. 2013) (Marra, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, attached to the Plaintiffs' SAC is the Operating Agreement between Manor Glenn and its members. The Operating Agreement appoints Defendant Team Real Estate Management as the Manor Glenn's manager and both assigns its duties and restricts its powers. While some provisions designate for what Defendant Team Real Estate is authorized to use Manor Glenn's resources for-since there are other grounds to dismiss the claim-this Court will assume that the Operating Agreement is not an express contract on the subject matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Therefore, the court evaluates the elements of an unjust enrichment claim. \"In Florida, the elements of a claim for unjust enrichment are: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) appreciation by the defendant of such benefit; and (3) acceptance and retention of such benefit by the defendant under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for him to retain it without paying the value thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Melton v.

Fla. 2017) (Moreno, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that \"by utilizing the substantial monetary investments made by Plaintiff members to capitalize Manor Glenn, and then engaging in the wrongful acts enumerated above for their own personal profit and gain,\" Defendants acting in concert accepted the benefit conferred, and squandered Plaintiffs' investment. Therefore, it would be unfair under the circumstances for the Defendants to keep the benefit. (ECF No. 40, \u00b6 174).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Once again, Plaintiffs provide no factual allegations and rely on reincorporating the first seventy one paragraphs of their complaint. Perhaps the most relevant paragraph, in the seventy- one paragraphs Plaintiffs incorporated, is paragraph sixty-four, which alleges there was a \"willful diversion of corporate assists to the personal projects of its managers\" and that \"the unlawful acts engaged in by Manor Glenn's directors, from which they derived improper personal benefit, are in violation of the good faith requirement of \u00a7 605.04901.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64). Paragraph sixty-four suffers from the same defect as most\n   paragraphs in Plaintiffs' complaint-it is conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Moreover, while plaintiffs are allowed to plead a breach of contract claim and, in the alternative, an unjust enrichment claim, that is not what Plaintiffs have done here. Count XIV does not say that it is pled in the alternative and it is based on the same facts as Plaintiffs breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a claim for unjust enrichment. As a result, this Court dismisses Count XIV of the SAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Shotgun Pleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, this Court notes that Plaintiffs' SAC is a shotgun complaint.

Fla. 2011) (Cohn, J.). The Eleventh Circuit has listed the four most common types of shotgun pleadings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Though the groupings cannot be too finely drawn, we have identified four rough types or categories of shotgun pleadings. The most common type - by a long shot - is a complaint containing multiple counts where each count adopts the allegations of all preceding counts, causing each successive count to carry all that came before and the last count to be a combination of the entire complaint. The next most common type, at least as far as our published opinions on the subject reflect, is a complaint that does not commit the mortal sin of re-alleging all preceding counts but is guilty of the venial sin of being replete with conclusory, vague, and immaterial facts not obviously connected to any particular cause of action. The third type of shotgun pleading is one that commits the sin of not separating into a different count each cause of action or claim for relief. Fourth, and finally, there is the relatively rare sin of asserting multiple claims against multiple defendants without specifying which of the defendants are responsible for which acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is brought against. The unifying characteristic of all types of shotgun pleadings is that they fail to one degree or another, and in one way or another, to give the defendants adequate notice of the claims against them and the grounds upon which each claim rests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Weiland v.

First, in every count Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate paragraphs 1-71. Paragraphs 1-55 pertain primarily to jurisdiction and should not be incorporated into any of the counts. Paragraphs 56-71 labeled \"Background Facts\" are, for the most part, conclusory, vague, and not material to every count they are incorporated into-the second evil identified above. Further, like in the fourth category above, Plaintiffs assert multiple claims against the Defendants without identifying which of the defendants are responsible for which act or omission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Despite this Court's ability to dismiss Plaintiffs' SAC in its entirety as a shotgun pleading, the Court addressed all of Defendants' bases for dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jovine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193224\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/795/1331/#p1337\">\n    795 F.Supp.2d at 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing the entire complaint as a shotgun pleading, but addressing the merits of each count).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   1.

This Court noted that \"while not addressed in Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, upon review, the Court also finds that Plaintiffs' jurisdictional allegations as to the individual Defendants are also deficient.\" (ECF No. 39, p. 3). Even when spoon-fed the argument, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint fails to argue that personal jurisdiction as to the individual defendants was insufficiently pled. Instead, Defendants make the failed argument of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Given that Defendants had the opportunity to make the proper argument and that personal jurisdiction is a disfavored defense that is waived if not raised,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(h)(1), this Court will find that personal jurisdiction exists and proceed to evaluate the merits of the claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Neither party makes a FRCP 23.1 argument. While under FRCP 23.1 plaintiffs are required to plead with particularity, what is sufficient to meet that higher standard is dictated by the law of the state of incorporation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20605.0410\">\n     Fla.

This tends to show that the\n    <em>\n     Merovich\n    </em>\n    court was correct in imposing a duty on the managers even though the statute expressly imposed a duty on the LLC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
