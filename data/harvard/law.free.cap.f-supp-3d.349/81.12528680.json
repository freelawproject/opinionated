Finally, Defendant argues that The Funds Availability Policy in the Account Agreement provides explicit guidance for members of various scenarios in which funds will not be immediately \"available.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270865\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1/#p10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270865\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1/#p10\">\n    at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For two reasons Defendant's argument fails. First, Defendant did not properly define \"available balance\" and its meaning is therefore ambiguous. Plaintiff contends that her account balance was artificially low not only because there was a hold placed on deposits into her account but also because Defendant subtracted pending transactions from the ledger balance. Indeed, this is how Defendant calculates \"available balance.\" Nowhere, however, does the Funds Availability Policy mention this second scenario or clarify how it might affect a member's balance. Instead, the Funds Availability Policy only explains how there may be a delay on funds coming into a member's account. Despite not sufficiently defining the term, Defendant argues that \"available balance\" nonetheless a well-known term that reasonable members would understand. I find, however, that the meaning of the term as used in the Account Agreement is ambiguous. Indeed, several courts, have found similar contractual arraignments ambiguous when they used the term \"available balance.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v.

In the court's view:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    The difference between preauthorizing a series of transfers and opting in to an overdraft services is both significant and meaningful. In the first instance, a consumer\n    gives express permission for a series of recurring transfers from his or her account.

[that] overdraft fees constitute discrete harms that do not constitute a single transaction providing for recurring transfers.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Indeed, Regulation E seems to contemplate that this distinction is a meaningful one. On the one hand, Regulation E requires preauthorized transfers to be in writing but only focuses on the authorization itself.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201005.10\">\n     12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1005.10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). On the other hand, with regard to overdraft services, the statute not only focuses on the requirements for opt-in provisions, but also prohibits \"any fee or charge on the consumer's account for paying an ATM or one-time debit card transaction pursuant to the institution's overdraft service\" without making the appropriate disclosures.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201005.17\">\n     12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1005.17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2). \"Thus, the\n    <em>\n     violation\n    </em>\n    for purposes of determining the limitation period for a preauthorized transfer may properly be characterized as an omission.

Plaintiff's argument is unpersuasive. Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that she was charged an overdraft fee when her account had a positive \"ledger balance.\" Therefore, had Plaintiff checked her bank statements, she \"should have known when [she] was charged [her] first overdraft on a positive ledger balance that [Defendant] was\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    using the ledger balance method to assess overdraft fees.\"\n    <em>\n     Domann v.
