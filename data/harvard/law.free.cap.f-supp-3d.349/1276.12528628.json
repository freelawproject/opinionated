WILLIAMS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court on Defendant Alexander Martinez's motion to dismiss (DE 68), Defendants United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (\"ICE\") motion to dismiss (DE 69), and Defendant Miami-Dade County's (\"County\") motion to dismiss (DE 70). Plaintiff Garland Creedle (\"Mr. Creedle\") filed a response in opposition to each motion. (DE 87; DE 88; DE 89). Defendants replied. (DE 100; DE 101; DE 102). For the reasons below, Martinez's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , while DHS and ICE's motion to dismiss and the County's motion to dismiss are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Creedle filed his original complaint against Carlos A. Gimenez and the County on July 5, 2017. (DE 1). This Court held a hearing on May 16, 2018, during which it granted in part Gimenez and the County's first motion to dismiss. (DE 47). On June 1, 2018, Mr. Creedle filed an amended complaint against the County, DHS, ICE, and Martinez, an ICE officer. (DE 48). Defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint soon after. (DE 68; DE 69; DE 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For purposes of ruling on the motions to dismiss, the Court accepts the following facts alleged in the amended complaint and contained in the exhibits as true. Mr. Creedle is a U.S. citizen who was 19 years old when the amended complaint was filed. (DE 48 at 3). Although Mr. Creedle has been a U.S. citizen since the moment of his birth by virtue of his father's U.S. citizenship, when he came to the U.S. from Honduras in 2015, ICE arrested him and placed him in administrative removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. In April 2015, DHS filed a motion with the immigration judge stating that the proceedings should be terminated because Mr. Creedle is a U.S. citizen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 48-1, Ex. B. The immigration judge granted the motion and terminated the proceedings against Mr. Creedle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 48-1, Ex. C. It is not clear from the amended complaint or the Parties' briefing why removal proceedings were initiated against a U.S. citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 12, 2017, Mr. Creedle was arrested after an alleged domestic dispute and taken to the Miami-Dade County jail. (DE 48 at 10). Mr. Creedle was never charged with an offense related to this arrest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That evening, Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Department (\"MDC\") officials fingerprinted Mr. Creedle and sent his fingerprints to DHS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 10. On March 13, 2017, MDC received an immigration detainer request from Martinez, an immigration enforcement officer, listing Mr. Creedle as its subject.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"Request for Voluntary Transfer\" form stated that Mr. Creedle was \"a removable alien\" under civil immigration law and asked MDC to hold him for up to 48 hours after he would otherwise be released from MDC's custody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The detainer did not allege probable cause to believe that Mr. Creedle had committed a crime, did not \"state facts amounting to an individualized determination that there was probable cause to believe that [Mr. Creedle] was removable from the U.S.,\" and did not state that he posed a risk of flight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Instead, the detainer form asserted that \"[p]robable cause exists that [Mr. Creedle] is a removable alien\" and, as support for this assertion, a box on the form had been checked next to an option stating that ICE's probable cause was based on \"biometric confirmation of the subject's identity and a records check of federal databases that affirmatively indicate, by themselves or in addition to other reliable information, that the subject either lacks immigration status or notwithstanding such status is removable under U.S. immigration law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 48-1, Ex. D. The form was signed only by Martinez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the same day, Mr. Creedle posted bond to be released from MDC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Mr. Creedle told MDC officials that he was a U.S. citizen, but because of the ICE detainer, MDC refused to release him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Instead, MDC detained him until the following day, March 14, 2017, after ICE officials had interviewed Mr. Creedle and withdrawn the detainer request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Creedle alleges that the County re-arrested him on March 13, 2017 pursuant to a recent change in policy that, in effect, requires MDC staff to \"honor all immigration detainer requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. This policy reversed the County's previous policy, which had been in place since December 2013 and significantly circumscribed the County's authority to arrest individuals pursuant to immigration detainer requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The 2013 policy stated that MDC could honor detainer requests from ICE only if (1) \"the federal government agrees in writing to reimburse Miami-Dade County for any and all costs relating to compliance with [ICE] detainer requests\"; (2) \"the inmate that is the subject of such a request has a previous conviction for a\n   Forcible Felony ...\"; and (3) the inmate has, at the time the County received the detainer request, \"a pending charge of a non-bondable offense....\" Miami-Dade Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, Resolution 1008-13, at 5 (Dec. 3, 2013), http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/legistarfiles/MinMatters/Y2013/132196min.pdf. Because the federal government \"declined to reimburse the County for any expenses associated with detainers,\" MDC stopped arresting individuals based on detainer requests in January 2014. (DE 48 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2016, the Board ratified its position when it unanimously opposed \"statewide legislation that would preempt its anti-detainer policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Resolution 77-16, which the Board passed on January 20, 2016, cited the fact that \"federal courts have found that local law enforcement agencies that detain individuals on the sole authority of a detainer request violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, exposing such agencies to legal liability unless there has been an independent finding of probable cause to justify detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board's resolution goes on to state that \"while criminal detainers are subject to multiple procedural safeguards, including a requirement of court approval, [ICE] detainer requests lack comparable protections ... [because] a judge is not required to review or approve an immigration detainer.\" Miami-Dade Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, Resolution 77-16, at 5-6 (Jan. 20, 2016), http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/legistarfiles/MinMatters/Y2015/153028min.pdf. The Board noted that \"a judge is not required to review or approve an immigration detainer,\" and that a detainer \"may be issued by a single Immigration[ ] and Customs Enforcement officer when there are no immigration proceedings pending.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. \"[T]his process,\" the Board found, \"does not meet the U.S. Constitution's minimum standard for authorizing detention after an inmate is scheduled to be released.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite the County's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   clear position on the legality and efficacy of honoring all detainer requests, on January 26, 2017, Miami-Dade County Mayor Gimenez reversed course, issuing a memorandum to MDC that ordered it to \"honor all immigration detainer requests.\" (DE 48-1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The directive was not preceded by any public notice or opportunity for debate, nor did it mention the Board's 2013 resolution limiting MDC's authority to hold people pursuant to detainer requests and the myriad legal concerns with honoring detainers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 17, 2017, the Board ratified the Mayor's directive and amended its 2013 Resolution (1008-13) to direct the Mayor \"to ensure that, related to immigration detainer requests, Miami-Dade County ... is cooperating with the federal government to the extent permissible by law.\" Miami-Dade Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, Resolution 163-17 (Feb. 17, 2017), http://www.miamidade.gov/govaction/matter.asp?matter=170440&amp;file=false&amp;yearFolder=Y201.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   MDC is following the Mayor's directive-as ratified by the Board's resolution-and, since January 26, 2017, has\n   maintained a policy and practice of re-arresting individuals in its custody after their criminal custody has ended on the sole basis that the person is the subject of an immigration detainer request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Creedle's amended complaint contains three counts against the County. Counts I and II are brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and allege that the County violated Mr. Creedle's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. (DE 48 at 12-13). Count III is a claim for false imprisonment under Florida law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(DE 48 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   All Defendants have moved to dismiss with prejudice. DHS and ICE moved to dismiss on the grounds that: (1) Mr. Creedle lacks standing to seek declaratory relief because he is not likely to suffer the same injury in the future; (2) Mr. Creedle's request for declaratory relief is moot because ICE has since altered its detainer policies; and (3) Mr. Creedle has failed to state a claim because ICE's issuance of the detainer was authorized by federal law and therefore did not exceed ICE's statutory authority or violate Mr. Creedle's Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 69 at 7-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The County moved to dismiss on the grounds that: (1) Mr. Creedle lacks standing to seek declaratory relief because he is not likely to suffer the same alleged injury in the future; (2) there can be no municipal liability for the County under Section 1983 because an official policy authorized by law cannot be the \"proximate cause of a constitutional violation\"; (3) the County's cooperation with ICE is expressly allowed under federal and state law, and; (4) the County's cooperation with ICE occurs under color of federal authority. (DE 70 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Martinez moved to dismiss on the grounds that: (1)\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   does not apply in the context of a wrongful immigration detainer issued by an immigration officer, and; (2) Martinez is entitled to qualified immunity. (DE 68 at 4, 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court assumes as true all well-pled factual allegations and determines whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Claims for Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As discussed above, Mr. Creedle brings claims for declaratory relief against both the County and ICE. As to the County, he seeks a declaratory judgment concerning both future and past conduct; he requests a declaration that the County's policy and practice of arresting people on immigration detainers is unlawful, and that its re-arrest of him in March 2017 pursuant to ICE's detainer violated his rights under federal and Florida law. As to ICE, however, Mr. Creedle seeks a declaratory judgment regarding\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   conduct only-that ICE's issuance of his detainer was unlawful. Defendants insist that Mr. Creedle lacks standing to pursue any declaratory claims and that all such claims are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Mr. Creedle Has Standing to Seek Prospective Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The County and ICE argue that Mr. Creedle lacks standing to obtain declaratory relief because he has not alleged, and cannot show, a sufficient likelihood of future injury from the challenged conduct: detention pursuant to a detainer. (DE 69 at 8; DE 70 at 7). According to Defendants, there is no \"real and immediate threat\" that Mr. Creedle will ever again be arrested and then held pursuant to a detainer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To support their argument, Defendants cite to a declaration by Dean Caputo, an ICE officer, which states that \"[u]pon information and belief, ICE [Enforcement and Removal Operations] database records state that the Plaintiff, Garland Creedle, is a United States citizen.\" (DE 69-1). Further, Defendants argue that Mr. Creedle is unlikely to be held pursuant to a detainer again because he is a U.S. citizen. (DE 101 at 3; DE 100 at 3). The County also argues that the fact that Mr. Creedle was arrested again during this litigation-\"no detainer was logged, and he was released the very next day after posting bond\"-demonstrates that he is not likely to be held by the County pursuant to a detainer in the future. (DE 101 at 3-4). ICE further asserts that Mr. Creedle cannot demonstrate standing because he \"can avoid\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   potential injury associated with any hypothetical future detainer by refraining from further criminal conduct and getting arrested again.\" (DE 100 at 3) (emphasis in original). In short, Defendants argue that declaratory relief is improper because Plaintiff cannot show a \"likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury.\" (DE 69 at 8) (quoting\n   <em>\n    O'Shea v.

Specifically, Mr. Creedle contends that his prior history with the immigration system-being forced into removal proceedings and later arrested pursuant to a detainer despite being a U.S. citizen-supports an inference that he is sufficiently likely to be subject to a detainer again. Mr. Creedle further argues that it would be premature to dismiss his claims for declaratory relief at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Standing is the threshold question in every federal case, determining the power of the court to entertain the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    CAMP Legal Def.

Mr. Creedle is not challenging a sporadic, random practice of government officers gone rogue, but an established, blanket County policy that requires MDC officials to honor all detainers and effectively re-arrest and detain anyone who is the subject of a detainer. This case is not like\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff challenged a valid policy that, on rare occasions, resulted in an unconstitutional application of that policy because of police officers' unjustified conduct.

Mr. Creedle's Claims Against the County for Prospective Declaratory Relief are Not Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court agrees with Mr. Creedle's argument that this case presents the sort of injury that is \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Detainers, by their nature, are meant to result in an individual being held on behalf of ICE for no more than 48 hours. Because 48 hours is an insufficient period in which to litigate a case challenging a detainer, the first prong of the exception to the mootness doctrine is met. The County's cursory argument-presented in a footnote in their motion to dismiss-that Mr. Creedle's claims for declaratory relief are moot because ICE changed its detainer policy to require an accompanying administrative warrant is also unpersuasive. The change in ICE's policy, which is not binding on that agency and could be rescinded at any time, is irrelevant to the County's challenged policy of honoring detainers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (DE 87 at 10);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ICE Policy Number 10074.2,\n   <em>\n    Issuance of Immigration Detainers by ICE Immigration Officers\n   </em>\n   (April 2, 2017), at 6 (\"This document provides only internal ICE policy guidance, which may be modified, rescinded, or superseded at any time without notice.\"), https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2017/10074-2.pdf.

Thus, the Court finds that Mr. Creedle has stated a plausible claim against ICE under Section 706(2)(C) of the APA based on the allegations that ICE-in issuing an immigration detainer for him-failed to comply with Section 1357(a)(2) because the agency (1) made no determination whatsoever about the chances that Mr. Creedle would have been \"likely to escape\" before a warrant for his arrest could be obtained, and (2) did not have probable cause to believe that he was removable from the U.S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mr. Creedle alleges-and nothing on the face of the detainer suggests otherwise-that when ICE issued the detainer against him the agency did not have \"reason to believe that Mr. Creedle posed a risk of flight\" and did not conduct \"any individualized assessment of Mr. Creedle's risk of flight.\" (DE 48 at 11).

These allegations, taken as true at this stage, are sufficient to state a claim that ICE exceeded its statutory authority when it issued a detainer for Mr. Creedle because ICE failed to comply with an explicit requirement of Section 1357(a)(2) and lacked probable cause to believe that he was removable from the U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Because the Court finds that the allegations in the amended complaint are sufficient to state a claim under the APA on the above-enumerated grounds, the Court need not-at this stage-reach the Parties' arguments regarding whether ICE was authorized to issue a detainer for Mr. Creedle without having a formal agreement with the County under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Issuing a detainer cannot constitute a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment, according to ICE, because \"detainers are requests.\" (DE 69 at 15). And even if issuing a detainer does constitute a seizure, ICE argues, \"that seizure is fully consistent with the Constitution because an ICE-detainer request evidences probable cause of removability in every instance.\" (DE 100 at 10) (quotations omitted).

The County Lacked Authority under Federal Law to Arrest Mr. Creedle for a Civil Immigration Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Court agrees with the above cases and finds that Mr. Creedle has plausibly alleged that the County was not authorized\n   by federal law to arrest him for a civil immigration violation and, therefore, because he was arrested without probable cause of a crime, the County violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. The County Lacked Authority under State Law to Arrest Mr. Creedle for a Civil Immigration Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The County maintains that it had authority under two provisions of Florida law to detain Mr. Creedle on behalf of the federal government for an alleged civil immigration offense. Mr. Creedle responds that these state law provisions are not independent sources of authority for the County to arrest individuals for civil immigration violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    a) Florida Statute Section 950.03\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   First, the County argues that it had authority to arrest Mr. Creedle under Florida Statute Section 950.03, which provides that \"[t]he keeper of the jail in each county within this state shall receive into his or her custody any prisoner who may be committed to the keeper's charge under the authority of the United States and shall safely keep each prisoner according to the warrant or precept for such commitment until he or she is discharged by due course of law of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20950.03\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 950.03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Creedle contends that this statute-enacted in 1847-is irrelevant here because, rather than operating as an independent source of arrest authority, it instead authorizes \"jailers to hold prisoners who have already been validly arrested by federal officers.\" (DE 89 at 7). Moreover, the County agrees that Mr. Creedle was in its sole custody-not being \"receive[d] into\" its custody-when he was detained pursuant to the detainer request from ICE. (DE 70 at 19) (\"Martinez requested that the County maintain custody of [Mr. Creedle], who was already in its charge, under the authority of the United States....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court agrees with Mr. Creedle that Section 950.03 is not an independent source of authority under which the County could lawfully arrest Mr. Creedle solely on the basis of a detainer. As discussed above, the County did not have authority under federal law to arrest Mr. Creedle based on a detainer, and this archaic Florida statute adds nothing to the County's arrest authority. Accordingly, the Court finds that Section 950.03 does not support the County's arrest of Mr. Creedle pursuant to a detainer based on a purported civil immigration violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    b) Florida Statute Section 901.18\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The County also points to Florida Statute Section 901.18 for the proposition that it is immune from civil liability under Florida law because the County's arrest of Mr. Creedle amounted to \"aid[ing] a peace officer.\" (DE 70 at 19). Section 901.18 provides that \"[a] person commanded to aid a peace officer shall have the same authority to arrest as that peace officer and shall not be civilly liable for any reasonable conduct in rendering assistance to that officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"338\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20901.18\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 901.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Creedle argues that the County's position with respect to this provision of Florida law is \"untenable\" because the County's interpretation would \"require every person who is asked to make an arrest to make that arrest\" and, thus, \"[t]here would be no limit to the arrests that federal agencies could demand of local officers.\" (DE 89 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Court again agrees with Mr. Creedle's reading of the statute. It cannot be that Section 901.18 applies in the context of federal officials coordinating with the County to arrest individuals for civil immigration purposes. If an ICE official (or any other federal officer) is a \"peace officer\" under Section 901.18, then ICE officials could \"command\" the County and its officers to arrest individuals-pursuant\n   to detainers or, presumably, for any other reason-and the County would be required to comply by \"render[ing] assistance as directed by the officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"339\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20901.18\">\n    Fla.

Thus, \"independent probable cause was required to warrant [Mr. Creedle]'s continued detention after [ ]he had satisfied all conditions of [his] bond on [his] original detention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alcocer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518966\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/944/\">\n    906 F.3d at 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(DE 70 at 18). The County argues that it had the requisite legal authority under federal law to cooperate with federal immigration officials and maintain custody of Mr. Creedle for a brief period to allow DHS to assume custody.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The County also contends that it had authority under a Florida statute to detain individuals on behalf of the federal government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.

First, Mr. Creedle adequately alleges, as discussed fully in\n   <em>\n    Section III.D\n   </em>\n   , that the County unlawfully detained him pursuant to a detainer because the County acted without either federal or state authority to arrest him for an alleged civil immigration violation. Mr. Creedle also alleges that (1) he was detained against his will, because he states that he posted bond for his original offense and told MDC officials that he was a U.S. citizen; and (2) such detention was unreasonable and unwarranted because he is, in fact, a U.S. citizen and the County did not have probable cause that he had committed a crime when it re-arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Taking as true all of the facts alleged by Mr. Creedle, as the Court must at this stage, he has pled facts sufficient to state a plausible claim for false imprisonment under Florida law.

(DE 68). Martinez first argues that Mr. Creedle's claims against him must fail because there is no claim applicable to Mr. Creedle's alleged injuries under the seminal Supreme Court case,\n   <em>\n    Bivens v.

Martinez argues that this Court should not extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to the context present here: an immigration detainer issued by an ICE officer for Mr. Creedle, a U.S. citizen, that resulted in his allegedly unlawful detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Mr. Creedle responds that his claims do not arise in a new context and instead fall within the class of \"quintessential\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims\" that \"seek a remedy for violations of the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" (DE 88 at 13). Mr. Creedle also contends that, even if the Court finds that his claims present a novel\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context, the Court should extend\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   based on the facts in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , a plaintiff may, in limited circumstances, recover money damages against federal officers who have violated a plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ziglar v.

Mr. Creedle had been arrested and was in the County's custody when Martinez, a federal immigration officer, issued a detainer requesting that the County continue to hold him for 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) on behalf of ICE for federal immigration purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that Mr. Creedle's claims present a new context under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , especially in light of the Supreme Court's analysis and holding in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1864 (finding that \"even a modest extension is an extension\" that presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context). This finding, however, should not be construed to suggest that all\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims based on immigration detainers, or in the context of immigration detention generally, would necessarily present a new context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, the Court's finding is limited to the\n   narrow facts presented by this case, where an ICE officer is alleged to have issued a detainer against a U.S. citizen without probable cause. Mr. Creedle does not allege that Martinez's issuance of the detainer was malicious (as was the conduct of the defendants mentioned by the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   ), based on fabricated information, or otherwise outside the scope of Martinez's rote, ministerial duties as an ICE officer. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff had alleged that the ICE officer conducted a sham review while knowing that the plaintiff could not be \"removed in the reasonably foreseeable future,\" Mr. Creedle has not alleged that Martinez knew that Mr. Creedle was a U.S. citizen or that he purposefully issued a detainer knowing that Mr. Creedle could not lawfully be detained by the County pursuant to a detainer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Special Factors Counsel Against Extending\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    to Mr. Creedle's Claim Against Martinez\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Having found that Mr. Creedle's claims against Martinez present a new context under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   , the Court must next consider whether there are \"special factors counselling hesitation\" before allowing Mr. Creedle's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims to proceed. The Court finds that, under the specific facts of this case and the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , there are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   As mentioned above, the allegations against Martinez in the amended complaint do not suggest that Martinez knowingly or purposefully issued a detainer against a U.S. citizen. Mr. Creedle also does not allege that Martinez knew that the County could not lawfully detain him pursuant to the detainer that Martinez signed. Instead, it appears that Martinez was acting within the parameters of ICE's current practices and procedures for issuing detainers. The Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , however, that \"a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action is not a proper vehicle for altering an entity's policy[,]\" or otherwise \"call[ing] into question the formulation and implementation of a general policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1860 (internal quotations omitted). That is what Mr. Creedle seeks to do here. Rather than seeking damages for an unauthorized, ultra vires act done by a malicious or reckless official, Plaintiff makes clear in his amended complaint that he challenges the broader, general policy of issuing detainers pursuant to which Martinez acted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Even acknowledging that Martinez lacked probable cause to issue the detainer for Mr. Creedle, it is not clear that this Court is \"well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed\" against an individual federal employee in this new context.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1858 (\"It is not necessarily a judicial function to establish whole categories of cases in which federal officers must defend against personal liability claims in the complex sphere of litigation, with all of its burdens on some and benefits to others.\"). Thus, the Court finds that, under the specific facts of this case, a judicially-created damages remedy under\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   against Martinez is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Martinez's motion to dismiss is granted. Having found that Mr. Creedle has failed to state a claim against Martinez, the Court need not address Martinez's argument that he is immune from any such claims based on qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(DE 68 at 17). Although the Court need not reach the issue of whether Martinez had probable cause to issue the detainer against Mr. Creedle, Martinez's stated grounds for probable cause are insufficient as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    First, the Supreme Court has held that an individual's place of birth is insufficient to justify a reasonable belief that the individual is an \"alien.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Further, Martinez's contention that he had probable cause based on Mr. Creedle's arrest because his arrest demonstrated that Mr. Creedle could eventually be convicted of a certain offense and thereby rendered removable-assuming he was not a U.S. citizen-also fails as a matter of law because probable cause must have existed at the time Martinez issued the detainer.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
