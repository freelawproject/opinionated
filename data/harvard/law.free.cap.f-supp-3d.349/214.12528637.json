Collateral attacks for constitutional right violations-the equivalent of a writ of habeas corpus-hold a vital place in United States constitutional jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    Engle v.

A waiver of collateral attack rights must specifically indicate what the exceptions to the waiver are. The text is deemed amended as follows (added text in italics):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The defendant agrees not to file an appeal or otherwise challenge, by petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or any other provision, the conviction or sentence in the event that the Court imposes a term of imprisonment at or below 51 months. This waiver is binding without regard to the sentencing analysis used by the Court. Nothing in the foregoing waiver of appellate and collateral review rights shall preclude the defendant from raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel;\n   <em>\n    a claim that the plea was not voluntary and knowing, including because relevant evidence was withheld by the government; a claim that the proceeding was instituted or the sentence imposed on the basis of a constitutionally impermissible factor; or a claim that foreclosure of collateral review would result in a miscarriage of justice.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As the law develops, any new exceptions should be added to the waiver so that a defendant has notice of what collateral attack rights he or she has waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
