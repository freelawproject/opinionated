Despite the variety of issues that the parties have briefed, the\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   facts are undisputed. The defendant insisted upon performance by the plaintiff that went beyond the terms of the policy. Accordingly, the defendant cannot rely on the plaintiff's subsequent failure to tender premiums to justify its termination of their contract. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The policy around which this case revolves was issued in April 2008 by the defendant, on the life of one Dora Zupnick. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 1, ECF No. 48-2; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 1, ECF No. 52-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy was issued to Abraham Zupnick, her son, as trustee of the Zupnick Family Trust 2008 B, the owner and beneficiary of the policy. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5. At some point, the plaintiff began making premium payments on the policy. Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2010, the plaintiff and another man replaced Abraham Zupnick as trustee, and in 2011 the plaintiff became the sole trustee of the trust. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 3. The plaintiff also became the primary beneficiary of the trust. Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 10. The plaintiff is not related to the Zupnicks (Def.'s 56.1 Statement\n   \u00b6 5); rather, for him, the life-insurance policy is an investment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 9). The plaintiff remains the sole trustee of the trust today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The policy does not simply require a fixed premium payment each month; instead, it \"provides a policy owner flexibility to determine certain aspects of coverage, including the timing and amount of premiums it will submit to Allianz within limits set by the terms of the Policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 12. Whether the policyholder has paid sufficient premium to keep the policy in force is determined by three different tests. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 8; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 14. Under the policy, the defendant evaluates each of the three tests every month; if all three tests fail at once, the policy enters a grace period. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 8; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 14. The grace period lasts sixty-one days, during which the policyholder may make \"[a] premium payment sufficient to keep [the] policy in force for three months\"; if the policyholder fails to do so \"prior to the last day of the Grace Period,\" the policy lapses. Policy 4191, ECF No. 48-4;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Once the policy lapses, it may be reinstated upon notice made by the policyholder within three years, provided that the insured is still \"insurable pursuant to [Allianz's] underwriting standards.\" Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 30. Although it was not formally part of the contract, at all relevant times the defendant had a practice of accepting premium payments from at least some policyholders within thirty days of when their policy would have lapsed without requiring a new underwriting of the insured. Def.'s Add'l 56.1 Statement \u00b6 62, ECF No. 53-1. In February 2010, however, the defendant specifically instructed its underwriting staff not to \"auto reinstate\" certain policies, including the policy at issue here. Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The three tests under the policy all relate to how much premium has been paid: Under one test, the policy would remain in force as long as the policyholder made premium payments equal to at least $34,726.67 per month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy 4165, 4191. That test, however, applied only for the first five years of the policy-that is, from April 2008 until April 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Under a second test, the policy remains in force as long as the policyholder makes sufficient premium payments to maintain a positive balance after Allianz takes its monthly costs and fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy 4165-66, 4187-94. And under the third test, the policy remains in force as long as the policyholder makes sufficient premium payments to maintain a positive balance in a \"side account\" after Allianz recalculates the \"Test Value\"-a complex process that includes the subtraction of a \"Monthly Test Premium,\" whose value changes every year according to a schedule set forth in the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy 4168-69, 4185-86; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 16. The policy at issue here failed all three tests on eight separate occasions between 2008 and 2012. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 7, 2012, the policy failed all three tests and entered the grace period. Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 17. On August 7, 2012, the defendant sent the plaintiff a grace notice, informing him that the policy would lapse unless a premium payment of $116,511.94 was paid by September 7, 2012. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 25; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 18. Neither party has conclusively explained how this dollar amount was calculated, but it represented more than enough premium for the policy to avoid failing at least one test until November 7 at the earliest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Statement\n   \u00b6 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 20, 2012, the plaintiff called the defendant to ask why he had \"to pay now so much.\" Call Trs. 4079, ECF No. 48-13. After some confusion, the defendant's representative repeatedly told the plaintiff-and the plaintiff's wife, Zissy Halberstam, who had joined the call-that the $116,511.94 represented sufficient premium to carry the policy until October 7.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4083-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 5, 2012, the plaintiff called the defendant to request a one-week extension of the payment deadline. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 28; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 29. The defendant's representative told him that she \"can't give [him] an extension but if the policy lapses, as long as [he] sen[t] the premium in within 30 days of the lapse date [the defendant would] auto-reinstate it, so [he] just need[ed] to get that money in as soon as possible.\" Call Trs. 4108. But then she corrected herself: \"Or actually, for reinstatement we have to contact somebody else. I stand corrected on that one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She then told him that \"[a]s long as it's postmarked by [September 7] ... it will be fine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4109. Finally, after apparently discussing the issue with her manager (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 4109-10), she told the plaintiff that, \"upon further investigation, ... [t]he premium actually needs to be in [the defendant's] office by the 7th.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 9, 2012, the defendant sent the plaintiff a notice stating that the policy had lapsed. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 29; Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 25, 2012, the Halberstams called the defendant to find out \"what premiums [the plaintiff] need[ed] to pay up in order to keep [the] policy in force.\" Halberstam Aff., Ex. F, at 1, ECF No. 52-5. The defendant's representative informed them that because the policy had lapsed, the defendant would need to prepare a reinstatement application for the plaintiff to fill out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And-evidently incorrectly (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   BenHaim Aff., Ex. A, at 49, ECF No. 52-3)-she told them that the amount of premium that the trust owed wouldn't be known until after the defendant had received and processed the completed reinstatement application (Halberstam Aff., Ex. F, at 4). The Halberstams accordingly requested that an application be sent to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following day, the plaintiff again called the defendant, again seeking to find out the amount of premium that he would have to pay to reinstate the policy. Pl.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 37. The plaintiff was told that that information was being calculated and would be sent to him with the reinstatement paperwork that he had requested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sure enough, the plaintiff received a letter from the defendant dated November 1, 2012, enclosing the reinstatement application and stating that \"[i]n order to reinstate [the] policy,\" he had to return the application and \"a check for $181,260.46.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The letter continued: \"After we receive the check, we will review the application to determine whether you are still insurable by our standards. The premium received will be credited only upon approval of reinstatement. We may need additional information regarding your medical condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And it warned: \"\n   <strong>\n    This policy is not in effect and you do not have coverage under it until ... you have been approved for reinstatement.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At least two additional reinstatement applications, which also stated the amounts purportedly owed under the policy, were sent by the defendant-one to a representative of the plaintiff on December 19, 2012, and another to the trust on December 5, 2014. Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. No reinstatement application was ever submitted, nor were any further premium payments made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff filed this action, seeking a declaratory judgment that the policy is still in effect, in New York Supreme Court, Kings County, on September 19, 2016. Summons &amp; Compl. 6, ECF No. 1-1. The defendant removed it to this court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction on December 12, 2016. Notice of Removal 1, ECF No. 1. On June 9, 2017, on motion by the defendant, I dismissed most of the claims but allowed the case to proceed with respect to the claims that \"the notice stated the incorrect amount due\" and that \"premiums were fully paid at the time of the [purported] lapse.\" Op. &amp; Order 17, ECF No. 25. The parties then proceeded to discovery, and each now moves for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Summary judgment is proper when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is material where it \"might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Def.'s Br. 9, ECF No. 48-1. And the defendant argues that the amount stated on the grace notice that the plaintiff received in August 2012 is \"irrelevant,\" because a grace notice is legally required only to terminate a life-insurance policy within one year of default, and here it has been several years since premiums were paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In contrast, the plaintiff argues that the policy did not lapse in 2012 because the grace notice that the defendant sent him was \"void on account of the inflated demand.\" Pl.'s Br. 2, ECF No. 52-1. And because the defendant then wrongfully \"informed [him] that [it] [would] not accept premiums or conditioned acceptance [of premiums] upon underwriting or refused to divulge the amount due,\" the plaintiff argues, he was excused from paying further premium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Thus, while the defendant may be correct that it was \"not a breach of contract\" for it to fail \"to provide the correct amount in the grace notice\" (Def.'s Opp'n 15, ECF No. 53), that failure meant that the grace notice was legally insufficient to trigger a lapse of the policy (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lebovits\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176594\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/678/#p680\">\n    199 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   680-81 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the defendant opposes the plaintiff's motion on the ground that \"[t]he undisputed facts do not indicate what amount should have been included on the grace notice.\" Def.'s Opp'n 8.

The defendant's statute-of-limitations argument fails.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In my previous opinion in this case, I rejected the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's claims were brought too late, ruling that the six-year limitations period for declaratory-judgment actions applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. &amp; Order 16-17. Based on that ruling, the defendant maintains that the action was still brought too late, because the defendant \"sent plaintiff its first grace notice on November 7, 2008,\" more than six years before the plaintiff filed his complaint. Def.'s Br. 22. Although it does not explicitly say so, the defendant appears to be arguing now that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the grace notices that it sent the plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.1 Statement \u00b6 22 (listing dates of notices sent) ) demanded too much money. By overcharging the trust for years before the\n   plaintiff caught on, the defendant supposes that it is now insulated from suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This argument has multiple flaws. First, I see nothing in the record to support a finding that any of the previous grace notices violated the statute, and neither the plaintiff nor the defendant have even alleged that those notices were invalid. Second, regardless of whether any of the previous grace notices were deficient, none of them precipitated the purported policy lapse that is at issue in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiff's cause of action accrued in 2012, and the plaintiff's complaint was filed in 2016. It was timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant's motion for summary judgment is accordingly denied. But before the policy can be declared \"in good standing and in effect\" (Pl.'s Mot. 1, ECF No. 52), the trust must become current on its premium obligations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lebovits\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176594\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/678/#p680\">\n    199 F.Supp.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
