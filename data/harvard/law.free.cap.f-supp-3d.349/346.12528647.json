After the defendants predictably failed to appear, NIKE and Converse won a default judgment for $1.8 billion, which they assigned to an investment firm. The investment firm sought to enforce the judgment by, among other things, subpoenaing six nonparty Chinese banks for account information related to the defendants. The banks moved to quash the subpoenas, and the investment firm moved to compel. The Magistrate Judge, who was supervising post-judgment discovery, denied the banks' motion, finding that the court had jurisdiction over the nonparty banks and that the Hague Evidence Convention did not offer any a viable alternative to discovery. This Court now affirms that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

On August 20, 2015, this Court entered a default judgment in favor of Plaintiffs (the \"Judgment\"). (Dkt. No. 49.) Plaintiffs subsequently assigned their interest in the Judgment to Next Investments, LLC (the \"Assignee\"), (Dkt. No. 50), who moved to enforce the Judgment by, in part, issuing subpoenas to six nonparty Chinese banks\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   relating to the online retailer defendants' assets (the \"Subpoenas\"). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of Jacqueline L. Chung, dated Feb. 14, 2018, Dkt. No. 72 Ex. 11.)

Sept. 11, 2018). The Banks were ordered to produce documents in response to the Subpoenas by November 12, 2018. (Dkt. Nos. 149, 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 10, 2018, the Banks filed two sets of objections to the Magistrate Judge's order, one from ABC and another from the other five banks. (Dkt. No. 156 (\"Banks Obj.\") and Dkt. No. 163 (\"ABC Obj.\") (collectively, the \"Objections\").) ABC wrote \"separately to highlight factual issues that pertained specifically to ABC as opposed to the [o]ther banks,\" including allegedly\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   contacts with the forum state. (ABC Obj. at 3 n.2.) However, ABC joined the objection of the other five banks \"in its entirety.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   That same day, the Banks also submitted a letter asking the Court to stay the discovery deadline pending a resolution of the Objections, (Dkt.

After allowing the Assignee to respond, this Court agreed with the Banks that a stay of the discovery deadline pending a resolution of the Objections avoided unduly prejudicing the Banks and, accordingly, granted their request to stay discovery. (Dkt. No. 168,)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Assignee filed a combined opposition to the Objections. (Dkt. No. 169 (\"Next Opp.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ruling on the Banks' Objections, this Court now finds that the Magistrate Judge's order was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law and AFFIRMS the order.

The district court does not conduct a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of a non-dispositive order; rather, it applies a deferential standard under which the moving party must show that the magistrate judge order is \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" Fed.

In response, the Assignee argues that the motion is non-dispositive as to the underlying cause of action and should therefore be reviewed under Rule 72(a)'s \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard.

However, the Second Circuit has ruled that motions to compel or quash subpoenas are properly classified as non-dispositive, even when the subpoena seeks information from a nonparty. \"A motion to quash a subpoena in an action seeking relief other than production of the subpoenaed information is not normally a dispositive motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Arista Records, LLC v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Frazier\n   </em>\n   , the\n   Third Circuit held that a proceeding to enforce a subpoena\n   <em>\n    ad testificandum\n   </em>\n   brought pursuant to a specific provision of the National Labor Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20161\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was a separate proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523334\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/812/#p817\">\n    966 F.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (3d Cir. 1992). Accordingly, the Third Circuit found that when the magistrate judge denied the National Labor Relations Board's motion to enforce the subpoena, the district judge should have reviewed that order\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523334\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/812/#p817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As that case acknowledged, \"While a motion to enforce a subpoena arising in a civil action would be a routine matter which a magistrate judge could dispose of as a non-dispositive motion, the Board's enforcement proceeding was not part of a larger case before the court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523334\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/966/812/#p817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The other case cited by the Banks likewise involves a separate civil action to enforce an administrative subpoena.\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Sterling Jewelers Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-mc-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205282622\">\n    2011 WL 5282622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Nov, 2, 2011). In that case, the magistrate judge elected\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   to treat the EEOC's administrative subpoena as dispositive and to style his opinion as a report and recommendation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205282622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *1 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court therefore reviews the Magistrate Judge's order under the \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" standard under Rule 72(a).

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Banks object to two aspects of the Magistrate Judge's order. All six Banks argue first that the Magistrate Judge failed to give proper consideration to key facts that would support quashing the subpoenas in favor of proceeding with discovery under the Hague Evidence Convention, as a matter of comity. ABC writes separately to argue that the Subpoenas in this case are akin to so-called\n   <em>\n    Bank of Nova Scotia\n   </em>\n   subpoenas, the use of which is disfavored by the U.S. Department of Justice in the international criminal context\n   (which, of course, this case is not). Because the magistrate court's findings on this issue were not clearly erroneous, the Objections are denied,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Banks also argue that the Magistrate Judge wrongly concluded that New York law provided for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Banks based on their maintenance and use of correspondent and settlement accounts at New York banks. Separately, ABC objects to the finding of personal jurisdiction on the basis that its contacts with New York were insufficient. Since the Magistrate Judge's findings on these issues are neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law, this objection is also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In the Banks' view, the exercise of personal jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Gucci III\n   </em>\n   was inappropriate because there was \"no indication\" that the bank in that case \"engaged in affirmative conduct to initiate wire payments or that it knowingly assisted in any illegal scheme through the use of its correspondent accounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court agrees with the Assignee that the Magistrate Judge's reliance on the Banks' use of correspondent accounts to find specific personal jurisdiction was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.

The customers' banks, called \"issuing banks,\" must regularly clear and settle these transactions with the acquiring bank. The interbank clearing and settlement process is conducted through the payment card network, which acts as a clearinghouse, and is facilitated through the use of \"settlement accounts\" at the issuing and acquiring banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Contrary to the Banks' assertions, the Magistrate Judge did not base her finding of personal jurisdiction on the Banks' \"acquiring bank activities,\" which undisputedly take place entirely within China.

Thus, the Magistrate Judge found that although courts in this circuit had not specifically addressed whether the use of such accounts could ever establish personal jurisdiction, the analysis \"should be essentially the same.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was not error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Indeed, this Court agrees with the Assignee that applying New York's decisional law on correspondent accounts to the settlement accounts at issue in this case was a \"reasonable extension of the law.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Next Opp. at 20.) The Banks protest that, \"[i]mportantly, no authority in this district, or in any other jurisdiction, holds that an acquiring bank may be subject to personal jurisdiction solely due to the presence of a settlement account in that forum[,] and the Magistrate Judge's unprecedented conclusion on this matter is contrary to law and should be set aside.\" (Banks Obj. at 20.) This is a bit of a red herring. Although the Banks would have me believe otherwise, \"correspondent accounts\" and \"settlement\n   accounts\" do not appear to be entirely distinct creatures: both are essentially checking accounts for other banks, and both are used to support interbank transactions, particularly those involving multiple currencies. The Assignee, for example, produced evidence demonstrating that the Banks' relevant \"settlement accounts\" were no more than intermediary accounts that the Banks had established at various New York banks.\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Indeed, I suspect that a correspondent account at a New York bank could well serve as a foreign bank's \"settlement account\" for a payment card network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As a result, it was not contrary to law for the Magistrate Judge to reason from first principles and find that the exercise of personal jurisdiction was appropriate. When evaluating personal jurisdiction based on correspondent accounts, the New York Court of Appeals has said that the key question is whether a bank's establishment and maintenance of correspondent accounts constitutes purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting business in New York. Here, the Banks themselves admitted that they \"maintain [settlement] accounts in New York to facilitate more efficient settlement processes with other banks, whose settlement accounts are also in New York.\" (Banks Obj. at 20.) This indicates purposeful availment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court of Appeals has also said that the quantity and quality of transactions through bank accounts can support a finding of personal jurisdiction. Here, the Magistrate Judge relied on evidence introduced by the Assignee that three of the Banks-ABC, BOCOM, and BOC-had \"repeatedly and deliberately used their New York-based settlement accounts to process international credit card transactions on behalf of their customers, including some of the Judgment Debtors in this action.\"\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.

The Banks attempt to distinguish that case by pointing out that, here, the Plaintiffs did not plead a tort or trademark infringement claim against the Banks. (Banks Obj. at 20-21.) However, the fact that the bank in\n   <em>\n    Frontline\n   </em>\n   \"direct[ed] business into the state\" was not relevant to that court's long-arm statutory jurisdiction analysis, which was based on tortious acts that took place in the state.\n   <em>\n    Frontline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088810\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/721/228/\">\n    721 F.Supp.2d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the\n   <em>\n    Frontline\n   </em>\n   court considered the fact that the defendants' conduct had \"actually allowed for the purchase of counterfeit products in the New York market\" as part of the \"minimum contacts\" prong of its constitutional analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088810\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/721/228/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088810\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/721/228/\">\n    at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the key question is whether the transactions, which took place through ABC's New York-based settlement account, are related to the discovery order, which seeks information related to the assets of the Judgment Debtors. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of Jacqueline L. Chung, dated Feb. 14, 2018, Dkt. No. 72 Ex. 11 at 3.) They unquestionably do. ABC's argument that \"ABC's settlement account in New York is merely an incidental consequence of fulfilling a foreign contract with Visa in Singapore,\" such that it does not constitute purposeful availment, (ABC Obj. at 16), is also unavailing. ABC points the Court to its 2009 Client Service and Trademark License Agreement with Visa Worldwide, attached as one of the Assignee's exhibits, which contains no mention of settlement accounts, let alone a requirement that ABC establish one in New York. (Suppl. Grossbaum Decl. Ex. 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ABC also argues that (1) \"www.alvababy.com,\" a website, is not a Judgment Debtor and, (2) in the alternative, even if the merchant name on the 2013 transactions, \"WWW.ALVABABY.COM BEIJING,\" is a Judgment Debtor, this merchant is not necessarily the same as the merchant listed on the 2016 transactions, \"ALI*WWW.ALVABABY.COM.\" (ABC Obj. at 12-13.) Because the 2016 transactions provide the strongest jurisdictional hook, and because it is not clear that the 2016 transactions relate to a Judgment Debtor, ABC argues that there is no personal jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But, the Assignee is correct that \"www.alvababy.com\" refers, not to an infringing website, but instead to the name of one of the Judgment Debtors, \"WWW.ALVABABY.COM BEIJING,\" which has a registered website \"www.nfljerseywebsite.com,\" through which infringing activities occurred. In the Court's final order, dated October 20, 2017, \"Judgment Debtors\" are defined as \"all Defendants set forth in the Exhibits to the [August 20, 2015] Judgment.\" (Dkt. No. 62 at 1.) Exhibit 1 to the Judgment lists \"WWW.ALVABABY.COM BEIJING\" as the name of the Judgment Debtor operating at the domain www.nfljerseywebsite.com. (Dkt. No. 37 Ex. 1 (row 1273).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the Magistrate Judge did not clearly err in relying on a sample cross-check and the sworn declaration of one of the Assignee's lawyers, Alexandra Grossbaum, to find that an adequate connection had been shown between the Judgment Debtors and the Banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   326 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 n.10. Although the names of the merchants in Exhibit 1 to the Judgment and in the records produced by Visa are slightly different, it was not error to assume that Visa had produced records that were responsive to the Assignee's March 5, 2018 subpoena. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Grossbaum Decl. Ex. 17.) The Assignee allegedly supplied the Merchant IDs to Visa for purposes of its search, from which Visa returned the relevant transaction information, including the 458 transactions that occurred in 2016. (Dkt. No. 146 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Advertising\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Magistrate Judge found, as part of both the statutory and constitutional personal jurisdiction analysis, that \"all of the Banks have made statements promoting their settlement services, and their service (provided through correspondent accounts) of providing U.S. dollar wire transfers to and from China for customers like the Judgment Debtors in this action.\"\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. The Banks argue that this was error, because \"the marketing materials cited by the Magistrate Judge do not advertise the wire transfer services that the Judgement Debtors [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] utilized, but rather, promote services of the Banks' New York branches, which are not involved in the present dispute.\" (Banks Obj. at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Banks concede that BOC-New York branch \"produced certain U.S. dollar wire transfer records associated with the Judgment Debtors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 n.26.) Therefore, I do not consider BOC for purposes of this analysis, because its branch\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   involved in the present dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is true that the Banks maintain branches in New York and that, apart from BOC, the Assignee has shown no connection between the present dispute and these branches. It is also true that some of the sources cited by the Magistrate Judge focus on branch banking services rather than, for example, the ability to wire money from the U.S. to China through correspondent banking or the global reach of its acquiring bank services. For example, ABC's webpage discusses the dollar clearing business of its New York branch, and even says that this business will \"reduce dependence on correspondent path to enhance the creation of business value.\" (Decl. of Robert L. Weigel, dated March 16, 2018, Dkt. No. 84 (\"Weigel Decl.\") Ex. 18.) It does not mention anything about supporting cross-border payment card transactions, the only jurisdictional link to the Judgment Debtors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, the spare BOCOM webpage advertises USD clearing services as part of the \"Specialty Services\" offered by its New York branch but does not say anything about payment cards. (Weigel Decl. Ex. 46.) Certain Banks' pages do relate to their in-state, suit-specific activities. For example, the CMB webpage states that the bank \"[m]aintain[s] long-term and close cooperative relationship with domestic institutions.\" (Weigel Decl. Ex. 70.) CCB's page, too, says that \"[c]ontinuously increasing correspondent banks enables a good book transfer rate.\" (Weigel Decl. Ex. 93.) ICBC's states that \"[t]he correspondent banking relationships maintained with the peers in 21 countries/regions lays a solid customer base for the Branch to achieve continual growth in USD clearing services.\" (Weigel Decl. Ex. 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because the webpages of CMB, CCB, and ICBC advertise the broader network of relationships with New York institutions that support the Banks' dollar clearing business-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the correspondent banking services that are the subject of the Subpoenas-it\n   was proper to find specific jurisdiction arising out of this in-state activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, for ABC and BOCOM, it was error to find that advertising their branch banking (and, to a very limited extent, dollar-clearing) activity was connected to the information requested in the Subpoenas. Personal jurisdiction was not asserted over ABC and BOCOM on the basis of its correspondent accounts; instead, it was based on its settlement accounts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ABC Obj. at 18.) The exhibits cited by the Magistrate Judge do not mention the reach of either Bank's acquiring banking services or the ability to reach payment card customers in the U.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nonetheless, I find that this error was ultimately harmless, as these exhibits were only a small portion of the Magistrate Judge's personal jurisdiction analysis, the bulk of which was grounded in the Banks' establishment and repeated use of correspondent and/or settlement accounts in New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (\"No single factor concerning the first prong of CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(1) is dispositive.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Real Estate Holdings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Banks make a similar argument that the Banks' real estate holdings have \"no relationship to the underlying dispute\" because the real estate holdings \"primarily relate to the Banks' New York branch operations.\" (Banks Obj. at 22.) Branch banking is not always connected to correspondent banking. A head office may elect to use its branch for correspondent banking, but it may also elect to use third-party banks. Ultimately, it is a business decision. Likewise, the Court is not aware of-and the parties have not briefed-the connection between branch banking and interbank settlement of payment card transactions, even where the issuing bank and branch bank are in the same country. Therefore, it was error to consider the Banks' branch banking activities as a basis for personal jurisdiction (with the exception of BOC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Again, however, this error of elision was harmless. The Magistrate Judge did not ground her personal jurisdiction analysis in the Banks' real estate holdings; \"[r]ather, it is the Banks' repeated use of New York-based correspondent and/or settlement accounts that satisfies the requirement that there be an 'articulable nexus' between the nonparties' contacts with the forum and the discovery order at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Licci III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754225\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/327/#p338\">\n    20 N.Y.3d at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754225\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/327/#p338\">\n    960 N.Y.S.2d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754225\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/327/#p338\">\n    984 N.E.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    5. \"Fair Play and Substantial Justice\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, the Banks argue that the Magistrate Judge clearly erred in determining that the exercise of personal jurisdiction for purposes of the subpoenas would comport with \"fair play and substantial justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Banks Obj. at 22.) This is sometimes called the \"reasonableness\" prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Courts evaluate five factors to determine if this prong of the Due Process analysis is satisfied: \"(1) the burden that the exercise of jurisdiction will impose on the defendant; (2) the interests of the forum state in adjudicating the case; (3) the plaintiffs interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; (4) the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of the controversy; and (5) the shared interest of the states in furthering substantive social policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Chloe v.

For this proposition, they cite\n   <em>\n    Shipping Corporation of India Ltd. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Shipping Corporation of India\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit acknowledged that \"[t]he unforeseen consequences of\n   <em>\n    Winter Storm\n   </em>\n   have been significant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481503\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/58/\">\n    585 F.3d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , In particular,\n   <em>\n    amici curiae\n   </em>\n   had informed the court that, in the prior year, maritime attachment suits constituted 33% of all lawsuits filed in the Southern District, and New York banks had been forced to hire additional staff to cope with the increased volume of EFT-related writs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481503\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/58/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Permitting the attachment of EFTs at intermediary banks had also \"introduced uncertainty into the international funds transfer process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481503\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/58/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Magistrate Judge did not clearly err, however, in failing to give this slippery slope argument much weight. First, the Banks' argument is purely speculative. The New York Court of Appeals announced the rule in\n   <em>\n    Licci III\n   </em>\n   in 2012. The Banks have failed to demonstrate how this rule has been \"disastrous\" for the banking industry in the intervening six years, except that they have submitted, along with their objections, a complete version of\n   <em>\n    The Bank Directory: Worldwide Correspondents\n   </em>\n   (2018). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Jacqueline L. Chung, dated Oct. 10, 2018, Dkt. No. 164 \u00b6 6.) This impressive-looking volume, which clocks in in at just over 1500 pages, the Banks maintain, is \"necessary [in order] for the Court to have a complete understanding of the number of non-U.S. banks maintaining correspondent accounts in New York in order to assess the reasonableness of exercising personal jurisdiction over non-U.S. banks that maintain such accounts in New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) As the saying goes, \"if the law and the facts are against you, pound the table\"-here, apparently, by dropping a 5-lb. book on it,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Banks also inflate the policy implications of the Magistrate Judge's order by misconstruing its reasoning. According to the Banks, \"[u]nder the standards for specific jurisdiction adopted by the Magistrate Judge, a plaintiff would simply be required to a wire payment [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] connected with a particular defendant or judgment debtor was routed through one of the[ ] 9122\" correspondent accounts that foreign banks maintain in New York. (Banks Obj. at 24 n.28.) As discussed in preceding sections, this is an incorrect statement of the rule. In fact, the parade of horribles imagined by the Banks is precisely the fact pattern from\n   <em>\n    Amigo Foods Corp. v. Marine Midland Bank-N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2340491\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/46/855/#p856\">\n    46 N.Y.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20N.Y.S.2d%20515\">\n    414 N.Y.S.2d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20N.E.2d%20226\">\n    387 N.E.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), a case in which the Court of Appeals determined that the routing of a single transaction through a New York correspondent account held by a Maine-based bank was not enough to confer personal jurisdiction.

The Magistrate Judge was self-evidently not required to consider China's bank secrecy laws in analyzing\n   <em>\n    the Assignee's\n   </em>\n   \"interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief.\" This factor has nothing to do with defendants'-or, in this case, nonparty Banks'-interests.

(Banks Obj. at 11-12.) They argue that the Assignee had tied only \"a handful\" of the Judgment Debtors to the Banks; that it is \"impossible for the Banks to identify the correct account holder\" because many of the Judgment Debtor names are \"extremely common Chinese names or partial names;\" and that the requests for customer account information based on e-mail addresses and websites are \"so broad that the Banks would not even know where to begin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the same time, however, representatives of the Banks have submitted declarations to this Court describing the internal control measures they have taken with respect to the Judgment Debtors identified in Attachment B to the subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 157 \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 158 \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 159 \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 160 \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 161 \u00b6 5-6.) These internal control measures include designating certain Judgment Debtor accounts for heightened risk, putting them on the Banks' internal \"watch lists,\" adding them to the Banks' real-time monitoring lists,\n   <em>\n    etc\n   </em>\n   . This rather undermines the Banks' contention that the breadth of the request should weigh against a finding of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Magistrate Judge did not clearly err in determining that the Subpoenas were sufficiently specific and that this weighed in favor of granting the Assignee's motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

This evidence was, and remains, thin. For example, the Banks stress that China's Ministry of Justice \"has written to this Court to confirm that it will 'execute a [Hague Convention request] according to the ... Convention and Chinese law\" and will \"take [a Hague Convention request] seriously and offer necessary legal assistance.\" (Banks Obj. at 7 (quoting Decl. of Jacqueline L. Chung, dated Apr. 27, 2018, Dkt. No. 111 at Ex. 11 (\"MOJ Ltr.\").) For the Banks, this demonstrates that \"the relevant Chinese authorities ... continue to display a consistent willingness to cooperate with Assignee on a Hague Convention request.\" (Banks Obj. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-100\">This Court is not convinced that this letter demonstrates that the Magistrate Judge clearly erred in her comity analysis. First, the Chinese version is addressed to \",\" <em>i.e.,</em> ABC, not to the Court, and it simply confirms that the Chinese office will write a letter to the Office of International Judicial Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice, copying Chief Judge Colleen McMahon, to express their aforementioned legal position. (MOJ Ltr. at 1-2 (\" Colleen McMahon, \").) This is hardly evidence of a sea change in the MOJ's willingness to cooperate with a Hague Convention request. Nor is it evidence of the MOJ's interest in supporting the expeditious production of relevant materials in this particular case. Indeed, it appears to be a form letter. The Magistrate Judge did not \"ignore\" this evidence, and she did not clearly err in affording it little weight.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Banks also point to their own (unprecedented) willingness to cooperate in these discovery requests. (Banks Obj. at 6-7.) However, as the Assignee has accurately stated, \"it is the MOJ, not the Banks, that executes Hague Convention requests, and 'historical precedent' indicates that any requests submitted to the MOJ will be only 'partly executed.' \" (Next Opp. at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, the Banks argue that the Magistrate Judge \"ignore[d] the fact that the speed with which China processes Hague Convention requests\n   <em>\n    has increased\n   </em>\n   \" in recent years. (Banks Obj. at 7 (emphasis added).) However, in support of this, the Banks cite to the Declaration of Guo Li, (dated Feb. 14, 2018, Dkt. No. 73), which the Magistrate Judge did, in fact, review as part of her findings.\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16. There was no error, let alone clear error, because the Guo Declaration is not persuasive. Guo cites data from the 2012\n   Hague Convention questionnaire, which demonstrates nothing about an increased response rate on the part of China to Hague Convention requests and simply compares the percentage of received requests answered by China and the percentage of received requests answered by the U.S. in the year 2012. (Guo Decl. \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Magistrate Judge did not clearly err in determining that resort to the Hague Convention was unlikely to produce the requested materials within a reasonable timeframe and that this fact weighed in favor of the Assignee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Fifth Factor: National Interests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Magistrate Judge's analysis of competing national interests was also not clearly erroneous. The Banks make much hay of the MOJ Letter: \"The very fact that the Ministry of Justice made a submission demonstrates the importance afforded its banking laws by the Chinese government.\" (Banks Obj. at 10.) Again, however, the Magistrate Judge was not required to give that form letter substantial weight, particularly where she found that it did not discuss the nature or importance of the law it purported to enforce,\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17. The Magistrate Judge also did not err in affording comparatively greater weight to the U.S.'s interest in enforcing the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal to this Court, the Banks make a confusing argument that the Magistrate Judge failed to appreciate China's national interest in enforcing\n   <em>\n    American\n   </em>\n   intellectual property laws by not ordering discovery pursuant to the Hague Convention. (Banks Obj. at 11.) In support, they cite articles from Reuters and Raconteur\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on China's great leap forward in IP reform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, this evidence may not be considered by this Court in the first instance and, in any event, is more properly directed at the fourth factor of the analysis-the viability of alternative discovery methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the first time on review, ABC raises an additional argument that, in the criminal context, the U.S. Department of Justice \"has placed special, important curbs on the ability of prosecutors to issue\" subpoenas that would cause the subject to violate its country's laws. (ABC Obj. at 22.) Therefore, ABC argues, \"[t]here is no legitimate reason why Next, a private litigant, should be permitted to issue such Subpoenas and circumvent the Hague Convention process when, if the U.S. Department of Justice sought to obtain the same foreign banking records, it almost certainly would not issue subpoenas and would instead elect to proceed through the [mutual legal assistance treaty] process out of respect for foreign law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Assignee has pointed out that district courts \"generally do not entertain new legal arguments not presented to the magistrate judge.\" (Next Opp, at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20737102\">\n    2015 WL 737102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ).) Regardless, ABC's argument fails because it compares apples to oranges. In the instant case, the Assignee does not wish to proceed under the Hague Convention, and the Magistrate Judge has determined that the interests of comity do not require it to do so. That the U.S. Department of Justice has adopted a different policy for purposes of its criminal cases is of no moment here. Moreover, as the Assignee has pointed out,\n   the U.S. government submitted an amicus brief to the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Gucci 2d Cir.\n   </em>\n   in favor of the plaintiffs' right to proceed without resort to the Hague Convention. (Next Opp, at 33 n.27.) This implies that the Department distinguishes between its own criminal cases and civil cases pursued by private parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Magistrate Judge did not err in finding that this factor weighed in favor of the Assignee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Sixth Factor: Hardship to the Banks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Magistrate Judge concluded that \"to date, the evidence remains strong for the conclusion ... that meaningful sanctions by the Chinese government against Chinese banks are highly doubtful.\"\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wultz v.

The Banks do not challenge these factual findings but instead argue that consideration of the likelihood of sanctions was contrary to law. (Banks Obj. at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   According to the Banks, \"a New York court should not encroach upon another nation's sovereignty by requiring citizens to take actions within their home country that would contravene that country's laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    CE Int'l Res.

June 12, 2013).) While this is desirable as a normative principle, the Second Circuit has clearly said that bank secrecy laws are not a bar to discovery orders.\n   <em>\n    Linde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049500\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/92/#p114\">\n    706 F.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). On its own, that argument is unavailing. Their contention that the Magistrate Judge \"essentially disregarded this hardship,\" (Banks Obj. at 9), is further belied by her repeated acknowledgment and treatment of this fact in the opinion. For example, \"this Court has considered the views expressed in the Chinese Ministry's letter, and accepts that China has an important national interest in ensuring compliance with its laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   340 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 17 n.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, the Banks argue that \"the law in this district ... holds that nonparties are not required to demonstrate proof of actual sanctions,\" (Banks Obj. at 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    CE Int'l Res.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202661037\">\n    2013 WL 2661037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 ).) Therefore, they argue, the Magistrate Judge's finding was contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    CE International Resources\n   </em>\n   did not hold, however, that considering the likelihood of sanctions is always improper; instead, that case held that nonparties \"must show that the possibility of civil and/or criminal punishment is more than speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    CE Intern.

This the Banks failed to do, and the Magistrate Judge found that they had not cited a single case in which penalties had arisen from compliance with a U.S. court's discovery order.\n   <em>\n    Nike\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528646\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/310/#p318\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204907596\">\n    2018 WL 4907596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Therefore, the Magistrate Judge's finding that this factor did not weigh in favor of the Banks was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
