The Court held a hearing on March 19, 2018. The primary issue is whether Defendant Adonis Baker presents a flight risk or is a danger to the community, and should therefore remain in custody pending trial, or whether the Court can furnish conditions of release that can reduce those risks to acceptable levels. The United States of America has shown, by clear-and-convincing evidence, that Baker is a danger to the community, and has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Baker is a flight risk. The Court denies Baker's Appeal, thereby affirming the Honorable Laura Fashing, United States Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico's Order of Detention Pending Trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order, filed September 29, 2017 (Doc. 15)(\"Order of Detention\"), and Magistrate Judge Fashing's Order Denying Motion to Release Defendant From Custody, filed January 2,\n   2018 (Doc. 46)(\"Order Denying Motion to Release\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court sets forth the facts as the United States alleges them in its Indictment, filed September 21, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Indictment\"), and as the United States Probation Office describes them in the Bail Report (disclosed October 13, 2017)(Doc. 24)(\"Bail Report\"), bearing in mind that Baker is presumed innocent of all charges,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

He has a certificate of completion from the State of Alabama Department of Corrections Substance Abuse Program, granted on October 27, 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 3. The Bail Report also references other documentation admitting past drug addiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 3.

From 2003 to the present, Baker was charged with the following: (i) theft of property (April 2003); (ii) robbery (May 2003); (iii) assault/reckless endangerment (March 2005)(Baker's only charge for violent behavior); (iv) possession of marijuana less than two ounces and possession of a controlled substance less than twenty-eight grams (August 2012); and (v) improper use of evidence of registration, improper display of registration plate, and no driver's license (November 2015).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail\n   Report at 5-6.

Baker alleges that his theft of property conviction was a petty theft, involving shoplifting from Walmart.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 4:19-22 (Court). Baker also alleges that his robbery conviction was a purse snatching, committed by another individual while Baker drove the car involved in the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 4:23-5:2 (Baiz). Baker asserts that the circumstances of his assault/reckless endangerment charge are that he ran a few red lights, and then an officer stopped to investigate him and see whether the car he was driving was stolen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:10-13 (Baiz). There is no disposition for that charge mentioned in the Bail Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:6-9 (Court). After Baker's robbery conviction, he was placed on probation and then his probation was revoked, because he had a dirty urine test due to cocaine use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:16-20 (Baiz). Baker asserts that his traffic-related offenses are that he was found to have a newly-purchased car that had not been registered with the DMV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 6:19-21 (Baiz). Baker has previously violated probation, and has had an active warrant since April 28, 2014, extraditable in Texas only, for a probation violation related to the possession of marijuana charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 5-6. Baker has also failed to appear, and in December 2015, the County of Bernalillo, New Mexico, issued a failure to appear bench warrant for Baker on his traffic-related offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 6. Bernalillo County canceled the warrant in May, 2017, when he was convicted of improper display of his registration plate and ordered to pay fines and fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Baker contends that, because he is a felon, he does not possess a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing at 3:20-21 (taken September 29, 2017)(Baiz)(\"Sept. 29 Tr.\"). At the September 29, 2017, detention hearing, however, Homeland Security Investigations Agent Morgan Langer testified that almost every alleged victim interviewed stated that Baker \"was armed at all times.\" Sept. 29 Tr. at 9:10-11 (Langer). Langer also testified that he found \"some handgun ammunition\" in Baker's apartment, although he did not find a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 9:21-10:1 (Langer, Court). Langer relayed what he had learned through his investigation of Baker: that Baker \"targeted women that were often homeless, often drug-addicted, vulnerable women, and would use that to recruit them through force, coercion, threats, violence, into a life of prostitution where the proceeds from their prostitution activities would be turned over to Mr. Baker and some of his associates.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 8:12-18 (Langer). Langer testified that there were reports of women who were drugged and awoke in different cities, including cities outside of New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 8:23-25 (Langer). At least one victim reported Baker holding a gun to her head.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 11:2-4 (Simms, Langer). Another reported Baker holding her head under water.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 11:5-7 (Simms, Langer). Of the six named victims, three reported that Baker had committed acts of violence\n   against them, and a fourth reported that Baker had threatened her with violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 15:2-4 (Langer). Langer testified that Baker used \"physical violence, beatings with his hands ... threats with a firearm ... sexual violence\" and rape against the victims. Sept. 29 Tr. at 10:19-11:1 (Simms, Langer). Langer reported that Baker lured the juvenile victim identified in the Indictment, a runaway from Phoenix, Arizona, into his car with drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 22:7-11 (Langer). Langer alleges that, once the juvenile was in Baker's car, she noticed it had disabled locks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 22:12-13 (Langer). Langer then asserts that Baker drove the juvenile from Phoenix to Albuquerque for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, but that Baker released her after she refused to engage in prostitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 22:13-16 (Langer). Langer testified that other victims reported that they were too afraid of Baker to cooperate in the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 23:5-12 (Simms, Langer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The twelve-count Indictment charges Baker with sex trafficking by means of force, threats, fraud, and coercion; coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution; transportation for prostitution; sex trafficking of a child; and transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States asserts that the penalties Baker faces on at least four of the twelve counts in the original Indictment are a mandatory fifteen years in prison, that may run consecutively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 26:9-12 (Simms).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States Probation Office (\"USPO\") recommends that Baker remain in custody, as it appears there \"is no condition or combination of conditions that will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community.\" Bail Report at 4. In support of its recommendation, the USPO alleges ten factors which indicate that Baker poses a danger to the community: (i) Nature of Instant Offense; (ii) Prior Arrests and Convictions; (iii) Substance Abuse History; (iv) Violent Behavior History; (v) Pretrial, Probation, Parole, or Supervised Release Status and Compliance; (vi) Criminal Activity While Under Supervision; (vii) History/Charge Involving a Child; (viii) History/Charge involving Sex Offense/Abuse; (viv) Safety Concerns for the Community or a Specific Individual; and (x) Criminal History.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 4. In the Addendum to the Bail Report, filed March 16, 2018 (Doc. 57)(\"Addendum\"), the USPO also cites the fact that three of the victims have not been located.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Addendum at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 21, 2017, a federal grand jury returned the twelve-count Indictment in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Baker\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 17-2556 JB (D.N.M.)(Browning, J.). Magistrate Judge Fashing held a detention hearing on September 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 1. After the September 29, 2017, detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Fashing concluded that a rebuttable presumption arises under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) that no\n   condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Baker's appearance as required and the safety of the community, because there is probable cause to believe that Baker committed an offense involving a minor victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Detention at 2. According to Magistrate Judge Fashing, Baker did not introduce sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Detention at 2. Additionally, weighing the factors set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) and the information presented at the detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Fashing concluded that the United States proved by clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community, and by a preponderance of the evidence that Baker is a flight risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Detention at 2. Magistrate Judge Fashing noted Baker's previous failure to appear in court as ordered, his lack of stable employment, his history of violence or use of weapons, the lengthy period of incarceration which he will face if he is convicted of the present charges, and the weight of the evidence against him, in supporting her conclusions that Baker is a flight risk and a danger to the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Detention at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the Order of Detention, Baker filed a Motion to Release Defendant from Custody, filed December 20, 2017 (Doc. 42)(\"Motion to Release\"). In the Motion to Release, Baker asserts that he has a minimal criminal history, family members in Birmingham who are willing to serve as third-party custodians, and that he has an employment history pre-dating 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Release at 3. Baker requests that \"he be allowed to live and work in Birmingham and reside with his father and grandmother as he is not either a danger to the community or a flight risk.\" Motion to Release at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The United States filed a response to the Motion to Release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States' Response to Defendants' Motion to Release Defendant from Custody, filed December 28, 2017 (Doc. 45)(\"Response to Motion to Release\"). In the Response to Motion to Release, the United States argues that a rebuttable presumption arises under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) that there is no condition or set of conditions that will reasonably assure Baker's appearance as required and the safety of the community, because there is probable cause to believe Baker violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2423, both offenses involving minor victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion to Release at 1-2. Specifically, the United States asserts that Baker \"is alleged to have lured a minor into his vehicle in Arizona, and drove her to New Mexico while she was passed out under the influence of drugs, so that she could work as a prostitute for him.\" Response to Motion to Release at 1-2. The United States argues that Baker did not put forth sufficient information in his Motion to Release to overcome the presumption in his case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion to Release at 2. The United States argues that Baker's proposed living arrangements in Alabama do not overcome the rebuttable presumption against release, because the nature of the charges against Baker indicate \"he will drive hundreds of miles from city to city to victimize women by forcing them into prostitution.\" Response to Motion to Release at 2. The United States asserts that Baker failed to advance any reason why his proposed living arrangement would overcome the presumption in favor of detention in his case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion to Release at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The United States argues that Baker is a flight risk, because he has minimal ties to New Mexico, a history of failure to appear, and an outstanding misdemeanor warrant in Texas (demonstrating his unwillingness to appear in court), and is facing a mandatory minimum of fifteen years' incarceration on multiple charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion to Release at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The United States also argues that Baker is a danger both to the community and to the victims, because, the United States alleges, Baker regularly possessed a firearm, used physical violence, threats, and drugs to control women, and trafficked women -- including a minor -- using force, fraud, and coercion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion to Release at 2-3. Finally, the United States argues that, because Baker is facing a long period of incarceration, he has an interest in finding and silencing his victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion to Release at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, although Magistrate Judge Fashing stated that Baker's criminal history is not significant, she asserted that it does not demonstrate that he is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, and it is not sufficient to rebut the presumption in favor of detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 2-3. In support, Magistrate Judge Fashing highlighted that Baker's criminal history includes a probation revocation on his robbery conviction from May, 2006, a probation violation with an active warrant from 2012, and a failure to appear on a misdemeanor charge in December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Magistrate Judge Fashing cited to the victims' reports of violence and threats of violence testified to at the detention hearing by Langer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 3. Magistrate Judge Fashing noted that Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment allege that Baker engaged in the conduct testified to at the hearing, as far back as 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. According to Langer's testimony, Baker has been unemployed since 2013, and has an apartment in Albuquerque, a residence in Phoenix, and traveled to Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, and elsewhere during the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. Magistrate Judge Fashing also notes that the United States represented at the hearing that at least four of Baker's charged offenses carry a minimum sentence of fifteen years of incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Magistrate Judge Fashing denied the Motion to Release, concluding that, considering the testimony that Langer provided at the detention hearing, the fact that Baker\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   has family members in Alabama who may be willing to serve as third-party custodians, and that he has an employment history prior to 2013, has no material bearing on whether Baker is a flight risk or a danger to the community. This information is also insufficient to overcome the presumption that Baker is both a flight risk and a danger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Fashing declined to reopen the detention hearing and denied Baker's request for release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Baker's Appeal\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Baker appeals the Order of Detention and the Order Denying Motion to Release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal of Detention Order, filed March 5, 2018 (Doc. 51)(\"Appeal\"). Baker argues that circumstances in his case are such that the rebuttable presumption under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)\"is overcome and the Court should release Baker from custody.\" Appeal at 2. Baker first cites to his minimal criminal history, the willingness of his father and grandmother to serve as third party custodians, and his employment history before 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 4. As Magistrate Judge Fashing stated in the Order Denying Motion to Release:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   All the reasons that Baker gives for his release -- that he \"has a minimal criminal history,\" that he is from Birmingham, Alabama and has family members there who are willing to serve as third\n   party custodians, and that he has a history of employment before 2013, Doc. 42 at 2-3 -- were known to Baker on September 29, 2017 (the day of his detention hearing), and he could have presented this information to the Court then. Indeed, the Court considered Baker's criminal history at the detention hearing, and although that history is not significant, it was not sufficient to rebut the presumption that he is both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Order Denying Motion to Release at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Baker argues that the facts of the Indictment alleging that he was involved in allegations in 2012 are false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 5. Baker asserts he was living in Beaumont, Texas and working at Subway Sandwiches, until at least 2013, and therefore could not have been involved in the \"acts in the indictment between June 2012 and June 2013.\" Appeal at 5. Baker also asserts that the alleged victim \"principally\" responsible for the allegations of violence against women, V.A., never stated during her interview with Baker's defense team that she was afraid of Baker. Appeal at 5. Baker further asserts only one audio recording of an interview with a government witness has been disclosed to him thus far in discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 5. In that recording, \"Jessica,\" one of the victims, repeatedly stated to a police officer, despite being prompted to say that she felt coerced, that she was \"not afraid of Baker and that she was engaging as a sex worker because she wanted to, not because she was forced. She also stated that Baker would not do anything violent because he was a 'caring person.' \" Appeal at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, Baker asserts that he is not a danger, and argues that the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard that the United States must meet requires \"proof that the particular defendant actually poses a danger to the community, not that the defendant in theory poses a danger.\" Appeal at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because Baker asserts that the allegations that witnesses are afraid of him are false, Baker contends that he does not actually pose a danger to the community, and therefore that the United States has not established dangerousness by clear-and-convincing evidence as required to support his pretrial detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Alleging that, based on a consideration of the \u00a7 3142(g) factors, he \"does not pose a risk of danger to the community, nor is he at risk of non-appearance\" such as could not be managed by the imposition of reasonable conditions, Baker requests that he \"be allowed to live at La Pasada Halfway House\" pending trial. Appeal at 6. In conclusion, Baker requests that the Court \"set this matter for a hearing as soon as possible; reverse the Magistrate Judge's order of detention in this cause [sic]; enter an order setting reasonable conditions of release; and provide for such other and further relief to which the Court may find Baker to be justly entitled.\" Appeal at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The United States' Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The United States requests that the Court deny Baker's Appeal, as he \"did not introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of detention, and has offered no new evidence that circumstances have since changed.\" Response at 1.

The United States maintains that, even if Baker was living and working in Texas until 2013, he could still be found guilty of these counts, because they allege a period until 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The United States takes the position that it is untrue that V.A. never said that she was afraid of Baker during her interview with Baker's defense team, and furthermore, the United States argues that this fact is \"irrelevant to the weight of the evidence.\" Response at 4. The United States argues that whether a victim is currently scared of a defendant is not necessarily probative of whether the defendant ever used force, fraud, or coercion to compel victims to work as prostitutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4-5. Moreover, the United States relays that, upon V.A.'s information and belief, she was specifically asked \"whether Defendant Adonis Baker really held her head under water, and whether she was really beaten at a local hotel,\" and she confirmed both allegations.

[who is] Facebook friends with the Defendant\" and whose motto on his Facebook page reads: \"I will not go to jail.\" Response at 5. This individual, who goes by Facebook identity \"Jimmie Choo\" from Fairfield, Alabama, contacted V.A. and requested that she give him a call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. The United States asserts that, while it cannot prove Baker was complicit in this individual contacting V.A., \"it is extremely coincidental that this person, who V.A. does not know, contacted her from very near Birmingham, Alabama, and is Facebook friends with Adonis Baker.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5.

The United States also notes that Magistrate Judge Fashing found that there is clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community, based on the\n   testimony at the detention hearing, and that Magistrate Judge Fashing found by a preponderance of the evidence that Baker is a flight risk, based on his lack of stable employment, the severe sentence he will face if convicted, and his failures to appear and then-outstanding warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 6-7. Since Magistrate Judge Fashing's determination, the United States asserts that the only potential change in circumstances is that Baker's family members are willing to serve as third-party custodians, but the United States alleges that Baker could have raised this information at the initial detention hearing and did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 7.

These four factors are: (i) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (ii) the weight of evidence against the defendant; (iii) the defendant's history and characteristics; and (iv) the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or a specific individual that the defendant's release would pose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the United States argues that the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses support detention, because Baker has been accused of serious, forceful, and violent offenses against women.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7-8. Citing to the testimony provided at the detention hearing, the United States asserts that Baker \"threatened victims with a gun,\" \"held a victim's head under water,\" \"picked up women he had not met before and immediately drove them to another town for the purpose of selling their bodies for sex,\" drugged women, beat them with his hands, and used sexual violence against them. Response at 8. The United States asserts that hotel and Backpage.com records corroborate the allegation that Baker traveled between states with his victims, and that there are at least six victims, one of whom was a juvenile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8. The United States concludes that the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses are serious, because Baker and his co-Defendants \"made money by forcing women to sell their bodies, and used violence to accomplish this objective.\" Appeal at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the United States asserts that the weight of the evidence against Baker supports his detention pending trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8. The United States asserts that Baker's contact information was linked to advertisements selling the victims via Backpage.com, and that hotel records, Backpage.com advertisements and forensic phone examinations all corroborate the victims' accounts of Baker's involvement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8. The United States alleges that \"[s]ix different women, most of whom do not know each other, give accounts of how they were trafficked by Adonis Baker.\" Response at 9. The United States notes that Magistrate Judge Fashing, in her Order Denying Motion for Release, highlighted that the testimony at the detention hearing suggested that \"three of the six named victims stated that the Defendant had committed acts of violence against them, to include beatings and rape.\" Response at 9. Most victims, including those not named, \"stated the Defendant usually possessed a gun.\" Response at 9. The United States further notes that, based on the testimony at the detention hearing, Langer received information from victims that Baker \"targeted homeless or drug-addicted women, lured them into his control by offering them drugs, and then forced them to work as prostitutes and give him their earnings.\" Response at 9. The United States asserts that the juvenile victim was lured into Baker's car using\n   drugs and transported across state lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9. Finally, the United States notes that Langer testified several women were too afraid of Baker to cooperate with the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9. Based on the testimony at the detention hearing, the United States concludes that the weight of the evidence against Baker is significant, and that this factor weighs in favor of pretrial detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, the United States maintains that, while Baker's criminal history is not \"the most extensive,\" it is \"not minimal.\" Response at 9. The United States asserts that Baker was convicted of theft on May 14, 2003, in Alabama, and arrested the very next day for robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9 (citing Bail Report at 5). The United States then notes that, after Baker was convicted of the robbery offense in July 2004, he was sentenced to three years confinement, one year suspended, and two years of probation, and that his probation was revoked in May 2006, after which he was sentenced to prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9-10 (citing Bail Report at 5-6). The United States also argues that Baker failed to appear on a misdemeanor charge and that, therefore, \"this Court should have no illusion that the Defendant will appear on serious federal felonies.\" Response at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fourth, the United States argues that Baker has honed his \"ability to identify and exploit the most vulnerable women in society to sell their bodies for profit\" through his involvement in sex trafficking. Response at 10. The United States alleges that Baker would\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   literally pick up women on the side of the road and drive them to other states, away from their homes, away from their resources, with no one to rely on except for him. Once he had them where he wanted them, he forced them to work as prostitutes while his associate guarded them in their rooms. He then took all of their money to ensure they maintained limited options.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Response at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The United States further argues that human trafficking, the offense of which Baker is accused, \"overlaps with the sort of dangers that are more familiar to the community: drug use, drug sales, physical abuse, child abuse, and rape,\" making human trafficking extremely dangerous. Response at 10. Baker's release, contends the United States, will place his victims at risk, because he knows who they are and how to find him, and because the United States believes one of Baker's associates has already tried to contact an alleged victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In conclusion, the United States asserts that Baker is a flight risk and a danger to the community. Because the weight of the evidence against him is strong and the nature and circumstances of his case are severe, Baker, the United States alleges, is a \"member of the small, identifiable group of particularly dangerous defendants whose continued pattern of criminal activity shows that they pose a significant risk of recidivism or violent behavior, and should be detained pending trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Baker responded that the theft involved shoplifting, and the robbery was a purse-snatching committed by someone else, and Baker drove the robber.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 4:19-5:2 (Court, Baiz). The Court then asked about the assault/reckless endangerment charge, and Baker responded that he ran a few red lights, and so an officer stopped and investigated him to determine if the car he was driving was stolen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:5-13 (Court, Baiz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Baker admitted that after his robbery conviction, the Court did revoke his probation and reinstate his imprisonment because he submitted a urine test that was positive for cocaine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:14-20 (Baiz). Baker told the Court that after reincarceration, he was granted probation again and completed it successfully, and did not use cocaine again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:21-24 (Baiz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court asked Baker about the probation violation bench warrant currently active against him, and Baker responded that he was convicted of a misdemeanor possession of marijuana and moved out of state and missed a court proceeding, but that the court which issued the warrant would not act on it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:25-6:13 (Court, Baiz). The Court then asked about a 2015 failure to appear bench warrant that Bernalillo County issued, and then canceled in 2017, and Baker responded that the warrant related to a traffic offense, and he had moved out of town, so could not promptly resolve it, but resolved it once he returned to Albuquerque.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 6:14-25 (Court, Baiz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Regarding Baker's criminal history while under supervision, the Court clarified that the USPO is referring to the fact that Baker violated the terms of his probation in Texas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 7:11-16 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   When asked what the United States feared would occur upon Baker's release, the United States cited fears that Baker would contact or harass victims, or make them feel unsafe, and that he would engage in further human trafficking or drug sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 7:22-9:9 (Court, Simms). The Court asked the United States what in Baker's criminal history gave it cause for concern, and the United States responded that his criminal history reveals a track record of crimes focused on vulnerable women, as evidenced by his purse-snatching conviction, and of not complying with the \"things that you have to do when you're a defendant in a criminal case,\" such as showing up to hearings, even on \"insignificant charges.\" March 19 Tr. at 11:3, 11:11-14 (Simms).

Nov. 15, 2011) (Browning, J.)(finding the defendant's burden of production satisfied where the only evidence presented in support of his release was his therapist's testimony, which the Court found not overwhelming). Baker presented some facts of which the Court might take judicial notice, such as the fifteen-year temporal gap since Baker's most recent prior conviction, that Texas will not extradite Baker based on his warrant for less than two ounces of marijuana, and that the traffic-violation-related warrant was resolved by conviction on May 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 24:24-25 (Baiz); Motion to Release at 2.

In the Appeal, Baker adds an argument that the 2012 allegations against him in the Indictment are necessarily false, because he was in Beaumont at the time they occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 5. Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment allege a period from June 2012, through June 3, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1-2. The United States, therefore, is correct that, even if Baker was living and working in Texas until 2013, he\n   could still be found guilty of these counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Baker alleges that the victims are not scared of him, and accordingly, he is not a danger to the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 6. In support, Baker notes that V.A. never stated in her interview with Baker's defense team that she was afraid of Baker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 6. There are many plausible reasons why victims of sex trafficking might not speak out against a perpetrator. Without suggesting that the same circumstances or motivations exist here, the Court notes, by way of illustration, some of the reasons trafficking victims in other cases have been reticent in interviews with authorities. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152111\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/900/\">\n    761 F.3d 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2014), for instance, a sex trafficking victim did not tell authorities about her trafficker, because he had threatened retribution against her, and another victim testified that she performed commercial sex acts, because she \"would rather work for [her trafficker] than put [her] family in danger.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Baker also presents his interpretation of the United States' recording of its interview with \"Jessica,\" suggesting that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [i]n spite of much prompting by the police officer to say that she felt coerced, Jessica repeatedly said she was not afraid of Mr. Baker and that she was engaging as a sex worker because she wanted to, not because she was forced. She also stated that Mr. Baker would not do anything violent because he was a \"caring person.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Appeal at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As the United States correctly notes, Baker may still pose a danger to victims even if they state in interviews that they are not afraid of him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4-5. Furthermore, even if the Court accepts the notion that \"Jessica\" was engaging in sex work of her own volition -- and the evidence suggests otherwise -- the allegations and the evidence presented at the detention hearing indicate that \"Jessica\" and the other victims did not want to engage in sex work for Baker's pecuniary gain. Nevertheless, Baker's points constitute sufficient evidence to meet his obligation to produce evidence to rebut the presumption in favor of detention. While he meets his burden of production, Baker's evidence does not overwhelm the United States' other evidence. Baker states in conclusory fashion that he is not a danger to any other person or the community,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 6, but he does not put forward any argument to this effect. Finally, there are six named victims in this case, and Baker refers only to two of them -- one who stated that she was not afraid of Baker, but the other who merely did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   state that she was afraid of Baker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 6. The United States also argues that there is a significant risk of victim harassment and therefore also of witness tampering if Baker is released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 7:22-9:9 (Court, Simms). The United States specifically notes evidence discovered since the September 29, 2017, hearing that one of Baker's associates has already attempted to contact a victim over Facebook.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court applies a lenient standard in determining what evidence is sufficient to satisfy the defendant's burden of production, and Baker has carried this light burden to produce evidence showing he is not a flight risk and is not a danger to the community. Magistrate Judge Fashing concluded that Baker \"has not introduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption,\" Sept. 29 Tr. at 27:14-15 (Court), but the Court concludes that there is enough evidence for Baker to meet his burden of production. Magistrate Judge Fashing also concluded, that, even if Baker has presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, she would still order his\n   detention, because she concludes that the United States has presented clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community, and that, by a preponderance of the evidence, Baker is a flight risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 27:15-28:5 (Court).

The Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Fashing's determination, and concludes that, considering the statutory factors, the United States has met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that no conditions could reasonably assure Baker's appearance in court. The Court concludes that, were Baker released before his trial, it is more likely than not that he would flee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The first factor from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses, weighs in favor of finding Baker to be a flight risk. Baker faces a lengthy period of incarceration if he is convicted of the charged offenses. On at least four of the counts in the Superseding Indictment, Baker faces, if convicted, a mandatory fifteen years of incarceration on each.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 26:9-11 (Simms). Given the severe sentence he faces if convicted of the charged offenses, and his poor performance when he has been on some form of supervised release, the Court recognizes that Baker has a strong incentive to flee if released before trial and is unlikely to comply with the\n   statutory conditions of release that the Court would impose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The second statutory factor, the weight of the United States' evidence against Baker, also favors finding Baker to be a flight risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). The evidence against Baker, if admissible, supports a finding of guilt. The weight of the evidence is thus against Baker. At the detention hearing, in addition to the many reports from victims describing Baker's conduct, Langer testified about Backpage.com advertisements that advertised Baker's victims, and that also included telephone numbers, email addresses, and names of associates all known to be connected to Baker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 10:9-16 (Langer). Langer conceded that there are currently no video or audio recordings of the alleged beatings which Baker inflicted on victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 13:3-9 (Baiz, Langer). Langer also conceded that, while there are interviews with the witnesses, not all the witnesses have prepared written statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 13:10-14 (Baiz, Langer). Langer testified, however, that there are hotel records from Arizona and Colorado linked to Baker, corroborating the Backpage.com records from Arizona and Colorado also linked to Baker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 15:5-22 (Baiz, Langer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The United States argues that, based on the testimony provided at the detention hearing and the linking of Baker's contact information to advertisements selling women on Backpage.com, the evidence against him is strong, and that the United States can prove that Baker is involved in human trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8-9. Baker states that only one individual, V.A., is responsible for most of the allegations he faces of violence against women and that V.A. stated in her interview with Baker's defense team that she was not frightened of Baker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 5. Baker also asserts that most interviews with witnesses are not recorded and that the only audio recording thus far disclosed in discovery is of an individual named \"Jessica,\" who also states that she is not afraid of Baker and finds him to be a caring person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 5. In its response, the United States asserted -- and it is correct -- that whether victims are currently afraid of defendants is not dispositive of whether the Defendants induced them to engage in prostitution by means of force, threats, fraud, or coercion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Considering the corroborating Backpage.com and hotel records linked to Baker, in combination with the reports from various victims, the Court concludes the evidence against Baker, if admissible, supports a finding of guilt. The Court concludes, therefore, that the weight of evidence against Baker is significant enough to create a strong incentive for Baker to flee if released before trial, and that his poor performance on other forms of release suggests that he will not do well under the restrictive conditions that the Court could impose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The third factor points in conflicting directions, but ultimately weighs in favor of finding Baker to be a flight risk. The relevant sub-factors evaluating Baker's personal history and characteristics, the third factor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [C]haracter, physical and mental condition, family ties ... length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, [ ] record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, [Baker] was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under Federal, State, or local law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3)(A-B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Some of Baker's personal characteristics weigh in favor of release. There is no\n   evidence to suggest that Baker has current or past mental health conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bail Report at 3. Baker does not have a long criminal history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 4. Baker admits to past drug addiction and has a 2013 conviction for a drug related offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 4. Baker indicated, through his counsel, that he no longer has a drug problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 5:17-24 (Baiz).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On the other hand, Baker's community ties are outside of New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 4. Baker was born in Alabama, has a father, sister, and grandmother all in Alabama, and has only resided in New Mexico for the past four years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appeal at 4. The Court also notes that Baker does not have a good record concerning appearance at required court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 15:24-16:15 (Court). The Addendum to the Bail Report notes that Baker has a history of \"non-compliance with past terms under community supervision.\" Addendum at 1. At the detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Fashing commented on the fact that Baker's record includes a 2015 failure to appear on a low-level offense, an active warrant from Texas on a 2012 probation violation, and a 2006 probation violation on a robbery conviction, indicating a history of poor performance on probation, parole, or supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 28:6-11 (Court). Baker's record indicates that he has fled in the face of much less substantial charges than those he currently faces. Further, Baker has no strong ties to New Mexico, and his closest family resides out of state. While an electronic bracelet may somewhat mitigate the risk of flight, realistically, a defendant can take off long before the USPO and the United States Marshals realize that he has fled, putting great distance between the defendant and the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The severe sentence that Baker faces if convicted and the significant weight of the evidence against him suggest that Baker has strong incentives to flee if released before trial. His lack of strong ties to New Mexico, and his history of poor compliance on supervised release suggest that he is likely to and able to flee. The Court therefore finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Baker is a flight risk. The Court also concludes there are no conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of Baker as required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     BAKER IS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The fourth statutory factor -- the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that Baker's release poses -- weighs in favor of detention. The United States has presented evidence of the nature and seriousness of the danger to victims and to the community that Baker's release poses, and the Court concludes that the evidence is clear and convincing. The Court is concerned that Baker would not do well on release and would then try to contact alleged victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In requiring courts to consider available information concerning the charged offenses' nature and circumstances when determining whether to release a defendant from pretrial detention,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) specifically requires courts to consider whether the charged offenses fall into certain categories.

Langer testified to reports that Baker drugged women and transported them to other cities and states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 8:23-25 (Langer). Langer testified to allegations of sexual violence and rape,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 10:24-25 (Langer), and allegations that Baker put a gun to one victim's head and held another victim's head underwater,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sept. 29 Tr. at 11:2-7 (Simms, Langer). The allegations that Baker specifically targets vulnerable women and, in one instance, a minor, and uses drugs and physical force to compel them to undertake acts in which they are not willing participants, are particularly troubling to the Court. The possibility that Baker could target another vulnerable victim persuades the Court that Baker would be a danger to society if released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In addition to Langer's testimony, the United States presented evidence indicating that one of Baker's associates has already attempted to contact an alleged victim, V.A., who stated in an interview that Baker held her head underwater, and that Baker or one of his associates beat her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. The United States alleges that, since Baker's defense team interviewed V.A. -- an interview which was \"unannounced and unscheduled\" -- V.A. received a \"friend request\" on Facebook from an individual who is Facebook friends with Baker and is from Alabama. Response at 5. The United States concedes that it cannot prove Baker was complicit in this contact, but it asserts that \"it is extremely coincidental that this person, who V.A. does not know, contacted her from very near Birmingham, Alabama, and is Facebook friends with Adonis Baker.\" Response at 5. At the March 19, 2018, hearing, the United States argued that the only reasonable inference from these facts is that Baker had something to do with the Facebook contact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19 Tr. at 9:23-24 (Simms). The United States argued that Baker may already have made efforts to contact the victims to \"retaliate against them or scare them to the point where they're no longer cooperating with this investigation.\" March 19 Tr. at 10:3-6 (Simms). This information was not available at the time of the September 29, 2017, detention hearing before Magistrate Judge Fashing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. Although the Court is not predisposed to believe the United States' side of the story, if the allegations presented are true, the Court has no assurance that Baker will not harass, contact, or retaliate against victims and potential witnesses if released. Placing Baker at La Pasada Halfway House does not appear to address the danger concern or decrease the risk that Baker could retaliate against victims, because it appears that Baker can do so through his associates and/or through virtual contact if he gains access to someone's cellular phone or computer at the La Pasada Halfway House or has a visitor to which he can pass on threats. This risk is particularly significant, the Court notes, because several of the victims are planned witnesses for the United States and because three victims have not yet been located. As the United States asserts, \"because the penalties in this case are so severe, the motivation to find these women and silence them is\n   high.\" Response at 11. While putting Baker on lockdown at La Pasada, with GPS monitoring, certainly reduces the risks of fleeing and danger, these conditions would not reduce those risks to zero, and if Baker walked off, the alleged victims and the United States' case would be in danger. That is a risk, however minimized or mitigated, which is too high to be tolerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Because the United States has presented probable cause supporting Baker's federal charges, the statutory presumption that Baker poses a danger to the community is triggered. While Baker has met his burden of production in response to the statutory presumption favoring detention, the presumption remains a factor for the Court to consider in making its ultimate determination regarding detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stricklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546699\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/1353/#p1354\">\n    932 F.2d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if a defendant's burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for consideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\"). Baker is charged with sex trafficking by means of force, threats, fraud and coercion; coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution; transportation for prostitution; sex trafficking of a child; and transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1. Langer's testimony at the detention hearing suggests that there are many victims presenting allegations connecting Baker to a well-organized, multi-state sex trafficking operation, fueled by drugs, coercion, threats of force, and physical force against vulnerable women and, in at least one instance, a minor victim. Evidence that Baker's contact information and his associates are linked to Backpage.com pages advertising women and to hotel records, which is consistent with the information that the Backpage.com pages reveal, corroborates the victims' reports. Additionally, there is some indication that one of Baker's associates has, since the September 29, 2017, detention hearing, attempted to contact V.A., one of the alleged victims and state's witnesses. Consequently, the Court finds that, by clear-and-convincing evidence, Baker is a danger to the community. If released, the temptation to harass and silence his alleged victims to avoid the severe sentences which he faces would be great. In the end, the Court is convinced that the temptation will be too great.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT BELIEVES IT CANNOT REDUCE BAKER'S RISK OF NONAPPEARANCE TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL EVEN WITH RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Baker proposes that the Court place him at La Pasada Halfway House to help mitigate his risk of nonappearance and danger to the community. The Court is not convinced that this restriction, even in combination with some of the restrictions which the Court has applied in the past, would mitigate these risks to an acceptable level to reasonably assure his appearance and to reasonably assure that he will not be a danger to the community. In the past, the Court has considered: \"(i) house arrest with RF monitoring; (ii) GPS monitoring; (iii) substantial restrictions on outside visitors; and (iv) significant restrictions on telephone use.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Varela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2013081272\">\n    2012 WL 13081272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10 (D.N.M. Feb. 21, 2012) (Browning, J.). While these conditions would mitigate the risk of Baker's nonappearance and the danger his release poses to the community, the Court concludes that the temptation for Baker to walk away from the facility is too great, given the weight of the evidence against him and the severity of the sentence he faces if convicted. The Court concludes that the United States has shown by clear-and-convincing evidence that he would pose a danger to the state's witnesses -- the alleged victims in this case --\n   and that the risk that he might harass or otherwise attempt to silence them could not be managed if Baker were to leave the facility, which the Court finds more likely than not he would do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Concluding that a presumption in favor of detention arises in this case because Baker's charged offenses include an offense involving a minor victim under \u00a7 1591, the Court also concludes that Baker has presented sufficient evidence to meet his burden of production. Even though Baker has presented sufficient evidence to meet his burden of production here, the Court concludes that, considering the statutory factors in \u00a7 3142(g) and the evidence presented, the United States has shown by clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community and by a preponderance of the evidence that Baker is a flight risk. Finally, concluding that the Court cannot reduce Baker's risk of nonappearance and danger to the community to acceptable levels through the imposition of any condition or combination of conditions, the Court will order that Baker be detained pending trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that: (i) the Defendant's Appeal of Detention Order, filed March 5, 2018 (Doc. 51), is denied; (ii) the Order of Detention Pending Trial, filed September 29, 2017 (Doc. 15), is affirmed, and (iii) the Order Denying Motion to Release Defendant from Custody, filed January 2, 2018 (Doc. 46) is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The defendant in a criminal case, on the other hand, need not present a cogent theory of the case or propose a comprehensive factual story.
