INTRODUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Christopher Campbell has asserted employment discrimination, hostile work environment, and whistleblower claims against Defendant Department of Human Services, State of Hawaii (\"DHS\"), and unnamed Doe/Roe defendants. DHS moves for partial judgment on the pleadings, arguing that it has Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to all state law claims and that the whistleblower claim, brought under state law, and the hostile work environment claim, to the extent based on a violation of state law, should therefore be dismissed with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Determining that the Eleventh\n   Amendment bars Campbell's state law claims against DHS, this court grants DHS's motion and dismisses the state law claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Campbell was employed by DHS as a Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist in Hilo, Hawaii, starting in June 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, PageID# 4. In the Complaint in the present case, filed on March 29, 2017, Campbell alleges that, while employed by DHS, he was subjected to \"a discriminatory, hostile work environment\" based on being African-American.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. He alleges that he was denied promotions, yelled at and mocked by his supervisor, falsely accused of several acts such as stealing from co-workers and threatening his supervisor, and treated differently from co-workers who were not African-American.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-10. Campbell also alleges that DHS did not thoroughly investigate his complaints of racial discrimination and did not discipline co-workers who used racial slurs and other offensive language.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. He alleges that, when he reported this discriminatory treatment to his Hawaii State Senator and the Hawaii State Ethics Commission, DHS retaliated against Campbell and suspended him without pay for pretextual reasons.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Campbell asserts three claims against DHS: (1) racial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e - 2000e-17 ; (2) a hostile work environment; and (3) retaliation against him as a whistleblower, in violation of Chapter 378 of Hawaii Revised Statutes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-21. Campbell does not specify whether the hostile work environment claim is brought under Title VII or state law; the court assumes for purposes of this order that Campbell is proceeding under both. He seeks \"general and special damages, including but not limited to reinstatement, an award of back pay, fringe benefits, senior and overtime and front pay,\" as well as compensatory damages, costs and attorney's fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DHS now moves for partial judgment on the pleadings.

The Supreme Court has made clear that Congress abrogated the Eleventh Amendment with respect to Title VII claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick v.

DHS is therefore not immune with respect to Campbell's Title VII racial discrimination claim and his hostile work environment claim, to the extent that claim is brought under Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, the question for this court is whether an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity applies to the remaining non-Title VII claims--\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the whistleblower claim and the hostile work environment claim, to the extent that claim is brought under state law. As discussed below, Campbell advances four arguments as to why Eleventh Amendment immunity does not apply to these claims. Finding none of these arguments persuasive, this court grants DHS's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Campbell's State Law Claims Seek Monetary Damages, Which Are Barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As mentioned above, under the Eleventh Amendment, a state is immune from lawsuits for monetary damages or other retrospective relief brought in federal court by its own citizens. The Eleventh Amendment does not apply to claims for prospective injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edelman v.

However, his complaint states that he is seeking various types of monetary damages: \"general and special damages, including but not limited to reinstatement, an award of back pay, fringe benefits, senior and overtime and front pay,\" as well as compensatory damages, costs and attorney's fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest. ECF No. 1, PageID # 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To the extent Campbell is arguing that \"reinstatement\" constitutes prospective injunctive relief, this argument is unavailing. \"In discerning whether the relief sought is prospective or retroactive for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment bar, we must analyze the substance, not the form, of the relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Native Vill. Of Noatak v. Blatchford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852557\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1505/#p1512\">\n    38 F.3d 1505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1512 (9th Cir. 1994) (\"Although Noatak has framed its request for payment of the $611 as prospective injunctive relief, in substance, Noatak seeks retroactive monetary relief.\"). Campbell's Complaint prays for general and special damages \"\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   ... reinstatement.\" ECF No. 1, PageID #21 (emphasis added). This suggests that he considers such reinstatement to be a form of damages, not injunctive relief. Moreover, the absence of any allegation in Campbell's Complaint that he was actually or constructively fired or demoted by DHS raises the question of whether \"reinstatement\" is even applicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1. This court cannot even tell from the record whether Campbell has anything to be \"reinstated\" to. Paragraph 70 of the Complaint is the last paragraph in the section of the Complaint stating background facts, and it indicates that Campbell's work credit card was returned to him in August 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852557\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1505/#p1512\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 14.

In\n   <em>\n    Bolla\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that the State of Hawaii had waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against the University of Hawaii brought under the Whistleblowers' Protection Act because suits against the University of Hawaii were allowed under Haw.

Campbell argues that, because\n   <em>\n    Bolla\n   </em>\n   did not find a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, \"[i]t would lead to an absurd result[ ] to suggest that the Legislature adopted a second, identical statute with the only difference being the inclusion of 'public employees.' \" ECF No. 77, PageID # 358. This court fails to see any absurdity. Section 378-70 was not identical to prior whistleblower statutes; it expanded whistleblower protections to public employees by providing greater avenues to state court. The legislative history does not mention\n   <em>\n    Bolla\n   </em>\n   , and no court has held that section 378-70 superseded the holding in\n   <em>\n    Bolla.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity requires that the state make a \"clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to [federal] jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Coll.
