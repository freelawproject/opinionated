The matter has been extensively briefed and is ready for disposition. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' motion will be granted in part and denied in part, and the City of St. Louis' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the purposes of the motions before the Court, the facts as established by the record are as follows. On February 10, 2017, the City of St. Louis Board of Alderman approved St. Louis Ordinance No. 70459 (\"Ordinance\"), which prohibits discrimination based on a person's reproductive health decisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or pregnancy. ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   No. 20-5.

It shall be a prohibited discriminatory practice:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) For an employer to fail or refuse to hire, to discharge or otherwise to discriminate against any individuals with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment, because of their reproductive health decisions or pregnancy status (including childbirth or a related medical condition).

The Ordinance also includes a provision stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Nothing in this ordinance shall prohibit a religious institution, corporation, association, society, health care facility or educational institution with historic religious affiliation from:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   i.

Refusing to provide health insurance coverage to any employee for any reproductive health service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sec. 2(B)(6); Sec. 2(C)(1)(j). Lastly, the Ordinance contains an enforcement provision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION THREE\n   </strong>\n   . Complaints, Proceedings and Enforcement. An aggrieved person may, not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after an alleged prohibited discriminatory practice has occurred or terminated, file a complaint with the Director of the Civil Rights Enforcement Agency pursuant to the procedures set forth in Ordinance 67119.

Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts (\"PSOF\") at \u00b6 1. Our Lady's Inn also operates a four-family flat that provides transitional housing for women who have completed their stay in a residential shelter and are either working, attending school, or enrolled in a job-training program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. It leases living space to women who are employees of Our Lady's Inn and serve as supervisors of residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. One criterion for employment with Our Lady's Inn is that the applicant support the pro-life mission of the organization; if an applicant does not support that mission, Our Lady's Inn does not consider the applicant to be a good candidate for employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Our Lady's Inn actively engages in expressive activities aimed at raising awareness of its pro-life mission and does not provide its employees with health insurance having coverage for abortion due to its sincerely held religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Archdiocesan Elementary Schools of the Archdiocese of St. Louis (\"Archdiocesan Elementary Schools\") are a Missouri nonprofit corporation consisting of a group of elementary schools administered by the Catholic Education Center and governed by the Archdiocesan Board of Catholic Education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. The employees of the Archdiocesan Elementary Schools must, upon application for employment, sign a Witness Statement attesting that they respect ecclesial authority, will not take a public position contrary to the Catholic Church, and will conduct their lives in a manner consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. This requirement is imposed by the Archdiocese of St. Louis on all Catholic school employees throughout the Archdiocese.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Witness Statement specifically enumerates and requires signers to abide by, among other doctrines, the Catholic Church's longstanding and widely known opposition to abortion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Every new and renewed employee is required to sign the Witness Statement as a condition of employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff O'Brien Industrial Holdings, LLC (\"O'Brien Industrial Holdings\") is a closely-held company engaged in exploration, mining, and processing of refractory and ceramic raw materials, and Plaintiff Frank O'Brien is the principal owner and holds the sole voting interest in the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28. Mr. O'Brien holds to the teachings of the Catholic Church regarding the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death, and he adheres to the Catholic Church's teachings regarding the immorality of sterilization and artificial means of contraception.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. Mr. O'Brien asserts that his company's provision of employee health insurance coverage for contraception, sterilization, or abortion would violate his sincere religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. In his Affidavit, Mr. O'Brien stated that since the enactment of the Ordinance, he has felt anxious and deterred from openly operating his company as he always had-in accordance with his sincerely held religious beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. He is also uncertain how to communicate information about O'Brien Industrial Holdings' mission and values to prospective employees without incurring legal penalties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the City of St. Louis to remedy what they allege to be numerous violations of Plaintiffs' freedom of speech, freedom of association, and other rights secured by the United States Constitution and Missouri law. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege the following against the City: (1) violation of the free speech clause of the First Amendment; (2) violation of the right to expressive association under the First Amendment; (3) violation of the religion clauses of the First Amendment (\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   claim) (Archdiocesan Elementary Schools only); (4) violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   claim) (Archdiocesan Elementary Schools only); (5) violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - void for vagueness; (6) violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Mr. O'Brien and O'Brien Industrial Holdings only); (7) violation of Missouri law (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20191.724\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 191.724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 376.805 ) causing the Ordinance to be null and void (Our Lady's Inn, Mr. O'Brien, and O'Brien Industrial Holdings only); (8) violation of Missouri law (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20188.325\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 188.325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 135.600 ) causing the Ordinance to be null and void (Our Lady's Inn only); (9) defective enforcement provisions; and (10) violation of the Missouri Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the Employment and Housing Provisions as applied to them because\n   they violate Plaintiffs' First Amendment freedoms, Missouri law, and Supreme Court precedent. The O'Brien Plaintiffs specifically challenge various provisions of the Ordinance, as applied, that they argue require non-religious employers to provide employee health benefits covering contraceptives, abortions, and sterilizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs also seek a Court order declaring the Employment and Housing Provisions, as well as the enforcement provision, of the Ordinance to be facially unconstitutional, unlawful, invalid, unenforceable, null and void and otherwise of no force and effect. Plaintiffs request that the City of St. Louis be enjoined from enforcing the Ordinance against them, \"as well as others not before the Court where it is facially unlawful.\" ECF No. 1 at 43. Plaintiffs further request that any remaining provisions of the Ordinance be declared invalid because they cannot be severed, and award Plaintiffs costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and expert fees and expenses pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   All Plaintiffs assert that the Ordinance is facially invalid as an overbroad restriction on their First Amendment rights to free speech and expressive association. Plaintiffs also bring a void-for-vagueness facial challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The O'Brien Plaintiffs argue that the Ordinance is also invalid as applied to the extent that it requires employers to provide employee health insurance benefits that cover abortions, contraceptives, and sterilizations. This, the O'Brien Plaintiffs argue, conflicts with their sincerely-held religious beliefs and violates Missouri's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibits government interference with a person's free exercise of religion unless that interference is essential to further a compelling interest and is not unduly restrictive. The O'Brien Plaintiffs also claim that the Ordinance's religious exemptions concerning employee health coverage violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the Ordinance treats religious and non-religious entities dissimilarly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Our Lady's Inn and the Archdiocesan Elementary Schools argue that the Ordinance, as applied, violates their right to free speech under the First Amendment because it regulates speech based on content and viewpoint, does not serve a compelling interest, and is not narrowly tailored. These Plaintiffs also claim the Ordinance violates their right to freedom of association because the forced inclusion of individuals who do not share Plaintiffs' beliefs on abortion affects in a significant way Plaintiffs' ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Archdiocesan Elementary Schools argue that the Ordinance violates their constitutionally-protected right to hire and fire \"ministers\" (which includes teachers) without government interference by way of employment discrimination laws, under\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; School v. EEOC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The Archdiocesan Elementary Schools also argue that the Ordinance conflicts with their right to conduct the internal affairs of their schools, as well as the rights of parents to choose where their children will receive religious and pro-life instruction, in violation of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pierce v. Society of Sisters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13076\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/268/510/\">\n    268 U.S. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13076\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/268/510/\">\n    45 S.Ct. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13076\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/268/510/\">\n    69 L.Ed. 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1925).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   All Plaintiffs maintain that the Ordinance violates Missouri law prohibiting mandatory employee coverage of abortion, contraception, or sterilization (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20191.724\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 191.724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376.805 ). Our Lady's Inn argues that the Ordinance may require it\n   to violate the Missouri Alternatives to Abortion Services Program,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20188.325\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 188.325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides services or counseling to pregnant women, resulting in a loss of tax credits. Lastly, all Plaintiffs challenge the enforcement provisions of the Ordinance on the basis that they unlawfully incorporate by reference the enforcement provisions contained in a different City Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The City in its opposition and cross motion for summary judgment argues that a plain reading of the Ordinance demonstrates that it is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The City claims that the Ordinance contains specific provisions that exempt both religious and non-religious entities from being required to provide healthcare coverage \"for reproductive rights.\" Any other interpretation, the City maintains, would violate\n   <em>\n    Burwell v. Hobby Lobby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20682\">\n    573 U.S. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), which the City took into account when drafting the Ordinance. Thus, the City argues, the claims of the O'Brien Plaintiffs must fail. Further, the City maintains that the Ordinance is compliant with the Missouri Religious Freedom Restoration Act because its provisions are essential to further a compelling government interest and are not unduly restrictive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The City also argues that the Ordinance is a content-neutral regulation protecting an important government interest (individuals making reproductive health decisions), and that it narrowly limits the time, place, and manner in which a person can discriminate against reproductive health decisions. With regard to the expressive association claims, the City argues that the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of reproductive health choices does not interfere with Plaintiffs' expressive association rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The City contends that the Archdiocesan Elementary Schools' claims are without merit because the cases cited do not apply. Specifically, the City maintains that teachers are not \"ministers\" under\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   ; and that the\n   <em>\n    Pierce\n   </em>\n   holding, which established black letter law regarding a parent's right to direct the upbringing and education of one's child, does not apply to the hiring and firing of teachers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Lastly, the City claims the Ordinance does not violate any Missouri law. It maintains that the Ordinance has no effect on Our Lady's Inn as it relates to the funding it receives under the Missouri Alternatives to Abortion Services Program because the Ordinance does not require Our Lady's Inn to run afoul of the statute. As to the challenges regarding employee healthcare coverage, the City reiterates is position that the Ordinance does not require employers to provide coverage for abortions, contraceptives, and sterilization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The standard for summary judgment is well settled.

The City argues that the word \"religious\" applies only to the word \"institution.\" The O'Brien Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that \"religious\" modifies each item in the subsequent list, and thus the O'Brien Plaintiffs do not qualify for the exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court cannot agree with the City's interpretation. Rather, the Court finds that when the phrase \"religious institution, corporation, association, society, health care facility or educational institution with historic religious affiliation\" is given its ordinary or natural meaning within the context of the Ordinance, the adjective \"religious\" applies to each noun in the series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Under the City's approach, the world \"religious\" is essentially rendered superfluous. Moreover, the City's interpretation leads to illogical results. Section 2(C)(1)(j) of the Ordinance would, for instance, exempt educational institutions with historic religious affiliation, but not other educational institutions.

The burden of proof is on the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Here, the City offered two government interests in support of the Ordinance: (1) to prohibit discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups, such as a person making reproductive health decisions; and (2) to ensure its citizens have access to employment and housing despite their decision to have a family or terminate a pregnancy. The sole piece of evidence presented by the City is the Affidavit of Alderwoman Megan Green, who stated that she \"was approached by City residents who were concerned that their job security and housing situation was threatened by employers and landlords who discriminated against their reproductive health choices.\" ECF No. 20-1 at \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although the City certainly has a compelling interest to protect its citizens against discrimination - clearly a laudable goal - it has failed to present sufficient evidence that those making reproductive health decisions are \"historically disadvantaged\" or that the provisions of the Ordinance limiting speech were narrowly tailored to further that compelling interest. In fact, the City only presents the Affidavit of the sponsor of the Ordinance, who states in general terms that she was approached by residents concerned about discrimination on the basis of reproductive health decisions. This is insufficient to withstand strict scrutiny. Thus, the Employment Provisions of the Ordinance are invalid as applied to Our Lady's Inn and the Archdiocesan Elementary Schools, and the Housing Provisions are invalid as applied to Our Lady's Inn, and the Court will grant summary judgment on Count II to this extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In light of this holding, it is unnecessary for the Court to address, under Plaintiff's Count III, whether the Ordinance could be applied to non-ministerial employees or to define who would be properly defined as a ministerial employee, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v.

Ill. 2016) (holding that the applicability of the ministerial exception is a question of law for the Court and is factual and case-specific). But, of course, a narrowly-tailored anti-discrimination provision still might have application to the Archdiocese if, for example, if it were to apply its policies, such as the Witness Statement, to its employees unevenly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cline v.

Further, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that no set of circumstances exist under which the Ordinance would valid.
