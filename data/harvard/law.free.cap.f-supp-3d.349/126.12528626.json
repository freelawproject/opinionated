R. CIV. P .\" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(6), seeking to dismiss the\n   complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the Plaintiff's complaint, and for the purposes of the instant motion, are construed in favor of the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Laface is currently employed by BOCES as a Custodial Worker I. For the last 30 years, he has been assigned to the Gary D. Bixhorn Technical Center (\"BTC\") at 350 Matra Avenue in Bellport, New York. During his tenure at BTC, Laface worked from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. during the workweek and was supervised by Anderson and Bilka. The Plaintiff belongs to the United Public Services Employees Union (the \"Union\") and his employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement (the \"CBA\"). At an unknown time, the Plaintiff developed a condition that causes stress and anxiety and prevents him from travelling further than ten miles from his home. Laface had previously informed Anderson as well as BOCES' Human Resources Department of his travelling restriction prior to the events detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While the Plaintiff's complaint makes it clear that the Plaintiff was involved in a series of complaints and grievances, the nature and timeline of the specific complaints is ambiguous. According to the Union, the Plaintiff has actively advocated for himself and the Union for over 25 years and filed 15 separate grievances since 2014. These were filed in connection with \"change in shift hours, non-bargaining unit members performing bargaining unit work, allowing district employees and/or students into the building without a custodian present ... and other ... matters.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry (\"DE\") 10-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relevant to the instant action, beginning in 2015, the Plaintiff began making complaints to Lutz, the Chief Operating Officer of BOCES, and the Board regarding alleged improper and wasteful expenditures of public funds, misuse of public funds, and contracting practices. The Plaintiff also alleges that he was involved in a grievance filed by the Union regarding harassment and discrimination that he purportedly faced on July 7, 2014. The letter from Laface's union depicts an issue with Anderson that alleges bullying, intimidation and the threat of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 10-8 at 1-2. The Plaintiff also filed a grievance with the Public Employment Retaliations Board (\"PERB\") on July 16, 2015 regarding the use of contractors without custodial employees present. The Plaintiff was scheduled to testify at the related arbitration hearing scheduled for November 2, 2016. This arbitration involved the use of exterior contractors without custodians present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 10-9. Separately, the Plaintiff seemed to have filed an internal complaint with BOCES regarding his treatment in the workplace, alleging harassment and discrimination regarding the Plaintiff's stated disability. There is no timeline provided for this factual assertion and it is unclear if this complaint is separate from the Union's grievance that resulted from the July 7, 2014 incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about October 17, 2016, Anderson and Bilka notified the Plaintiff by letter that he was reassigned to the H.B. Ward Campus (\"HBW\") in Riverhead, New York, effective on October 28, 2016. The letter did not provide an explanation as to why BOCES was transferring Laface. HBW is located more than ten miles from the Plaintiff's residence. The CBA permits involuntary transfers with one-week's prior notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBA, DE 10-2 at 27-28. In\n   pertinent part, it states: \"Except for emergencies and temporary assignments, a permanent unit member may not be transferred to another shift or from one building to another until prior notice to and discussion with the unit member has taken place. A one week notice for permanent transfers is required.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20L.%20%C2%A7%20296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff was provided nine days notice of the transfer to HBW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Laface's impending transfer caused him enormous anxiety and prevented him from being able to continue to work. Unable to drive to HBW without his condition flaring up, the Plaintiff began a period of sick leave beginning on October 28, 2016. On or about November 22, 2016, the Plaintiff received a letter from Diamond, the School Personnel Officer, which directed him to report to BOCES Human Resources Department for a meeting on November 28, 2016. Laface's last day of documented sick leave was November 27, 2016, the day before the meeting. He reported to the November 28, 2016 meeting with Diamond and requested that she \"make a reasonable accommodation for his documented disability.\" She \"refused to engage in the required interactive process ... to identify a reasonable accommodation for Plaintiff's travel/driving restrictions and stated to Plaintiff that [BOCES] was not going to accommodate him.\" Diamond instructed the Plaintiff to have his physician complete a number of forms regarding his disability. Laface presented the forms to his physician who completed them and returned them to Diamond. After the November 28, 2016 meeting, the Plaintiff received correspondence from Marysue Dileva informing him of his rights and responsibilities under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Diamond again met with the Plaintiff on December 23, 2016, along with his union representative. At that meeting, Diamond purportedly accused Laface of being uncooperative in refusing to answer her questions and informed him that he was to report to HBW using public transportation rather than remain at BTC. Following the December 23, 2016 meeting, the Plaintiff was placed on paid administrative leave. Both the Plaintiff and his union representative reached out to Diamond to discuss his administrative leave. Ultimately, the Plaintiff never reported to his assignment at HBW. On December 21, 2016, the Union filed a complaint with PERB contending that the Plaintiff's transfer was in retaliation for the Union's July 16, 2015 grievance involving exterior work on the building.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about January 19, 2017, the Plaintiff received a letter from Diamond ordering him to report to Jefferson Academic Center (\"JAC\") for a temporary work assignment beginning on February 1, 2017. The letter further informed the Plaintiff that he was assigned to work from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. at JAC during the regular workweek and indicated that JAC is less than ten miles from the Plaintiff's residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 10-7, at 2. The Plaintiff began working at JAC as instructed and continues to report to this temporary work assignment, which he contends involves different work and added responsibilities, including additional manual labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Throughout this time there were vacant custodial positions at BTC, including the Plaintiff's original position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As the Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   , \"the terms and conditions of employment ordinarily include the possibility that an employee will be subject to an employer's [leave] policies in appropriate circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261742\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/87/#p92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3261742\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/465/87/#p92\">\n    at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This short, paid administrative leave, without more, cannot constitute an adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court notes that the Plaintiff's allegation that the Defendants attempted to place him on FMLA leave has no basis in the facts alleged in the complaint. The fact that the Defendants sent Laface a Notice of Eligibility and Rights &amp; Responsibilities under the FMLA does not indicate that BOCES was trying to place him on FMLA leave. Rather, BOCES was required to provide him with notice regarding his eligibility under the statute. This notice does not form a separate adverse employment action for the Plaintiff's ADA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

Laface contends that Lutz, McSweeney, Diamond, Anderson and Bilka are not \"school officers\" within the meaning of the statute. A \"school officer\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   a clerk, collector, or treasurer of any school district; a trustee; a member of a board of education or other body in control of the schools by whatever name known in a union free school district, central school district, central high school district, or in a city school district; a superintendent of schools; a district superintendent; a supervisor of attendance or attendance officer; or other elective or appointive officer in a school district whose duties generally relate to the administration of affairs connected with the public school system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20Law%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    N.Y.

Based upon this definition, Lutz, McSweeney, Diamond,\n   Anderson and Bilka all qualify as \"school officers.\" While none of these Defendants are trustees, treasurers, collectors, clerks, or district superintendents, they are all \"elective or appointive officer[s]\" who are responsible for the \"administration of affairs\" at BOCES. All of these district-wide positions \"relate to the administration of affairs\" within BOCES. There is no contention in the complaint or any other part of the record that any of these roles are school-specific, such as a principal or teacher, and therefore not an \"officer\" as defined by the Education Law. Rather, the complaint contains factual allegations that indicate these were all district-wide roles. Accordingly, the Plaintiff was required to comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 3813(1) with regard to his state-law claims against the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Moreover, the Court is unable to grant leave to allow the Plaintiff to file a late notice since the one-year statute of limitations period for his state-law claims has now expired.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Defendants' motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), is granted in part. The Plaintiff's disability discrimination claims under the ADA &amp; Rehabilitation Act; hostile environment claim under the ADA; retaliation claim under Title VII; Section 1983 First Amendment redress of grievances claim; Section 1983 procedural due process claim; and state law claims are dismissed with prejudice. Laface's ADEA discrimination claim and Section 1983 First Amendment free speech claim are dismissed without prejudice. A portion of his retaliation claim under the ADA survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   For those claims that are dismissed without prejudice, the Plaintiff is granted leave to replead them within thirty (30) days of entry of this Order. Failure to do so will result in their dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
