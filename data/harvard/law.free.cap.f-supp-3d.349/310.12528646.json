(together, \"Plaintiffs\") in this trademark-infringement action, Plaintiffs assigned their interest in the Judgment to Next Investments, LLC (the \"Assignee\"), and the matter has recently been before the Court in connection with the Assignee's efforts to enforce the Judgment against the defendant judgment debtors (\"Defendants\" or the \"Judgment Debtors\") and disputes related to those efforts. In particular, the Honorable Colleen McMahon has referred the case to this Court to address a post-judgment motion by six nonparty Chinese banks - Agricultural Bank of China (\"ABC\"), Bank of Communications Limited (\"BOCOM\"), China Construction Bank (\"CCB\"), China Merchants Bank (\"CMB\"), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (\"ICBC\"), and the Bank of China (\"BOC\") (collectively, the \"Banks\") - to quash certain subpoenas (the \"Subpoenas\") served on them by the Assignee, and to modify an Order issued by Judge McMahon on October 20, 2017 (the \"10/20/17 Order\"), which imposed a global restraint on the assets of the Judgment Debtors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 70 (motion by five of the Banks), 107 (request by BOC for leave to\n   join in the motion).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Also before this Court is the Assignee's cross-motion to compel compliance with the Subpoenas. (Dkt. 82.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Banks' motion is denied to the extent the Banks seek to quash the Subpoenas and deemed withdrawn without prejudice to the extent they seek to modify the 10/20/17 Order, and the Assignee's cross-motion to compel the production of documents pursuant to the Subpoenas is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this action in November 2013, asserting federal and state trademark claims against hundreds of alleged infringers, based on their unauthorized use of Plaintiffs' trademarks in connection with the sale of counterfeit goods. (Dkts. 1, 28.) None of the named Defendants appeared in this action, and, on June 29, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a default judgment, seeking both injunctive and monetary relief. (Dkt. 37.) At that point, as discussed further below, the nonparty Banks filed an objection (Dkt. 41), specifically challenging the provision of the proposed default judgment that they described as an \"asset-freezing injunction that would purport to require the Banks to restrain customer accounts located outside of the United States\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 1). After receiving briefing regarding the Banks' objection (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 42, 43, 46, 47), the Honorable Shira A. Scheindlin, U.S.D.J., to whom the case was then assigned, denied the objection on August 20, 2015 (Dkt. 48). On that same day, Judge Scheindlin entered the Judgment, which awarded Plaintiffs more than $1 billion in equitable relief and which included the asset-restraint provision that had been challenged by the Banks. There was then no further activity in the case before the Court until Plaintiffs assigned their interest in the Judgment to the Assignee on January 31, 2017 (Dkt. 50), and the Assignee began efforts to seek enforcement (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkts. 53-58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 6, 2017, the case was reassigned to Judge McMahon, and, on October\n   20, 2017, Judge McMahon issued an Order finding the Judgment Debtors to be in contempt of court. (10/20/17 Order \u00b6 1.) Further, as relevant to the matters now before this Court, the 10/20/17 Order expressly restrained and enjoined not only Defendants, who were the only subjects of the Judgment, but also third parties (including the Judgment Debtors' \"financial service providers\") \"from transferring, withdrawing, or disposing of any money or other assets into or out of any accounts held by, associated with, or utilized by the Judgment Debtors, ... regardless of whether such money or assets are held in the U.S. or abroad.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about November 30, 2017, the Assignee issued the Subpoenas to the Banks, seeking information related to the Judgment Debtors' assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jacqueline L. Chung [in Support of Banks' Motion to Quash Subpoenas and Modify the 10/20/17 Order], dated Feb. 14, 2018 (\"Chung Decl.\") (Dkt. 72) \u00b6 13 and Ex. 11 (example of Subpoenas).) According to the Banks, the Subpoenas to the different Banks are largely identical and may be considered collectively. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 14, 2018, five of the Banks (all except for BOC) filed a motion to quash the Subpoenas, and to modify the global asset-restraint provision of the 10/20/17 Order. (Dkt. 70 (Notice of Motion);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law of Nonparties ABC, BOCOM, CCB, CMB, and ICBC's Motion to Quash Subpoenas and to Modify the 10/20/17 Order, dated Feb. 14, 2018 (\"Banks Mem.\") (Dkt. 71).) On March 16, 2018, the Assignee filed an opposition to that motion, together with a cross-motion to compel compliance with the Subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 82 (Notice of Cross-Motion);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion to Quash Filed by Third-Party Chinese Banks and in Support of Cross-Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated Mar. 16, 2018 (\"Assignee Mem.\") (Dkt. 87).) On April 27, 2018, BOC filed a motion for leave to join in the other banks' motion to quash (Dkt. 107), and, on the same day, the originally moving banks filed a joint reply on their motion and an opposition to the cross-motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Support of Nonparty Banks' Reply in Support of Motion to Quash Subpoenas and to Modify the 10/20/17 Order and Opposition to Assignee's Cross-Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated Apr. 27, 2018, (\"Banks Reply Mem.\") (Dkt. 110).) On May 25, 2018, the Assignee filed a reply on its cross-motion. (Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Cross-Motion to Compel Production of Documents, dated May 25, 2018, (\"Assignee Reply Mem.\") (Dkt. 127).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Banks and the Assignee have also filed no fewer than 21 separate Declarations in support of their motions and cross-motions, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 72-78, 83-86, 108, 109, 111-15, 124-26), including Declarations from two experts in Chinese law (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Guo Li (\"Guo\") [in Support of the Banks' Motion to Quash and to Modify the 10/20/17 Order], dated Feb 13, 2018, (\"Guo Decl.\") (Dkt. 73); Declaration of Donald Clarke (\"Clarke\") [in Support of the Assignee's Cross-Motion to Compel Production of Documents], dated Mar. 16, 2018 (\"Clarke Decl.\") (Dkt. 83) ). The Court has also received a letter from the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China, in support of the Banks' motion. (Letter to the United States Department of Justice and the Honorable Colleen McMahon, U.S.D.J., from the Ministry of\n   Justice, People's Republic of China, dated Mar. 20, 2018 (\"Chinese Ministry of Justice Letter\") (Dkt. 103).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge McMahon referred the disputes over the Subpoenas and the 10/20/17 Order to this Court for resolution. (Dkts. 95, 116.) As also discussed further below, this Court subsequently heard oral argument from counsel for the Assignee and the Banks (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Transcript of June 25, 2018 Oral Argument (\"6/25/18 Tr.\") (Dkt. 128) ), and received post-argument submissions relating to an issue raised during the argument (Dkts. 130, 132, 133, 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THE BANK'S MOTION TO QUASH THE SUBPOENAS AND THE ASSIGNEE'S CROSS-MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Timeliness of Motion To Quash and of BOC's Request To Join the Motion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"In order to be timely, a motion to quash a subpoena generally must be filed before the return date of the subpoena.\"\n   <em>\n    Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Associated Elec. &amp; Gas Ins.

Nov. 4, 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The representative Subpoena submitted by the Banks in conjunction with their motion to quash reflects a return date of January 2, 2018 (Chung Decl., Ex. 11, at 1) and, although the Court has not been provided copies of all of the Subpoenas, it assumes that the others were returnable on the same or a similar date. Five of the six Banks filed their motion to quash on February 14, 2018, a little over one month after the return date stated on the representative Subpoena (Dkt. 70), and BOC did not seek leave to join in the motion until April 27, 2018 (Dkt. 107). As such, it appears that all of the Banks' motions, with regard to the Subpoenas, are untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Still, \"district courts have broad discretion over the decision to quash a subpoena, and a number of courts in this Circuit have exercised their discretion to consider motions to quash that were not timely filed within the meaning of Rule 45 and applicable case law.\"\n   <em>\n    Bouchard Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206741852\">\n    2015 WL 6741852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Given the important interests articulated in the Banks' motion, this Court will exercise its discretion to consider the motion to quash, even if untimely. Also, as BOC's interests in this matter are virtually identical to those of the other nonparty banks, and as the Assignee has not objected to BOC's request for leave to join in the motion, this Court finds that permitting BOC to join in the motion would be reasonable and would aid the Court in efficiently resolving the matters at issue. Accordingly, BOC's request for leave to join in the motion (Dkt. 107) is granted, and this Court will not\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   deny, as untimely, either the motion to quash or BOC's application to join in the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Personal Jurisdiction Over the Banks\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is axiomatic that, before compelling a nonparty to comply with a subpoena pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, a court must have personal jurisdiction over that nonparty.\n   <em>\n    Gucci America, Inc. v.

With respect to their use of correspondent accounts, for example, the Banks argue that they are \"passive actors\" that merely maintain those New York-based accounts, and that they \"themselves do not transfer funds, nor ... direct the transfer of funds to their customer accounts overseas.\" (Banks Reply Mem., at 7.) In support of this argument, the Banks draw attention to the \"highly automated\" process of correspondent banking, noting that any \"affirmative action\" takes place either in the New York correspondent banks (into whose accounts the transferor's banks credit funds) or in the Banks' foreign branches (at which the Banks credit the accounts of the transferees,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Judgment Debtors). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 6-7.)

Indeed, as discussed in the context of this Court's comity analysis below (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Discussion,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , at Section I(C)(4) ), the Hague Convention - which the Banks urge the Court to require the Assignee to utilize as an alternative to the Subpoenas - has not proven to afford parties a viable mechanism through which they may secure full discovery from nonparties in China. The limitations of the Hague Convention suggest that requiring its use, in this case, would not further the international judicial system's interest in ensuring that a significant judgment against trademark infringers is satisfied. Rather, it appears that permitting the Assignee to proceed with the Subpoenas would \"provide the fastest and most practical means\" of advancing this matter.\n   <em>\n    Gucci III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178013\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/135/87/#p93\">\n    135 F.Supp.3d at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    iv.\n    <em>\n     Substantive Social Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, in balancing the substantive social policies at issue, this Court notes that the underlying claims in this case charged a large number of defendants with counterfeiting famous trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint, dated Dec. 2, 2014 (\"Am. Compl.\") (Dkt. 28).) As a matter of social policy, such significant violations of the Lanham Act should have consequences, and the Judgment Debtors should not be permitted to avoid the Judgment entered against them. While the Banks point out that the Assignee is not, itself, the trademark holder (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Banks Mem., at 1 n.1 &amp; 15), the mere fact that Plaintiffs assigned their rights to the Judgment does not render its enforcement of lesser significance. Although the Banks have raised certain conflicting legal interests arising from Chinese banking law (interests that are properly addressed as part of the comity analysis (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ) ), this Court finds that, overall, this factor either weighs in the Assignee's favor or, at a minimum, in the face of competing policy interests, is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As at least four of the five factors weigh in favor of the Assignee, this Court finds that exercising personal jurisdiction over the Banks would comport with notions of fair play and substantial justice, and would not violate constitutional due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     International Comity Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Banks assert that complying with the Subpoenas will necessarily cause them to violate Chinese banking laws, which, according to the Banks, \"prohibit the disclosure of customer account information and the restraint of customer accounts absent authorization from the appropriate Chinese authorities.\" (Banks Mem., at 19.) The Banks' view, as supported by a Declaration submitted by their expert, Guo - a Professor of Law and Vice Dean at Peking University Law School in the People's Republic of China - is that they are permitted by applicable regulations to disclose or restrain accounts only at the request of a \"competent organ\" of the Chinese government, such as a Chinese judicial authority or another expressly authorized Chinese governmental entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 14-15 (citing Guo Decl. \u00b6 15-21).)

(Banks Mem., at 23-24 (citing Guo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-37).) As has been observed by other courts in this district, however, \"[t]o date, the evidence remains strong for the conclusion reached in the\n   <em>\n    Forbse\n   </em>\n   case that meaningful sanctions by the Chinese government against [Chinese banks] are 'highly doubtful.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288692\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/548/#p556\">\n    910 F.Supp.2d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Banks \"are closely tied to the Chinese state and are in many respects quasi-governmental entities\" (Clarke Decl. \u00b6 20), and Clarke states that, in his expert opinion, it is unlikely that the Banks or their employees would face serious repercussions if ordered to comply with the Subpoenas (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39). Further, the cases cited by Guo, some of which were previously analyzed in\n   <em>\n    Gucci I\n   </em>\n   and found not to support the Banks' position, \"are plainly inapposite to the facts of the case at bar[,] ...

(Assignee Mem., at 25.) The Assignee further argues that the Banks have provided no justification for their failure to produce documents related to New York correspondent accounts, asserting that such production would not have \"raise[d] the same comity concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In contrast, the Banks point to their voluntary search of records in their New York branches for responsive information, their active participation in this case, and the supposedly \"narrowly focused\" relief they seek (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to limit the scope of the Assignee's requests, and not to evade discovery, but rather to require the Assignee to proceed by way of the Hague Convention) as evidence of their good faith.

Based on the current record, this Court cannot find that the Banks have acted in bad faith in resisting the Subpoenas and filing their motion. Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of the Banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Considering the totality of the circumstances, though, this Court finds that, overall, the balance of interests in the comity analysis weigh in favor of granting the Assignee's motion to compel production of documents from the Banks. To be sure, there are factors that weigh slightly or\n   moderately in favor of the Banks, including the location of relevant documents abroad, a lack of demonstrated bad faith by the Banks, and the potential (although doubtful) legal repercussions that the Banks may face for violating Chinese law. These factors, however, are outweighed by others that weigh more strongly in favor of the Assignee, including the obvious importance of the requested documents to enforcing the Judgment; the lack of a proven, viable alternative means by which those documents may be secured without substantial delay and imposed limitations; the specific focus of the document requests; and, on the whole, the greater national interest of the United States in enforcing its judgments against counterfeiters. Given the balance of the comity considerations, and this Court's earlier finding that an exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over the Banks would satisfy the requirements of both the New York long-arm statute and constitutional due process, the Banks' motion to quash the Subpoenas is denied, and the Assignee's cross-motion to compel compliance is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE BANKS' MOTION TO MODIFY THE COURT'S 10/20/17 ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Motorola Credit Corp. v.

For the reasons discussed below, however, this Court understands that the Banks have voluntarily withdrawn their request for a modification of the 10/20/17 Order at this time, without prejudice to renew the request at a later date, should the Assignee take affirmative steps in the future to enforce the asset restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Asset-Restraint Provisions of the Judgment, and the Procedural History of Those Provisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Prior to Judge Scheindlin's entry of the Judgment against Defendants in this case, the Banks wrote to the Court, requesting that the Court decline to include in the Judgment certain language that had been proposed by Plaintiffs that, according to the Banks, \"would purport to require the Banks to restrain customer accounts located outside the United States.\" (Letter to the Court from Andrew Rhys Davies, Esq., and Paul B. Carberry, Esq., dated July 17, 2015 (Dkt. 41), at 1.) Plaintiffs responded to the Banks' letter by arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that, as the proposed default judgment was \"not an order against the Banks, ... the Court need[ed] jurisdiction\n   only over the counterfeiter defendants to enter it.\" (Letter to the Court from Robert L Weigel, Esq., dated July 24, 2015 (Dkt. 42), at 3.) In reply, the Banks acknowledged that Plaintiffs' proposed language, as written, would directly enjoin only Defendants, but argued that Plaintiffs did \"not deny ... that [their] true purpose in seeking such an injunction [was] to coerce the Banks into restraining customer accounts overseas, by allowing [Plaintiffs] to threaten the Banks with contempt proceedings if they fail[ed] to prevent the accountholders from withdrawing their funds abroad.\" (Letter to the Court from Andrew Rhys Davies, Esq., and Paul B.

Both Plaintiffs and the Banks duly made the requested supplemental submissions, with Plaintiffs arguing that \"\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   and the separate entity rule ... simply [did] not apply at this stage of proceedings where the Plaintiffs [did] not seek to enforce any order against the Banks\" (Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Motion for Default Judgment, dated Aug. 14, 2015 (Dkt. 46), at 2), and the Banks, for their part, contending that Plaintiffs should not be permitted to \"end-run New York's carefully calibrated post-judgment enforcement regime, including the policy-based geographical limitations that are inherent in that regime,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the separate entity rule, by seeking a post-judgment federal asset-freezing injunction of extraterritorial scope\" (Supplemental Submission of Non-Parties [Banks] Pursuant to the Court's Order Dated August 7, 2015, dated Aug 14, 2015 (Dkt. 47), at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   By Order dated August 20, 2017, Judge Scheindlin overruled the Banks' objections to the language that had been proposed by Plaintiffs, finding that \"none [of those objections were] ripe given that the Proposed Default Judgment [was] directed entirely at defendants and [sought] no enforcement against the non-party Banks.\" (Order, dated Aug. 20, 2015 (Dkt. 48), at 2.) With respect to the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   , Judge Scheindlin specifically concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   ... has no effect on the Court's ability to grant the Proposed Default Judgment.

Before entering the contempt order proposed by the Assignee, Judge McMahon inquired at a hearing (attended only by counsel for the Assignee) as to what counsel expected would happen, \"as a practical matter,\" if the requested order were issued. (Transcript proceedings held on Oct. 20, 2017 (Dkt. 65), at 3.) Counsel responded that the order, if issued, would serve as a \"predicate\" to an anticipated turnover proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Judge McMahon then proceeded to sign the 10/20/17 Order, in the form proposed by the Assignee, which, as relevant to the disputes now before the Court, included the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   4.

In their motion (which this Court has permitted BOC to join (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Discussion,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at Section I(A) ) ), the Banks acknowledged that Judge Scheindlin had previously found that their objections to any global asset restraint were not ripe for resolution, but suggested that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   it would be proper for the Court to resolve these issues now because: (1) through the [10/20/17] Order, the Assignee is seeking enforcement of the global asset restraint and discovery provisions against the Banks, and the [10/20/17] Order authorizes third parties affected by the order to move for modification or clarification of the order; and (2) the Subpoenas also implicate the same personal jurisdiction and comity concerns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 4 n.4.) Substantively, the Banks reiterated their earlier argument that the New York \"separate entity rule,\" as discussed by the New York Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   , prohibits a global asset restraint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In response to the Banks' challenge to the asset-restraint provision of the 10/20/17 Order, the Assignee took the position, in its brief, that the 10/20/17 Order, \"same as the Judgment, is directed entirely at Judgment Debtors and seeks no enforcement against the Banks.\" (Assignee Mem., at 9 (citing the paragraphs of the Judgment and the 10/20/17 Order quoted above).) In any event, the Assignee represented that it \"is not currently seeking an order compelling the Banks to turn over their proceeds, simply discovery into the assets that the Banks currently hold for the Judgment Debtors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).) \"As a result,\" the Assignee argued, \"the situation is no different than when Judge Scheindlin previously held that the Banks' arguments were premature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   When this Court then held oral argument with respect to the Banks' motion to quash the Subpoenas and to modify the 10/20/17 Order, this Court sought clarification from both the Banks and the Assignee as to their views as to how the\n   <em>\n    Gucci\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   decisions could be reconciled. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6/25/18 Tr., at 5.) Counsel for the Banks explained his view that, while\n   <em>\n    Gucci\n   </em>\n   \"deal[s] primarily with a subpoena for documents and information,\"\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   \"is a case dealing with a very specific situation of asset restraint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 9.) The Banks' counsel went on to say that, in light of the Assignee's papers in response to the Banks' motion, the Banks had come to understand that the Assignee was not actually seeking to enforce an asset restraint against the Banks at this time, but rather was anticipating that \"further steps would have to be taken\" by the Assignee \"for that to come to pass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 32-33.) With that understanding, the Banks' counsel stated that \"we can probably address those issues [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , regarding the asset restraint] down the road.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 33.) This led this Court to ask, \"Then you don't need that relief at this point[,] and then\n   <em>\n    Motorola\n   </em>\n   doesn't have an impact[?]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Banks' counsel responded, \"I believe the answer to both of those questions is yes, Your Honor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   This Court also heard oral argument from counsel for the Assignee, who confirmed that, although the Banks had \"given [the Assignee] no comfort that they're actually honoring the injunction\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 74), the Assignee, nonetheless, did not \"have any motion to enforce the restraining notice at the [B]anks because [the Assignee]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   ha[d] no information right now that the [B]anks have violated it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 50.) The Assignee made clear that, should the subpoenaed information or other discovered evidence reveal such a violation, the matter would then be presented to the Court, in what this Court described as a likely \"round two.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Subsequent to the oral argument, the Banks and the Assignee made additional submissions to address an inquiry that this Court made to the Banks at the time of the argument. Specifically, after hearing the Assignee's argument that a Hague Convention request would engender substantial delay, this Court asked the Banks to inform it as to whether they would agree to restrain the Judgment Debtors' accounts voluntarily, during the pendency of any Hague Convention requests, so as to mitigate any prejudice to the Assignee that could result from the delay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 74-76.) In their additional submission, the Banks indicated that they would not agree to an asset restraint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   letter to the Court from David G. Hille, Esq., dated Aug. 14, 2018 (Dkt. 130) (reiterating argument that \"Chinese law prohibits the Banks from restraining customer accounts absent a formal direction from a 'competent organ' of the Chinese government to do so,\" and stating that \"no such authorization has been granted at this time\").) In response, the Assignee noted that, in the Banks' submission, \"the Banks c[a]me close to admitting that they have not frozen any of the counterfeiters' assets.\" (Letter to the Court from Robert Weigel, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2018 (Dkt. 132), at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3 (stating that \"the Banks' letter makes clear that the Banks have not taken any action, and will not take any action, to ensure that the counterfeiters' assets are, and will remain, frozen\").) Nonetheless, the Assignee did not alter the position that it had taken at oral argument,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was not seeking, at this time, to enforce the asset restraint as against the Banks, but rather was only seeking to compel the Banks' compliance with the Subpoenas. Indeed, the Assignee primarily argued, in its additional submission, that the Banks' latest statements further demonstrated the drawbacks in proceeding by way of the Hague Convention (\n   <em>\n    see generally id.\n   </em>\n   ), and concluded its submission by merely repeating its request that this Court compel the Banks to produce documents in response to the Subpoenas (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In short, while this Court does not agree with the Assignee that there is essentially no difference between the language contained in the Judgment (which was directed only at Defendants) and that contained in the 10/20/17 Order (which was also expressly directed at third-party financial service providers for the Judgment Debtors), and suspects that the Assignee - whose counsel crafted the language of both - is well aware of the distinction, this is of little moment at this juncture.
