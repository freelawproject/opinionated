(Dkt. 1).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2017. (Dkt. 8-2 at 27). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since October 15, 2012, the alleged onset date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of affective disorder, obesity, and essential tremors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). The ALJ further found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments of diabetes, hypertension, and a history of alcohol abuse were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 11.00 and 12.04 in reaching his conclusion, as well as the effect of Plaintiff's obesity, as required by Social Security Ruling (\"SSR\") 02-1p. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), except that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   is limited to occasional stooping and climbing stairs and ramps; and occasional use of the upper extremities to push, pull, lift and reach overhead, bilaterally.

[Plaintiff] would be limited to the types of low stress jobs that do not require her to complete a fixed number of high volume production quotas or fast-paced assembly line work. Further, she is limited to unskilled work, which is defined as no more than a svp-2 per the\n   <em>\n    Dictionary of Occupational Titles\n   </em>\n   , whereby she would retain the capacity to apply common sense understanding to carry out detailed, but uninvolved written and oral instructions. Additionally, [Plaintiff] is limited to frequent superficial interaction with the general public; can tolerate few or little changes in the work structure; retains the judgment to make simple work-related decisions independently; and would require unimpeded access to the restroom during normally scheduled breaks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31). At step four, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was unable to perform any past relevant work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of photocopy machine operator, mail clerk, and cleaner/housekeeping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 279-80). In the letter, Dr. Garyali stated that the last time she saw Plaintiff was on November 21, 2013, when Plaintiff reported that she was doing \"well,\" that she was addressing issues relating to her tremors, that her flashbacks were \"much less,\" and that she recently drove to Canada for a music\n   event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 281). Dr. Garyali diagnosed Plaintiff with several impairments, including dipolar disorder I, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol abuse.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 393-95). The medical histories recounted in the January 22, 2014 letter and April 22, 2014 letter are similar, and the April 22, 2014 letter does not include any additional significant information relating to Plaintiff's functional capacity. A mental status examination revealed that Plaintiff's speech was \"coherent and relevant\"; there was no evidence of thought disorder, delusions or hallucinations; Plaintiff was alert, and her memory was intact; Plaintiff denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation; and her insight and judgment were \"ok.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 395). Dr. Garyali assessed Plaintiff with several impairments, including bipolar disorder I, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a marked contrast to her prior medical summary letter completed only three months earlier, Dr. Garyali opined that Plaintiff's \"psychiatric condition seriously interferes with her functioning,\" and that she \"cannot stand the stress of a regular job where she has to be at a certain place at a certain time and follow a routine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 396). Dr. Garyali concluded that Plaintiff was \"seriously disabled and will not be able to function in a regular job situation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 29, 2014, Dr. Garyali completed a medical source statement relating to Plaintiff's mental residual functional capacity.

Dr. Garyali assessed Plaintiff as \"seriously limited, but not precluded\" for the following work activities: maintain attention for a two hour segment; maintain regular attendance and be punctual within customary, usually strict tolerances; work in coordination with or proximity to others without being unduly distracted; complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms; accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors; and deal with normal work stress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Garyali also opined that, on average, Plaintiff would be absent from work more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

The ALJ explained that Dr. Garyali had treated Plaintiff since September 2011, and her opinions as to Plaintiff's limitations were not internally consistent with her\n   own findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ pointed specifically to the marked conflict between the January 2014 medical summary and the April 2014 medical summary and August 2014 medical source statement, relating to Dr. Garyali's opinion as to whether Plaintiff was able to function in a work setting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37). The ALJ further noted that Dr. Garyali's later findings that Plaintiff was unable to function in a work setting were contrary to her most recent mental status examination, where Plaintiff presented as pleasant and cooperative, having intact memory, with no suicidal ideations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 395).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court finds that the ALJ adequately set forth his reasons for assigning Dr. Garyali's assessments \"limited weight.\" As explained above, the ALJ explained that Dr. Garyali's opinions relating to Plaintiff's disability were internally inconsistent with her own treatment notes and pointed specifically to conflicting medical summaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Domm v.

The written determination contains a summary of the treatment relationship between Plaintiff and Dr. Garyali, including that Plaintiff began treating with Dr. Garyali in 2011, that Dr. Garyali treated Plaintiff for mental health issues, and that Dr. Garyali continued treating Plaintiff through 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35).

Plaintiff has not identified any gap or ambiguity in the record that could be solved by re-contacting Dr. Garyali. Despite the inconsistencies between the January 2014 and April 2014 medical summaries offered by Dr. Garyali, the ALJ had adequate evidence in the record from which he could properly and thoroughly assess Plaintiff's RFC, including opinion evidence from Look Persaud, M.D., a consultative examiner; opinion evidence from Sarah Long, Ph.D., a consultative examiner; a medical source statement by Nancy Erwin, N.P.P.; and the opinion of L.

In other words, there was abundant medical opinion evidence in the record from which the ALJ could and did assess Plaintiff's RFC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dougherty-Noteboom v.

None of these doctors offered formal opinions on Plaintiff's work-related restrictions, a point Plaintiff concedes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Mar. 4, 2016) (collecting cases holding that a medical provider who has evaluated a patient on only a few occasions does not constitute a \"treating physician\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   However, even if Drs. Segal, Kanchana, and Douenias were considered treating physicians pursuant to the regulations, Plaintiff's statement that the ALJ did not consider their treatment of Plaintiff is incorrect. The ALJ thoroughly discussed Plaintiff's treatment relating to her tremor, including treatment by Drs. Segal, Kanchana, and Douenias, in the written determination. (Dkt. 8-2 at 33). Plaintiff's tremor was assessed as mild but exacerbated by anxiety or talking about the tremor. (Dkt. 8-7 at 286-93, 372-75, 424-27). While Plaintiff reported at her second visit with Dr. Segal on November 19, 2013 that\n   her tremors were \"worsening\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 290), at a more recent visit with Dr. Douenias on March 30, 2015, Plaintiff reported that she \"ha[d] been learning some new coping skills and ha[d] been very active in looking for methods and tools to assist her in her condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 424). Dr. Douenias assessed a benign essential tremor, and because Plaintiff was \"coping better with [her] diagnosis,\" did not make any changes to her medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 425). Based on these treatment notes, the ALJ concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [t]he treatment notes support that [Plaintiff's] essential tremors limited her functional abilities. Though exacerbated by anxiety, clinical findings nonetheless support that her tremors persisted despite medication. However, as noted in her last evaluation [with Dr. Douenias], she was coping better with her diagnosis. Therefore, limitations for no more than occasional pulling, reaching lifting, and reaching overhead, with no more than frequent use of her upper extremities for such movements in all other directions is warranted. Additionally, due to the impact of her tremors on her fine motor skills, a limitation for no more than frequent use of both upper extremities to finger, feel, grasp and handle is also warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Dkt. 8-2 at 33). Accordingly, the written determination is very clear as to how the ALJ assessed Plaintiff's ability to use her upper extremities. The ALJ discussed and considered treatment for Plaintiff's tremor provided by Drs. Segal, Kanchana, and Douenias, and the ALJ's assessment of those records was reasonable, based on other evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff argues that because Drs. Segal, Kanchana and Douenias all found that Plaintiff had a tremor, the ALJ should have afforded their treatment notes \"great weight,\" and imposed \"significant limitations on the plaintiff's ability to perform fine manipulation with her upper extremities.\" (Dkt. 14-1 at 21). Plaintiff's argument misses the mark. The ALJ agreed that the medical evidence, particularly the treatment records of Drs. Segal, Kanchana, and Douenias, revealed that Plaintiff had a tremor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-2 at 33 (\"the treatment notes support that the claimant's essential tremors limited her functional abilities\" and recognizing that Plaintiff's tremors are \"exacerbated by anxiety\"). However, as further discussed above, the ALJ also found that based on other evidence in the record, Plaintiff's tremors did not completely prevent her from performing any type of work. Simply because a claimant has an impairment, even when diagnosed by several medical sources, does not equate to an inability to work under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oakes v. Comm'r of Soc.

Mar. 14, 2017) (\"the standard for disability is not whether a claimant is completely free of symptoms but whether the claimant has symptoms so debilitating as to preclude any substantial gainful activity\"). Here, the ALJ acknowledged that Plaintiff suffered from tremors but, based on medical evidence in the record, concluded that Plaintiff's tremors did not completely preclude her from performing light work with additional limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff makes a passing remark about the opinion of Dr. Persaud, whose opinion she claims \"bolster[s] and support[s]\" the notes of Drs. Segal, Kanchana, and Douenias. (Dkt. 14-1 at 21). Plaintiff does not make any specific argument as to the ALJ's treatment of Dr. Persaud's opinion; however, to the extent Plaintiff challenges the ALJ's assessment of Dr. Persaud's opinion, this argument also fails. Plaintiff underwent a consultative internal medicine examination with Dr. Persaud on December 19, 2013. (\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 294-300). Plaintiff had a normal gait, did not use any assistive devices, and did not appear to be in acute distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 297). Plaintiff did not have any sensory deficit, and her strength was a \"5/5\" in her upper and lower extremities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 299). Plaintiff's hands showed tremors, worse with activities and use, with hand and finger dexterity severely impaired bilaterally for all activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's grip strength was rated at a \"5/5\" bilaterally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Persaud assessed Plaintiff with several impairments, including bilateral essential tremors, severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Persaud opined that Plaintiff had mild restrictions for bending, twisting, and turning, and a marked restriction for fine motor skills of the hands, bilaterally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Persaud further opined that Plaintiff had a moderate to marked restriction for lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling, due to her tremors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The ALJ afforded Dr. Persaud's opinion \"limited weight,\" based on the timing of his examination. (Dkt. 8-2 at 34). Specifically, the ALJ explained that Dr. Persaud's December 2013 evaluation of Plaintiff occurred shortly after she started treatment for the tremors, and more recent treatment records reflect that Plaintiff had a higher level of functioning than assessed by Dr. Persaud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ cited specifically to the March 2015 examination with Dr. Douenias, where Plaintiff reported that she was better coping with her diagnosis.

(Dkt. 8-2 at 34.).

Evaluation of Plaintiff's Expected Absences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, in formulating the RFC determination, the ALJ erred in failing to consider evidence relating to the number of days Plaintiff would be absent from work. (Dkt. 14-1 at 22). Plaintiff points specifically to the opinions of Dr. Garyali and nurse practitioner Erwin (hereinafter, \"N.P. Erwin\"). As noted above, on August 29, 2014, Dr. Garyali completed a one-page medical source statement relating to Plaintiff's mental residual functional capacity. (Dkt. 8-7 at 392). The statement consists of a one-page, fill-in-the-blank document. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On the form, Dr. Garyali checked the box indicating that, on average, Plaintiff would be absent from work more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). There is no explanation as to why or how Dr. Garyali arrived at this conclusion. Similarly, on February 26, 2015, N.P. Erwin, who saw Plaintiff for mental health treatment on three occasions between January and March 2015, completed the same, one page, fill-in-the-blank mental residual functional form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 414). Nurse Erwin also checked the box that indicated that Plaintiff would be absent from work, on average, more than four days per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). N.P. Erwin's treatment notes are a part of the record and are nine pages in length. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 415- 23). The records summarize Plaintiff's history of mental illness, treatment with Dr. Garyali, and Plaintiff's subjective complaints. Mental status examinations performed on January 29, 2015, February 26, 2015, and March 18, 2015, were mostly normal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419, 421, 423). On January 29, 2015, Plaintiff exhibited \"poor to fair\" concentration, with some distractibility and confusion at times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, to the extent Plaintiff argues that the ALJ did not consider or discuss opinions relating to Plaintiff's absences from work, this statement is incorrect. The ALJ specifically noted Dr. Garyali's and N.P. Erwin's opinions relative to Plaintiff's expected absences in the written determination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-2 at 36 (\"Finally, Dr. Garyali indicated that the claimant would likely miss more than four days per month from work due to her impairments\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37 (\"Ms. Erwin finally noted that the claimant would likely miss more than four days of work per month due to her impairments\") ). As noted above at Section II(A), the ALJ did not err in affording limited weight to the conclusions of the August 29, 2014 assessment completed by Dr. Garyali, because those opinions conflicted with Dr. Garyali's own treatment notes and a recent, earlier opinion relating to Plaintiff's ability to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With regard to N.P. Erwin's opinion relating to Plaintiff's absences, the Court notes that nurse practitioners are not \"acceptable medical sources,\" and their opinions are not entitled to any special weight.\n   <em>\n    Young v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-6199L,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202752443\">\n    2018 WL 2752443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2096900\">\n    2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D.N.Y. June 8, 2018). This is particularly true in this case, considering Plaintiff's and N.P. Erwin's limited treatment relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cowley v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525394\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/381/#p383\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383 (W.D.N.Y. 2018) (explaining that amount of weight given to opinions of non-medical sources \"is based, in part, on the examining and treatment relationship\" and the \"length and frequency of examinations....\"). Nevertheless, the ALJ thoroughly discussed N.P. Erwin's February 26, 2015 assessment of Plaintiff and afforded the assessment \"limited weight.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-2 at 37). The ALJ explained that N.P. Erwin \"did not start treating [Plaintiff] until a month before she completed the medical source statement, and, therefore, she did not have the opportunity to develop an established treating relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further noted that while Plaintiff demonstrated\n   minor limitations with memory and focus in her initial examination with N.P. Erwin, the limitations \"seem[ed] to be more heavily based on the claimant's subjective allegations rather than the actual objective clinical findings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ's consideration of the lack of objective clinical findings was proper, as subjective complaints are insufficient to establish disability, particularly when they are not based on any objective medical evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poupore v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3646772\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/303/#p307\">\n    566 F.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (2d Cir. 2009) (ALJ's finding that the plaintiff's subjective complaints of pain were insufficient to establish disability was supported by substantial evidence, where the plaintiff's \"subjective complaints were unsupported by objective medical evidence....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, Dr. Garyali's and N.P. Erwin's opinions relating to Plaintiff's expected absences are not particularly persuasive. Rather, both appear on a one-page, fill-in-the blank form, and are not accompanied by any explanation as to how or why Dr. Garyali or N.P. Erwin arrived at their conclusions. Accordingly, they were of little value to the ALJ on the issue of Plaintiff's expected absences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Camille v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837489\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/104/329/#p341\">\n    104 F.Supp.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341 (W.D.N.Y. 2015) (opinions that are essentially \"form reports composed of checklists and fill-in-the-blank statements,\" are \"by their nature, of limited evidentiary value\"),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350526\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/652/25/\">\n    652 F. App'x 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cowley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525394\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/381/#p383\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ALJ did not err in not fully crediting opinion of social worker, where social worker's opinion was \"based on a brief treatment history,\" and \"largely comprised of a series of check-box findings that were unsupported by an elaboration\"). In sum, the Court finds that the ALJ did not err in his assessment of N.P. Erwin's opinions, considering her limited treatment relationship with Plaintiff and the nature of the evidence at issue. The ALJ therefore did not err in failing to include any limitations regarding expected absences in the RFC finding, contrary to Plaintiff's argument, and remand on this basis is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Evaluation of Plaintiff's Tremors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff's final argument is that the ALJ's evaluation of Plaintiff's tremors is not supported by substantial evidence. (Dkt. 14-1 at 23). In this regard, Plaintiff asks the Court to reverse and remand the decision of the Commissioner solely for the calculation of benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In support of her argument, Plaintiff references the following: three of her treating neurologists have documented Plaintiff's tremors, and noted they increase with Plaintiff's anxiety; Plaintiff has been hospitalized over 18 times for mental health conditions; Plaintiff requires a specialized spoon to eat and a specialized pen to assist with writing; and Plaintiff's primary care provider assessed tremors in August and September 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24). Plaintiff also points to the opinion of Dr. Persaud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff's argument on this point is essentially a restatement of her argument that the ALJ did not properly evaluate the opinions of Drs. Segal, Kanchana, Douenias, and Perasud. As noted above, the ALJ evaluated the treatment records and opinion evidence in the record relating to Plaintiff's treatment for tremors. The objective medical evidence shows that Plaintiff has a mild baseline tremor that is exacerbated by anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 8-7 at 288 (Dr. Segal's examination revealed a \"mild resting tremor\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 292 (although Plaintiff reported that her tremors were getting worse, Dr. Segal assessed an \"unchanged moderate degree of postural tremors,\" and \"no resting tremors\" during the exam);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 374 (exam by Dr. Kanchana revealed that Plaintiff's tremor fluctuates and is mild, but increases when\n   Plaintiff writes or talks about the tremor);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (Dr. Kanchana assessed that Plaintiff's tremor \"appears to be mild at baseline but is greatly exacerbated by anxiety\") ). The ALJ provided good reasons for the extent to which he agreed with, or discounted, the opinions of Drs. Segal, Kanchana, Douenias, and Persaud. In particular, more recent records specific to treatment for Plaintiff's tremors revealed that she was \"coping better with [her] diagnosis,\" and the neurologist did not make any changes to her medications (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 425), a point highlighted by the ALJ in the written determination (Dkt. 8-2 at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff testified extensively about her tremors and treatment for her tremors at the administrative hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-61, 69-70). While Plaintiff has difficulty writing legibly and requires a special spoon to eat, she can drive, dress herself (including putting on her bra and watch) and do some cooking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70). The ALJ found that Plaintiff's ability to perform these activities demonstrates that she is able \"to perform tasks that require a fine degree of motor control with her hands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based on the above-mentioned medical records, opinion evidence, and testimony, the ALJ concluded, \"due to the impact of her tremors on her fine motor skills, a limitation for no more than frequent use of both upper extremities to finger, feel, grasp and handle is ... warranted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). The ALJ also limited Plaintiff to low-stress, non-dangerous jobs, with limited to superficial interaction with the general public - all of which address Plaintiff's anxiety. The ALJ's conclusion that Plaintiff can use her upper extremities to finger, feel, grasp and handle from one-third to two-thirds of the time\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence, particularly the medical records showing that Plaintiff was learning new coping skills for her tremor, and her own testimony relating to her day-to-day application of fine motor skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In deciding a disability claim, an ALJ is tasked with \"weighting] all of the evidence available to make an RFC finding that [is] consistent with the record as a whole\" and the assessed RFC does not need to \"perfectly correspond with any of the opinions of medical sources cited in his decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Matta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147245\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/508/53/#p56\">\n    508 F. App'x at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
