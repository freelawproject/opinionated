INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is an action for several causes under Pennsylvania state law arising from an acrimonious business dispute between Plaintiff, Michael Martin (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Martin\"), and two of his fellow business partners in a medical device company based in Scranton, Med-Dev Corporation (\"Med-Dev\"), Defendants Thomas Finley (\"Finley\") and George Albanese (\"Albanese\"), and the attorney retained purportedly on behalf of Med-Dev, Defendant Amil Minora (\"Minora\") (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Against Finley and Albanese, Martin alleges tortious interference with existing contractual relations, abuse of process, defamation and false light invasion\n   of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"). Martin also alleges abuse of process and IIED against Minora. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) because there is diversity of citizenship between Martin, a Virginia citizen, and the Defendants, who are either Pennsylvania or New Jersey citizens, and the amount in controversy is more than $75,000. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Minora filed a motion to dismiss Martin's Complaint on November 2, 2015. (Doc. 22). The Court referred this motion to Magistrate Judge Carlson for issuance of a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\"). After briefing from the parties, Magistrate Judge Carlson issued an R &amp; R in which he recommended denying Minora's motion with respect to Martin's malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and IIED claims, but granting it with respect to Martin's defamation and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims. (Doc. 60). By memorandum opinion and order dated February 15, 2017, the Court adopted in part and rejected in part the Magistrate Judge's R &amp; R, and in doing so dismissed Martin's claims against Minora for malicious prosecution, defamation and false light, and negligent infliction of emotional distress, leaving claims for abuse of process and IIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 64, 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finley, Albanese, and Moore filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on March 9, 2016. (Doc. 37). This motion was likewise referred to Magistrate Judge Carlson for issuance of an R &amp; R. Magistrate Judge Carlson issued an R &amp; R in which he recommended denying the motion with respect to Martin's tortious interference, unjust enrichment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, defamation, and IIED claims, but granting it with respect to his negligent infliction of emotional distress claim. (Doc. 63). The Court adopted in part and rejected in part the Magistrate Judge's R &amp; R, dismissing the malicious prosecution and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims, but retaining the remaining claims as to those Defendants (tortious interference, abuse of process, defamation/false light, and IIED).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants have filed separate motions for summary judgment with accompanying briefs in support (\"Motion(s)\"). (Docs. 108, 122 (Albanese), 111, 125 (Finley), 116, 123 (Minora) ). Martin has opposed these motions (\"Opposition(s)\"). (Docs. 129 (Opposition to Albanese), 143 (Opposition to Minora), 145 (Opposition to Finley) ). Only Albanese submitted a reply to Martin's Opposition (\"Reply\"). (Doc. 137). Martin did not file a crossmotion for summary judgment against any Defendant. Accordingly, the Motions are ripe for review. Because Defendants have submitted similar or nearly identical statements of purportedly undisputed fact and raise the same arguments in their Motions, and Martin's Opposition to each Motion is likewise mirrored, the Court will consolidate its analysis of the Motions in this Opinion. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' Motions will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except where specifically noted as disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2012, Plaintiff was the sole incorporator of Med-Dev, a Delaware corporation. (Docs. 108 \u00b6 1, 112 \u00b6 1, 117 \u00b6 1). At\n   least part of the reason for the formation of Med-Dev was to distribute \"a novel intra-nasal clip that was intended to serve as a non-antibiotic treatment for nasal methicillin-resistant infections.\" (Doc. 117 \u00b6 2). The initial shareholders of Med-Dev included Plaintiff, Defendant Finley, Defendant Albanese, and several others. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 2, 112 \u00b6 2). Neither Plaintiff nor any of the Defendants invested any money into Med-Dev, as separate investors provided the financial capital. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff served as the initial Chairman of the Board of Directors of Med-Dev (\"Board\"), (Docs. 109 \u00b6 9, 112 \u00b6 9, 117 \u00b6 3), and was \"a Director and Officer of Med-Dev,\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 17, 112 \u00b6 17). His duties \"included attracting investors, distribution of products, sales, testing of the products, and overall direction of the Company.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 10, 112 \u00b6 10, 117 \u00b6 4). Plaintiff never had any other official title at Med-Dev, (Docs. 109 \u00b6 11, 112 \u00b6 11), but he asserts he functionally served as the CEO of Med-Dev at times, \"rais[ing] money and organiz[ing] individuals to do what they needed to do to get things done,\" (Docs. 128 \u00b6 12, 144 \u00b6 12). Finley served as the President of Med-Dev, and \"his duties included taking care of the check books, paying the expenses, balancing the books on a monthly basis, and the operations of the company.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 13, 112 \u00b6 13, 117 \u00b6 5). The members of the Board in 2013 were Plaintiff, Finley, Moore, and William Peters, M.D. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 14, 112 \u00b6 14). Albanese was appointed to the Board on January 16, 2014, (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16), although Plaintiff contends that Albanese resigned from the Board shortly afterwards, (Docs. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Albanese was later appointed Chairman of the Board on April 29, 2014-an appointment later invalidated by the Delaware Chancery Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon forming Med-Dev, Plaintiff adopted a set of bylaws for the company (\"Bylaws\"), (Docs. 109 \u00b6 36, 112 \u00b6 32), although he asserts that they were never formally adopted by the Board, (Docs. 128 \u00b6 36, 144 \u00b6 32). The Bylaws outline the rules governing the conduct of the internal affairs of Med-Dev, although Plaintiff contends that Med-Dev rarely, if ever, followed the Bylaws, stating that \"Med-Dev operated informally and there were no Board Resolutions for any of the actions taken by the Board.\" (Docs. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 39-42, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 35-37). The Bylaws state: \"The business and affairs of the Corporation will be managed by or under the direction of its Board who may exercise all such powers of the Corporation.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 37, 112 \u00b6 33). Authorized committees with designated power and authority can be designated by the Board, upon Board resolution. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 39, 112 \u00b6 35). The Bylaws further state that contracts or transactions between Med-Dev and its Directors or officers \"will not be void or voidable ... solely because the Director or Officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction ..., if\" material facts regarding the Director or Officer's interest are known or disclosed to the Board or authorized committee or shareholders and the contract or transaction is approved by vote of the Board or shareholders, or the contract or transaction is \"fair\" and is otherwise approved by the Board, authorized committee, or shareholders. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 38, 112 \u00b6 34). The Bylaws also state that Board Directors can receive compensation \"for their services and reimbursement for their expenses\" by Board resolution, although a resolution is not needed for compensation paid to Directors \"serving the Corporation in any other capacity.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 41, 112 \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"On December 10, 2012, [Plaintiff] executed a Consulting Agreement 'to render\n   services as Chairman of the Board of Directors' of Med-Dev in return for compensation of $15,000 per month for a three year term commencing January 1, 2013.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 46, 112 \u00b6 41). Finley signed the Consulting Agreement as President of Med-Dev, and Plaintiff signed it as Consultant. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 47, 112 \u00b6 42). Plaintiff's Consulting Agreement prohibited the assignment of the Consultant's rights, duties, or obligations under the Consulting Agreement \"without the prior written consent of [Med-Dev],\" and did not \"provide for any other payments or benefits such as health insurance to be paid to [Plaintiff].\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 55, 58, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 49, 52). The Board never formally voted to approve Plaintiff's Consulting Agreement or the payment of health benefits to Plaintiff. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 48, 52, 59, 62, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 53, 56). However, Plaintiff asserts that the Consulting Agreement was valid because Finley, as Med-Dev's President, signed it, and it was further \"ratified and consented to by Med-Dev through the continued payments of compensation to [Plaintiff] in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.\" (Docs. 128 \u00b6 48, 144 \u00b6 43). Finley and Board Director Peters also were paid monthly compensation by Med-Dev under similar agreements, and these also were not formally approved by the Board. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 64, 122 at 36, 125 at 4, 36, 128 \u00b6\u00b6 38, 43, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 38). The parties dispute whether Plaintiff was paid under the Consulting Agreement solely as Chairman of Med-Dev, or in another role, (Docs. 109 \u00b6 54, 112 \u00b6 48, 128 \u00b6 54 (Plaintiff asserting that compensation \"was for the services he provided for the operation of Med-Dev\"), 144 \u00b6 48 (same) ), but do not dispute that \"[t]he Consulting Agreement specifically states that [Plaintiff] is 'an independent contractor and not an employee of the Company,' \" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 60, 112 \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Arguments about Plaintiff's use of Med-Dev funds began in earnest in late 2013 and into early 2014. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 85, 92, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 77, 84, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12). The parties do not dispute that Plaintiff improperly used $2,500 of Med-Dev funds in 2013 to pay a legal bill to the Mauro Savo law firm that was unrelated to Med-Dev. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 70-74, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 62-66, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 7-11, 128 \u00b6\u00b6 70-74, 142 \u00b6\u00b6 7-11, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 62-66). However, Plaintiff contends that this payment was an honest mistake arising out of confusion regarding the name of what he mistakenly thought was a predecessor LLC to Med-Dev, and that he informed Med-Dev's corporate counsel, Attorney Joseph Tomasek, as soon as he learned of the purported mistake. (Docs. 128 \u00b6 70, 142 \u00b6 7, 144 \u00b6 62). The parties also do not dispute that Plaintiff used Med-Dev funds to pay $8,517 in expenses at a country club that were unrelated to Med-Dev business. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 128 \u00b6\u00b6 75-76, 142 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 67-68). However, the parties dispute the propriety of Plaintiff charging his health insurance premiums to his Med-Dev debit card. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 70-71, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 128 \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, 142 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 70-71). Finley and Albanese and Plaintiff also disagree on the propriety of Plaintiff's directing his fees paid under his Consulting Agreement to an LLC owned by Plaintiff, Scotland Yarns, LLC. (Docs. 109 56-57, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 50-51, 128 \u00b6\u00b6 56-57, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 50-51).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agree that Plaintiff did not separately reimburse Med-Dev for the Mauro Savo legal fees or country club expenses, and that Plaintiff offered to offset the $2,500 in legal fees paid to Mauro Savo against expenses he had not yet\n   turned in to Med-Dev. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 86-87, 112 \u00b6 78-79, 117 \u00b6 13, 17). Plaintiff also claims he offset the $8,517 in country club expenses, and that Med-Dev owed him $52,000 in unpaid consulting fees and unreimbursed expenses by early 2014. (Docs. 128 \u00b6 87, 142 \u00b6 17, 144 \u00b6 79). In his portion of the record, Plaintiff includes a sworn statement from Attorney Tomasek that states that Finley and Albanese did not communicate with Martin about the alleged expenditure issues or discuss the issues at Board meetings that the attended, and that he counseled them to speak with Martin \"so he would have the opportunity to rebut or explain the charges and ultimately resolve the issues.\" (Doc. 144-16 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finley closed Med-Dev's Wells Fargo bank account in January 2014 to prevent Plaintiff from accessing Med-Dev funds, and told him he was closing the account \"because [Plaintiff] was taking consulting fees from it\" and \"because [Finley] thought [Plaintiff] was misappropriating corporate funds.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 91-93, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 83-85). Plaintiff asserts that Albanese was involved in this decision as well. (Doc. 128 \u00b6 91). January 2014 was also the last month that Plaintiff received his monthly consulting fee from Med-Dev. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 66, 112 \u00b6 58). In addition to Finley's actions, Minora was also hired in March 2014 to investigate Plaintiff's use of corporate funds. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 82, 112 \u00b6 74, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). At the time of his hiring, Minora was a Scranton attorney in private practice, but the parties dispute whether he was a former or current prosecutor for the Lackawanna County District Attorney's Office (\"LCDA\"). (Docs. 117 \u00b6 23, 128 \u00b6 110, 142 \u00b6 23, 144 \u00b6 116). Plaintiff asserts that Minora's hiring was not on behalf of Med-Dev, but was rather orchestrated by Defendants Finley, Albanese, and Moore, as Board Director Peters was not aware of Minora's hiring; Plaintiff further asserts that there was no written engagement letter between Med-Dev and Defendant Minora. (Docs. 128 \u00b6 96, 142 \u00b6 21, 144 \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Around this time, Plaintiff \"offered to resign as Director and Chairman of the Board of Med-Dev effective April 19, 2014 contingent on Edward Lipes ('Lipes') and Gregory Rainey ('Rainey') being appointed to the Board.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 21, 112 \u00b6 19). \"At the time of his resignation from Med-Dev on April 19, 2014, [Plaintiff] believed the company had 'gotten dysfunctional,' it was 'heading off a cliff,' and Dr. Moore and Finley had 'gone rogue.' \" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 26, 112 \u00b6 24). Defendants Finley and Albanese and Plaintiff dispute whether the allegations surrounding Plaintiff's unauthorized expenditures were the driving force behind Plaintiff's offer to resign, (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 21, 28, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26), although Plaintiff acknowledges that the allegations were \"distracting Med-Dev from its mission\" and he wanted \"to end the distractions and allow Med-Dev to move forward,\" (Docs. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 21, 28, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26). \"[Plaintiff] signed a written resignation letter April 19, 2014 prepared by Attorney Tomasek that was unconditional.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 22, 112 \u00b6 20). Plaintiff later informed Med-Dev he was retracting his resignation offer because Lipes and Rainey were not appointed to the Board, and the Delaware Chancery Court officially reinstated Plaintiff as a Director on the Med-Dev Board on October 27, 2015, ruling that Attorney Tomasek should have disclosed to Plaintiff that Med-Dev viewed the resignation as unconditional and that Med-Dev did not satisfy the terms of the resignation offer originally presented to Plaintiff. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23). Plaintiff is emphatic that he was not \"forced to resign\" from the Med-Dev Board, (Doc. 128 \u00b6 119), and also notes that he told Finley and Albanese in December 2013, prior to the unauthorized expense issues being raised by Finley, that\n   he was planning to resign in the first half of 2014, (Docs. 128 \u00b6 33, 144 \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Also around the time of Plaintiff's resignation from the Board and his subsequent retraction of the resignation, Defendant Minora's \"investigation\" into Plaintiff's use of corporate funds led to the initiation of a criminal complaint with the LCDA. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 99, 112 \u00b6 91, 117 \u00b6 30). Plaintiff contends that Defendant Minora filed the criminal incident report with the LCDA on behalf of Defendants Finley, Albanese, and Moore, not on behalf of Med-Dev, and that Defendant Minora \"did not conduct any individual factual investigation into [Plaintiff's] use of Med-Dev corporate funds.\" (Docs. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 97, 99, 142 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 89, 91). However, the parties agree that \"[Defendant] Minora reviewed internal Med-Dev documents, he spoke to an attorney at Mauro Savo, he spoke to Attorney Tomasek, and he sent correspondence to the Mauro Savo firm.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 83, 112 \u00b6 75, 117 \u00b6 24). After this review, Defendant Minora spoke with LCDA detectives. (Docs. 109 97-98, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 89-90, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). \" 'Based upon information [Defendant] Finley provided, [LCDA Detective] Bauer obtained two search warrants. The first was to obtain [Plaintiff's] bank records; the second sought Med-Dev's bank records in order to verify what [Defendant] Finley and [Defendant] Minora had reported.\" (Doc. 117 \u00b6 31). LCDA Detective Bauer found, from review of bank records, that Plaintiff had made the improper $2,500 payment to the Mauro Savo law firm. (Doc. 117 \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties vigorously dispute exactly what happened next. All agree that Plaintiff's attorneys at the time contacted the LCDA and Defendant Minora on or about May 27, 2014 to suggest that the criminal investigation be halted to discuss a possible civil settlement between Plaintiff and Med-Dev, and that \"[Plaintiff] authorized his attorneys to try and settle with Med-Dev to avoid possible criminal charges against him.\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 100-101, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 92-93, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35). However, the parties disagree on how settlement negotiations proceeded. Defendants state that [Plaintiff's] attorneys were the ones that proposed that Plaintiff would agree to give up his Med-Dev stock and resign from Med-Dev. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 102, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 94, 106-07, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 41). Plaintiff contends that it was Defendants who pursued this course:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   To the contrary, it was [Defendant] Attorney Minora who indicated to Martin's attorneys that his clients wanted [Plaintiff] out of the Company and if they could achieve this by settlement, his clients would not continue to advocate for [Plaintiff's] criminal prosecution ... [Defendant] Attorney Minora raised the idea of a settlement agreement and volunteered to draft the settlement agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Docs. 142 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 106-07). The parties also dispute whether [Defendant] Minora's August 2014 communication with [Plaintiff's] lawyers constituted a threat that if Plaintiff did not sign the settlement agreement, Defendants would seek criminal charges against Plaintiff, and that Defendants had a corrupt purpose in filing the initial criminal complaint with the LCDA. (Docs. 109 \u00b6\u00b6 104, 110, 128 \u00b6\u00b6 104, 110, 112 \u00b6\u00b6 96, 116, 117 \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, 142 \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 96, 116). The LCDA terminated its criminal investigation in September 2014, and Plaintiff asserts that Defendants tried to get the LCDA to reopen the investigation by going to another assistant district attorney, but were unsuccessful. (Docs. 128 \u00b6 110, 142 \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The relationship between the parties continued to deteriorate. On August 20, 2014, a newsletter (the \"Newsletter\") was sent to at least some of Med-Dev's shareholders,\n   investors, and partners, a portion of which included the following text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Internal Happenings\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 19, 2014, after an extensive internal Investigation into the alleged mishandling/misappropriation of Med-Dev corporate funds, Michael G. Martin was forced to resign as Chairman of the Board &amp; Corporate Officer of Med-Dev. Mr. Martin is no longer associated with Med-Dev and accordingly should not be communicated with to discuss any Med-Dev Corp. business activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Also, William P.

In his Complaint, Plaintiff pleads that Defendants Finley and Albanese, without justification or privilege, interfered with his Consulting Agreement with Med-Dev by closing the Med-Dev Wells Fargo bank account and engaging in other conduct, which led to the loss of $180,000 in consulting fees to which he claims he was entitled. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 109-114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants Finley and Albanese take a sweepingly broad approach in raising five arguments in their Motions against this claim: (1) the Consulting Agreement between Finley and Med-Dev was void from the start because it was never formally approved by Med-Dev's Board; (2) there was no culpable conduct on the part of either Defendant Finley or Albanese, either because they were not involved in the decision to discipline Plaintiff or because Plaintiff made the decision to resign from Med-Dev on his own; (3) there is no third-party in Plaintiff's posited scenario, because Med-Dev and Defendants Finley and Albanese, as Directors of Med-Dev, should be treated as the same party; (4) Plaintiff's claim should be treated as arising from a claim for defamation, which has a one year statute of limitations, and should be time-barred as such; and (5) Plaintiff's claim should be barred by the Gist of the Action doctrine because Plaintiff's cause of action is essentially for breach of the Consulting Agreement, and is not a tort. Each argument fails to convince the Court that summary judgment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    1. VALIDITY OF THE CONSULTING AGREEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants Finley and Albanese challenge the first element of the tort, the existence of a contract, by attacking the validity of the Consulting Agreement. They argue that the undisputed facts establish that the Consulting Agreement is void as an unauthorized \"back-room reciprocity deal\" between Defendant Finley and Plaintiff, never approved by the Med-Dev Board in violation of the Med-Dev\n   Bylaws. (Docs. 122 at 15-16, 125 at 15-16). Plaintiff responds that the Consulting Agreement was signed by Defendant Finley, the President of Med-Dev, on behalf of Med-Dev, and that under relevant Delaware corporate law, Defendant Finley had the authority to enter Med-Dev into the contract with Plaintiff. (Docs. 129 at 4, 145 at 4). Plaintiff also contends that the Consulting Agreement was ratified through conduct because Med-Dev paid Plaintiff for a year, and both parties were performing their obligations under the Consulting Agreement until Defendant Finley and Albanese's wrongful interference. (Docs. 129 at 4, 145 at 4-5). Plaintiff finally notes that Defendant Finley's position is \"completely disingenuous,\" because he was getting paid under a nearly identical contract from Med-Dev. (Doc. 145 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Relying on the Bylaws, Defendant Finley and Albanese's position is essentially that there was no proper offer and acceptance between Med-Dev and Martin with respect to the Consulting Agreement. However, as Plaintiff points out, they cite to no legal authority in support of their position that the apparent failure of the Med-Dev Board to formally approve the Consulting Agreement, pursuant to the Bylaws, renders it void. Instead, the factual record is replete with material disputes that make it impossible for the Court to conclude, as a matter of law, that the Consulting Agreement was not properly offered or accepted by either Med-Dev or Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For example, Plaintiff contends that \"Med-Dev operated informally and there were no Board Resolutions for any of the actions taken by the Board\" such as setting up committees, leasing office space, expenditures, and contracts. (Docs. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 39-42, 144 \u00b6\u00b6 35-37). Indeed, Plaintiff, citing an email from Defendant Albanese, states that the Bylaws themselves were never formally adopted by the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 128 \u00b6 36, 144 \u00b6 32). Thus, whether adherence by the parties and Med-Dev itself to the Bylaws was required is in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, the factual record is murky with respect to the exact nature of Plaintiff's employment with Med-Dev. The Consulting Agreement itself is contradictory, stating that Plaintiff, as \"Consultant,\" is \"an independent contractor and not an employee of [Med-Dev],\" (Docs. 109 \u00b6 60, 112 \u00b6 54), but also that Plaintiff is being retained to act as Chairman of Med-Dev's Board, (Docs. 109 \u00b6 46, 112 \u00b6 41). The parties also dispute whether Plaintiff was paid under the Consulting Agreement solely as Chairman of Med-Dev, or in another role. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 54, 112 \u00b6 48, 128 \u00b6 54 (Plaintiff asserting that compensation \"was for the services he provided for the operation of Med-Dev\"), 144 \u00b6 48 (same) ). As the Bylaws only require formal authorization for the approval of compensation agreements with corporate directors being compensated in their role as directors, (Docs. 109 \u00b6 41, 112 \u00b6 36), it is uncertain that the Bylaws, even if adopted and observed, would apply to Plaintiff and the Consulting Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, although tortious interference with contract requires a \"contract,\" it is not \"necessary that the contract be legally enforceable against the third person ... [because] [a] promise may be a valid and subsisting contract even though it is voidable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. f. Thus, even if there are defenses that the third-party (in this case, Med-Dev) could raise to enforcement of the Consulting Agreement, such as a lack of mutuality in entering the contract, \"until [the third party] does, the contract is a valid and subsisting relation, with which the actor is not permitted to interfere improperly.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057797\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/375/#p384\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties agree that Plaintiff was paid for months in exchange for his work under the Consulting Agreement and then was not paid starting in January 2014. However, no party asserts that the failure of Med-Dev to pay Plaintiff starting in January 2014 was due to Med-Dev contemporaneously declaring the Consulting Agreement to be void due to fatal errors in its formation. Instead, the factual record contains references to a late April 2014 Special Board meeting that may have included discussion of a retroactive termination of the Consulting Agreement, but the basis for a possible retroactive termination is unclear. (Docs. 109 \u00b6 35, 112 \u00b6 31, 112-4 at 14 \u00b6 70). Nor does Med-Dev itself advance the argument now that the Consulting Agreement is void, because Med-Dev is not a party to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In sum, given the tangled web of factual disputes here, Defendant Finley and Albanese have not established, as a matter of law, that the Consulting Agreement was void. Hence, they are not entitled to summary judgment on this ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \" CULPABLE CONDUCT \"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants Finley and Albanese also argue that they did not engage in any \"culpable conduct\" to interfere with Martin's Consulting Agreement with Med-Dev. (Docs. 122 at 16-17, 125 at 17-18). Defendant Finley argues that \"[t]here is no authority to support Martin's claim that the closure of the Wells Fargo account violated any legally cognizable interest of Martin,\" and that \"Finley's legitimate inquiries about Martin's wrongful expenditures, which Martin has admitted of record, do not form a basis for relief against Finley,\" (Doc. 125 at 17-18). Defendant Albanese contends that he was not involved in the closure of the bank account, or the negotiations for Martin's resignation from the company and termination of the Consulting Agreement. (Doc. 122 at 16-17). Both assert that Martin decided to terminate his own contract by voluntarily deciding to resign as Med-Dev Chairman because of the unauthorized expenses issue. (Docs. 122 at 16-17, 125 at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Martin responds that there is a clear dispute of material fact regarding Finley and Albanese's involvement with the decision to close the Wells Fargo bank account, citing emails and testimony from Finley indicating that he discussed closing the account with Albanese and that Finley \"did not act unilaterally in any of these capacities in dealing with any of these issues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 112-3 at 33:11-13, 128-20 at 3, 129 at 5, 145 at 5). Martin further\n   argues that his resignation from the Med-Dev Board in April 2014 is a \"smoke screen\" raised by Finley and Albanese to avoid liability for their tortious interference because the Consulting Agreement was effectively terminated four months earlier with the closure of the Wells Fargo bank account. Further, Martin contends that his resignation was later deemed ineffective by the Delaware Chancery Court because a condition subsequent to Martin's resignation was not fulfilled, i.e., the appointment to the Board of Lipes and Rainey. (Docs. 109-1 at 121-22, 145 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although they are not identified as such, Finley and Albanese's \"culpable conduct\" arguments lump together the remaining elements of tortious interference-purposeful action to interfere with a contract, taken without privilege or justification, that results in actual legal damages.\n   <em>\n    CGB Occupational Therapy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057797\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/375/#p384\">\n    357 F.3d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These arguments fail to convince the Court that the entry of summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, the Court will not rule as a matter of law that the closing of the Wells Fargo bank account, from which Martin withdrew his monthly fee under the Consulting Agreement, is not an actionable interference with a contract. Tortious interference with contract does not have \"a technical requirement as to the kind of conduct that may result in interference... [i]nterference with the third party's performance may be by prevention of the performance... [such as] by depriving him of the means of performance.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. k. Preventing Med-Dev from paying Martin by closing the Wells Fargo account is, on its face, \"depriving [Med-Dev] of the means of performance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9057797\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/375/#p384\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, while Albanese may not have been the individual who personally closed the Wells Fargo bank account, Martin has pointed to material in the factual record that suggests that Albanese was involved in the decision to close the account. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 112-3 at 33:11-13, 128-20 at 3, 129 at 5, 145 at 5). Martin has also pointed to portions of the factual record to support his claim that Finley and Albanese had the aim of pushing him out of Med-Dev, and the Court also takes notice of portions of the record that identify a factual dispute between the parties on this issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 109-2 at 40, 128-13 \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, 128-16 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14-16, 128-34 at 2, 129 at 7, 144-34 at 23:24 to 24:2, 145 at 7-8). This is sufficient to preclude summary judgment on the grounds that Finley and Albanese did not intend to interfere with the Consulting Agreement. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. j (describing that an actor is liable if actions to interfere with contract are taken with the \"primary purpose of interfering with the performance of the contract,\" if the actor \"desires to interfere, or if the actor \"knows that interference is certain or substantially certain to occur\" even if it is not the primary purpose of the action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Further, while a court can rule as a matter of law that an actor is privileged to take an action that would otherwise be unlawful interference with a contract,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dempsey v.

As subsequently discussed,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.3, Martin raises factual disputes regarding whether Finley and Albanese were acting within the scope of their authority when they purportedly took actions to interfere with the Consulting Agreement. Evaluating other potential justifications for interference with a contract, such as Finley's brief reference to his \"legitimate inquiries about Martin's wrongful expenditures,\" (Doc. 125 at 18), are better resolved\n   by a jury and are thus inappropriate for judicial resolution on summary judgment. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767 cmt. I.

While they may dispute the importance of Martin's later proffered resignation in April 2014, the failure of Martin to be paid under the Consulting Agreement starting in January 2014 constitutes \"actual legal damages\" as required by the tort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774A(1)(a) (liability for damages for \"the pecuniary loss of the benefits of the contract\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will deny the entry of summary judgment on these grounds asserted by Finley and Albanese.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3. EXISTENCE OF A THIRD-PARTY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finley and Albanese next raise a legal defense against Martin's tortious interference claim by arguing that they are not \"third parties\" that could have interfered with the Consulting Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, they contend that as corporate officers of Med-Dev, they should be considered the same as Med-Dev. (Docs. 122 at 17-18, 125 at 18-19). They further assert that there is \"no evidence that [either] acted outside the course and scope of his role as a director of Med-Dev.\" (Docs. 122 at 18, 125 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With respect to Albanese, Martin responds that there is a dispute of fact regarding whether \"Albanese was a member of the Med-Dev Board of Directors at all times between January 16, 2014 and April 19, 2014.\" (Doc. 128-3 at 2, 128-4 at 3, 128-16 \u00b6 11, 129 at 5-6). With respect to both Finley and ALbanese, Martin further argues that there is a dispute of fact regarding whether each was acting within the scope of his authority as a director of Med-Dev when both took actions to allegedly interfere with Martin's Consulting Agreement. (Docs. 129 at 6-8, 145 at 6-9). Martin points to portions of the factual record to support his assertion that both Finley and Albanese \"acted with personal animus\" and \"contrary to Med-Dev's interest\" because they knew or should have known that Martin was paid his consulting fees from the Wells Fargo account to Martin's company, Scotland Yarns, LLC, and that Finley was aware that the payment to Mauro Savo was a mistake and that Martin offered to rectify the situation by offsetting the payment against fees he was owed.

The Court rejects Martin's argument that there is a dispute of fact with respect to whether Albanese was a member of the Board starting in January 2014, as this was an issue previously decided in the Delaware Chancery Court matter. (Doc. 109-1 at 125, 127-28). In that matter, Martin also argued that \"at some point after his January 16 appointment, Albanese resigned from the Board.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125).

Because the statute of limitations for defamation in Pennsylvania is one year,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Pa.%20Stat.%20and%20Cons.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%205523\">\n    42 Pa.

(Docs. 129 at 8-9, 145 at 9-10). Martin states that his tortious interference claim is based on \"substantially different conduct [than his defamation claim], conduct that is irrelevant to the defamation claim and that started prior to the defamation and ended after the defamation.\" (Docs. 129 at 9, 145 at 10). Martin alludes to specific conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   It includes Finley's mission to expel Martin from the Company to hide his own incompetence, Finley's recruitment of Albanese, Moore, and Minora, to assist him in that pursuit, the Defendants' actions in closing the Med-Dev bank account at Wells Fargo Bank-thereby ceasing all consulting payments owed to Martin under the Agreement and effectively terminating his consulting contract, and Defendants refusal to turn over operating and financial records to the company after Martin's return to the Board in 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (Docs. 129 at 9, 145 at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court agrees with Martin that his tortious interference and defamation claims are distinct, and, thus, his tortious interference claim is not time-barred.

GIST OF THE ACTION DEFENSE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In their final argument against Martin's tortious interference claim, Finley and Albanese raise a \"gist of the action\" defense and assert that Martin's claim is actually for breach of contract of the Consulting Agreement and is not a tort claim. (Docs. 122 at 21-23, 125 at 21-23). They contend that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Martin's claim is a disguised breach of contract action due to Med-Dev's failure to pay him any consulting fees since January 2014 ... [and] is also an attempt to pierce the corporate veil and impose liability against a select group of directors (3 out of 6), who served in 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Docs. 122 at 22, 125 at 22-23). They note that the Delaware Chancery Court found that the reason that Martin agreed to resign from Med-Dev in April 2014 was due to misrepresentations by Med-Dev's counsel, Attorney Tomasek, and that Martin should have sued Med-Dev for breach of the Consulting Agreement instead of them for tortious interference. (Docs. 122 at 22, 125 at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In response, Martin argues that he \"did not allege a breach of contract claim against any of the Defendants in this action simply because he did not have a contract with any of the Defendants.\" (Docs. 129 at 10, 145 at 11). Martin further states that he did not sue other members of the Med-Dev Board because he did not believe that they \"participated in, or had knowledge of, the personal attack the Defendants were plotting and executing against him.\" (Docs. 129 at 10, 145 at 11). Finally, Martin posits that applying the gist of the action doctrine to his tortious interference claim should result in a finding that the claim is \"a stand-alone claim that does not arise solely from the contract\": \"[w]hile Med-Dev had contractual\n   obligations to pay Martin his monthly consulting fees under the Agreement, the substance of Martin's tortious interference claims are not that Med-Dev failed to meet these obligations, but rather that the Defendants, intending to harm Plaintiff, interfered with the Agreement, without justification or privilege, and caused Martin to suffer damages.\" (Docs. 129 at 11, 145 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \"Pennsylvania courts apply the gist of the action doctrine 'to ensure that a party does not bring a tort claim for what is, in actuality, a claim for a breach of contract.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bull Int'l, Inc. v.

In this regard, the substance of the allegations comprising a claim in a plaintiff's complaint are of paramount importance, and, thus, the mere labeling by the plaintiff of a claim as being in tort, e.g., for negligence, is not controlling. If the facts of a particular claim establish that the duty breached is one created by the parties by the terms of their contract-i.e., a specific promise to do something that a party would not ordinarily have been obligated to do but for the existence of the contract-then the claim is to be viewed as one for breach of contract. If, however, the facts establish that the claim involves the defendant's violation of a broader social duty owed to all individuals, which is imposed by the law of torts and, hence, exists regardless of the contract, then it must be regarded as a tort. Although this duty-based demarcation was first recognized by our Court over a century and a half ago, it remains sound, as evidenced by the fact that it is currently employed by the high Courts of the majority of our sister jurisdictions to differentiate between tort and contract actions. We, therefore, reaffirm its applicability as the touchstone standard for ascertaining the true gist or gravamen of a claim pled by a plaintiff in a civil complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276636,6893278\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/106/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276636,6893278\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/106/48/\">\n    at 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).

First, unlike the cases cited by Finley and Albanese where the gist of the action doctrine was found to apply, here, one of the contracting parties, Med-Dev, is not a named party in this lawsuit. This negates the concern raised by Finley and Albanese, and cited by Pennsylvania courts, that \"[t]o permit a promisee to sue his promisor in tort for breaches of contract\n   <em>\n    inter se\n   </em>\n   would erode the usual rules of contractual recovery and inject confusion into our well-settled forms of actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Constr.

Finley and Albanese contend that Martin's pleading strategy-naming them as defendants instead of Med-Dev-is based on a fiction, (Docs. 122 at 22-23, 125 at 22-23), and that \"in this situation, the directors and company should be viewed as one and the same,\" (Doc. 137 at 8). However, as previously discussed, Martin has pointed to material in the factual record to support his claim that it was not Med-Dev that breached the contract, but rather Finley and Albanese, as third parties operating outside the scope of their authority, who interfered with full execution of the contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 109-2 at 40, 112-1 at 43:17-23, 128-13 \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, 128-16 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14-16, 128-34 at 2, 129 at 7, 144-34 at 23:24 to 24:2, 145 at 7-8). While Martin perhaps could have brought a breach of contract action directly against Med-Dev, in factual circumstances such as these, where the inner-workings of an apparently informally-run, small, private corporation are highly disputed, the Court cannot rule as a matter of law that he should have pursued his lawsuit in that fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 cmt. v (\"The fact that the plaintiff has an available action for breach of contract against the third person does not prevent him from maintaining an action under the rule stated in this Section against the person who has induced or otherwise caused the breach.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Secondly, the duty here alleged to have been breached by Finley and Albanese is one that is \"a broader social duty owed to all individuals, which is imposed by the law of torts and, hence, exists regardless of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276636,6893278\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/106/48/\">\n    106 A.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

All Defendants argue that Martin's abuse of process claim is barred by collateral estoppel because it was essentially denied in Martin's previous Delaware Chancery Court suit. (Docs. 122 at 26-27, 123 at 14-16, 125 at 26-28). Finley and Albanese also attempt to shift responsibility to Minora and argue that it was he, not they, who initiated the criminal complaint with the LCDA, and thus, they have not engaged in a \"definite act or threat\" as\n   required by the tort. (Docs. 122 at 24, 125 at 24-25). Additionally, Finley, Albanese, and Minora argue that the procurement of the legal process, which included the search warrants issued by the LCDA, was not improper, and that it was not intended to coerce Martin to give up his Med-Dev shares. (Docs. 122 at 24-25, 123 at 12-14, 125 at 25-26). The Court will address each argument in turn, and will deny the entry of summary judgment on Martin's abuse of process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    1. COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL/ISSUE PRECLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   All Defendants argue that Martin's abuse of process claim is barred by collateral estoppel (issue preclusion), because it was an issue that was litigated and decided in Martin's previous Delaware Chancery Court case. They argue that \"[t]he Delaware Chancery Court held Martin is not entitled to an award of legal fees based on the actions of Med-Dev and Finley during the LCDA investigation.\" (Docs. 122 at 27, 125 at 27). Minora further contends that \"[t]he Delaware Chancery Court denied Martin's claim that Med-Dev and Finley acted in bad faith by proposing a settlement under which they would drop the criminal charges against Martin in exchange for a relinquishment of his interest in the company.\" (Doc. 123 at 15). Martin responds that Defendants do not satisfy any of the elements of issue preclusion, most notably that the issue of the impropriety of the LCDA investigation was only considered for the purposes of fee shifting and that discovery has revealed essential documents that \"were previously withheld in the Chancery Court matter.\" (Docs. 129 at 14-15, 143 at 8-10, 145 at 15-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As previously stated, the Court must look to Delaware issue preclusion doctrine in evaluating the parties' arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.3.

First, the Delaware Chancery Court did not determine the precise issue that is contested by the parties in the instant matter, the Defendants' abuse of process during the LCDA investigation, because the Chancery Court's consideration of the LCDA investigation never resulted in that ultimate finding. As Martin points out, the Delaware Chancery Court's consideration of Finley's conduct in the LCDA investigation and during settlement negotiations was solely for the purpose of determining whether Finley's conduct constituted \"bad faith\" for purposes of awarding attorneys' fees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 109-1 at 126-27). The Chancery Court explicitly stated that \"bad faith\" only applies to \"conduct taken during litigation rather than before it commences.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126). Neither the LCDA nor Finley commenced litigation against Martin for his purported criminal acts regarding the diversion of Med-Dev funds. Thus, the Chancery Court's subsequent and extended discussion of Finley's conduct during the LCDA investigation, which could bear upon a determination whether such conduct constituted an abuse of process, was dicta: \"\n   <em>\n    Even if the bad faith exception to the American Rule did permit fee-shifting based on pre-litigation conduct\n   </em>\n   , however, Defendants' complained-of actions here do not rise to the level of bad faith sufficient to justify an award of attorneys' fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-27) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Further, the Chancery Court decided the issue under a different, higher evidentiary standard than is before the parties in this action. The Chancery Court applied to Martin \" 'the stringent evidentiary burden of producing clear evidence of bad-faith conduct.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Marra v. Brandywine Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   , C.A. No. 5574-VCN,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204847083\">\n    2012 WL 4847083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Del. Ch. Sept. 28, 2012) ). Here, Martin must prove his abuse of process claim under the traditional civil litigation burden of proof, preponderance of the evidence. Applying issue preclusion in these circumstances would be inappropriate, and so the Court will deny the entry of summary judgment of the abuse of process claim on the grounds that it is barred by issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    2. INVOLVEMENT OF FINLEY AND ALBANESE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finley and Albanese next contend that Martin has no evidence that they \"supplied any information to the LCDA, let alone false information. Rather, Minora initiated the criminal investigation of Martin on behalf of the corporation.\" (Docs. 122 at 24, 125 at 24-25). Albanese further argues that he was even less involved in the LCDA investigation than Finley, pointing to the absence of his name in the LCDA Incident Report as a source of information\n   for the criminal complaint and that \"there is no evidence that Albanese directed Finley or Minora on what information to supply to the LCDA.\" (Doc. 122 at 24). Finley and Albanese thus urge the Court to conclude that they did not engage in any \"definite act or threat,\" as required by the tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Martin responds that there are \"numerous questions of fact that preclude summary judgment on the part of any Defendants in this matter.\" (Doc. 145 at 13). He points to evidence in the record to identify factual disputes regarding Albanese's involvement with the decision to hire Minora, and the involvement of Albanese and Finley in conjunction with Minora with respect to the decision to allegedly threaten Martin with criminal charges to get him to sign the settlement agreement and give up his interest in Med-Dev. (Docs. 112 \u00b6 108, 112-3 at 13:14-22, 23:16-24:8, 32:16-33:20, 128-21, 128-23 at 2, 128-25, 128-27 at 87:16-88:2, 89:13-16, 89:23-90:17, 128-28, 129 at 12-13, 145 at 13-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court finds that Martin has raised disputes of material fact to preclude granting summary judgment on Finley and Albanese's proposed grounds that they were not involved in a \"definite act or threat.\" The Court also notes that Finley and Albanese's argument misconstrues the \"definite act or threat\" in question here, which is not the initial filing by Minora of a criminal complaint with the LCDA, but rather the alleged abuse of the legal process by using the threat of an arrest to extort a settlement from Martin. In its previous opinion adopting in part and rejecting in part Magistrate Judge Carlson's Report and Recommendation on Minora's Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. 64), the Court addressed this issue. While referencing only Minora, the reasoning also applies to Finley and Albanese:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   As Plaintiff admits, the abuse of process claim began to accrue against Defendant Minora personally when Defendant Minora himself used the threat of the criminal proceedings as a means of coercing Martin to enter into a civil settlement.\" (Doc. 62, at 4). Thus, it is the final event, the use of the ongoing criminal investigation to leverage a favorable civil settlement, that, when applied in conjunction with the prior allegations, sufficiently alleges a perversion of process; i.e. the improper use of the criminal complaint and subsequent search warrants to achieve the allegedly unlawful and unethical objective of extracting a civil settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   (Doc. 64 at 3-4). As Martin has pointed to disputes in the factual record over the involvement of Finley and Albanese in the alleged threat, the Court will deny summary judgment on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    3. LEGITIMATE OBJECT OF THE PROCESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   All Defendants next argue that there was no abuse of process because there was no improper use of the process, as they contend they were not using it to seek to extort Martin. Rather, they were seeking an independent investigation by the LCDA to determine if Martin had engaged in criminal conduct. (Docs. 122 at 24-25, 123 at 12-13, 125 at 25-26). They contend that the undisputed facts show that Martin had used Med-Dev funds without authorization, and that Martin raised the idea of agreeing to resign from Med-Dev in exchange for his entire interest in the company. (Docs. 122 at 24-25, 123 at 13, 125 at 25-26). Minora separately argues that there is no evidence that he \"attempted to use his prior employment with the LCDA to sway the outcome of the LCDA investigation or to threaten Martin to give up his ownership interest in Med-Dev.\" (Doc. 123 at 13). Finley and Albanese also argue that \"[a] judicial privilege extends to statements\n   made to law enforcement for the purpose of initiating a criminal investigation.\" (Docs. 122 at 25, 125 at 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Martin responds that \"the case at bar represents a textbook example of abuse of process by way of extortion.\" (Docs. 129 at 11, 143 at 4, 145 at 12). He states that evidence in the factual record indicates that all Defendants acted improperly in bringing the criminal complaint and using it as leverage to extract a settlement from him. Specifically, he points to Minora's deposition testimony, which he contends establishes that Minora did not do a detailed investigation before contacting the LCDA, (Doc. 117-7 at 7:17-8:15, 142-8 at 32:13-34:1, 44:5-19, 143 at 5-6), and other material in the record to support his claim that Finley and Albanese hired Minora with the intent of improperly using Minora's current or past connection with the LCDA to strengthen their purportedly unfounded case against Martin, (Docs. 128-24 at 37:5-10, 128-25, 128-28, 129 at 12, 142-13 at 46:21-47:4, 145 at 13). He further asserts that Minora played a key role in the abuse of process, by \"indicat[ing] to Martin's counsel that Finley, Albanese, and Moore wanted Martin out of the Company and they wanted a stock transfer whereby Martin would relinquish all his stock in Med-Dev,\" (Doc. 143 at 6-7), and that Minora told Martin's counsel that, in exchange, his clients would be willing to stop advocating for Martin's criminal prosecution. (Doc. 117-9 at 23:24-24:5, 142-13 at 28:9-21, 32:18-33:6, 35:4-7). He states that it was Defendants, through Minora, who drafted the settlement agreement that falsely stated that the LCDA believed that probable cause existed to charge Martin with criminal conduct, and that it was Defendants who used the threat of such criminal prosecution to coerce Martin to enter into the settlement agreement, despite knowing of the weakness of their case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docs. 128-25, 129 at 13, 142-12 at 58:22-59:24, 142-13 at 35:14-21, 43:1-11, 142-14 at 3, 143 at 7-8, 145 at 14-15). Martin summarizes his view of the facts in his Opposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   At no time did Albanese, Finley, Moore, or Minora attempt to do any proper investigation, offer Martin any chance to explain or justify expenses, nor did they\n   seek reimbursement; rather, they sought to compel Martin to forfeit his role, his fees and his shares of stock in the Company or they were going to bring criminal charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   (Doc. 143 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Court will not grant the entry of summary judgment on Defendants' arguments that the criminal investigation was initiated and conducted with a proper purpose that is not an abuse of process. While the parties apparently agree that Martin did, on at least two occasions, improperly use Med-Dev funds, the Court finds that Martin has identified numerous factual disputes raised with respect to the use of an alleged threat of criminal prosecution to coerce Martin into signing the settlement agreement. There are numerous disputed issues of material fact that remain for trial, including: the true origins of the decision to go to the LCDA to file the criminal complaint and the motivations of Finley and Albanese, to the extent they made that decision; Minora's knowledge of Finley and Albanese's motivations; and the sequence and nature of the settlement discussions between the parties, including who initiated and broached the idea of a civil settlement as a means of resolving the criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Additionally, as Magistrate Judge Carlson previously noted in his R &amp; R addressing Finley and Albanese's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (Doc. 63):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   [W]e note that threatening a meritless criminal prosecution for the sole purpose of gaining leverage in a civil settlement is an ethically problematic practice which has been condemned by courts in the past.\n   <em>\n    Realuyo v.

Mar. 17, 2006). Moreover, this practice has been considered by state and county bar associations in Pennsylvania and is viewed as violative of Pennsylvania's standards of professional conduct.\n   <em>\n    Guidance Opinion Number\n   </em>\n   88-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988%20WL%20236401\">\n    1988 WL 236401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (1988) (\"the Committee is of the opinion that letters from lawyers threatening criminal prosecutions are inappropriate and that the tenor of the Rules prohibit them.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   (Doc. 63 at 27-28). Martin points to the communication from Defendants to his counsel seeking his signature on the settlement agreement: \"Mr. Martin has five days to accept or reject this agreement as is. Failing that Med-Dev intends to seek criminal charges against Mr. Martin.\" (Doc. 142-14 at 3, 145 at 12-13). The Court cannot say that no reasonable juror could find it constitutes an improper threat of criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, Finley and Albanese's argument that the statements made to the LCDA to initiate the criminal investigation are judicially privileged again miss the thrust of Martin's argument, which is that the legal process was abused by Defendants when they threatened criminal prosecution in an attempt to extort a settlement. Accordingly, the Court will deny summary judgment on these grounds, and Martin's abuse of process claim survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     DEFAMATION/FALSE LIGHT (COUNT IV - DEFENDANTS FINLEY AND ALBANESE)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finley and Albanese argue for summary judgment on Martin's fourth claim for defamation and false light invasion of privacy for publication of the August 2014 Newsletter and January 2015 Manifesto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will deny summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \"Under Third Circuit jurisprudence, the Court must apply a two-step approach when presiding over a defamation action.

Finley contends that Med-Dev was the entity that made the statements. (Doc. 125 at 29). Martin responds by pointing to evidence in the factual record to attempt to raise factual disputes on this issue, including an August 2014 email from Finley to investors stating that a newsletter is attached and being sent \"on behalf of the Board of Directors &amp; management of Med-Dev Corp.\", (Doc. 112-4 at 58), and an email from Albanese that appears to indicate that he reviewed a draft of the newsletter, (Doc. 109-2 at 141).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   None of the parties cite to any legal authority to state what constitutes \"publication\" under Pennsylvania defamation law.

In addition to direct publication, publication can also be procured, which requires the plaintiff to show that the \"third party-defendant directed or participated in the publication of the defamatory publication by another ...

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Ertel\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found that there was not publication by procurement with respect to the defendant writer of an allegedly defamatory report because the defendant did not take affirmative action to direct or participate in the decision of a newspaper to publish the report, \"he merely failed to hinder its publication\" after the newspaper reported contacted him and the defendant said \" 'I don't care what you do with [the report].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463562,463532,7867892,7867966\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/674/1038/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"463562,463532,7867892,7867966\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/674/1038/\">\n    at 1043-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In that case, the Court analyzed allegedly defamatory statements made by the School District's Deputy Chief Communications Officer to the Philadelphia Enquirer on behalf of the School District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. The plaintiff cited evidence that showed that the Deputy Chief Communications Officer, Deputy Superintendent, and Chief Communications Officer communicated by email regarding a response to the newspaper article that contained the allegedly defamatory statements, and that the Deputy Chief Communications Officer \"had only been on the job for three weeks ... and would not have made the statements on behalf of the School District without direction from her supervisor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \"By its nature, the question of whether there has been publication by the defendant is a question of fact for the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Agriss v.

The Court finds that Martin has raised a genuine factual dispute with respect to Finley and Albanese's involvement with publication of the Newsletter and the Manifesto such that they either directly published the statements or procured their publication. Martin points to evidence in the record suggesting that the two traded drafts and exchanged comments on both the Newsletter and Manifesto. With respect to Albanese's role, Albanese sent an email to Finley in January 2015 purportedly regarding the Manifesto in which he advised an addition to it; \"I think we should mention Martin's - Nelcon folly and it's [sic] cost including legal fees resulting from his unilateral and cavalier decision making management style.\" (Doc. 128-29 at 4). A dispute with Nelcon is subsequently mentioned in the final version of the Manifesto. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 109-2 at 134-35). Martin also points to an email from Albanese suggesting that he reviewed a draft of the Newsletter. (Doc. 109-2 at 141). And Martin also points to Finley's deposition testimony, where Martin asserts Finley testified that he did not act unilaterally with respect to any issues involving the discipline and ouster of Martin. (Doc. 112-3 at 33:11-13). Therefore, at the very least, Martin has raised a factual dispute with respect to whether Albanese \"procured\" the publication of the Newsletter and Manifesto from Finley, similar to the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Byars.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Finley's attempt to characterize the Newsletter and Manifesto as having been published by Med-Dev rather than him is also unavailing. While his analysis of the issue is sparse, Finley's stratagem appears to be framing the publication of the Newsletter and Manifesto to the Court as one of improper\n   <em>\n    respondeat inferior\n   </em>\n   , where the agent (Finley) is being held responsible for the actions of the principal (Med-Dev).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Hoffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"296175\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/972/308/#p314\">\n    972 F.Supp. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314 (E.D.

However, as previously discussed, Martin has raised a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Finley and Albanese were acting within the scope of their authority as corporate directors when they purportedly engaged in tortious conduct against Martin. Thus, there is a dispute over whether it was really Med-Dev, the corporation, acting through Finley and Albanese as its agents, when actions were taken to close the Wells Fargo bank account, seek Martin's departure from the Board, and publish the Newsletter and Manifesto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Nevertheless, even if Finley and Albanese were acting within the scope of their authority when publishing the Newsletter and Manifesto, \"[a] corporate officer is individually liable for the torts he personally commits and cannot shield himself behind a corporation when he is an actual participant in the tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Donsco, Inc. v.

Here, in the case of a small corporation that seems to have operated relatively informally, with numerous factual disputes as to the purported involvement of Finley and Albanese in taking actions against Martin, summary judgment is particularly inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As a result, the Court will deny Finley and Albanese summary judgment on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    2. TRUTH OR PRIVILEGE DEFENSE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Finley and Albanese next argue that the statements in the Newsletter are substantially true or privileged. They contend that the allegedly defamatory statement in the Newsletter, that Martin was \"forced to resign\" from Med-Dev's Board after an \"extensive internal investigation into the alleged mishandling/misappropriation of Med-Dev corporate funds\" is substantially true because they state that \"Martin admits that he would not have resigned but for Finley pushing the issue of his unauthorized expenses.\" (Docs. 122 at 30, 125 at 30). They also argue that they were conditionally privileged to make the alleged defamatory statements as corporate directors of Med-Dev acting in Med-Dev's interest because the statements \"concerned allegations of wrongdoing by Martin as Chairman of Med-Dev, which could affect the shareholders and investors.\" (Docs. 122 at 31-32, 125 at 30-31). Finley and Albanese do not address the Manifesto, which contain additional alleged defamatory statements, including that Martin improperly failed \"to disclose his indictment, arrest and arraignment for Theft by Deception in Bergen County NJ on Thursday May 7, 2009\" before entering into the Consulting Agreement. (Doc. 109-2 at 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Martin responds that Finley and Albanese had knowledge that the statements in the Newsletter and Manifesto were false. (Docs. 129 at 17-19, 145 at 18-20). In particular, Martin points to an email chain between Defendants where they discussed a possible retraction of \"a prior statement that Martin was 'forced to resign.' \" (Doc. 128-33 at 4). Martin also argues that Finley and Albanese acted with personal animus against Martin, outside the scope of their authority as corporate directors of Med-Dev, and against Med-Dev's interest, making their defamatory statements unprivileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   (Docs. 128-32 at 2, 4, 129 at 19, 145 at 18);\n   <em>\n    see also supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Truth is an affirmative defense to defamation. 42 Pa.

As an initial matter, Finley and Albanese do not address the statements in the Manifesto, and so they cannot assert the affirmative defense of truth with respect to those statements. However, with respect to the Newsletter, their contention that Martin has admitted that he was essentially \"forced to resign\" from Med-Dev exists in a contentious factual record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finley and Albanese's argument here hinges on Martin's characterization of his April 2014 resignation in the Complaint as an admission that he was forced to resign from the Med-Dev Board because of the unauthorized expenses issue: \"By April 2014, Martin recognized that Defendants' false allegations [about his expenses] were distracting the company from its mission. To end the distractions and allow Med-Dev to move forward, Martin agreed to resign from the company contingent on Edward Lipes and Gregory Rainey being appointed to the Board.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 45-46). However, Martin asserts that his decision to resign was not made in response to the allegations, in the sense that he was admitting that they were true. (Docs. 128 \u00b6 21, 144 \u00b6 19). Instead, Martin asserts in his deposition testimony that he resigned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Because the company had gotten dysfunctional. Dr. Moore and Finley had gone rogue. Dr. Moore was conducting a study on his own and wouldn't disclose the protocols of that study to either Dr. Peters or myself. I asked Finley, what were the protocols and he wouldn't tell me. The company was heading off a cliff and I said the only way to save this company was for Lipes and Rainey to join the board and for me to resign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (Doc. 109-1 at 69:20-70:4). Additionally, he asserts that he was already planning to resign from Med-Dev prior to Finley raising the unauthorized expense issue and closing the Wells Fargo bank account, pointing to an email he sent to Finley and Albanese in December 2013 that indicates that he was planning to resign in the first half of 2014. (Docs. 128 \u00b6 33, 128-8, 144 \u00b6 26). The Manifesto also references this plan: \"Prior to April 19, 2014, MARTIN stated his intention to resign in emails dated December 27 &amp; 30, 2013.\" (Doc. 109-2 at 130). Viewed through the eyes of Martin and in context, the statement in the Newsletter is arguably defamatory, because it could imply that he was admitting his guilt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    Internal Happenings\n   </em>\n   On April 19, 2014, after an extensive internal Investigation into the alleged mishandling/misappropriation of Med-Dev corporate funds, Michael G. Martin was forced to resign as Chairman of the Board &amp; Corporate Officer of Med-Dev. Mr. Martin is no longer associated with Med-Dev and accordingly should not be communicated with to discuss any Med-Dev Corp. business activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   Also, William P. Peters, MD, PhD resigned as an Independent Board member and as CEO. Dr. Peters continues to remain a founding member of Med-Dev.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   (Doc. 112-4 at 61). The Court also notes that at the time the Newsletter was published in August 2014, Martin asserts he had already withdrawn his offer to resign from the Board. (Docs. 109-1 at 114, 128 \u00b6 24, 128-6). Given the extensive factual disputes on this issue, the Court cannot rule as a matter of law that the Newsletter was \"substantially true\" with respect to the statements regarding Martin's resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Finley and Albanese also cannot avail themselves of conditional privilege, an affirmative defense to defamation under Pennsylvania law. 42 Pa.

While the Court was reluctant to dismiss Martin's IIED claim earlier in this litigation, the further development of the factual record at the summary judgment stage has convinced the Court that the alleged misconduct of Defendants does not satisfy Pennsylvania's strict requirements for an IIED claim. Martin's case against Defendants arose out of a business dispute in which the parties accused each other of misconduct, and does not present the circumstances under which Pennsylvania courts have previously found outrageous conduct to support an IIED claim.

However, the\n    <em>\n     Genger\n    </em>\n    Court noted that it was only doing so because the higher burden of proof was imposed by the previous court as a sanction for spoliation of evidence and contempt of court. Thus, allowing the defendant to claim issue preclusion in the new matter would have been rewarding him for his prior bad conduct and would essentially have rendered the previous sanction nugatory.\n    <em>\n     Genger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20603164\">\n     2013 WL 603164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *15. Those unique circumstances do not apply here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    In his Responses to Defendants' Statements of Undisputed Material Facts, Martin cites Fed. R. Evid. 408 to argue that the Court should not consider the settlement negotiations between the parties. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. 128 \u00b6 102). The Court is puzzled by Martin's position, as he has put the settlement negotiations front and center in his arguments surrounding his abuse of process claim. Indeed, in the Delaware Chancery Court action, Martin sought to introduce settlement-related evidence in order to prove his bad faith claim regarding the LCDA investigation. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 109-1 at 115 n.53). The Delaware Chancery Court properly allowed the settlement evidence, and the Court will do so here. The Rule 408 prohibition is cabined to prevent introduction of settlement evidence only to \"prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.\" Fed. R. Evid. 408(a). The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 408 emphasize that it does not bar introduction of settlement evidence when \"the claim is based upon a wrong that is committed during the course of settlement negotiations.\" Fed.

Additionally, Rule 408 allows the Court to admit settlement negotiation evidence if it is admitted for the purpose of \"proving a witness's bias or prejudice.\" Fed. R. Evid. 408(b). As this is the crux of Martin's claim-that Defendants improperly conducted and used the settlement talks and offers as an unlawful threat against Martin and are now claiming that they did not do so-the Court will reject Martin's argument that it cannot consider the negotiations in its evaluation of the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    The Court notes that Martin styled his defamation claim as one for defamation, defamation per se, libel, and false light, although in his Oppositions to Finley and Albanese's Motions, he only specifically addresses the defamation claim. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 133-51).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Finley and Albanese also make an argument with respect to the possible award of punitive damages for Martin's defamation claim, contending that Martin cannot prove \"actual malice,\" knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth, to support punitive damages. (Docs. 122 at 33, 125 at 32-33). The Court will subsequently address this argument in conjunction with Finley and Albanese's later contention that punitive damages should not be allowed with respect to any of Martin's claims.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Section IV.E. However, the Court notes that Finley and Albanese's argument regarding punitive damages for defamation incorrectly conflates the term \"actual malice,\" required to be shown by public figures seeking recovery in a defamation action, with \"common law malice\" required under Pennsylvania law to establish punitive damages for defamation.\n    <em>\n     Sprague v.
