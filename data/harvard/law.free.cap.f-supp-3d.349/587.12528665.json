Plaintiff seeks preliminarily to enjoin the Secretary from acting pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395g(a) and 1395ddd(f) to recoup from Plaintiff overpayments of Medicare funds paid to Plaintiff.

After carefully considering the motion, response, supplemental response, advisory and response thereto, supplemental declaration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguments and evidence presented at the hearing, and applicable law, the Court concludes\n   for the reasons that follow that the motion should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Congress's Plan for Payment and Review of Claims Submitted by Medicare Service Providers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from Plaintiff Infinity Healthcare Services, Inc.'s (\"Plaintiff\") participation as a provider of home health services in the Medicare program. When Plaintiff applied to be certified as a Medicare provider, it agreed to be \"legally and financially [bound] ... to the laws, regulations, and program instructions of the Medicare program.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those laws and regulations establish that Medicare will pay for home health services only if a physician provides the detailed certification of the patient's eligibility described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.22\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such certification requires the physician to provide,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a narrative describing the clinical justification for certain services, certification that home health services are required because the patient is confined to the home, establishment of a plan for furnishing the services which was or will be reviewed periodically by a doctor, and certification of a face-to-face encounter with the patient.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.22\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Medicare providers like Plaintiff routinely submit claims for home health services which--in order to avoid delays in the provision of Medicare services to eligible patients--are paid as a matter of course within a couple of weeks. The structure therefore places an extraordinary level of trust in both the provider's integrity and its compliance with the required procedures. All payments, however, are subject to later review to determine whether the provider complied with Medicare's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To facilitate post-payment review of the provider's bills, Congress provided that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may enter into contracts with Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") to determine the amount of payments to be made to providers and to communicate with the providers on behalf of the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395kk-1. A provider's claims which were initially paid as a matter of course may eventually be reviewed by a Zone Program Integrity Contractor (\"ZPIC\"), and if the ZPIC's audit determines that the provider was overpaid, the MAC sends the provider a letter demanding repayment. At that point, if the provider wishes to challenge the overpayment decision, Congress has provided a comprehensive multi-level administrative appeals process which the provider may pursue. The Fifth Circuit recently summarized this process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   First, [a provider] may submit to the MAC a claim for redetermination of the overpayment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(a)(3)(A).

Plaintiff is a privately owned Houston business that in 2010 applied to be certified as a Medicare provider and agreed to be legally and financially bound to the Medicare laws and regulations outlined above. Plaintiff was certified as a Medicare provider in 2011. Plaintiff provides both home health care and hospice services, and at its peak had approximately thirty employees and sixty patients. In 2015, a Medicare ZPIC determined that Plaintiff had been overpaid for claims it had submitted, from which determination Plaintiff appealed and obtained a substantial reduction of the overpayment in 2016. Meanwhile, more recent payments were under review and in November 2016, either CMS or the Medicare contractor determined there was reliable evidence of overpayments or that payments may not be correct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and all Medicare payments to Plaintiff were suspended pending a new overpayment investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That investigation concluded in June 2017, when Palmetto GBA, LLC, a Medicare MAC, by letter dated June 27, 2017, notified Plaintiff that the ZPIC, Health Integrity, LLC, had determined an overpayment in the amount of $648,843. This overpayment determination was based on the ZPIC's review of a sample of thirty claims for payments submitted by Plaintiff and paid to Plaintiff for home health care services between August 2014 and July 2016. The ZPIC determined that twenty-nine of those thirty claims were defective and should not have been paid because Plaintiff had not submitted the required documentation to establish that the patients were eligible to receive home health care services or that Plaintiff had otherwise complied with Medicare's requirements. The ZPIC found an actual overpayment to Plaintiff of $65,256.23 based on those twenty-nine claims, and extrapolated a total overpayment of $648,843 during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The MAC'S June 22nd notification letter included an attachment summarizing the reasons for the ZPIC's overpayment determination. Two of Plaintiff's claims were denied because Plaintiff did not supply records as requested, and the other twenty-seven\n   were denied because Plaintiff's documentation did not meet Medicare's criteria for home health services. Specific reasons for denial included: that there were no changes in the patient's condition or treatment regimen to support that services provided were so inherently complex that they could only be safely and effectively performed by, under the supervision of, or taught by a skilled nurse; that the documentation did not clearly support a determination of the patient's normal inability and considerable effort to leave home; that the face-to-face encounter documentation did not describe clinical observations of the patient to support the need for skilled services and contained only generalized statements to support the patient's homebound status; that the patient's plan of care was not signed and/or not dated by a physician; that OASIS documentation was incomplete or not included in the records; that the physical therapy evaluations of the patient did not describe the patient's restorative potential and how therapy services would be provided with the expectation that the patient's condition would improve materially in a reasonable and generally predictable period of time; and that the patient's physical therapy treatment plan was not signed and/or not dated by the physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff on July 25, 2017, began the four-level Medicare appeals process by requesting a redetermination, arguing that its claims were properly presented and fully payable. Plaintiff was represented by counsel. Plaintiff's owner, Darlington Ofoefule, testified in the preliminary injunction hearing that Plaintiff at this first level of appeal submitted to the MAC all of the evidence that it had to support its argument that the overpayment determination was wrong. The MAC issued its redetermination decision in September 2017. The decision was completely \"unfavorable\" to Plaintiff. In the decision, the MAC reviewed and affirmed the statistical sampling methodology and devoted twenty pages to explaining the specific defects in each of the twenty-nine denied claims and outlining in detail numerous ways in which Plaintiff's documentation failed to comply with Medicare's requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff then invoked the second stage of the appeal process by requesting an independent reconsideration by a QIC. Plaintiff again was represented by counsel and again submitted all evidence that Plaintiff had to support the validity of its claims. After reviewing all of Plaintiff's evidence, the QIC, C2C Innovative Solutions, Inc., rejected Plaintiff's arguments, and issued its \"unfavorable\" decision in April 2018. The QIC's decision included more than thirty-five pages of detailed explanation as to why each of the twenty-nine claims was overpaid and why Plaintiff's challenges to the notice it received and to the ZPIC's extrapolation methodology failed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the unfavorable decision, the QIC also notified Plaintiff that recoupment would begin in late May, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ddd(f)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's owner states that by then he had already reduced the company's operations due to its loss of revenue from Medicare's earlier payment suspension, and\n   that Plaintiff now has only eleven employees and six patients and will be forced to shut down completely sometime next year if recoupment is not suspended. Plaintiff did not request an extended repayment plan under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ddd(f)(1) because of its financial inability to make the required monthly payments even if they were extended over the maximum statutory term of five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As explained above, once a provider exhausts the first two levels of independent review by separate reviewing contractors, it may avail itself of a third level of administrative appeal by requesting a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"), who is to conduct a hearing and render a decision within 90 days after such a request is timely filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(d)(1)(A). Currently there is a massive backlog within the Department of Health and Human Services that is causing delays of three to five years in the ALJ hearing process. The statute provides, however, that if the 90-day deadline is not met, the provider may escalate its claim to the fourth stage of the appeal process by requesting review from the DAB (Departmental Appeals Board). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(d)(3)(A). The DAB is to render its decision within a specified time, but if it fails to do so, the provider may bypass the DAB and seek judicial review in federal district court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.371\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1395ff(d)(3)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rather than to follow the steps provided by Congress to request an ALJ hearing and then, if such a hearing is not provided within 90 days, to escalate and proceed to federal court, Plaintiff filed this suit against Defendant Alex M. Azar II in his official capacity as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"Defendant\"), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent Defendant from recouping the overpayment until after Plaintiff receives an ALJ hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff later requested an ALJ hearing on May 29, 2018, and then in June filed its First Amended Complaint, alleging that Plaintiff's statutory and constitutional due process rights have been violated and seeking suspension of recoupment until after Plaintiff receives an ALJ hearing, and also seeking mandamus relief prohibiting Defendant from using sampling to calculate Plaintiff's overpayment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's request for an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   temporary restraining order was denied without prejudice to Plaintiff seeking expedited relief after serving Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After Plaintiff served Defendant, Defendant moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Plaintiff filed a renewed motion for a temporary restraining order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court dismissed Plaintiff's mandamus claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction but otherwise denied Defendant's motion, holding that it has jurisdiction under the collateral-claims exception over Plaintiff's claims in Counts One through Four and Six, all of which challenge Defendant's right to recoup the overpayment without providing an ALJ hearing and decision within 90 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   By\n   agreement of the parties, the Court converted Plaintiff's renewed motion for a temporary restraining order into a motion for preliminary injunction, which, after the evidentiary hearing held on October 31, is now ripe for decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To obtain a preliminary injunction Plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a substantial likelihood that it will prevail on the merits, (2) a substantial threat that it will suffer irreparable injury if the relief is denied, (3) the harm to Plaintiff outweighs the threatened harm to Defendant, and (4) granting the injunction will not disserve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Bluefield Water Ass'n, Inc. v.

Here, the deprivation is much lesser still.

Moreover, the uncontroverted evidence is that there are more than 450 other home health agencies in Harris County alone, and there is no evidence that any of Plaintiff's Medicare patients who are eligible for home health care would be unable to obtain care from the cornucopia of other local providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nor does the length of the delay in the administrative appeal process indicate a severe deprivation. In\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that no pre-deprivation hearing was constitutionally required where the delay between the cutoff of disability benefits and a final decision after an ALJ hearing would exceed one year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 906. Here, because of the Medicare backlog, Plaintiff faces a delay of three to five years before it could obtain an ALJ hearing. But Plaintiff need not endure that lengthy wait. As observed above, Plaintiff has the option of escalating its appeal to the DAB, and if the DAB does not provide a timely hearing, Plaintiff may pursue judicial review on the merits of its claims in federal court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(d)(3). A provider who promptly pursues this option will be in federal court in less than a year after recoupment begins--shorter than the time for review that the Supreme Court considered acceptable in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   --even assuming that the ALJ and DAB both fail to provide an earlier decision. Although the adequacy of recourse to federal court has been questioned based on judicial review being deferential,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Hosp. Ass'n v.

As observed above, these first two stages provided adequate process for Plaintiff in 2015 and 2016 when it successfully appealed the ZPIC's determination of an extrapolated overpayment of approximately $1 million and obtained a reduction to approximately $110,000 without reaching the ALJ stage. Furthermore, as discussed in more detail below, Congress specifically expected that ALJ decisions would not always be timely and created a remedy, allowing providers to elect to escalate their claims past the ALJ stage if they so desired. It is reasonable to infer that Congress did not view an ALJ hearing before recoupment as indispensable for protecting providers' rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The specific facts of this case further undercut Plaintiff's contention that an ALJ hearing would provide a unique opportunity for it to present new evidence. Plaintiff's owner, Darlington Ofoefule, testified that Plaintiff has already produced all evidence it has in support of its claims at the prior hearings. Plaintiff does not contend that it lacked notice of the asserted deficiencies in its documentation before its appeal to the QIC so as to be unable to prepare and present evidence to rebut those deficiencies, and the evidence is to the contrary. Although Ofoefule testified that he might want to procure additional letters from doctors and hire an expert to testify at the ALJ hearing, Plaintiff presented no evidence that it had any plausible excuse, much less good cause, not to have obtained its hoped-for additional proof during the sixteen and a half months after it was first notified of the overpayment, or during the ten months when Plaintiff with the assistance of experienced counsel appealed through two detailed levels of administrative review. Having no good cause for not having gathered and submitted to the MAC and/or the QIC any additional evidence, it is now too late to introduce new evidence even if Plaintiff were given an immediate ALJ hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(3) (provider \"may not introduce evidence in any appeal ... that was not presented at the reconsideration conducted by the [QIC], unless there is good cause which precluded the introduction of such evidence at or before that reconsideration\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additionally, the uncontroverted evidence is that in fiscal year 2018, only 18.2 percent of appellants received a fully or partially favorable ruling at the ALJ stage.

[E]xperience with the constitutionalizing of government procedures suggests that the ultimate additional cost in terms of money and administrative burden would not be insubstantial.\"). Here, the parties did not prove the number of appeals awaiting ALJ hearings but it is undisputed that the number is at least in the hundreds of thousands. Obviously, to dispose of this backlog and decide ALJ cases within 90 days would require vast numbers of additional ALJs together with appropriate support staffs, which, if feasible at all, would come with enormous costs to the Government and the public. On the other hand, if the backlog persists, the costs of making continued payments for an additional three to five years to hundreds of thousands of providers that have been determined by multiple independent reviews to have been overpaid, with little hope of later recovering the overpayment, would likewise be enormous. Either way, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   found that such costs must be weighed in the balance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Financial cost alone is not a controlling weight in determining whether due process requires a particular procedural safeguard prior to some administrative decision. But the Government's interest, and hence that of the public, in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources is a factor that must be weighed. At some point the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected by the administrative action and to society in terms of increased assurance that the action is just, may be outweighed by the cost. Significantly, the cost of protecting those whom the preliminary administrative process has identified as likely to be found undeserving may in the end come out of the pockets of the deserving since resources available for any particular program of social welfare are not unlimited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508268\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/120/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Just as in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , if recoupment is suspended and Plaintiff continues to bill for services that Defendant routinely pays within two weeks or less in reliance on the\n   trust system that is the underpinning of Medicare, Defendant's \"theoretical right\" to recover overpayments after an ALJ hearing is unlikely to \"result, as a practical matter, in any substantial offset to the added outlay of public funds,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the funds available to pay for medical care for eligible Medicare patients will be reduced accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has not shown that after two levels of separate and independent reviews the Constitution now require an ALJ hearing in order to permit Defendant to recoup its overpayment. Indeed, Plaintiff conceded at oral argument that if Congress had written the statute to provide for only the first two levels of the administrative appeal process that Plaintiff exhausted, followed by the judicial review, there would be no unconstitutional deprivation of due process. Plaintiff's concession that due process is satisfied even if Congress had not provided an ALJ hearing is fully consistent with\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiff has made no plausible showing of how it suffers a deprivation of due process simply because Congress added to a constitutionally adequate process additional layers of procedural process (including an ALJ hearing) which Plaintiff may elect either to await or to bypass by escalation if it chooses to avoid the delays caused by the backlogs. Accordingly, after careful consideration of all three\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   factors, it is evident that Plaintiff has not met its burden to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that constitutional due process requires Defendant to provide an ALJ hearing before continuing to recoup the overpayment to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   4. Other Considerations regarding Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Whether Defendant's actions violate statutory requirements and whether they violate the Constitution are two distinct questions. In light of Plaintiff's concession that the Constitution does not require an ALJ hearing at all, Plaintiff's claims perhaps are better construed as statutory, rather than constitutional, challenges. However, Plaintiff has not shown that it is statutorily entitled to suspension of recoupment because an ALJ hearing cannot be accomplished within the 90-day deadline. Indeed, Congress specifically contemplated this possibility and provided a different remedy as part of its comprehensive statutory scheme, as the Fourth Circuit has persuasively explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   While the [Medicare] statute imposes deadlines for completion at each step of the process, it also anticipates that the deadlines may not be met and thus gives the healthcare provider the option of bypassing each step and escalating the claim to the next level, ultimately reaching judicial review by a United States district court within a relatively prompt time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Cumberland Cty.

In fact, Plaintiff succeeded in its previous challenge to the extrapolation used in an overpayment determination without an evidentiary hearing before an ALJ.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    After the preliminary injunction hearing, Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration in which Ofoefule conclusorily testifies that \"there will be experts to testify as to the validity of the claims and that the extrapolation methodology was flawed\" and that the experts will submit a report before the ALJ hearing.

Ofoefule's representation neither specifies the expected content of the experts' opinions nor, more importantly, shows any good cause that would allow the ALJ to consider this evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Ofoefule also cites to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1018\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1018\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d), which he argues allows him to submit new oral testimony at an ALJ hearing. That regulation provides a deadline for submitting evidence to the ALJ and requires that any evidence not submitted prior to the issuance of the QIC's reconsideration determination must be accompanied by a statement explaining why the evidence was not previously submitted to the QIC or a prior decision-maker, and then provides that the regulation does not apply,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , to oral testimony.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1018\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1018\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is not clear that the exception in the regulation is intended also to apply to the statutory prohibition on introducing new evidence without good cause, which contains no exception for oral testimony.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(b)(3). At the very least, the good cause requirement applies to the proposed doctors' letters that Ofoefule testified he wanted to obtain, and to the written expert report(s) that he stated in his supplemental declaration would be submitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Court takes judicial notice of the Government Accountability Office's May 2018 report to Congress on improper payments, which estimated that the Department of Health and Human Services paid nearly $90 billion on improper Medicare and Medicaid claims in fiscal year 2017 alone.
