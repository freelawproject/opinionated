No language in the contract suggests that providing the Opt-Out Notice form was a condition precedent to the arbitration agreement. Rather, the Terms of Service indicate that the form would be provided as a matter of \"convenience.\" (Terms of Service, ECF No. 8-4, at 10.) Therefore, the provision of the form was not a condition precedent, and the agreement to arbitrate was sufficiently mutual and supported by adequate consideration as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Li argues that the arbitration clause is void under the doctrine of material misrepresentation, because StockX misrepresented that an Opt-Out Notice form would be provided to him. Both intentional and innocent misrepresentation defenses under Michigan law require that the party asserting the defense \"acted in reliance upon\" the misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arim v. Gen. Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1881285\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/206/178/\">\n    206 Mich.App. 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20N.W.2d%20695\">\n    520 N.W.2d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702 (1994) (per curiam) (requiring reliance for a defense of intentional misrepresentation);\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1944560\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/412/99/\">\n    412 Mich. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20N.W.2d%2077\">\n    313 N.W.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 84 (1981) (same for innocent misrepresentation). Li provides no evidence that he relied on the existence of an Opt-Out Notice form when entering the agreement-Li's declaration acknowledges only that an opt out procedure existed, but he does not claim to have read the clause or even to have been aware of it when registering. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Li Decl. \u00b6 4 (stating only that, \"[a]pparently, the Terms of Service included an 'OPT OUT' Procedure.\").) Therefore, Li failed to meet his burden on an essential element of a misrepresentation defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, Li argues that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable. Under Michigan law, the defense of unconscionability requires both procedural and substantive unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"555857\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/268/138/\">\n    268 Mich.App. 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=706%20N.W.2d%20471\">\n    706 N.W.2d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (2005). Li argues that the clause is unconscionable because it is included in an adhesion contract and because StockX never provided the Opt-Out form. If StockX's failure to provide the form made it impossible to opt out of arbitration such that Li had \"no realistic alternative to acceptance of the term,\" the arbitration provision might be considered procedurally unconscionable under Michigan law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=706%20N.W.2d%20471\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, even if so, Michigan courts \"will not invalidate adhesion contracts as a matter of law as long as the challenged provision is [substantively] reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Rembert v. Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"840013\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/235/118/\">\n    235 Mich.App. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=596%20N.W.2d%20208\">\n    596 N.W.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (1999). As a matter of law, Michigan courts hold arbitration agreements to be substantively reasonable provided they do not mandate a waiver of statutory rights and provided the arbitration process is procedurally fair.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=596%20N.W.2d%20208\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lozada v.

Mich. 2000). Li has failed to point to any aspects of the arbitral forum under the challenged clause that would be procedurally unfair or to any impact on his statutory rights. Thus, Li failed to carry his burden of showing that the arbitration agreement is substantively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his final argument, Li contends that the arbitration agreement was illusory. Under Michigan law, an agreement to arbitrate may be illusory if it \"allows one party the unfettered right to alter the arbitration agreement's existence or its scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Tobel v. AXA Equitable Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 298129,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20555801\">\n    2012 WL 555801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (Mich. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2012) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dumais v. Am. Golf Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453477\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1216/#p1219\">\n    299 F.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219 (10th Cir. 2002) ). Li appears to argue that the arbitration agreement was illusory in practice because StockX required the use of a particular Opt-Out Notice form, it was in StockX's exclusive power to provide that form, and, simply by failing to provide it, StockX could unilaterally amend the arbitration agreement by rendering it impossible to opt out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opp'n to Mot. Compel at 9-10.) Indeed, the arbitration provision expressly states that the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   way to opt out of the agreement is to complete a specific form, a form which the Defendant never claims to have provided. (Terms of Service, ECF No. 8-4, at 10 (\"You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form....This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\").) At root, this is an argument that the Defendant breached its obligations under the arbitration provision by failing to provide Li with the Opt-Out Notice form and, because of that breach, Li should be excused from performance under that same provision. Li's argument would be stronger if, for example, he provided evidence that he contacted StockX to request a form and was ignored, or that he submitted his own version of an opt-out form and had it rejected; however, he puts forward no evidence to that effect. Under the facts provided, it is not abundantly clear that it would have been impossible\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   to opt out. However, Li need only raise a genuine dispute of material fact. Li points out that Defendant has not produced the Opt-Out Notice form referenced in the terms, raising doubt as to whether such a form exists. (Opp'n to Mot. Compel at 6.) Li also provided a declaration from his counsel, suggesting that the failure to provide an Opt-Out form upon registration was not a one-time glitch unique to Li's experience, but may have been a recurrent feature of StockX's registration process under the October 2017 terms. (Emejuru Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6-7, Exh. in Opp'n to Mot. Compel, ECF No. 8-5.) Such a suggestion is troubling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, even considering all these facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Li's argument still fails as a matter of law. Even assuming StockX's conduct in failing to provide the form constituted a material breach of the arbitration provision under Michigan law, Li's continued performance under the contract without any protest at the time of the breach waived his right to refuse to perform on those grounds. In\n   <em>\n    Schnepf v. Thomas L. McNamara, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Michigan Supreme Court held that, where one party unilaterally amended the location of performance under the contract, the opposing party's\n   failure to object at the time of breach waived its right to refuse to perform later:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   'It was [the non-breaching party's] duty, when it discovered the apparent breach of the contract, if it intended to insist upon [ ] forfeiture, to do so at once. By permitting [the breaching party] to proceed with the performance of the contract[,] it waived a breach [on that ground].'...'Where there has been a material breach which does not indicate an intention to repudiate the remainder of the contract,...[a]ny act indicating an intent [by the injured party] to continue will operate as a conclusive election...depriving him of any excuse for ceasing performance on his own part.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Schnepf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867294\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/354/393/\">\n    354 Mich. 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20N.W.2d%20230\">\n    93 N.W.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (1958) (internal citations omitted) (first quoting\n   <em>\n    Grayson-McLeod Lumber Co. v.

Mich. 2015). Li offered no evidence suggesting that he objected to StockX's failure to provide the Opt-Out form at any time prior to this litigation. According to his own statements, it appears that he continued to use StockX's services after the 30-day opt-out period expired, despite never having received an Opt-Out Notice form. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 27 (alleging that he received the allegedly fraudulent merchandise in or around January 2018),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Li Decl. \u00b6 4 (stating that he registered and was provided with the Terms of Service, including the 30-day opt-out provision, on November 2, 2017).) Therefore, under Michigan law, even if the Defendant's failure to provide the form constituted a material breach of the arbitration provision such that Li might have been excused from his own obligation to arbitrate, his failure to object or assert his rights at the time of the breach waived any right to do so later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a supplemental filing, Li provided an additional citation to\n   <em>\n    Whitten v. Apria Healthcare Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , as support for his argument that his declaration provides sufficient evidence to defeat the motion to compel. (Suppl. in Opp'n at 1-2, ECF No. 9.) In\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff challenged whether she had ever agreed to-or even been presented with-a contract to arbitrate disputes with her employer. Civ. No. PWG-14-3193,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202227928\">\n    2015 WL 2227928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Md. May 11, 2015).\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   , though clearly correct on\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   facts, is distinguishable from this case, and Plaintiff misreads its treatment of the evidence. The plaintiff's affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   contested the authenticity of records suggesting that the employer's online learning program incorporated an agreement to arbitrate at the time she completed it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202227928\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Far from \"accept[ing] the Plaintiff's wholesale argument that she did not bind herself to an arbitration agreement simply through sworn affidavit\" (Suppl. in Opp'n at 2), the court in\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   determined that the affidavit called the credibility of defendant's evidence into doubt.\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202227928\">\n    2015 WL 2227928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (highlighting questions about the authenticity and reliability of screenshots and other evidence defendant offered to prove the existence of an arbitration agreement and plaintiff's assent to it). On that basis, the court found that the plaintiff created a genuine dispute on a material fact: whether an agreement to arbitrate ever existed between the plaintiff and her employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202227928\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   , Li does not argue that he never assented to the Terms of Service when creating his account. Nor does he dispute that the Terms of Service applicable at that time included an arbitration agreement. All of his arguments turn on the Opt-Out Notice form. Unlike the plaintiff's\n   affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Whitten\n   </em>\n   , and for the reasons explained above, Li's declaration-and any other evidence he provides-fails to carry his burden to raise a genuine factual dispute on a material question under any of his theories of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The final question before the Court is whether to grant a stay pending arbitration or to dismiss the case. (Mot. Compel Mem. Supp. at 5 n.2 (indicating a preference for a stay); Opp'n to Mot. Compel at 15 (arguing for dismissal) ). The Fourth Circuit has suggested on occasion that dismissal may be appropriate where all issues within a lawsuit are subject to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc. v.
