(Doc. 24.) As Defendant Jose de Jesus Estrada (\"Estrada\") did not respond to the Government's motion, the matter is now ripe for ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Estrada was admitted as a naturalized United States citizen on May 7, 1999. (Doc. 17-1 at 3, 17.) The Government now brings this action to revoke Estrada's naturalization as illegally procured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1997, Estrada filed his Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"). (Doc. 17-2.) Estrada signed the naturalization application under penalty of perjury and dated it May 3, 1997. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The naturalization application asked, at Part 7, Question 15(a): \"Have you ever: a. knowingly committed any crime for which you have not been arrested?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) In response, Estrada checked \"No.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 6, 1997, an INS officer placed Estrada under oath and asked him a series of questions regarding his eligibility to become a naturalized citizen of the United States. (Doc. 17-1 at 2-3.) During the naturalization interview, Estrada orally affirmed his answers on his naturalization application and specifically affirmed that he had never knowingly committed any crime for which he had not been arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the conclusion of the April 6, 1999 naturalization interview, Estrada signed the application and swore that the contents of his application were true to the best of his knowledge and belief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 7, 1999, Estrada appeared before the United States District Court for the District of Arizona for his naturalization oath ceremony. (Doc. 17-1 at 3, 17.) Based upon the information Estrada supplied in his application for naturalization and the sworn answers he gave during his April 6, 1999 naturalization interview, Estrada was admitted as a naturalized United States citizen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Estrada was issued Certificate of Naturalization No. 24670879. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over a decade later, in August 2012, Estrada was indicted for sexual conduct with a minor and molestation of a child. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.) Between April 29, 1993, and April 28, 1994, Estrada engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sexual contact with his daughter, a minor under the age of 14. (Doc. 17-1 at 27-28, 31.) On October 24, 2013, Estrada pleaded guilty to one count of Sexual Conduct with a Minor, a class two felony, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1401, 13-1405, and two counts of Attempted Molestation of a Child, a class three felony, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1401, 13-1410, 13-1001. (Doc. 17-1 at 32-38.) Estrada's plea was based on the offenses committed before his naturalization, on or between April 29, 1993, and April 28, 1994. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.) On November 21, 2013, Estrada was convicted and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for the sexual conduct charge and placed on lifetime probation for the molestation charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government filed its complaint seeking to revoke Estrada's citizenship on November 6, 2015. (Doc. 1.) Estrada filed an answer. (Doc. 7.) The complaint was then amended to plead four counts, each providing a separate basis for Estrada's denaturalization (Doc. 17.) The Government attached the following to the amended complaint: (1) affidavit of good cause of Andrew Lee, Special Agent, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Department\n   of Homeland Security; (2) Estrada's naturalization documents, including his May 3, 1997 Application of Naturalization (Form N-400) and his May 7, 1999 Certificate of Naturalization (Form N-550); (3) Estrada's Resident Alien form (Form 551); and (4) Estrada's conviction documents, including a copy of the August 24, 2012 direct complaint from the Maricopa County Superior Court (\"Superior Court\"), a copy of the August 28, 2012 indictment from the Superior Court, copies of the October 24, 2013 plea agreement and plea agreement/change of plea from the Superior Court, a copy of the November 21, 2013 presentence investigation from the Superior Court, and a copy of the November 21, 2013 sentence of imprisonment and probation from the Superior Court. (Docs. 17-1, 17-2.) In his answer to the amended complaint, Estrada categorically denied all counts. (Doc. 19.) The Government then filed the instant motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking judgment on only Counts I and II of the amended complaint.

The determination whether a conviction under a criminal statute is categorically a crime of moral turpitude involves two steps: (1) identify the elements of the statute of conviction, and (2) compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of a crime of moral turpitude and decide whether the conviction meets that definition.\n   <em>\n    Ceron v.

More specifically, the Court finds that a person at least 18 years old who intentionally or knowingly engages in sexual conduct with a minor age 12 and who intentionally or knowingly attempts to engage in or cause a person under the age of 15 to engage in sexual contact, engages in conduct that may be fairly characterized as vile, base, and depraved and that violates accepted moral standards; involves a protected victim; and is \"done willfully.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ceron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180613\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/773/#p778\">\n    747 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   779 ;\n   <em>\n    Nunez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521705\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/1124/#p1133\">\n    594 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1132 ;\n   <em>\n    Fernandez-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8456154\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/1159/#p1165\">\n    468 F.3d at 1165-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Estrada pleaded guilty to these two crimes, he committed a crime involving moral turpitude during the statutory period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, while Estrada indisputably committed these crimes during the\n   statutory period, he was not convicted until over a decade after naturalization. Section 1101(f)(3) does not clearly address whether \u00a7 1101(f)(3) applies where, as is the case here, the crime was committed during the statutory period but neither the conviction nor the admission of guilt occurred until after naturalization.

The Court finds the Seventh Circuit's reasoning persuasive and adopts it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, because Estrada committed crimes involving moral turpitude during the period of time in which he was required to establish good moral character, he was statutorily ineligible to naturalize at the time he became a United States citizen, and thus his certificate of naturalization was illegally procured.
