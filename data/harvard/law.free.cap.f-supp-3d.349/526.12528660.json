The indictment contains one count, charging Saravia-Chavez with illegally reentering the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 1). Saravia-Chavez argues that the indictment should be dismissed because the notice to appear initially issued to him failed to specify the time and date of the removal proceedings against him, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

Saravia-Chavez advances two specific attacks on the indictment. First, Saravia-Chavez argues that without a valid notice to appear, subject matter jurisdiction never vested in the immigration court, rendering that court's deportation order a legal nullity. Second, Saravia-Chavez launches a collateral attack against his deportation order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), arguing that his initial deportation proceedings lacked fundamental fairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Although conceding that the notice to appear issued to Saravia-Chavez was defective under \u00a7 1229(a)(1) and\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Government argues that the indictment should be upheld for two reasons. First, the Government asserts that federal regulations, not \u00a7 1229(a)(1) or\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , control when and how subject matter jurisdiction vests in an immigration court, and these regulations do not require that a notice to appear list the time and place of any removal proceeding. Second, the Government contends that Saravia-Chavez's collateral attack under \u00a7 1326(d) fails because Saravia-Chavez cannot show that he exhausted administrative remedies, that he was deprived of an opportunity for judicial review, or that his deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government is correct that the immigration court had subject matter jurisdiction over Saravia-Chavez's deportation proceedings under the governing regulations. Moreover, Saravia-Chavez's collateral attack on the underlying deportation order fails because, although the initial notice to appear lacked the time, date, and place of the removal proceedings, Saravia-Chavez received subsequent notice of these details, attended his deportation hearing, and admitted to facts that supported the issuance of a deportation order. Saravia-Chavez therefore cannot make the necessary showing under \u00a7 1326(d) that his deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss the indictment has been denied. (Dkt. 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; KEY PRECEDENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 25, 2018, Jose Orangel Saravia-Chavez was indicted on one count of illegal reentry into the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 1). Saravia-Chavez, allegedly a native of El Salvador, was initially served in person with a notice to appear on April 14, 2011. (Dkt. 22-1). This notice to appear ordered Saravia-Chavez to appear on \"a date to be set\" and \"at a time to be set\" to \"show why [he] should not be removed from the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The notice nowhere specified the time or date when Saravia-Chavez should appear, or the place where Saravia-Chavez should appear. The Government avers that, days after receiving the initial notice\n   to appear, while still in custody, Saravia-Chavez received notice in person of the date, time, and place of his removal hearing. (Dkt. 30 at 5; 30-1 at 7). On April 26, 2011, Saravia-Chavez attended his removal hearing, at which he was ordered deported on the basis of his own \"admissions.\" (Dkt. 22-2). The immigration court's removal order indicates that Saravia-Chavez waived his right to appeal the order and that Saravia-Chavez was personally served with a copy of the order on April 26, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Government avers that Saravia-Chavez was removed from the United States on or about May 12, 2011, (dkt. 30 at 1), and that he later came to the attention of federal law enforcement following his arrest on January 17, 2018 \"on felony strangulation and misdemeanor domestic assault charges in Albemarle County.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Saravia-Chavez advances two arguments in support of his motion to dismiss the indictment. First, he argues the indictment should be dismissed because subject matter jurisdiction never vested in the immigration court. Second, he contends the indictment should be dismissed under the factors set forth for a collateral attack on a deportation order in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). The Court addresses each argument in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Immigration Court's Subject Matter Jurisdiction over Removal Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Saravia-Chavez first argues that the indictment should be dismissed because the allegedly deficient notice to appear issued to him prevented subject matter jurisdiction from vesting in the immigration court. Saravia-Chavez contends that a removal proceeding commences, and jurisdiction vests with the immigration court, only by the filing of a charging document such as a notice to appear, which\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 1229(a) establish must contain the time and place of the removal proceedings. (Dkt. 22 at 4-5). Saravia-Chavez argues that where a notice to appear \"fails to include notification of the time and place of a removal hearing, the document does not qualify as a charging document so as to confer jurisdiction over an alien\" to the immigration court, rendering any subsequent deportation\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and void. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This argument fails.

Saravia-Chavez argues that he \"was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies or seek judicial review\" because the immigration court lacked jurisdiction and thus the removal proceedings were void, and because \"it would have been futile\" to \"pursue administrative exhaustion and judicial review\" under a 2011 Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision holding that a putative notice to appear has legal effect \"regardless of whether the date and time of the hearing have been included in the document.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Camarillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20644\">\n    25 I. &amp; N.

Furthermore, the Court finds no merit in the argument that a BIA decision issued in December 2011-months after Saravia-Chavez's deportation hearing in April 2011-rendered his ability to pursue administrative exhaustion and judicial review completely futile. Additionally, the copy of the deportation order Saravia-Chavez provided, (dkt. 22-2), indicates that Saravia-Chavez waived his right to appeal the order. Saravia-Chavez nowhere argues that this waiver was unknowing or involuntary.

This is so because the defects in the initial notice to appear Saravia-Chavez received ultimately did not deprive Saravia-Chavez of \"the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\"\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the deficiencies in the initial notice to appear, Saravia-Chavez had \"notice of the charges against him,\" received notice days later of the date, time, and place of his removal hearing, (dkt. 30-1 at 7), and attended that hearing, where he had a \"fair opportunity to be heard\" by the immigration judge.\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n    434 F.3d at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the deficiencies in the notice to appear Saravia-Chavez received ultimately do not rise to the level of a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, even assuming that these deficiencies violated Saravia-Chavez's due process rights, Saravia-Chavez cannot show that the alleged due process violation resulted in actual prejudice. Apart from the jurisdictional arguments this Court has already rejected, Saravia-Chavez presents no substantive argument that \"but for the errors complained of, there was a reasonable probability that he would not have been deported.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p663\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defense counsel briefly notes that \"based on his minimal criminal history, Mr. Saravia-Chavez appears to have been eligible for voluntary departure at the time of the 2011 proceedings.\" (Dkt. 22 at 13, n.4). But counsel has provided no further briefing on this issue and did not address this point at oral argument. Even if counsel is correct that Saravia-Chavez may have been eligible for voluntary departure at the time of his 2011 deportation proceedings, Saravia-Chavez could have sought voluntary departure prior to or at his April 26, 2011 removal hearing, which Saravia-Chavez received notice of and attended despite the deficiencies in the initial notice to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8 C.F.R. 1240.26(b)(1)(i) (alien may seek voluntary departure prior to or at master calendar hearing); \u00a7 1240.26(b)(2) (alien may seek voluntary\n   departure via stipulation by the Service prior to the completion of removal proceedings); \u00a7 1240.26(c)(1) (immigration judge may grant voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings). Nothing in the record shows that Saravia-Chavez attempted to avail himself of these opportunities but was thwarted by the deficiencies in the initial notice to appear he received. Thus, Saravia-Chavez's failure to seek and secure voluntary departure cannot be attributed to the deficiencies in the notice to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Collazo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322479\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/453/#p462\">\n    824 F.3d at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"defect in the removal proceedings\" complained of \"must be linked\" to the \"resulting prejudice\").

Counsel contended that any other reading of the statutory and regulatory scheme would be absurd. Counsel may be correct that the same notice to appear issued to the alien pursuant to \u00a7 1229(a)(1) is often, if not always, the same notice to appear filed with the immigration court for jurisdictional purposes pursuant to \u00a7 1003.14 and \u00a7 1003.15.

First, even if the statute and the regulations refer to the same notice to appear, it does not necessarily follow that the time and place criteria listed in \u00a7 1229(a)(1) for purposes of providing notice to the alien must be imported into \u00a7 1003.14 and \u00a7 1003.15, which serve the distinct purpose of establishing the immigration court's subject matter jurisdiction. Second, it is not at all absurd that, under the current statutory and regulatory scheme, the contents of the same notice to appear filed with the immigration court and provided to an alien could be sufficient for subject matter jurisdiction purposes under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003\n    </extracted-citation>\n    but deficient for notice purposes under\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1).

Accordingly, the Government's contention that \"this case is outside the scope of\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    's limited holding\" is without merit.
