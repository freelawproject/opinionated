GOLDSMITH, United States District Judge\n  The law is clear that the Federal Government cannot indefinitely detain foreign nationals while it seeks to repatriate them, when there is no significant likelihood of repatriation in the reasonably foreseeable future. This principle emanates from our Constitution's core value of rejecting arbitrary restraints on individual liberty.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  The issue the Court now resolves is whether there is such a likelihood of repatriation for scores of Iraqi nationals whom the Government has detained for an extended period-many for well over a year-while it engages in a diplomatic dialogue with Iraq that has yet to produce any clear agreement on repatriation. In fact, the weight of the evidence actually uncovered during discovery shows that Iraq will not take back individuals who will not voluntarily agree to return. This means that the Iraqi detainees could remain locked up indefinitely-many in local jails-whether their challenges to their orders of removal are exhausted or on-going. More evidence confirming Iraq's refusal to repatriate might well exist, but the Government has acted ignobly in this case, by failing to comply with court orders, submitting demonstrably false declarations of Government officials, and otherwise violating its litigation obligations-all of which impels this Court to impose sanctions.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As explained fully below, the Court will grant a preliminary injunction, as requested by Petitioners in this case, ordering that those detained more than six months be released under orders of supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As recited in the Court's prior opinions, this case arises out of the arrest and detention of Iraqi nationals who are or were subject to long-standing final orders of removal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamama v. Adducci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267434\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/820/\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. 2017). In June 2017, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), began arresting hundreds of these Iraqi nationals, the majority of whom are Chaldean Christians who would face persecution, torture, and possibly death if returned to Iraq. The initial round-up took place in Michigan, snaring approximately 114 individuals. Am. Pet. \u00b6 5 (Dkt. 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Many of these individuals were ordered removed to Iraq years ago (some decades ago), because of criminal offenses they committed while in the United States. All detainees served their sentences and were released under orders of supervision, because Iraq refused to accept repatriation. According to Petitioners, they lived peaceably in their respective communities under the orders of supervision-a point the Government does not contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Preliminary Injunction Staying Removal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 24, 2017, this Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the removal of Petitioners and the putative class, defined at the time as \"any and all Iraqi nationals in the United States who had final orders of removal on June 24, 2017, and who have been, or will be, detained for removal by ICE.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamama v. Adducci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267434\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/261/820/\">\n    261 F.Supp.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (E.D. Mich. 2017). The Court ruled that Petitioners' habeas and\n   due process rights entitled them to access to the immigration courts, prior to removal, so that motions to reopen their immigration proceedings could be filed. The Government filed a notice of appeal of this ruling on September 21, 2017 (Dkt. 108), which appeal remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioners filed an Amended Petition on October 12, 2017 (Dkt. 118), both reasserting and revising their claims, and requesting three forms of relief: (i) a stay of removal proceedings to allow class members to seek relief from removal before the appropriate body in the immigration court system; (ii) bond hearings for those held in prolonged detention; and (iii) release under orders of supervision, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    533 U.S. 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), unless and until repatriation to Iraq becomes significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   prohibits civil detention where there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Preliminary Injunction Regarding Bond Hearings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As class members' claims wound their way through the immigration courts, the Government elected to continue their administrative detention. On November 7, 2017, Petitioners moved for a second preliminary injunction, asserting that they were entitled to immediate release from detention under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , because there was no significant likelihood of their removal in the reasonably foreseeable future (Dkt. 138). In the alternative, Petitioners argued that their prolonged detention entitled them to bond hearings before an impartial adjudicator to determine whether their release would present a flight or safety risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioners also filed a motion to certify the \"Primary Class\" (Dkt. 139), which ultimately was defined as \"All Iraqi nationals in the United States who had final orders of removal at any point between March 1, 2017 and June 24, 2017 and who have been, or will be, detained for removal by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" 9/26/2018 Op. at 18 (Dkt. 404). The motion also sought certification of three subclasses of detainees: (i) detainees who are subject to final orders of removal; (ii) detainees subject to prolonged detention whom the Government purported to hold under a statutory provision providing for mandatory detention; and (iii) a so-called\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   subclass defined as \"All Primary Class Members, who are currently or will be detained in ICE custody, and who do not have an open individual habeas petition seeking release from detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamama v. Adducci\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522983\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/997/#p1020\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1020 (E.D. Mich. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 2, 2018, the Court issued an order granting, in part, Petitioners' second motion for preliminary injunction, holding that those subject to prolonged detention are entitled to a bond hearing before an impartial adjudicator, unless the Government proffered individualized evidence that a detainee should not receive a hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522983\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/997/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522983\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/997/#p1020\">\n    at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also certified the three detention subclasses and deferred a ruling on primary class certification pending the Sixth Circuit's ruling or other developments.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522983\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/997/#p1020\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court later certified the Primary Class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/26/2018 Op. (Dkt. 404).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court also deferred ruling on Petitioners'\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim, ordering that the parties conduct discovery to determine whether Iraq is willing to accept class-wide repatriation.\n   <em>\n    Hamama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522983\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/997/#p1020\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discovery Problems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response to that allowance for discovery, on January 14, 2018, Petitioners served the Government with more narrowly\n   tailored versions of their earlier interrogatory and production requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 5 (Dkt. 454). However, the Government did not respond to the January 14, 2018 discovery requests, which necessitated a court order requiring, in part, that the Government serve written responses to the interrogatories no later than March 23, 2018, and that it begin document production no later than March 30, 2018. 3/13/2018 Order \u00b6\u00b6 20 &amp; 22 (Dkt. 254). By March 30, 2018, the Government produced a total of four pages of documents, two of which were pages prepared by attorneys in support of the Government's defense in this action. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 5 &amp; n.2. The Government also provided incomplete interrogatory responses, omitting key information such as Iraq's requirement that Petitioners sign forms indicating their willingness to be returned to Iraq.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Government filed a status report on April 6, 2018, in which it indicated that it had located 20,000 potentially responsive documents and would be able to complete production by July 2018 (Dkt. 267). According to Petitioners, on April 16, 2018, they received forty-six pages of nonresponsive documents from the Government. The Court was provided with a status report on April 20, 2018, in which the Government stated that it had resolved its technological issues and estimated that it would take eleven weeks (until the first week of July), to complete its document production (Dkt. 272). The Court thereafter conducted a status conference on May 25, 2018, during which the Government stated that it would begin producing a significant number of documents following entry of the second amended protective order, which was entered on June 19, 2018 (Dkt. 313).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nonetheless, the Government's discovery responses continued to be deficient and the Government filed a motion to stay discovery (Dkt. 284), which the Court eventually denied (Dkt. 345). On June 12, 2018, the Court entered an order admonishing the Government that it may not withhold production of records pending its completion of all document review. 6/12/2018 Order (Dkt. 304). The Court ordered ICE to produce documents weekly on the following rolling basis: \"1,000 pages of documents on each of the following dates: (i) June 19, 2018; (ii) June 26, 2018; (iii) July 3, 2018; and (iv) July 10, 2018. The balance of documents shall be produced July 17, 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Notwithstanding the foregoing dates, DHS was required to complete its document production by June 25, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court made clear that \"[f]ailure to produce documents on this schedule will be construed, presumptively, as bad faith, unless Respondents can establish by clear and convincing evidence that there is exceptional good cause for not meeting the schedule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court further ordered the Government to provide written responses and objections to Petitioners' January 14, 2018 requests for production by June 12, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to the January 14, 2018 interrogatories, the Court ordered Petitioners to identify the ways in which the Government's responses were deficient and allowed the Government to supplement its responses by June 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Court further\n   warned the Government that \"[i]f Respondents fail to conduct a reasonable inquiry, respond with information within their control or otherwise obtainable by them, provide an appropriate verification, or fully and completely respond to the interrogatories, Respondents may be sanctioned, including the exclusion of that information in motions, in hearings, at any evidentiary hearing, and at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite the Court's warnings, the Government provided only 150 documents by June 19, 2018. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 6-7. The Government subsequently sought to modify the production schedule (Dkt. 315), claiming great difficulties with production software and the various litigation tasks. The Court found that the Government had not demonstrated exceptional good cause for failing to produce documents that were months overdue. 6/22/2018 Order at 2 (Dkt. 320). The Court ordered document production to be completed by July 17, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The Court warned the Government that \"[f]ailure to comply with the Court's order may be cause for the Court to direct that the facts necessary to support Petitioners'\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim are established, or prevent the Government from opposing the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim, or issue other appropriate relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) ). Seven months after service of the first document requests, the Government completed production on the first set of document requests. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 8. ICE produced 1,508 records and DHS produced 123 pages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As is often the case, the discovery responses led to new areas of inquiry. Petitioners served a second set of interrogatories and production requests on July 6, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. On the day the new discovery responses were due, the Government sought an extension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Petitioners resisted the extension, because they intended to file their renewed preliminary injunction motion in August 2018. The Court granted an extension until August 20, 2018, but made clear that no further extensions would be granted. 8/13/2018 Order (Dkt. 366). On August 20, 2018, the Government served written responses to the production requests, but no documents, and refused to answer most of the interrogatories on the ground that they exceeded the 25-interrogatory limit per party. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 9. The Government's request for an additional twenty-one days to respond to interrogatories, and its subsequent objection to most of them on the ground that they exceeded the 25-interrogatory limit, evidenced bad faith. The Court subsequently overruled the objections (Dkt. 385).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Current Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Further Discovery Problems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Petitioners filed their renewed preliminary injunction motion on August 29, 2018 without the benefit of responses to the July 6, 2018 discovery requests (Dkt. 376). After several status conferences and a motion to compel, the Government provided interrogatory answers on October 5, 2018, less than eighteen days before the hearing was scheduled on the preliminary injunction motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In the responses, the Government represented that the repatriation process had changed in September 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the Government still had not produced any documents in response to the document requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In light of the October 23, 2018 hearing, and despite ordering document production by August 20, 2018, the Court ordered the Government to produce the outstanding documents by October 16, 2018. 10/12/2018 Order (Dkt. 431). The Court further granted Petitioners leave to take depositions and Rule 30(b)(6) depositions in light of the information regarding new removal\n   procedures in September and the Government's insistence on an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the Government's representations, Petitioners expected to review tens of thousands of pages of documents beginning on October 16, 2018 in preparation for depositions on October 18 and 19 and the evidentiary hearing on October 23. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 11. However, no documents were produced on October 16.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At an emergency status conference on October 17, 2018, the Court ordered production of the documents in electronic format on the same day, and the depositions were rescheduled for October 22, 2018. 10/19/2018 Order (Dkt. 449). The Government produced 680 documents out of the 22,275 documents processed using a computer-based Technology Assisted Review (\"TAR\") program. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 11. When the TAR parameters were later disclosed, the parameters were shown to be inadequate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The document production was clearly incomplete, as evidenced by the number of documents produced and by the fact that only a handful of documents were dated after mid-July, and none was dated after August 31, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. This was particularly problematic because the Government submitted later-dated documents to the Court as proposed exhibits in support of its position at the upcoming evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was later revealed that approximately half of the documents that the TAR process identified as responsive were withheld.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After two more emergency status conferences on October 18 and 19, the Court ordered interim relief to Petitioners, including ordering production of all 22,275 documents, subject to the assertions of attorney-client or work product privileges. 10/19/2018 Order (Dkt. 449). The Court further ordered that documents from the period from August 31, 2018 to September 30, 2018 be produced by 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Government again failed to meet the Court-ordered deadlines. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 13. The Government filed a notice of non-compliance on October 19, 2018 (Dkt. 449) with an accompanying declaration explaining fiscal and staffing constraints for the failure to meet discovery deadlines. The declaration stated that the Government had produced 7,000 records-which turned out to be erroneous, prompting the Government subsequently to file a motion to strike the notice (Dkt. 450). The declaration also stated that an additional 20,000 records had been omitted from the TAR review. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court conducted another emergency status conference on Sunday, October 21, 2018, after which it cancelled the evidentiary hearing and requested briefing on appropriate sanctions for the Government's conduct (in addition to the briefing already filed in connection with Petitioners' motion for sanctions). The Court reasoned that an evidentiary hearing-at which the Government would present witnesses and documents of its choosing without full production of the documents ordered by the Court-would be unfair to Petitioners. 10/22/2018 Order (Dkt. 452). The Court held oral argument on Petitioners' preliminary injunction motion and their motion for sanctions on October 24, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Even under significant pressure from the United States, in the form of executive orders, the GoI only agreed to repatriate eight Iraqi nationals on the SHRC flight. Thereafter, the GoI cancelled the next charter flight and has delayed scheduling any more charter flights. Furthermore, the GoI has issued official statements that it will not accept forced repatriation of its nationals. And almost all subclass members who are currently detained have steadfastly refused to agree to voluntary removal to Iraq despite the coercive pressure of incarceration. Petitioners have more than met their burden of showing good reason to believe that their removal is unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Government, in response, argues that Petitioners' removal is significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, and their detention-which now extends well over a year-is reasonable. The Government essentially makes two arguments in an effort to rebut Petitioners' showing. First, the Government argues that removal is significantly likely because Petitioners who have opted out of the Court's stay of removal have been, and continue to be, removed to Iraq regardless of voluntariness. Second, the Government argues that the removal period has not begun for Petitioners, because the Court's stay of removal, and not Iraq, is the only impediment to removal. Both arguments are deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   With respect to its first argument, the Government's best purported evidence in support of its position that Iraq will accept forced repatriation is its representation that \"Iraq issued fifteen travel documents to ICE on July 13, 2018 and on September 5, 2018 for Iraqis who refused to sign a voluntary return form at their consular interviews.\" Ex. A to Resp. to Mot. for Sanctions, \u00b6 46 (Dkt. 478-1) (\"Schultz Sept. 28, 2018 Decl.\"). However, the Government's representation that fifteen individuals were removed who refused to sign voluntary return forms at their consular interviews is cagey at best. The Government does not explain who these individuals are. Presumably, they are among the thirty-nine class members for whom the Court has lifted the stay of removal, Schlanger Decl. VI, \u00b6 6,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and who executed forms agreeing to be returned, as explained below. These are hardly \"involuntary\" returnees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As of October 12, 2018, it appears that eighteen class members have been removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The fifteen so-called \"involuntarily\" removed class members must have come from this group. However, it is impossible to determine whether Iraq was furnished with some document in which the returnees expressed a willingness to be repatriated. While the group of fifteen may not have signed a voluntary return form at their consular interviews, at least twenty-two individuals have signed the following forms-the \"Detainee Stipulation To Prompt Removal To Iraq\"-which states: \"I wish to be removed to Iraq as promptly as possible,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkts. 346-2, 332-2, 300-2, 294-2, 278-2, 270-2, or the \"Detainee Request For Prompt Removal to Iraq\"-which states: \"I do not have a lawyer, and I currently wish to be removed promptly to Iraq,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 161-2. Iraq might well have accepted such forms as expressing voluntary agreement to be repatriated. Therefore, because the Government has failed to identify this group of fifteen, the Court has nothing but the Government's conclusory statements that their removals were \"involuntary.\" And the Government's representations in this case are often suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Government asks the Court to accept John Schultz's present \"understanding that the Iraqi Government is issuing TDs for Iraqi nationals regardless of voluntariness.\" 9/28/2018 Schultz Decl., \u00b6 47. However, Schultz's understanding is not a credible indicator of Iraq's willingness to accept forced repatriation of its nationals, as it is contrary to every statement made publicly by Iraqi officials on the subject. And it is contrary to the exceptionally credible declaration of Daniel Smith, whose explanation of Iraqi policies comports with the record before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In addition to Schultz's demonstrably false statements to the Court that it was the stay of removal, and not the GoI, that stopped the June 2017 charter flight, Schultz says that based on the 2017 Statement of Cooperation, he believed and continues to believe \"that Iraq will take back all Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal\n   regardless of whether they are volunteers, asylum seekers or otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 31 (citing Schultz Dep. 39:4-24). Schultz insists that Petitioners can be removed to Iraq \"without limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Bernacke also stated in December 2017 that \"Iraq agreed to the timely return of its nationals subject to a final order of removal.\" December 2017 Bernacke Decl., Ex. A to Resp't Supp. Br. to Resp. to Prelim. Mot., \u00b6 4 (Dkt. 184-2). Like Schultz, Bernacke doubles down on his previous statements and submitted a new declaration stating unequivocally that \"[t]he U.S. reached an agreement with Iraq in 2017 where Iraq expressed their willingness to accept the return of all Iraqi nationals with final orders of removal without limitation.\" September 2018 Bernacke Decl., Ex. B to Resp't Mem. Resp. re Disc. Sanc. (463-2). He says that the GoI \"has been and continues to be willing to accept flights containing Iraqi nationals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. He even says that the GoI \"has indicated a preference that ICE increase the volume of Iraqi Nationals being removed at one time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Based on prior experience, the Court finds Schultz's and Bernacke's representations not worthy of belief-especially without supporting documentation, which has not materialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In contrast to his \"without limitation\" assertion, Schultz concedes that ICE and the GoI continued the back and forth with respect to whether subclass members would be required to sign voluntary removal forms though June and July 2018. 9/28/2018 Schultz Decl., \u00b6 43. Schultz now says that \"[o]ver the last year, the process for obtaining Iraqi TDs has changed and continues to be an evolving process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Bernacke made a similar statement in December 2017 that, at that time, the agreement \"between the United States and the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is not memorialized in any written document or treaty. It is a product of\n   <em>\n    ongoing diplomatic negotiations\n   </em>\n   .\" December 2017 Bernacke Decl., \u00b6 4 (emphasis added). An evolving process or ongoing diplomatic negotiations are quite different from what the Government asserted at oral argument-that there is a \"reliable process for the removal of Iraqi nationals\" in place. 10/24/2018 Hr'g Tr. 46:20-21 (Dkt. 461).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Schultz's declaration further indicates that there have been developments as recently as September 2018 on Iraq's willingness to accept repatriation of its nationals. 9/28/2018 Schultz Decl., \u00b6 49. And Bernacke says that \"[o]n July 2, 2018, it was communicated to [him] in person at a meeting with the Iraqi Ambassador, the Deputy Chief of Mission, and the First Secretary that the GOI expects to issue travel documents for all individuals determined to be Iraqi Nationals by the GOI, regardless of whether they state they wish to return to Iraq voluntarily.\" December 2017 Bernacke Decl., \u00b6 17. Unfortunately, the Government's document production largely concludes in July 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. (Dkt. 454). Despite representations to the Court that as many as 60,000 potentially responsive documents exist, albeit identified under a flawed methodology, Petitioners have received only 123 pages from DHS and approximately 9,135 pages from ICE, some of which are duplicates, and most of which predate July 2018. Pet'rs Reply in Supp. of Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 4 (Dkt. 469). Despite Court orders, the Government has not made an appropriate document production on Petitioners' July 6, 2018 document requests. The Government's failures in this regard undermine the Schultz and Bernacke declarations and also warrant sanctions, as discussed later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Government has not met its burden of rebutting that Petitioners' removal is not significantly likely in the foreseeable future, as Sixth Circuit precedent demonstrates. In\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Garcia v. Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n    322 F.3d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 391 (6th Cir. 2003), the Attorney General initiated removal proceedings against a group of Mariel Cubans whom the United States ordered removed because they had past criminal convictions, like many subclass members in this case. The district court denied the petitioners' writs of habeas corpus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n    at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the Government did not contend that repatriation of the petitioners was reasonably foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n    at 391-392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It \"attested that negotiation between the United States and Cuba regarding the excluded Mariel Cubans is ongoing, there is no evidence that Cuba has any particular intention to repatriate [the petitioners].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 391 n.3. The Sixth Circuit held that evidence of \"continuing negotiations with Cuba over the return of Cuban nationals excluded from the United States\" was not sufficient to justify the continued detention of the petitioners.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n    at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The Government attempts to distinguish this case by arguing that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , it does not concede that there is no likelihood of removal, because a repatriation agreement exists, and Petitioners continue to be removed. Resp. at 32. The Government's argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   There is no question that American officials purported to believe that some form of an agreement existed in March 2017, as detailed in the Statement of Cooperation, which resulted in the repatriation of eight Iraqi nationals. But the process used at that time was not repeatable. Ex. 1-12 at PageID.12997. Subsequent to the SHRC flight, and the failed June 2017 charter flight, the records reflect ongoing negotiations with Iraq with respect to issuing TDs, whether to use voluntary repatriation forms, and whether Iraq will accept forced repatriation at all. This case is a great deal like\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Gonzales\n   </em>\n   in that respect. Whatever the \"agreement\" was between the United State and Iraq on March 12, 2017, the agreement has not evolved; it has devolved, back to the negotiation stage, and there does not appear to be a clear way forward to repatriate Iraqi nationals at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Equally deficient is the Government's second argument-that the removal period has not begun because, supposedly, the Court's stay of removal, and not Iraq, is the only impediment to removal. Fatal to the Government's argument is that several individuals are no longer under the stay and yet they remain in this country. At least eighteen class members have had the Court's stay lifted, some almost a year ago, and have yet to be removed. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   \u2022 The Court lifted the stay of removal as to Khahir Al Salaman on December 18, 2017 (Dkt. 181); he obtained TDs in June 2018; and yet he remains in detention. Schlanger Decl. VI, Table A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   \u2022 The Court lifted the stay as to Aqil Al Muntafigi on March 7, 2018 (Dkt. 253); he obtained TDs in June 2018; and yet he remains in detention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   \u2022 The Court lifted the stay as to Sabeeh Alsaad on March 7, 2018; he obtained TDs on July 10, 2018; and he was scheduled to be removed on September 10, 2018; and yet he remains in detention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9369282\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/386/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The case of Al Shakarchi also undermines the Government's argument. Although an Iraqi national, he was not a member of the class and was never subject to the stay. 10/24/2018 Hr'g Tr. 11:2. He had been detained subject to a final order of removal for quite some time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   There were no impediments to Al Shakarchi's removal, other than that he would not volunteer to be removed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:8-9. When Iraq refused to issue TDs for Al Shakarchi, the ICE field office released him, citing\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   What the Court can reasonably infer from Al Shakarchi's case and others is that the Court's stay is not the barrier to Petitioners' removals. Although some Petitioners have been removed, the Government has not explained under what circumstances the removals took place and has steadfastly refused to meet its discovery obligations, which would allow for a more robust picture of any repatriation dialogue with Iraq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Government relies on cases that do not support its position. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Beckford v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341527\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/533/\">\n    168 F.Supp.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.N.Y. 2016), the Jamaican petitioner's only argument in support of\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   relief was his pursuit of judicial review of his final order of removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341527\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/533/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341527\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/533/\">\n    at 538-539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner did not offer any good reason to believe that Jamaica would not accept his repatriation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341527\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/533/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341527\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/533/\">\n    at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Government's number is highly misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The Government, despite identifying tens of thousands of potentially responsive documents, has produced only 123 pages from DHS and 9,135 pages from ICE, many of which are duplicate pages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17; Pet'rs Mem. re Disc.

The remaining 296,280 of the 305,538 pages relate to Court-ordered disclosures, including Petitioners' A-Files and Records of Proceedings, which go directly to Petitioners and not class counsel, for use in their immigration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4; Pet'rs Mem. re Disc.

The Court-ordered productions are not in lieu of traditional discovery, and the Court-ordered productions, such as A-Files and Records of Proceedings, do not address the issue of whether there is a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   As to the Government's document production, the Government's document review has moved at a glacial pace. According to the Government, it collected 28,000 potentially responsive documents in April 2018, to respond to January 2018 document requests-yet it did not produce the documents until July 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (citing Scott A. Whitted Decl. (\"Whitted Decl.\"), Ex. D to Resp't Resp. to Mem. re Disc Sanc., \u00b6 7 (Dkt. 463-4). After threading the emails,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the number of potentially responsive documents was approximately 15,000. The Government estimated that it would take eleven weeks to review the 15,000 documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The Government's estimate was based on ten attorneys reviewing twenty-five documents an hour, or 200 documents a day, Whitted Decl., \u00b6 9, which is by no means fast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Based on ten-attorney reviewers, 2,000 documents should have been reviewed each day, and the initial review should have been completed in a week and a half. Even accepting the Government's time estimates with respect to a training week and a second-level review, the entire production should have been completed in a little over a month. However, the Government only assigned the ten attorneys to review documents one day a week, which, when training and a second-level review is considered, forms the basis for its eleven-week estimate. Whitted Decl. \u00b6 10. ICE's production was finally made on July 17, 2018. Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 8. The Government complains that it did not have the resources to complete its production in a timely fashion, but even taking into consideration its difficulties, it should not have\n   taken\n   <em>\n    seven months\n   </em>\n   to make its first document production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   As to the second set of document requests, Petitioners served the requests on July 6, 2018. Therefore, under Rule 34, documents should have been requested, reviewed, and produced on or before August 5, 2018. Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(A). However, the Government did not make the internal request to search for electronically stored records, such as emails, until September 4, 2018-two months after the request for production was served. Manuel Ramirez Decl., Ex. A to Resp't Resp. Mem. re Disc. Sanc., \u00b6 7 (Dkt. 463-1). The Government made no effort to comply with Rule 34's requirement to produce documents by August 5, 2018, or the Court's order to produce records by August 20, 2018. 8/15/2018 Order (Dkt. 366) (\"Respondents shall serve their responses to Petitioners' second set of discovery requests, including production of documents, on or before August 20, 2018. No further extension shall be granted.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Government represented to the Court that there were 22,275 potentially responsive documents to Petitioners' second document request, which the Court repeatedly ordered to be produced to Petitioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/12/2018 Order (Dkt 431); 10/19/2018 Order (Dkt. 449). To date, only 680 documents have been produced to Petitioners, and the 680 documents almost entirely omit documents from August 2018 and contain no documents from September 2018, which-based on the Government's most recent representations-is the most vital period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Shortly after the Court ordered the 22,275 documents be turned over to Petitioners, an additional 20,000 potentially responsive documents surfaced, Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Sanc. at 13, and that number has since swelled to upwards of 60,000 documents, Ramirez Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. If the past is any indication, the Government will need more than ten months to complete the review of these documents. Petitioners should not be made to languish in detention while the Government puts this case on the back burners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Government has needlessly prolonged the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   discovery for almost a year, and there is no end in sight. The Government's cry of lack of resources simply demonstrates improper prioritization of its litigation responsibilities, for which it must live with the consequences. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, a district court, as a sanction for failure to comply with discovery orders, may order the matters at issue or other designated facts to be \"established\" for purposes of the action.

From the earliest stages of this case, the Government made demonstrably false statements to the Court designed to delay the proceedings. It represented that the GoI was ready and willing to accept repatriation of its nationals without limitation, and that but for the Court's stay of removal, it would have done so. The Government has maintained this position even while it was considering sanctions against Iraq, noting it is one of the most recalcitrant countries with respect to repatriation. The Government asked for extensions of time to make procedural objections to interrogatories that could have been easily made without an extension. The Government appears befuddled by the entire discovery process and cannot proceed without the Court's constant intervention instructing the Government on the steps necessary to meet its obligations under the Federal Rules. The Government's attorneys are quite capable, which leads the Court to the conclusion that the Government's conduct is of its own making and demonstrates clear bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The prejudice to the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   subclass members is obvious. They have been subjected to civil detention well beyond the presumptively reasonable six-month period. Even if the subclass members are eventually allowed to remain in the United States, they have been deprived of more than a year of their lives with their families and their communities. Additionally, it is doubtful any of them have their old jobs or businesses waiting for them after this long period of time. Even after their release, the subclass members will have to start over to regain some measure of economic stability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Sanctions cannot come as a surprise. The Court has repeatedly warned the Government that failing to comply with the Court's discovery orders may result in sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/13/2018 Order \u00b6\u00b6 20 &amp; 22 (Dkt. 254); 6/12/2018 Order (Dkt. 304) (\"Failure to produce documents on this schedule will be construed, presumptively, as bad faith, unless Respondents can establish by clear and convincing evidence that there is exceptional good cause for not meeting the schedule.\"); 6/22/2018 Order (\"Failure to comply with the Court's order may be cause for the Court to direct that the facts necessary to support Petitioners'\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim are established, or prevent the Government from opposing the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   claim, or issue other appropriate relief.\") (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) ); 8/13/2018 Order (Dkt. 366); 10/12/2018 Order (Dkt 431); 10/19/2018 Order (Dkt. 449).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Lesser sanctions will not suffice in this case. The\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   issue, and the reason for the present discovery, is to determine whether to release Petitioners under orders of supervision. The Government has delayed a determination on the merits of that issue for over a year, which has benefitted the Government in that Petitioners remain in custody. The hard-fought limited discovery in this case paints a picture that\n   there is no likelihood of Petitioners' removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. The Court is not persuaded by the Government's representations that the discovery delays are solely because it is overworked and understaffed. The Court draws the reasonable inference that the Government is withholding documents adverse to its position in the hope that its situation will improve in the future. Petitioners should not be subject to indefinite detention because of the Government's indefinite discovery delays. The Court finds that the Government has failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders and has done so willfully. Therefore, sanctions are warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Accordingly, for the purposes of Petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court orders it established that there is no significant likelihood of Petitioners' removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Additionally, the Government argues that to the extent Petitioners are seeking review of their bond determinations, they must exhaust their administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.

Petitioners are injured by their continued incarceration. That incarceration is attributable to the Government, because it was the Government that detained them and continues to do so. An order by this Court would redress the harm. Accordingly, Petitioners have indubitably established standing to pursue relief under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Government seems to be arguing that the availability of bond hearings, previously ordered by the Court, undermines Petitioners' standing to pursue\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   relief. The theory appears to be that the detention is a failure to secure a bond, and thus not traceable to Government action. However, as noted above, the initial, primary and continuing cause of their detention is that they were arrested and detained by the Government-not their failure to secure a bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Further, the relief now requested is different in kind than relief under a bond. As this Court has already said, \"[a] bond hearing provides an\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   for release; relief under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , after a finding\n   that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   that release be granted in order to prevent further unlawful confinement.\" 7/18/2018 Op. at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    533 U.S. at 699-700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 345). Obviously, for those who were denied bond or could not make bond, that opportunity did not and would not provide the relief sought now. Therefore, the availability of a bond remedy has no bearing on Petitioners' standing to pursue\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   As for its argument on exhaustion, the Government cites no authority-and the Court is aware of none-holding that exhaustion is required for\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Petitioners' detention may be authorized under different statutory provisions; however, as the Court has already explained, either the statutory provisions or the Constitution requires their release from indefinite detention. Denying Petitioners' preliminary injunction motion because Petitioners are situated somewhat differently would discard the substantial benefits of consolidated treatment. \"[W]hat matters to class certification ... [is] the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has generated common answers regarding statutory and constitutional concerns, which in turn drive this litigation to a common resolution-namely release under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   . Rule 23(b)(2) is the most appropriate way to proceed in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Irreparable Harm; Balance of the Equities; Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Petitioners have unquestionably met their burden regarding irreparable harm. Detention has inflicted grave harm on numerous detainees for which there is no remedy at law. Families have been shattered. Petitioner Hassan Al-Atawna has been detained since January 2017 and taken away from his family, including his infant-now toddler-son. Gandhi Decl., Ex. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 6-8. Maytham Al Bidairi has been in ICE detention since May 2016 separated from his wife and three daughters for over two years. After Al Bidairi's arrest, his family was evicted because they could no longer afford rent. Moore Decl., Ex. 13, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. Firas Nissan was arrested in June 2017 and can no longer provide for his two children, elderly parents, and five siblings. He is now locked in solitary confinement\n   twenty-one hours a day. Piecuch Decl., Ex. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 3-14. The harm to Petitioners, who are ostensibly not being punished for criminal activity, is intolerable and ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The balance of equities tips decidedly in favor of preliminary relief. Without some relief from detention, detainees will undoubtedly continue to experience these or similar harms. The Government argues that there is no irreparable harm, because Petitioners' detention is lawful for a reasonable period. The Court cannot find detention reasonable for Al Bidairi, who did not receive a custodial sentence for making false statements, and yet has spent almost two-and-half years in detention based on his removal status. For Al Bidairi, and any Petitioner who has been incarcerated beyond six months, whatever may have once been considered reasonable under the law, has long since passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Finally, the public interest requires preliminary relief. Our Nation has a long history of resisting unreasonable governmental restraints. As the Supreme Court has made clear, \"[i]n our society liberty is the norm.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p755\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p755\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Petitioners' only crime is being caught between the United States and Iraq's diplomatic tug-o-war over repatriation. Nonetheless, more than half of the detainees are being held in penal institutions under the same conditions as those convicted of crimes. The public interest overwhelmingly favors freedom over mass detention in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In balancing all of the factors, the Court concludes that Petitioners are entitled to preliminary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Petitioners' renewed motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. 473) as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   1. The Government must release on orders of supervision all members of the\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   subclass who have been detained for more than six months within thirty days of this Opinion and Order, except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4 below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   2. Any\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   subclass member who has not yet been detained for six months, but whose period of detention reaches six months hereafter, shall be released on an order of supervision no later than thirty days after that member's six-month period of detention is reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   3. If the Government contends that there is a strong special justification, within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , to detain a specific individual, the Government need not release such individual, provided the Government files a motion alleging and substantiating that contention prior to the time for release. The Court will thereafter address whether release is, nonetheless, required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   4. The Government need not release an individual on supervised release if the Government actually removes that individual prior to the time required for release and does so in conformity with prior orders of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   5. This preliminary injunction currently will not apply to those on bond, because the Petitioners have not spoken consistently about whether the relief they seek should be applied to such persons.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Schlanger Decl. V, Table B (Dkt. 473-62) (reflecting 110 total subclass members, but none on bond)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Pet'rs Reply at 13, n.13 (Dkt. 479) (stating that relief is being sought as to those on bond also). Nor has the Government addressed this issue. Accordingly, if Petitioners intend to seek extension of this preliminary injunction to such individuals, they must file a supplemental\n   brief in that regard; the Government may file a response within seven days after service of the supplemental brief; Petitioners may file a reply within three days after service of the Government's response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   6. This injunction is to remain in place until there is a final determination on the merits of all of Petitioners' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   7. To the extent any party wishes to modify, supplement, or clarify the relief granted here, that party shall confer with opposing parties to attempt a resolution of any such issue. If there is agreement as to any issue, the parties shall submit a proposed stipulated order to that effect. If any dispute remains, counsel shall contact the Court's case manager to arrange a telephonic status conference to address the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    The Court initially permitted discovery in a September 2017 order,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    9/29/2017 Order (Dkt. 115), and Petitioners served discovery requests on the Government in October 2017, Pet'rs Mem. re Disc. Violations at 5. The Court eventually stayed those discovery requests, in part, based on the Government's representation that it would supply pertinent information in its response to Petitioners' November 7, 2017 motion for preliminary injunction (Dkt. 138), which carried the possibility of obviating the need for extensive discovery. 11/22/2017 Order at 2 (Dkt. 153).
