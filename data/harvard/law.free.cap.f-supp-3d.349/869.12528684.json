Before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration or Alternatively Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Class Action Complaint. Mot., ECF 25. The Court heard oral argument on the motion on September 27, 2018. For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and TERMINATED AS MOOT IN PART. The action is DISMISSED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Google LLC (\"Google\") runs an advertising program called AdWords, which allows an advertiser to tie his advertisement to specific keywords, such that users of Google see the advertisement when they search for those keywords. First Am. Class Action Compl. (\"FACC\") \u00b6 2, ECF 9. AdWords also allows the advertiser to select certain\n   <em>\n    negative\n   </em>\n   keywords, such that users of Google\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   see the advertisement when they search for those negative keywords.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. But Plaintiff Troy Martial Arts Inc. and its co-owner Plaintiff Mark Trudeau (collectively, \"Trudeau\") claim that this negative keyword functionality does not work as promised.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FACC. Specifically, when a user misspells a negative keyword in his or her search, Google allegedly corrects that misspelling and then runs the search results for that word.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. In that scenario, AdWords displays the advertisement, even though the search includes the negative keyword.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Trudeau thus claims that Google makes material misrepresentations about AdWords' functionality. He brings the following causes of action on behalf of himself and a putative class: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) violation of the Unfair Competition Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In order to determine whether these claims must be compelled to arbitration or be litigated in this court, the Court necessarily must decide whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable-if it were unconscionable, then it would be unenforceable. After thoroughly reviewing the briefing on this issue and the declarations submitted in support thereof, as well as hearing argument from each side at the hearing on the motion, the Court holds that the arbitration provision is valid and enforceable and covers the claims at issue here, such that Google's motion to compel arbitration must be granted and its motion to dismiss must be granted as to the claim for declaratory relief that the arbitration provision is unconscionable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    As an initial matter, Trudeau does not dispute several facts important to deciding these motions. It is undisputed that Trudeau accepted the 2017 TOS and did not follow the arbitration opt out procedures.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FACC \u00b6 32; Sung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14-17. It is also undisputed that if Section 13(A) is valid and enforceable as to claims that accrued before the 2017 TOS was enacted (what Trudeau deems to be \"retroactive\" application), the scope of that provision covers the claims at issue here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    2017 TOS \u00a7 13(A) (governing \"all disputes and claims between Google and Customer ... that arise out of or relate in any way to the Programs or these Terms\"); Mot. at 12. The key dispute then is whether the arbitration provision can cover claims that accrued before the 2017 TOS was enacted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    It also appears from Trudeau's Opposition that he abandons his declaratory relief claim that the arbitration provision is procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    FACC \u00b6\u00b6 107-114 (seeking declaratory relief that clause is unconscionable)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 4-14 (arguing arbitration provision is unenforceable for\n    other reasons). To the extent Trudeau has not waived this argument, the Court rejects it and dismisses this cause of action with prejudice. Under California law, a contractual clause is unenforceable only if it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nagrampa v.

Apr. 19, 2018) (\"[A]n advertiser's decision to decline the September 2017 AdWords Agreement to avoid being subject to the new arbitration provision is a voluntary choice given that he or she can easily opt out from that provision ....\"). Trudeau does not meaningfully dispute the voluntariness of the opt out procedure. Thus, the arbitration provision is not procedurally unconscionable and thus not unconscionable. As a result, the Court dismisses Trudeau's claim for declaratory relief under Rule 12(b)(6). Because the Court has taken judicial notice of the facts relevant to Trudeau's unconscionability argument-namely, the existence of and procedure for the voluntary opt-out, as well as the 2017 TOS-the Court finds further amendment would be futile and DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE the claim for declaratory relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Instead, Trudeau argues that the arbitration provision does not apply retroactively for three reasons: (1) the plain language of Section 13(A) in the 2017 TOS \"does not say that the new Dispute Resolution Agreement ... will apply retroactively to already-accrued claims\"; (2) the retroactivity provisions in the past versions of the TOS bound Google to making only prospectively applicable changes in future versions of the TOS; and (3) California law, specifically the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, \"prohibits the retroactive enforcement of late-added contractual terms, at least as to claims that ha[ve] 'accrued' before the clause was added.\" The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     A.

Section 12 of the 2017 TOS states in part that \"[o]ther than changes made under Section 13(G), changes to the Terms will not apply retroactively ....\" 2017 TOS \u00a7 12. And Section 13(G) covers only future changes to Section 13's arbitration provision.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201876950\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 13(G). Trudeau argues that Section 12's application exclusively to Section 13(G) indicates that it does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    apply to Section 13(A) (the arbitration provision), such that the 2017 TOS arbitration provision does not apply retroactively.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 10-11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    At the same time, Trudeau recognizes that Section 13(A)(2) \"seems to imbue [Section 13(A) ] with retroactive effect, by providing that the new dispute resolution clause applies to,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , 'claims that arose before Customer or Advertiser first accepted any version of these Terms containing an arbitration provision.' \" Opp. at 11 (quoting 2017 TOS \u00a7 13(A)(2) ).

Civ. Code \u00a7 1654\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Court finds that Trudeau's argument misses the mark, as argued by Google.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 8-10, ECF 35. Rather than starting with Section 12, the Court starts with the plain language of the arbitration provision. Section 13(A)(2) expressly covers \"claims that arose before Customer and Advertiser first accepted any versions of these terms containing an arbitration provision.\" 2017 TOS \u00a7 13(A)(2). On its face then, the arbitration provision applies to claims arising before the 2017 TOS. Trudeau muddies the point by calling this a \"retroactive\" application of Section 13(A)(2). \"Retroactivity\" as it relates to this contract is a question of\n    <em>\n     timing\n    </em>\n    : Does the provision apply as if it had been enacted at some time prior to the time of its actual enactment? Section 13(A)(2) does not apply retroactively-that is, it does not apply as if it had been enacted prior to the time of its actual enactment. Instead, it applies prospectively from the time of enactment. That the\n    <em>\n     scope\n    </em>\n    of Section 13(A) covers claims that accrued prior to enactment does not mean that the Section itself has retroactive application.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    This distinction is made clear by Section 12. Section 12 states that Google \"may make non-material changes to these [2017] Terms at any time without notice, but Google will provide advance notice of any material changes to these Terms.... Other than changes made under Section 13(G), the changes to the Terms will not apply retroactively ....\" Put simply, Section 12 states that any future changes to the 2017 Terms will not apply as if they had been present in the original 2017 Terms,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , as if they had been present in the contract before they were actually enacted. The exception to this provision is for future changes made to the Section 13 Dispute Resolution Agreement pursuant to Section 13(G). Section 12 instructs that those changes\n    <em>\n     can\n    </em>\n    have retroactive application, as if they had been present in the TOS all along.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Nothing about the potential retroactivity or nonretroactivity of\n    <em>\n     future\n    </em>\n    changes to the 2017 TOS changes the fact that Section 13(A)'s scope, by its plain terms, covers claims that accrued prior to enactment. That is, Section 13(A) need not apply retroactively in order to cover previously accrued claims. As such, the Court finds no conflict or ambiguity in the terms of the 2017 TOS and holds that Section 12 does not preclude Section 13(A) from covering previously accrued claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     B. The Impact of Non-Retroactivity Provisions in Previous Versions of the Terms of Service\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Trudeau next argues that even if the 2017 TOS does not bar previously accrued claims by its own terms, the existence of non-retroactivity provisions in previous versions of the TOS, which Trudeau signed, precluded the 2017 TOS from covering such claims.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 13-14.

A novation requires (1) a previous valid obligation; (2) the agreement of all parties to the contract; (3) the extinguishment of the old contract; and (4) the validity of the new one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     James\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204269898\">\n     2016 WL 4269898\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2. It is clear from the 2017 TOS terms and the context in which it was signed that these requirements are met here. Each of the requirements save the third is undisputed. As to the third, by its plain terms, the 2017 TOS terms represent \"the parties' entire agreement relating to their subject matter and\n    <em>\n     supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements\n    </em>\n    on those subjects.\" 2017 TOS \u00a7 14(d);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     James\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204269898\">\n     2016 WL 4269898\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding novation where contract with arbitration provision had similar language). And Section 11 of the 2013 TOS confirms this understanding, as Google points out. The 2017 TOS was not mere changes enacted by Google and then posted on its website, which advertisers were expected to discover by \"look[ing] at the[ ] Terms regularly,\" 2013 TOS \u00a7 11. Instead, Google implemented an extensive notice campaign and required that advertisers expressly accept the new 2017 TOS.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Likewise, as admitted by Trudeau, the 2017 TOS was the first \"substantial\" change since the 2013 TOS. Opp. at 3;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Sung. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Unlike the other TOS versions that Trudeau references, which seemingly were mere modifications posted to the website, the 2017 TOS constituted a significant change that he was required to sign. Each of these facts supports the argument that the 2017 TOS was a novation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Given the language of the 2017 TOS and the context in which it was implemented, the Court holds that previous versions of the TOS do not bar the 2017 TOS arbitration provision from applying to previously accrued claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     C. The Applicability of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Under California Law\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Trudeau's final argument is that the arbitration provision is invalid under California's\n    implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (\"covenant\") because \"[e]very Court of Appeal to have considered whether a party may unilaterally modify an arbitration clause to retroactively cover claims that have already accrued has agreed\" that the covenant bars such retroactive application.

According to Trudeau, California appellate courts have followed the decision in\n    <em>\n     Peleg v.

App. 2015) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Trudeau seems to argue both that the retroactivity of the 2017 TOS arbitration provision is unenforceable in its own right,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 8-9, and that the non-retroactivity provisions in previous versions of the Terms contribute to that conclusion. As to the 2017 TOS themselves, he relies on the\n    <em>\n     Peleg\n    </em>\n    line of cases to argue that the retroactivity of an arbitration provision is barred wholesale. As to the other versions of the TOS, Trudeau argues that Google's long line of Terms not allowing for retroactive application would have instilled in the advertisers a reasonable expectation that the 2017 TOS also did not apply retroactively.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 8. And, according to Trudeau, the opt out provision would not have changed those expectations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Google responds that the\n    <em>\n     Peleg\n    </em>\n    line of cases are inapposite because they apply only to\n    <em>\n     unilateral\n    </em>\n    changes to the arbitration agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 6-8. Google argues by way of example that in\n    <em>\n     Peleg\n    </em>\n    , the Court held a contractual term to be illusory because it would have allowed the employer to \"amend the contract in anticipation of a specific claim, altering the arbitration process to the employee's detriment\" via mere notice to the employee.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 6;\n    <em>\n     see id.\n    </em>\n    (distinguishing\n    <em>\n     Cobb\n    </em>\n    ). Google argues that the circumstances are vastly different here, where the advertisers had to accept the agreement and were given multiple opportunities to opt out. Finally, Google argues that the advertisers could not have reasonably expected the arbitration provision not to govern previously accrued claims because the express terms of the 2017 TOS in Section 13(A)(2) demonstrate that such claims are covered.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply at 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Court agrees with Google that California law does not bar enforcement of the arbitration provision here. The\n    <em>\n     Peleg\n    </em>\n    court was concerned with potentially illusory contract terms by which an employer could change the terms of the arbitration provision at any time, even after a dispute had arisen.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250091\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/204/1425/\">\n     204 Cal.

App. 2013) (invalidating modification to arbitration provision where employer \"unilaterally\n    modified\" the agreement based on a provision allowing it to \"change or modify [the contract] from time-to-time without advance notice and without the consent of employees.\"). The 2017 TOS arbitration provision does not run afoul of this caselaw. Google did not unilaterally change the 2017 TOS to add an arbitration provision. Instead, it provided ample notice to the advertisers, required them to accept or decline, and gave them a valid opportunity to opt out.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9; 16-18. Simply put, there was no unilateral amendment of the contract that might render the provision illusory, and thus warrant application of the covenant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    And as to the reasonable expectations of the advertisers, as explained above, the Court does not find the terms of the contract to be uncertain or ambiguous. Section 13(A)(2) expressly applies the arbitration provision to previously accrued claims on its face. The Court finds it would not be reasonable to construe that provision as not applying retroactively, even given the history of the Terms.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mohamed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277941\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/1201/#p1210\">\n     848 F.3d at 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[O]ne who signs a contract is bound by its provisions and cannot complain of unfamiliarity with the language of the instrument.\" (citation omitted) ). Thus, the Court holds that the arbitration provision is not invalid as a matter of California law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Because none of Trudeau's arguments is sufficient to rebut the plain language of the 2017 TOS and because Trudeau expressly accepted those terms and refused to opt out, the Court finds that he is bound by the arbitration provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
