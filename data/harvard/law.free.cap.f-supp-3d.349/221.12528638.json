Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This tragic case presents complex and difficult sentencing issues. The defendant, Pamela Harris, is a former New York State Assemblywoman-a position she resigned from when threatened with the instant prosecution. She has suffered extraordinarily harsh and repeated blows: as a teenager, an abusive mother who beat her with a belt at least twice a week resulted in her leaving her family home and dropping out of high school; she never met her biological father; the unexpected death of her only child was followed by a period of despair when she was living on the street, addicted to crack cocaine and prostituting herself to support her drug habit; a brutal beating by an inmate while she worked as a corrections officer in Riker's\n   Island prison created great pain and stress; diagnosed with breast cancer at 44, she underwent a radical mastectomy and three invasive reconstructive surgeries; a car accident required multiple surgeries; and she is burdened with diabetes and other serious medical problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Harris has exhibited a remarkable capacity to rehabilitate herself: she earned a G.E.D. in 1995, an associate's degree in 2004, a bachelor's degree in 2007, and a master's degree in 2013. She became a leader in the Coney Island community, particularly in instructing children and steering them away from criminal conduct; and universal respect resulted in her election as an assemblywoman. She married a supportive husband and maintained good relations with all her family. She is sincerely remorseful for her crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The likelihood of criminal behavior in the future is low. The probability of her assisting people in the community, and ex-convicts, is high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Her crimes are serious. They reflect a pattern of deliberate and calculated criminal behavior from 2012 to 2017. She executed various schemes to defraud the public of funds allocated for vulnerable members of society: she stole $45,600 in City funds from a not-for-profit organization she ran for at-risk adolescents in Coney Island and $24,800 in federal flood disaster relief funds set aside for individuals displaced from their homes by Hurricane Sandy. She defrauded bankruptcy creditors of $10,000. She forged signatures and submitted fabricated documents to City and federal agencies. She interfered with the prosecution of her crimes by inducing people to commit perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Harris did not use her position as an elected official to execute her crimes. But, by continuing to engage in criminal conduct while she served in the Assembly, she contributed to the erosion of the public's faith in government.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Jeet Heer,\n   <em>\n    New York is the Most Politically Toxic Place in America\n   </em>\n   , The New Republic (May 9, 2018), https://newrepublic.com/article/148337/new-york-politically-toxic-place-america (describing a culture of corruption in New York State politics).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Deviation from defendant's prior law-abiding conduct is so great as to suggest that she is still suffering from the psychic scars of her dreadful past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Harris has a better chance at\n   rehabilitation on the outside than on the inside of a prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the one hand, the Guideline for incarceration of thirty-three to forty-one months is too severe in this unique case. A long incarceratory Guideline sentence might well destroy defendant's ability to rejoin her free community and to exercise her capacity for helping people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the other hand, a sentence of no incarceration might send a wrong message to the community.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   James S.

The fact that she then fell so hard and now was having to do community service with us is also part of the lesson we try to teach these young people that you're accountable or what you do, that you can lose everything you've got if you engage in criminal behavior but also that there's room for redemption; that it's possible to come back; that it's possible to give back and we try to teach them the value that if you've done damage to the community, your job is to undo that damage and to the extent that we can have role models of people who themselves are facing sentences and are trying to build back by giving back, that can make a difference in a young person's life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   I always look at risk when I look at somebody that might be working with our young people and the question I always ask is why can we trust this person and what made me feel good about Pam working with them was a long, long, long track record of loving kids and being there for them; pretty much a lifetime track record. The fact that she was a crime victim, that she was assaulted so seriously that she still suffers the consequences and yet chose to work with high-risk and at-risk young people after that may have [made] me feel good about having her work with our kids because she kind of embodied being at bottom, pulling yourself up, doing things that then tear that whole thing down, but still having qualities of carrying and solidity and being there for young people....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [T]his is somebody who can bring value and increase the odds of our kids and whatever happens she may well be somebody we would like to hire and bring in because we think she can make a difference.

Harris repeatedly lied and submitted forged documents to divert public funds reserved for youth and disaster victims into her own pocket. She stole from the children she was supposed to be protecting. She stole from natural disaster victims. When the government focused on her various schemes to defraud, she took advantage of those closest to her by convincing them to lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The defendant's crimes were not an aberration. They reflect a pattern of calculated fraudulent behavior over a number of years. She is a thoughtful, intelligent, and highly competent person. She did not stumble into her crimes but deliberately walked into them with her eyes wide open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The people have the right to expect a high degree of moral rectitude in their State legislators, even if what they did is not done using their legislative power. The court is mindful of its responsibility to assure the public that those in positions of power receive appropriate punishment for their crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Consideration must be given to defendant's difficult background and her strong and effective efforts to improve herself and society. Harris pulled herself up after hitting bottom following the death of her only daughter. She wrenched herself off the street and off drugs; she went back to school, earning a G.E.D., and a bachelor's and a master's degree. She maintained lawful employment as a corrections officer until retirement. She suffered post-traumatic stress, requiring medication and therapy, after being brutally attacked by an inmate at Riker's Island prison. She survived a serious auto accident, breast cancer, and a radical mastectomy, and she has been diagnosed with other serious diseases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Numerous witnesses testified at sentencing regarding her role as a leader in her community and the positive impact she has had on them and others. She has demonstrated that she can be an effective mentor for at-risk youths in Coney Island, helping them stay out of trouble and on the path towards a lawful life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Her husband has helped defendant get back on her feet. He is able to help her again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   In view of the defendant's unique, tragic personal history, her extraordinary capacity for rehabilitation, and the important role she can serve in her community, as well as the fact that her crimes were not committed with the power of her public office, a term of imprisonment longer than six months is not required. The term is just.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gall v.

So too does her vulnerability to abuse in prison by other inmates as a former corrections officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   General and specific deterrence are achieved by the sentence imposed. She\n   voluntarily resigned from public office. Harris has expressed remorse for her conduct and understands the gravity of her actions. Time in prison, close supervision after release, and restitution provide sufficient deterrence. In addition to the punishments imposed by this court, she has lost some of the respect of her community which she desperately sought.
