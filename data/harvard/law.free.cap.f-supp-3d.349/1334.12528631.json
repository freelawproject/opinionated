On November 26, 2018, this action was removed to this Court. On November 30, 2018, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause, requiring Defendant to show that this case was properly removed because the Court had doubts as to the amount in controversy and the diversity of citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DE 7]. The Court has considered the Response to the Order to show Cause [DE 8] and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. Upon careful consideration, the Court determines that Defendant has failed to meet its burden regarding the amount in controversy requirement for purposes of removal of this action to federal court. Accordingly, the Court will remand this case to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v.

Feb. 22, 2018) (\"But, this Court has repeatedly held that \" 'the amount in controversy is determined at the time of removal and thus does not include post removal back pay.' \") (citations omitted). Plaintiff was terminated September 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DE 1-2] at \u00b6 33. The case was removed on November 26, 2018. Therefore, the amount of back pay at the time of removal is approximately $49,920.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, crucially, this number may be significantly reduced or non-existent at all based upon the facts regarding Plaintiff's employment since the termination. Back pay calculations require a deduction of any amounts Plaintiff earned since a wrongful discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar Logistics Servs., Inc. v.

Here, Defendant has not introduced any evidence regarding whether Plaintiff has been employed since September 2016 conclusion of employment with Defendant, and, if so, at what salary or hourly rate, which would be material to the Court to determine whether back pay can even properly be considered in this case in determining the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See Lupinacci v.

Moreover, again, as with the back pay analysis, the Court has no facts before it in the record supporting whether front pay is even appropriate here, as \"[t]he same mitigation of damages\n   analysis applies to back pay and front pay awards.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

The Court finds that the FCRA's prevailing party attorney's fee and cost provision insufficient to bolster a claim that otherwise lies short of the jurisdictional threshold for removal to federal court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Avery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201008443\">\n    2018 WL 1008443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   remanding FCRA claims where \"[defendant] has not provided any information regarding the amount of attorney's fees accrued at the time of removal, and there is no basis to find that such fees reach an amount that could satisfy the jurisdictional minimum, even when considered in conjunction with [plaintiff]'s claims for back pay.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the Court concludes that Defendant has failed to meet its burden to establish the jurisdictional amount in controversy of $75,000.00. The record evidence that Plaintiff's salary was approximately $24,960 per year at the conclusion of her employment with Defendant, supplemented by argument and speculation, is simply insufficient to establish an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000.\n   <em>\n    See Lupinacci v.
