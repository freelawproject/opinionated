The Court held a hearing on January 25, 2018. The primary issue is whether Plaintiff A.J. Olivas' proposed class members are similarly situated such that the Court should authorize providing them notice of their right to opt in to Olivas' collective action against Defendants C &amp; S Oilfield Services, LLC, Dewey Coffman,\n   and Brett Coffman (collectively, \"C &amp; S Oilfield\") under the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 219 (\"FLSA\"). The Court concludes that Olivas' allegations and proposed class members' affidavits establish that he and the proposed class members are similarly situated. Accordingly, the Court grants the Notice Motion and authorizes Olivas to notify the proposed class of his collective action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   C &amp; S Oilfield is a Louisiana-based company that \"provid[es] water transfer and other ... services\" to New Mexico oilfields.

Notice Motion at 1-2. Olivas defines the target group as \"[a]ll field personnel employed by Defendants over the last three years who received pay on a salary basis. This Definition includes, but is not limited to, ... positions referred to by Defendants as field hands, lead hands, water transfer technicians, crew leaders, laborers, crewmembers, tank hands, and team leaders.\" Notice Motion at 4. Olivas asserts that, for a court to permit a plaintiff to send out a FLSA collective action notice, a plaintiff needs to make substantial allegations or to provide some factual support that there is a basis for a collective action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice Motion at 6. Olivas argues he has met that standard by providing six sworn statements from him and other C &amp; S Oilfield employees who aver that they and others performed similar work as Olivas performed and were also not paid for overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice Motion at 6-9 (citing Olivas Aff. \u00b6 4, at 2; Holloway Aff. \u00b6 4, at 2; Wright Aff. \u00b6 4, at 2; Ward Aff. \u00b6 4, at 2; Reinhart Aff. \u00b6 4, at 2; Lambertt Aff. \u00b6 4, at 2). Olivas also asks the Court to order C &amp; S Oilfield to provide to Olivas the names and contact information for putative class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice Motion at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   C &amp; S Oilfield responds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs and Conditional Certification, filed April 24, 2017 (Doc. 19)(\"Response\"). C &amp; S Oilfield argues that Olivas' proposed class is too broad, because it \"disregards the duties and level of responsibility of the various job titles and positions as well as the location where such work was performed.\" Response at 3. C &amp; S Oilfield notes that Olivas' affidavits feature sworn statements from lead hands, a tank hand, a hand, and a water transfer technician, but there are no sworn statements or other evidence showing that crew leaders, laborers, crew members, and team leaders are similarly situated to Olivas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. C &amp; S Oilfield also argues that Olivas' request for workers' names and contact information is too broad, and that it should only be required to provide that information for workers who performed the same jobs as Olivas and the workers who provided affidavits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Olivas replies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Reply in Support of Motion for Notice to Potential Plaintiffs and Conditional Certification, filed April 28, 2017 (Doc. 22)(\"Reply\"). Olivas argues that the six sworn statements demonstrate that C &amp; S Oilfield's policy to not pay overtime \"applied to all personnel paid on a salary basis regardless of duties, location or official title.\" Reply at 2 (emphasis omitted). Olivas contends that the six sworn statements \"meet the lenient standard for conditional certification without additional support.\" Reply at 3. Olivas adds that at least twenty other workers \"have self-identified themselves as similarly situated by filing their consents with the court,\" which \"further establish the propriety of Notice and that Defendants failed to pay Plaintiff and all similarly situated field personnel in compliance with the FLSA.\" Reply at 3. Olivas contends that the criteria for granting conditional certification to a proposed class is that the proposed class members include employees in similar positions, and that the defendants made a\n   single decision or enforced a policy to not pay them overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 3-4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

April 20, 2016) (Garza, M.J.) ). Olivas avers that, \"[a]s a matter of corporate policy, Defendants classified all field personnel [that were] paid a salary as exempt from overtime without performing any individualized analysis themselves.\" Reply at 4. Further, Olivas contends that the proposed class is not overly broad, because Olivas and the class had similar job duties, and were paid pursuant to the same payment system that denied them each overtime pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Supplemental Authority\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 23, 2017, Olivas submitted a Notice of Supplemental Authorities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Supplemental Authorities, filed May 23, 2017 (Doc. 23)(\"Notice Supp. Auth.\").
