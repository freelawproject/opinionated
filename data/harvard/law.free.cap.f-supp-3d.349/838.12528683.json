TIGAR, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\") \"deals with one of the oldest and most important themes in our Nation's history: welcoming homeless refugees to our shores,\" and it \"give[s] statutory meaning to our national commitment to human rights and humanitarian concerns.\" 125 Cong. Rec. 23231-32 (Sept. 6, 1979). As part of that commitment, Congress has clearly commanded in the INA that any alien who arrives in the United States, irrespective of that alien's status, may apply for asylum - \"whether or not at a designated port of arrival.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Notwithstanding this clear command, the President has issued a proclamation, and the Attorney General and the Department\n   of Homeland Security have promulgated a rule, that allow asylum to be granted only to those who cross at a designated port of entry and deny asylum to those who enter at any other location along the southern border of the United States. Plaintiff legal and social service organizations, Plaintiffs East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, Al Otro Lado, Innovation Law Lab, and Central American Resource Center of Los Angeles (collectively, the \"Immigration Organizations\"), now ask the Court to stop the rule from going into effect. ECF No. 8. The Court will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country outside a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the INA and the expressed intent of Congress. Whatever the scope of the President's authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden. Defendants' claims that the rule can somehow be harmonized with the INA are not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also, Plaintiffs and the immigrants they represent will suffer irreparable injury if the rule goes into effect pending resolution of this case. Asylum seekers will be put at increased risk of violence and other harms at the border, and many will be deprived of meritorious asylum claims. The government offers nothing in support of the new rule that outweighs the need to avoid these harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court addresses the parties' various arguments, and explores the Court's reasons for granting Plaintiffs' motion, more fully below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

First, their mission has\n   been frustrated in numerous cognizable ways. The record reveals that the government has an established policy of limiting the number of people who may present asylum claims at ports of entry - called \"metering\" - and that this policy currently results in lengthy delays, some eclipsing six weeks.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 8-4 \u00b6\u00b6 32-34; ECF No. 19-1 at 6-10; No. 35-3 at 17-28; ECF No. 35-4 \u00b6\u00b6 5-9; ECF No. 35-5 \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Under this practice, border officials at official ports of entry turn away asylum seekers and other migrants and force them to return at a later date. ECF No. 35-3 at 17 (quoting DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen). The record further establishes that unaccompanied children seeking asylum, who are among the Immigration Organizations' clients, are entirely barred from presenting their claims at a port of entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35-8 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10, 13. Because of the Rule, the Organizations' clients with potentially meritorious asylum claims are significantly delayed or wholly unable to pursue those claims, which are the Organizations' core service. The inability of an organization's constituency to gain access to or participate in the organization's core services is a well-recognized impairment of an organization's ability to function. The en banc Ninth Circuit recognized such an injury to day-laborer organizing entities in\n   <em>\n    City of Redondo Beach\n   </em>\n   , where a local ordinance prohibiting public solicitation of employment prevented day laborers from making their availability known and discouraged potential employers from hiring them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833485\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/936/#p943\">\n    657 F.3d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, the Immigration Organizations' funding is directly tied to their ability to pursue affirmative asylum claims on a per-case basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-3 \u00b6 7; ECF No. 8-4 \u00b6 11; ECF No. 8-7 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. The Rule's impairment of the Organizations' ability to pursue asylum cases therefore impairs their functioning by jeopardizing their funding, an independently sufficient injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Constr. Indus. Ass'n of Sonoma Cty. v.

Plaintiff Al Otro Lado, for instance, has expended significant staff resources to accompany its minor clients full-time in order to safeguard them from various dangers in border towns. ECF No. 35-8 \u00b6\u00b6 14-16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-4 \u00b6\u00b6 38-40; ECF No. 35-3 \u00b6 5.

First, Defendants contend that even if Congress unambiguously stated that manner of entry has no effect on an alien's ability to\n   <em>\n    apply\n   </em>\n   for asylum, it can be the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   factor by which the alien is\n   <em>\n    rendered ineligible.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27 at 26-27. The argument strains credulity. To say that one may\n   <em>\n    apply\n   </em>\n   for something that one has no right to\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   is to render the right to apply a dead letter. There simply is no reasonable way to harmonize the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Clearly, the Attorney General may deny eligibility to aliens authorized to apply under \u00a7 1158(a)(1), whether through categorical limitations adopted pursuant to \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(C) or by the exercise of discretion in individual cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Congress's\n   judgment that manner of entry should have no impact on ability to apply necessarily implies some judgment that manner of entry should not be the basis for a categorical bar that would render \u00a7 1158(a)(1)'s terms largely meaningless. Basic separation of powers principles dictate that an agency may not promulgate a rule or regulation that renders Congress's words a nullity.\n   <em>\n    Mohasco Corp. v.

The asserted distinction is not supported by evidence or authority. And if what Defendants intend to say is that the President by proclamation can override Congress's clearly expressed legislative intent, simply because a statute conflicts with the President's policy goals, the Court rejects that argument also. No court has ever held that \u00a7 1182(f)\"allow[s] the President to expressly override particular provisions of the INA.\"\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

At the moment, aliens may enter and apply for asylum only because the current Proclamation expressly says so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proclamation \u00a7 2(b). By simply incorporating by reference any future proclamations, the Rule gives the President plenary authority to halt asylum claims entirely along the southern border, subject only to the requirements of \u00a7 1182(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   There is little reason to think Congress intended this result. Congress located the President's authority to suspend entry in \u00a7 1182, which governs admissibility, not asylum. To the extent that Congress delegated authority to limit asylum eligibility, it conferred that authority on the Attorney General, who, unlike the President, is subject to the procedural requirements of the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin v.

These harms are both irreparable and likely to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants argue that any harm can be avoided by simply violating the policy, because the only loss then is \"a discretionary benefit to which [asylum seekers] are never entitled\" and \"they remain eligible for mandatory protections from removal.\" ECF No. 27 at 32. This argument ignores several basic facts. First, Congress has determined that the right to bring an asylum claim\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   valuable, regardless of whether it is discretionary. Second, and more importantly, the application of the Rule will result in the denial of meritorious claims for asylum that would otherwise have been granted. That means that persons who are being persecuted on the basis of their religion, race, or other qualifying characteristic, to whom the United States would otherwise have offered refuge, will be forced to return to the site of their persecution. Moreover, aliens who violate the Rule are placed in expedited removal proceedings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C934\">\n    83 Fed.

As discussed extensively throughout this Order, potential asylum seekers are exposed to numerous harms while waiting to present their claims, including not only physical privations like physical assault but also the loss of valuable, potentially meritorious claims for asylum. The Rule, when combined with the enforced limits on processing claims at ports of entry, leaves those individuals to choose between violence at the border, violence at home, or giving up a pathway to refugee status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Court acknowledges Defendants' argument that \"[t]he government's interest in efficient administration of the immigration laws at the border also is weighty.\"\n   <em>\n    Landon v.

The Court must also consider that the Immigration Organizations are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Rule contravenes Congress's judgment to give full consideration to asylum seekers' claims regardless of their failure to comply with entry requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fish v.

The executive's interest in deterring asylum seekers - whether or not their claims are meritorious\n   - on a basis that Congress did not authorize carries drastically less weight, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Defendants also contend that maintaining the Rule serves the public interest because, absent the Rule, aliens will continue to cross the border in a dangerous manner. ECF No. 27 at 32. The Rule's sole reference to the danger presented by crossings appears in a quote from a 2004 rule, with no explanation as to how the situation may have evolved in the intervening fourteen years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55,950 (\"There continues to be an 'urgent need to deter foreign nationals from undertaking dangerous border crossings, and thereby prevent the needless deaths and crimes associated with human trafficking and alien smuggling operations.' \" (quoting Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=69%20Fed.%20Reg.%2044%2C877\">\n    69 Fed. Reg. 44,877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48878 (Aug. 11, 2004) ). The Rule contains no discussion, let alone specific projections, regarding the degree to which it will alleviate these harms. On the other side of the scale, the Court must weigh the extensive record evidence of the danger experienced by asylum seekers waiting to cross in compliance with the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 35-3 at 1-2, 29-32; ECF No. 35-4 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; ECF No. 35-5 \u00b6 5; ECF No. 35-8 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Finally, the Court considers the administrative burden to Defendants of maintaining the status quo. The Court initially notes that \"[a]ny administrative burden [injunctive relief] places on the government is greatly minimized by the fact that the government already has a process in place for adjudicating\" asylum applications for aliens who enter in violation of a Presidential proclamation.\n   <em>\n    Saravia v.
