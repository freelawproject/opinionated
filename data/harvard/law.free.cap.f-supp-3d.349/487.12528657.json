Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of a train derailment that occurred near Hyndman, Pennsylvania in August 2017. Plaintiff Denora Diehl (\"Plaintiff\") filed a Class Action Complaint alleging that Defendant CSX Transportation, Inc. (\"Defendant\") negligently operated its train, causing it to derail. Plaintiff avers that she and other proposed class members (\"Proposed Class\") were subsequently forced to evacuate their homes and subjected to inconvenience as Defendant repaired the derailment site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court is the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant on July 20, 2018. (ECF No. 7.) Plaintiff filed her Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss on August 23, 2018. (ECF No. 22.) Therefore, the instant Motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, this Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENY IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff brings this proposed class action on behalf of Proposed Class, which consists of approximately\n   1,000 other residents of Hyndman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33(a).) Defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Virginia with its principal place of business in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Therefore, there is diversity between Defendant and Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Furthermore, the $5 million amount in controversy requirement is met. Although Plaintiff does not specify the amount of damages sought, Plaintiff brings claims of negligence and private nuisance for herself and on behalf of Proposed Class, alleging that she was forcibly evacuated from her property; deprived of quiet enjoyment of her property; subjected to loss of use of her property; and subjected to inconvenience, fear, anxiety, and mental anguish. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55.) Plaintiff seeks actual and punitive damages for her and Proposed Class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.)

(ECF No. 1.) Defendant filed a Notice of Removal with this Court on June 8, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant then filed the instant Motion to Dismiss and accompanying brief in support thereof on July 20, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 7, 8.)

On August 31, 2018, Defendant filed a Reply in Support of its Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 25), after receiving leave of this Court to do so (ECF No. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Factual Allegations Set Forth in the Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the purposes of deciding Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Court accepts the allegations of Plaintiff's Complaint as true.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to the Complaint, Plaintiff is a resident of and property owner in Hyndman, Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff's allegations can be divided into two parts: the derailment and the aftermath of the derailment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Derailment\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 2, 2017, Defendant was operating a train that was traveling from Illinois to New York, a route that took the train through Hyndman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) This train, which consisted of five locomotives and 178 railcars, was carrying mixed freight, including propane, molten sulfur, asphalt, and phosphoric acid residue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the train approached Hyndman, Defendant's crew stopped the train because it was experiencing air brake problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The crew applied 58 hand brakes during this stop, as the train was on a descending grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Upon inspection, the crew discovered a leak in the brake system, which an employee of Defendant attempted to repair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, according to the Complaint, this repair was unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the course of the inspection and attempted repair of the brake system, a new crew took over for the original crew. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant ordered this new crew to finish the route, and the new crew complied, although the crew knew that the problem with the air brake system persisted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Because the crew members knew that the brake problems continued, they first attempted to operate the train with the 58 hand brakes still applied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) When they were unable to move the train with the hand brakes applied, the conductor released the first 25 hand brakes, leaving 33 hand brakes applied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The crew was then able to move the train, although the Complaint alleges that the crew knew or should have known that operating the train in such a manner was unsafe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the train proceeded to Hyndman, the 35th railcar partially derailed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) However, Defendant's crew continued to operate the train, in spite of the fact that the crew knew or should have known about the derailment and that the continued operation of the train was unsafe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The crew thus dragged the derailed railcar for two miles before reaching a railroad crossing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Upon reaching the crossing, the derailed railcar moved further off the rail, causing the derailment of the 33rd to the 65th railcars near Hyndman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14.) Some of these derailed railcars had been transporting hazardous materials, including propane and molten sulfur (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8), and the derailment of these cars caused a fire that burned for more than two days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Due to the derailment, approximately 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Aftermath of the Derailment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 2, 2017 at 5:00 a.m., Plaintiff evacuated her home due to the derailment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Other residents of Hyndman were also evacuated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Evacuated residents were not permitted to return to their homes for periods of two days to multiple weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) During this period, Plaintiff was forced to leave two dogs unattended in her home for 48 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) After she was reunited with her dogs, she was required to professionally board one of them for approximately two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, by the time Plaintiff returned home, the food in her refrigerator had expired and had to be thrown away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Finally, because of the derailment, Plaintiff was not able to can any vegetables from her garden in 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following Plaintiff's return home, Defendant worked at the derailment site 24 hours a day for three months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Defendant used bright lights to illuminate the site while it was dark; operated heavy machinery, which caused extreme noise; and used machinery to cut, weld, and burn railcars, creating noxious fumes and odors that Plaintiff could smell inside her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's actions caused Plaintiff aggravation, fear, and anxiety; \"rendered the property's ordinary use of physical occupation uncomfortable, unsafe and/or impossible\"; and \"endangered [Plaintiff's] life and health, gave offense to the senses, and prohibited the reasonable and comfortable use of [the] property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-28, 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Specifically, they require Defendant to ensure that 85 percent of the train's cars have operative brakes before moving it, and to ensure that each car has effective air brakes unless the car is being moved for repairs. Furthermore, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated this standard of care by operating the train without effective air brakes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 42.) Therefore, under the first step of the FRSA preemption test, the Court finds that Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated a federal standard of care, such that Plaintiff's claims based on operating without effective brakes avoid preemption.

To this end, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was negligent in \"failing to properly inspect the railcars that derailed and breached before the operation of the Train that resulted in the derailment and fire.\" (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 36(\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ).)

Therefore, the next question is whether Plaintiff's Complaint sufficiently alleges that the invasion of Plaintiff's interest in the use and enjoyment of her property was either intentional and unreasonable or unintentional and negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   With regard to the intentional type of private nuisance, although Plaintiff repeatedly uses the word \"willful\" to describe Defendant's actions in relation to the derailment and evacuation (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6 53), Plaintiff does not allege any facts that make it plausible that Defendant intentionally invaded Plaintiff's interest in the use and enjoyment of her property.

(ECF No. 9 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   However, Plaintiff does sufficiently allege an unintentional private nuisance based on negligence, and aside from Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's negligence claim is not \"otherwise actionable\" because it is barred by the economic loss doctrine, Defendant does not contend that Plaintiff failed to plausibly plead Defendant's liability for negligence.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's crew knew there was a problem with the train's braking system, but that Defendant ordered the crew to operate the train in spite of this problem. (ECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) The crew then operated the train using 33 hand brakes, knowing it was unsafe to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) The unsafe operation of the train caused a railcar to partially derail, and, in spite of the fact that the crew knew or should have known about the partial derailment, the crew continued operating the train, dragging the derailed railcar for two miles before a larger derailment occurred near Hyndman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) This derailment caused Plaintiff to have to evacuate from her home, as well as the other alleged injuries discussed\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22-23.) Accordingly, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Defendant knew the continued operation of the train was unsafe and knowingly disregarded the risk such unsafe operation posed to the inhabitants of Hyndman. Therefore, the Court will deny Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's punitive damages claim. However, the Court may revisit this issue at the time of\n   the filing of motion(s) for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that to the extent Plaintiff's negligence and nuisance claims are based on Plaintiff's allegations regarding the unsafe order of Defendant's rail cars or the noise and fumes created by Defendant's cleanup of the derailment site, Plaintiff's claims are preempted by the ICCTA. Regarding the FRSA, the Court declines to dismiss Plaintiff's claims under the FRSA to the extent those claims are based on alleged violations of duties contained in federal regulations and internal rules created pursuant to those regulations.

The Court also finds that Plaintiff has stated a claim for nuisance under Pennsylvania law, and therefore will not dismiss Plaintiff's nuisance claim. Finally, because Plaintiff has plausibly alleged knowing and outrageous conduct on the part of Defendant that caused the derailment and subsequent evacuation, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiff's punitive damages request at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   A corresponding order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this\n   <em>\n    1\n    <sup>\n     st\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of October, 2018, upon consideration of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 7), and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum Opinion,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 7) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    By Order of June 19, 2018, the Court extended Defendant's response deadline until July 20, 2018.
