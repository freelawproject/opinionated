Plaintiff has filed an \"Opening Brief\" (Doc. 21) that asks the court to reverse the decision denying his visa petition. Plaintiff asks the court to deem the agency's decision as arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. He also asks the court to deem the decision a violation of the United States Constitution, the plain language of the governing statute, and the agency's own policies. After reviewing the administrative record and considering both parties' arguments, the court affirms the USCIS's decision. The court explains why, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties do not dispute the facts of this case, and the court summarizes those facts presented in the parties' briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff and his wife, Soo Jin Schreiber, are both United States citizens. Mrs. Schreiber's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   brother's daughter, Hyebin,\n   was born in South Korea in 1997. Hyebin arrived in the United States on December 15, 2012, when she was 15 years old, on a student visa. She lived with plaintiff and his wife from that point forward and attended school in Lansing, Kansas. Plaintiff and his wife adopted Hyebin, and the District Court of Leavenworth County, Kansas, issued a decree of adoption on November 17, 2014. That Court concluded that Hyebin's biological parents \"freely and voluntarily\" had consented to the adoption. Doc. 16 at 55. Hyebin received her Kansas birth certificate on December 14, 2017. And the United States Department of Defense issued Hyebin a military identification card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that USCIS officials told him that, because Hyebin was a citizen based on the adoption, he needed to file a Form N-600-an Application for a Certificate of Citizenship. Plaintiff filed the form pro se. The USCIS's Kansas City Field Office denied plaintiff's application. Plaintiff alleges that USCIS officials then directed him to file a visa petition for Hyebin-an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative. Plaintiff's I-130 visa petition asked that Hyebin be classified as an immediate relative-specifically, as a \"legitimated\" child-under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 16 at 137-38, 122-26 (plaintiff's arguments for classifying Hyebin as an immediate relative appear in his Memorandum of Law in Support of I-130 Petition for Legitimated Child Under INA 101(b)(1)(C) ). USCIS issued a Notice of Intent to Deny plaintiff's visa petition because Hyebin was more than 16 years old when plaintiff and his wife adopted her. The age cutoff to classify a person as an adopted \"child\" for immigration purposes is 16 years under a different provision of the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(E).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff responded to USCIS's Notice, arguing that Hyebin should be classified as a child under the legitimation category in \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C), instead of under the adoption category in \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   USCIS denied plaintiff's I-130 visa petition. Plaintiff argues that USCIS made the decision \"without any analysis or consideration as to the applicability of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C)\" to the petition. Doc. 21 at 10. Plaintiff then timely appealed USCIS's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). He again argued that Hyebin should be classified as a \"legitimated\" child under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The BIA dismissed plaintiff's appeal. The BIA concluded that the adoption provision categorizing a person as a \"child\" in \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(E) could not apply to Hyebin because her adoption was finalized after she already had turned 16. The BIA also determined that Hyebin could not be categorized as a child under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C)'s legitimation provision because plaintiff had not established that Hyebin is his biological child. The BIA cited\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bueno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%201029\">\n    21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 1997), where the BIA held that, \"to qualify as the legitimated child of the petitioner under section 101(b)(1)(C) of the [Immigration and Nationality Act], the beneficiary must be the biological child of the petitioner.\" Doc. 16 at 68. The BIA noted plaintiff did not argue that he is Hyebin's biological father. The BIA also explained that it had considered the amicus curiae's arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, they had argued that Kansas law recognized adoption as an avenue to establish paternity, but the BIA did not use those arguments as grounds for its decision. Finally, the BIA concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to \"rule on the constitutionality of the laws it administers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%201029\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Matter of Fuentes-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20905\">\n    21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 912 (BIA 1997) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff now argues that the BIA \"denied the appeal without any real analysis.\" Doc. 21 at 10 (referencing the BIA's \"short\" and \"terse[ ]\" four-paragraph opinion). Plaintiff also asserts that neither USCIS nor the BIA has alleged that plaintiff's visa petition or family relationships are fraudulent. Instead, plaintiff contends in this appeal that he has \"no category under which to petition for [the citizenship of] his daughter.\" Doc. 21 at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard and Scope of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff's \"Opening Brief\" (Doc. 21) seeks review under the APA of the BIA's decision denying plaintiff's I-130 visa petition for his daughter. He raises both statutory and constitutional arguments. The APA grants federal courts authority to review agency decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff argues, first, that the plain meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) is unambiguous and that the court should not give any deference to the agency's determination under\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

He makes several arguments why there is no prerequisite biological relationship for a child to become \"legitimated\" under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C). Second, plaintiff contends that the USCIS's denial of his visa petition violates two constitutional provisions: the Fifth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment. After summarizing the parties' arguments, the court addresses them in the sections below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that defendants \"insistently shoehorned\" his visa petition on his daughter's behalf into the adoption provision of the INA ( \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(E) ). He argues that each statutory subsection defining the ways a person can be classified as a \"child\" present alternatives to one another. Plaintiff thus asserts that defendants should have considered his application under the provision he identified in his visa petition: the provision about legitimated children, \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C). The plain language of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C), plaintiff contends, is not ambiguous-and thus deserves no\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference because, \"if Congress's intent is clear, ... the court must give effect to that intent.\" Doc. 28 at\n   9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Heaven v.

But, he notes, the plain meaning of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C) does not contain this language. Docs. 21 at 15, 28 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also, plaintiff argues \" '[l]egitimacy is a legal concept' \" that \"state or foreign entit[ies]\" govern. Doc. 21 at 16 (first quoting\n   <em>\n    Iracheta v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702924\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/419/#p424\">\n    730 F.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (5th Cir. 2013) ). Under Kansas law, plaintiff notes, \"legitimation has long been accomplished in one of three ways, 'includ[ing] ...\n   <em>\n    adoption pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2103.\n   </em>\n   ' \" Doc. 21 at 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Aslin v.

Because Kansas law recognizes adoption as a form of \"creat[ing] a parent-child relationship that cannot be undone,\" plaintiff argues that this state law definition should control whether Hyebin can be classified as a \"legitimated\" child under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C). Doc. 21 at 19. Plaintiff thus asserts that defendants erroneously required a direct biological link between the parent and child at issue before that child's visa petition can qualify under the legitimation provision of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his Reply Brief, plaintiff also argues that the agency's action is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. First, plaintiff asserts that the BIA \"started and ended with the idea that only 'illegitimate' children could be 'legitimated,' \" a proposition, plaintiff argues, that \"arbitrarily limited the plain language of the statute.\" Doc. 28 at 10. Second, plaintiff asserts that, because Congress did not \"charge[ ] the [BIA] with interpreting state legitimating procedures\"-and because state law purportedly controls the definition of legitimation-the court should give no\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference to the agency's decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1483762\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/225/77/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Efagene v.

Plaintiff notes that the agency, in October 2014, began to recognize that a gestational mother carrying a child to whom she does not have a biological connection can be considered \"the 'natural mother' of a child born out of wedlock ... if she is the legal parent at the time of birth.\" Doc. 21 at 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Effect of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) on Immigration and Acquisition of Citizenship Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs.\n   </em>\n   1 (Oct. 28, 2014), https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/Updates/20141028-ART.pdf). Plaintiff argues that, in the context of ART, the agency recognizes non-genetic relationships for purposes of legitimation under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C), and so it also must recognize non-genetic adoptive parents like plaintiff.

First, relying on his Assisted Reproductive Technology (\"ART\") argument, plaintiff asserts that the agency violated his equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that the agency's current policy recognizes non-genetic gestational mothers who formalize relationships with their children after birth, but not non-genetic fathers like plaintiff, who formalized his relationship with Hyebin after her birth. Plaintiff characterizes this difference as unconstitutional disparate treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21 at 21-22. Second, plaintiff argues that the agency's interpretation of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C) violates the Tenth Amendment\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it abridges the states' traditional function as the governmental authority who defines legitimation. Requiring a biological connection between plaintiff and Hyebin, he contends, \"places the State in the position of having to treat its own citizens unequally and giving different value to birth records of foreign children versus U.S. citizen children [who are] adopted in the State of Kansas.\" Doc. 21 at 23. The agency's interpretation, plaintiff asserts, is \"coercive\" and \"threatens [state] sovereignty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also asserts that USCIS's interpretation is contrary to other \"[i]mmigration laws [that] have long recognized the validity of State court orders.\" Doc. 28 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants respond, arguing that the court should disregard plaintiff's Tenth Amendment argument because the agency did not use Kansas law as a basis for its determination. Defendants alternatively argue that, if the court considers plaintiff's Tenth Amendment argument, \"the Supremacy Clause [of Article VI of the Constitution]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   controls the interaction between state laws regarding family law and immigration law.\" Doc. 27 at 25. Defendants also contend that their interpretation of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C) does not disturb state-issued adoption decrees-the agency merely evaluates those decrees in light of federal immigration statutes to determine whether a child is \"legitimated.\" Doc. 27 at 26. Defendants argue that \"Congress could not establish a uniform rule of naturalization if a state court could modify Congress's mandates on qualifications for naturalization.\" Doc. 27 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants also assert that plaintiff did not raise his Equal Protection argument-the argument based on ART-before the agency, and thus the court should not consider it in this limited review. Doc. 27 at 21. Specifically, defendants distinguish between plaintiff's claims about the constitutionality of the agency's interpretation (which the agency has jurisdiction to decide) and constitutional challenges to the statute itself (which, it says, the agency lacks jurisdiction to hear). Doc. 27 at 28. Alternatively, defendants \"do not concede\" (Doc. 27 at 25) that Kansas law defines adoption as a form of legitimation. They also argue that non-genetic gestational mothers carry and give birth to their children, which differentiates these mothers from non-genetic adoptive parents like plaintiff. Doc. 27 at 29-30. The two groups, defendants contend, are not similarly situated for purposes of equal protection analysis. And even if the court decides that the groups are similarly situated, defendants argue, differentiating between them should be subject merely to rational basis review. Doc. 27 at 30. Defendants profess that they easily can articulate sufficient immigration-based grounds to justify different treatment for non-genetic gestational mothers and non-genetic adoptive fathers. Doc. 27 at 30-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the sections below, the court first evaluates whether it can consider plaintiff's arguments about ART and state law definitions of legitimation.

The administrative record shows that plaintiff referenced ART in a footnote in his Brief in Support of Appeal from Denial of I-130 Petition for Alien Relative by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Doc. 16 at 32. In that footnote, plaintiff argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A biological requirement, as the sole [ ] controlling factor has been minimized in context of legitimated children to some degree as of October 28, 2014. USCIS issued policy guidance in the USCIS Policy Manual and Adjudicator's Field Manual outlining that a non-genetic gestational mother (person who carried and gave birth to the child) who is also the child's legal mother may be recognized in the same way as genetic legal mothers are treated under the INA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5623474\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/525/655/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the record does not reflect that plaintiff made any additional argument about ART in the briefing he submitted to the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 16 at 26-35, 122-26 (The court considered the arguments plaintiff made to USCIS in his Memorandum of Law in Support of I-130 Petition for Legitimated Child Under INA 101(b)(1)(C) and to the BIA in his Brief in Support of Appeal from Denial of I-130 Petition for Alien Relative by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. These portions of the agency record show the limited nature of plaintiff's arguments before the agency.). The lone footnote in plaintiff's Brief argued simply that the USCIS had placed less weight on the biological connection between parents and children when it recognized non-genetic gestational mothers under the INA. The footnote is couched in plaintiff's arguments about a case the Tenth Circuit had decided,\n   <em>\n    Pfeifer v. Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1790453\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/41/464/\">\n    41 F.2d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1930), and\n   <em>\n    Pfeifer\n   </em>\n   's discussion of adoption and legitimation under Kansas law. The principal text of plaintiff's argument never mentions ART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   But in his Opening Brief now, plaintiff advances more complex and nuanced constitutional arguments. Namely, he asserts that: (1) because the agency recognized non-genetic relationships in the ART context, it was required to recognize plaintiff's non-genetic relationship with his daughter for legitimation purposes; (2) because non-genetic mothers, in the context of ART, were required to formalize their legal relationship with their children after those children were born, the court should draw a comparison to plaintiff's formalization of the adoption of his daughter; and (3) past BIA determinations requiring a biological connection between parents and \"legitimated\" children are incompatible with the agency's policy statement about ART. But as the administrative record shows, plaintiff merely described the agency's October 28, 2014, policy on ART as a trend toward \"minimiz[ing]\" the biological prerequisite \"in [the] context of legitimated children to some degree.\" Doc. 16 at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff did not present his current arguments to the agency, and thus the agency did not have adequate ability to consider or review them. Merely mentioning the agency's ART policy-which is all plaintiff\n   did during the administrative proceedings-failed to present the detailed arguments that plaintiff raises here in his Opening Brief. He did give the agency notice of his argument that the biological requirement had been \"minimized\" in the ART context. But his cursory references deprived the agency of notice that: (1) plaintiff would ask the agency to treat plaintiff's relationship with his daughter in the same fashion as non-genetic mothers' relationships with their children; (2) plaintiff contended that his adoption formalization was comparable to non-genetic mothers' formalization of their relationships with their children; or (3) plaintiff would assert that the BIA's own decisions are incompatible with the agency's ART policy statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff invokes\n   <em>\n    Darby v. Cisneros\n   </em>\n   , contending that it means he was not required to appeal the Director's decision to the BIA and exhaust that appellate remedy. But the court's inquiry, as described in\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Carbajal\n   </em>\n   , must ask not only whether plaintiff exhausted his remedies; instead, it also must ask whether he exhausted specific arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Carbajal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801471\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/1233/#p1237\">\n    625 F.3d at 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff did not raise the particular ART arguments listed above in his memoranda to the agency. So, no matter how persuasive the court might find plaintiff's detailed ART arguments now, the court cannot consider them.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801471\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/1233/#p1237\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that our Circuit has not considered the merits of arguments not presented to an agency before presenting them for judicial review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The court also concludes that it cannot reach the question whether Kansas law includes adoption as a method of legitimation or whether the agency's interpretation of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C) thus abridges Kansas law.

Here, neither Director Mark Hazuda, who initially denied plaintiff's I-130 visa petition, nor the BIA, on appeal, discussed whether Kansas law defines adoption as legitimation. Doc. 16 at 109-11, 67-69. On June 10, 2016, the Director denied plaintiff's I-130 petition because: (1) Hyebin was more than 16 years old when she was adopted; (2) USCIS had sent plaintiff a Notice of Intent to Deny, asking for evidence that satisfied the requirements for \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(E)'s adoption provision; and (3) Hyebin did not qualify as a \"legitimated\" child under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C) because plaintiff is not her \"natural father.\" Doc. 16 at 109-10. On June 5, 2017, the BIA denied plaintiff's visa petition because: (1) Hyebin \"had already reached the age of 16 at the time of adoption\"; and (2) the BIA's decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Bueno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%201029\">\n    21 I. &amp; N.

The BIA considered but declined to discuss amicus curiae's arguments about Kansas law in the rationale for its decision because\n   <em>\n    Bueno\n   </em>\n   had superseded those arguments. The BIA also ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to address plaintiff's constitutional arguments because it \"does not have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of the law it administers.\" Doc. 16 at 67-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Director and the BIA clearly and adequately stated the grounds for their decisions denying plaintiff's visa petition.

He also contests the agency's interpretation of \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(C) because it allegedly usurped Kansas family law determinations. But these constitutional challenges to the agency's interpretation of the statute-rather than to the statute itself-are \"commit[ted] to administrative agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035018\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/541/249/#p251\">\n    541 F.2d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To be sure, plaintiff's claims here try to present constitutional issues. But none of them is \"coupled with\" any showing that the administrative relief he sought has produced \"threatened or impending irreparable injury\" because of delay. In his Reply Brief, plaintiff notes that he was not required to appeal the Director's denial of his visa petition to the BIA. Yet, plaintiff chose to appeal. Because plaintiff's appeal was a discretionary one, the court cannot conclude that plaintiff faced irreparable injury because of the time it took for him to pursue administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The court thus determines that the agency had jurisdiction to review those claims that plaintiff raised before it. The BIA considered arguments based on Kansas law, but it declined to discuss these arguments as grounds for its determination because of \"controlling precedent\" that required a biological connection between a parent and \"legitimated\" child. Nor can the court decide plaintiff's arguments based on ART or state law control of the definition of legitimation. Those arguments involve challenges to the agency's application of the INA to plaintiff's case, and such arguments are \"commit[ted]\" to the agency.\n   <em>\n    McGrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035018\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/541/249/#p251\">\n    541 F.2d at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Doc. 16 at 80-91. They argued that Kansas law recognizes adoption as one way to establish paternity. They also asserted that Kansas law has moved away from using language such as \"legitimate\" and \"illegitimate\" to describe a child's relationship to her parents. Instead, they contended, Kansas law recently has tended to use language describing children's paternity, and the Supreme Court of Kansas has defined adoption as a method of legitimation.

They also argued that there is no biological prerequisite to establishing a parental relationship, and that adoption is simply one way to do so. They thus concluded that Hyebin should be classified as a \"legitimated\" child because her adoption established such a parent-child relationship. Finally, they asserted that the USCIS decision in this case violated plaintiff's equal protection rights under the United States Constitution because it treated parentage established by legitimation and parentage established by adoption differently.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In his Opening Brief, plaintiff also notes that equal protection rights are applied to state action through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Weinberger v.
