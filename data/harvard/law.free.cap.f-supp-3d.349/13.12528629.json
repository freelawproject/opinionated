Procedural Prerequisites to Forfeiture In Rem\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule G \"governs [ ] forfeiture action[s] in rem arising from a federal statute.\" Supp. R. G(1). Relevant here, Rule G requires the government to (1) file a verified complaint that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"state[s] sufficiently detailed facts to support a reasonable belief that the government will be able to meet its burden of proof at trial,\" Supp. R.

G(3)(b)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, the Court concludes that the government has demonstrated that the applicable requirements of Rule G have been satisfied.

G(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, the Clerk of the Court issued a warrant to arrest the property in accordance with Rule G(3),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Warrant for Arrest\n   <em>\n    In Rem\n   </em>\n   (Apr. 3, 2017), ECF No. 2; Supp. R.

Then, on April 20, 2017, within a reasonable time after filing its complaint, the government published notice of this action on www.forfeiture.com, an official government forfeiture website, for thirty consecutive days in accordance with Rule G(4)(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Publication Decl., Att. 1 (Notice of Forfeiture Action); Supp. R.

Supp. R. G(4)(b)(iii)(A). Here, the government represents that it sent notices to potential claimants via mail and email to addresses known to the government,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Default Aff. \u00b6 5; Gov't's Mem. at 5-6, and received confirmations of receipt from PT Petro, MKS, and U.S. Company 1,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mem. at 6.

First, the notices, which were sent on or about April 20, 2017,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Default Aff. \u00b6 5, satisfy Rule G(4)(b)(i)'s requirement that such notices be sent within sixty days after the government posted notice of this action on an official government forfeiture website, which was on April 20, 2017,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Publication Decl., Att. 1 (Notice of Forfeiture Action);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Supp. R. G(4)(b)(i) (requiring that the notices be sent \"before the end of the time for filing a claim under Rule G(5)(a)(ii)(B)\"); Supp. R. G(5)(a)(ii)(B) (requiring that claims be filed \"no later than [sixty] days after the first day of publication on an official internet government forfeiture site\"). Additionally, the notices satisfied Rule G(4)(b)(ii), which provides that \"[t]he notice[s] must state: (A) the date when the notice is sent; (B) a deadline for filing a claim, at least [thirty-five] days after the notice is sent; (C) that an answer or motion under Rule 12 must be filed no later than [twenty-one] days after filing the claim; and (D) the name of the government attorney to be served with the claim and answer.\" Supp. R. G(4)(b)(ii);\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Supp. Default Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11 (representing that the notices sent to the potential claimants (1) indicated the dates they were sent, (2) stated that any claim must be filed \"within [thirty-five] days of the [g]overment[']s sending of th[e] [n]otice,\" (3) stated that \"claimants must serve and file [a]nswers to the Complaint[ ] ... within [twenty-one] days after filing their [ ] [c]laims,\" and (4) \"w[ere] electronically signed by counsel for the government and listed his mailing address\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In accordance with Rule G(4)(b)(ii)(B), the government's notices to the potential claimants stated that the claimants must file any claim \"within [thirty-five] days of the [g]overment[']s sending of th[e] [n]otice,\" Supp. Default Aff. \u00b6 9, and the notices were sent on April 20, 2017,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Default Aff. \u00b6 5. Thus, the deadline for filing a claim was May 25, 2017. Even calculating the deadline from the date the last notice to Royal Pearls was sent, June 30, 2017,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Gov't's Mem. at 5, any claim had to be filed by August 4, 2017. And, as to any persons to whom the government did not send notice, the deadline was June 19, 2017, which is sixty days after April 20, 2017, the date the government posted notice on www.forfeiture.com.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Publication Decl., Att. 1 (Notice of Forfeiture Action). Although the government, in response to PT Petro's letter and petition for remission filed with the Court, sent PT Petro a letter, dated June 12, 2017, representing that it \"w[ould] not object based on untimeliness should [PT Petro] file a proper claim within [twenty] days of the date of [the government's] letter,\" Gov't's Notice, Ex. 1 (Bateman Letter), PT Petro did not file a claim within that period or at any time thereafter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The government's Complaint also asserts that the co-conspirators' conduct violated the Export Administration Regulations (\"EARs\"),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 1, which it asserts are incorporated into the IEEPA,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20981\">\n     \u00b6\u00b6 10-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, because the Court concludes that the government's allegations establish violations of the IEEPA based on violations of other legal authorities incorporated by the statute, the Court need not determine whether the allegations also establish a violation of the IEEPA based on violations of the EARs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The Complaint's allegations, which are supported by a detailed declaration from Special Agent Katherine Tenaglia,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Gov't's Resp., Ex. 1 (Declaration of Special [FBI] Agent Katherine Tenaglia (Sept. 6, 2018) ), are also sufficient to demonstrate that there exists a \"substantial connection between the [defendant funds] and the [alleged criminal] offense[s]\" as required by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20983\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(3),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
