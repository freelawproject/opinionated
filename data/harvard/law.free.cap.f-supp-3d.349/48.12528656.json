BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   In 1905, Teddy Roosevelt wrote that \"there can be nothing in the world more beautiful\" than the natural wonders of the United States, and \"our people should see to it that they are preserved for their children and their children's children forever.\"\n   <em>\n    Outdoor Pastimes of An American Hunter\n   </em>\n   at 317 (1905). Roosevelt was talking, of course, about those legendary sites that most Americans know: Yosemite Valley, the Canyon of Yellowstone, and the Grand Canyon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But he might have been talking about a less well-known - and only more recently appreciated - natural wonder: the Canyons and Seamounts of the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Like the landmarks the twenty-sixth President had in mind, the Canyons and Seamounts are a \"region of great abundance and diversity as well as stark geographic relief.\" ECF No. 1 (Compl.), Exh. 4 (Proclamation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument) at 1. Dating back 100 million years - much older than Yosemite and Yellowstone - they are home to \"vulnerable ecological communities\" and \"vibrant ecosystems.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. And, as was true of the hallowed grounds on which Roosevelt waxed poetic, \"[m]uch remains to be discovered about these unique, isolated environments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   More than a century after Roosevelt had left office, but in reliance on a conservation statute passed during that time, President Barack Obama proclaimed the Canyons and Seamounts a National Monument. Motivated by the area's \"unique ecological resources that have long been the subject of scientific interest,\" the President sought to protect it for future use and study.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The question before the Court in this case is whether he had the power do so. More specifically, does the Antiquities Act give the President the authority to designate this monument? Plaintiffs are various commercial-fishing associations who argue that it does not for three reasons: first, because the submerged lands of the Canyons and Seamounts are not \"lands\" under the Antiquities Act; second, because the federal government does not \"control\" the lands on which the Canyons and Seamounts lie; and third, because the amount of land reserved as part of the Monument is not the smallest compatible with its management. The Government, backed by intervening conservation organizations and two groups of law professor\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   , disagrees entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court concludes that, just as President Roosevelt had the authority to establish the Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cameron v.

The first covers three underwater canyons that \"start at the edge of the continental shelf and drop thousands of meters to the ocean floor.\" Compl., \u00b6 54.

In that regard, two categories of\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   claims should be distinguished. First, there are those that can be judged on the face of the proclamation. The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Cappaert\n   </em>\n   made such a claim when they argued that the Devil's Pool in Death Valley was not an \"object[ ] of historic or scientific interest\" because it was not archaeological in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174983\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/128/#p141\">\n    426 U.S. at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174983\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/128/#p141\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What is clear about this category, however, is that review would be available only if the plaintiff were to offer plausible and detailed factual allegations that the President acted beyond the boundaries of authority that Congress set.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mountain States\n    </em>\n    , 306 F.3d at 1137 (emphasizing that courts should be \"necessarily sensitive to pleading requirements where, as here, [they are] asked to review the President's actions under a statute that confers very broad discretion on the President and separation of powers concerns are presented\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Lobstermen assert both types of claims here. Their allegations that the submerged lands of the Exclusive Economic Zone are not \"land\" under the Antiquities Acts and are not \"controlled\" by the federal government fall into the first category. The Court can undoubtedly review these claims and decide whether the President acted within the bounds of his authority. Plaintiffs' allegations that the land reserved as part of the monument is not the \"smallest area compatible\" with monument management, however, lie in the second category.

In concluding that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the President acted outside his statutory authority, the Court holds, at least as a formal matter, that Plaintiffs' claims are not subject to further judicial review. Such a determination, as best the Court can tell, is jurisdictional.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Griffith v. Fed.

In other words, the subsequent environmental statutes provided the Executive Branch with a targeted way of addressing similar environmental concerns - the fact that Congress subsequently expanded the Executive's tools to protect the environment, however, did not invalidate Congress's prior authorization to the Executive to designate national monuments.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court concludes that, as in\n    <em>\n     Mountain States\n    </em>\n    , the Antiquities Act's reach is unaffected by subsequent statutory enactments such as the Sanctuaries Act. As the Court interprets them, both Acts address environmental conservation in the oceans. Yet they do so in different ways and to different ends. Begin with the purposes of the Acts. The Antiquities Act is entirely focused on preservation. The Sanctuaries Act, on the other hand, addresses a broader set of values, including \"recreation[ ]\" and the \"public and private uses of the [ocean] resources.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1431\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2), 1431(b)(6). In line with their different purposes, the Acts' regulatory tools also vary. The Antiquities Act provides presidents with a blunt tool aimed at preserving objects of scientific or historic value. The Sanctuaries Act, on the other hand, offers a targeted approach, incorporating feedback from a host of stakeholders and reflecting more tailored conservation measures.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201434\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1434\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(5) (outlining procedures and explaining that commercial fishing, among other private uses, generally permitted). Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, then, the Court's interpretation of the Antiquities Act does not render the Sanctuaries Act redundant. Far from it. Like the Endangered Species Act in\n    <em>\n     Mountain States\n    </em>\n    , the Sanctuaries Act gives the President an important, but more targeted, implement to achieve an overlapping, but not identical, set of goals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Considered in the broader context of Congressional involvement in marine conservation, Plaintiffs' post-enactment-intent argument faces another problem. When Congress passed the Sanctuaries Act in 1972, it acted on a backdrop of presidential practice establishing national monuments on submerged lands, aimed at conserving natural resources.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Stat.%202534\">\n     53 Stat. 2534\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1939) (Glacier Bay Expansion);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Stat.%201441\">\n     76 Stat. 1441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1961) (Buck Island Reef). If the later Congress had a narrower understanding of the Antiquities Act's reach, as Plaintiffs contend, it might be expected to have expressly amended or repealed the Act when it passed the Sanctuaries Act. It did not do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 57-58. The natural inference from Congress's silence is not that it intended to\n    <em>\n     change\n    </em>\n    the Antiquities Act's reach, but that it intended to keep it the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    These circumstances, among others, also show why Plaintiffs' reliance on\n    <em>\n     FDA v.

This case is different. Here, as mentioned, Congress enacted the Sanctuaries Act against the backdrop of the Executive's position that the Antiquities Act reaches submerged lands.

By that point, more presidents had declared marine national monuments, and several of those monuments had been sustained by the Supreme Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 55-58. The response from Congress? Silence.

Recall that presidents may only declare national monuments on land \"owned or controlled by the Federal Government.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20320301\">\n     54 U.S.C. \u00a7 320301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

Opp. at 14. This argument hauls in no more catch than Plaintiffs' prior one about submerged lands. The Court starts by explaining why it disagrees with Plaintiffs' interpretation of \"control\" before articulating why it concludes that the federal government adequately controls the EEZ for purposes of the Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     \"Complete\" Control\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Plaintiffs contend that the phrase \"lands owned or controlled by the federal government\" should be interpreted to mean \"lands owned or\n    <em>\n     completely\n    </em>\n    controlled by the federal government.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.

The ordinary meaning of the word, backed by statutory context and Supreme Court precedent, demonstrates that Congress meant something less than complete control.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The Court starts with the plain meaning of the word \"control.\" Relying on definitions from Webster's First Dictionary, Plaintiffs argue that \"control\" means \"to exercise complete dominion.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20320301\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20320301\">\n     at 14\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Webster's First defines control as follows: \"To exercise restraining or directing influence over; to dominate; regulate; hence, to hold from action; to curb; subject; overpower.\"\n    <em>\n     Webster's New International Dictionary\n    </em>\n    at 490. None of the definitions they cite supports Plaintiffs' understanding. Most of the definitions, including \"to exercise directing influence, regulate, hold\n    from action, curb,\" clearly indicate something less than absolute control. But even the most favorable definitions for Plaintiffs -\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , \"to dominate and overpower\" - arguably suggest something less than complete control. Consider a simple example: If a technology investor said that IBM \"dominated\" the market for laptop computers, one would not understand her to mean that it \"exercised complete dominion\" over the market. Rather, she would be understood to say that IBM is the unrivaled leader in the market, though other companies continue to compete with it. Replace dominate with control and the meaning remains largely the same. Far from supporting Plaintiffs' understanding of control, the dictionary definitions thus suggest a broader interpretation of the term.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In response, the Lobstermen invoke several canons of interpretation.

Rather, the federal government exercises close management and regulation of marine environments in the EEZ.

Another is through fisheries management under laws like the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1801\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    One purpose of that Act is \"to take immediate action to\n    <em>\n     conserve\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     manage\n    </em>\n    the fishery resources found off the coasts of the United States ... by exercising (A)\n    <em>\n     sovereign rights\n    </em>\n    for the purposes of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing\n    <em>\n     all fish, within the exclusive economic zone\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1801(b)(1) (emphases added). Of course, such enactments do not on their own give the federal government the power to establish national monuments in the EEZ - only the Antiquities Act can do that. But they shed light on what\n    <em>\n     kind\n    </em>\n    of control the federal government exercises over the EEZ. As the Court sees it, the fact that the federal government maintains and exercises specific authority under domestic and international law to \"protect the marine environment in the EEZ\" strongly suggests that Congress would have understood the Government to maintain the requisite level of control under the Antiquities Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Op.%20O.L.C.%20183\">\n     24 Op. O.L.C. at 197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (suggesting that federal government's ability to regulate marine environments essential to question of control of EEZ under Antiquities Act).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Third, the federal government's control over the EEZ is unrivaled. As explained, the United States exercises sovereign rights there for a host of purposes, including natural-resource extraction, fisheries management, marine conservation, and the establishment of artificial islands. No other person or entity, public or private, comes close to matching the Government's dominion over that area - whether for the purposes discussed already or for any others. That matters a great deal for understanding the sufficiency of the Government's control over the EEZ. For just as control can be defined by the\n    <em>\n     presence\n    </em>\n    of dominion or authority over something, so the\n    <em>\n     absence\n    </em>\n    of control can be underscored by the presence of someone else's dominion or authority over that same thing. That no one else challenges the federal government's control over the EEZ thus suggests that it possesses, rather than lacks, control of the area.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Yet, as discussed earlier, the Government does not claim to exercise complete control over the EEZ. Other nations may exercise \"the freedoms of navigation and overflight\" there, as well as the \"freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 514(2). But those limitations on U.S. control in the EEZ are not all that different from those in the territorial sea, which the Supreme Court has affirmed\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    controlled by the federal government.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     California\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490426\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/32/\">\n     436 U.S. at 36\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490426\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/32/\">\n     98 S.Ct. 1662\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing\n    <em>\n     California\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"364863\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/332/804/#p805\">\n     332 U.S. at 805\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20S.%20Ct.%2020\">\n     68 S.Ct. 20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). In the territorial sea, as mentioned, foreign ships maintain \"the right of innocent passage\" - defined as passage that is \"not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state.\" Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 513(1)(a)-(b). Foreign ships thus pass through the territorial sea, just as they pass through the EEZ. More broadly, the presence of foreign ships and undersea cables does not vitiate the other forms of Government control of the EEZ, discussed in detail above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    These three considerations demonstrate that, under any of the range of definitions referenced above - to regulate, to dominate, to overpower, to curb, to exercise restraining or directing influence over - the federal government's control here is adequate. It bears mentioning that this conclusion is not novel. In 2000, the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice - in an opinion drafted by Randolph Moss, now a highly regarded judge in this district - concluded, based on very similar considerations, that the federal\n    government controlled the EEZ for purpose of the Antiquities Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Op.%20O.L.C.%20183\">\n     24 Op.

Likewise, several courts, while not deciding the issue raised in this case, have described the EEZ as subject to control of the federal government.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Native Vill. of Eyak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708781\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/154/1090/#p1091\">\n     154 F.3d at 1091\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (United States has \"sovereign control and jurisdiction ... to waters lying between 3 and 200 miles off the coast\");\n    <em>\n     R.M.S.

While the federal government had previously claimed dominion over the area's minerals,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Proclamation No. 2667,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C303\">\n     10 Fed. Reg. 12,303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Oct. 2, 1945), it had not yet claimed the broader authority discussed in detail above. The non-binding case might well have come out differently had it occurred after Reagan's proclamation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    For another, that decision addressed the Antiquities Act's reach with respect to a historic - rather than a scientific - object. As the Office of Legal Counsel has explained, the Government might well have the authority to declare a scientific object in the EEZ to be a national monument to advance conservation goals, yet lack the authority to declare a historic object one to advance historic-preservation goals.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Op.%20O.L.C.%20183\">\n     24 Op. O.L.C. at 196\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is because the Government possesses the sovereign right to regulate the EEZ for purposes of marine conservation, which the Court found persuasive above, yet lacks any sovereign right to regulate or salvage historic objects there. While the Court need not decide the matter, the upshot is that the Fifth Circuit's decision could be correct if decided today and still have no bearing on this Court's conclusion that the President may establish this national monument in the EEZ.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Second, Plaintiffs maintain that the Antiquities Act cannot reach certain territory that was not controlled by the United States when the Act was passed in 1906.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Opp. at 17-18. But Congress did not freeze the Act's coverage in place in 1906. Rather, by referring to \"lands controlled by the U.S. Government,\" the legislature intended for the Act's \"reach [to] change[ ] as the U.S. Government's control changes.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Op.%20O.L.C.%20183\">\n     24 Op. O.L.C. at 191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In line with that understanding, Presidents have declared national monuments in areas that were not under U.S. control in 1906.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Proclamation No. 3443,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Stat.%201441\">\n     76 Stat. 1441\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1961) (Buck Island in the Virgin Islands). Plaintiffs concede that \"Congress anticipated the federal government obtaining additional lands within categories covered by the Act,\" but insist that Congress did not want the Act to extend to \"areas that were categorically ineligible for federal ownership or control in 1906.\" Pl. Opp. at\n    17-18. Any distinction between the two is illusory. The federal government did not control lands in the Virgin Islands in 1906, but once it gained such control, it could declare national monuments there. Likewise, the federal government did not control the waters from 3 to 200 miles off the coast in 1906, but once it gained such control under international and domestic law, it could declare national monuments there. Plaintiffs offer no evidence that Congress would have intended to treat the EEZ and the Virgin Islands any differently - if expansion in U.S. control and ownership can expand the Act's scope as to one, logically it can expand the Act's scope as to the other.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Lobstermen finally resort to a classic slippery-slope argument: If the Act reaches the EEZ, it could reach anywhere, up to and including private property.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 20-21. Plaintiffs can rest easy: The slope, assuming there is one, has plenty of traction. To start, the Court does not understand the Antiquities Act to reach anywhere the Government can regulate. Such a reading would indeed expand the Act's scope to a host of private lands outside the Government's control. Rather, in concluding that the Antiquities Act reaches the EEZ, the Court has emphasized that the Government possesses broad dominion over the area, that it possesses specific regulatory authority over the subjects of the Monument, and that its authority there is unrivaled. The last point particularly addresses Plaintiffs' concern about private property. Had a private person or entity exercised some control or ownership over the EEZ, that would indicate the federal government lacked the requisite control over the area.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 65-66. In all, the Court's narrow reading of \"land controlled by the federal government\" poses few of the hurricane-is-coming concerns Plaintiffs raise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Smallest Area\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Finally nearing harbor, the Court addresses Plaintiffs' fact-specific arguments about the boundaries of the Monument. Recall that the Antiquities Act requires monuments to be \"confined to the smallest area [of land] compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20320301\">\n     54 U.S.C. \u00a7 320301\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). But to obtain judicial review of claims about a monument's size, plaintiffs must offer specific, nonconclusory factual allegations establishing a problem with its boundaries.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mountain States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11441185,3700228\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1132/\">\n     306 F.3d at 1137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Plaintiffs allegations here do not rise to that level.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The Lobstermen offer the following factual allegations about the Monument's size: (1) \"The monuments['] boundaries bear little relation to the canyons and seamounts, thereby prohibiting much fishing outside of these areas that would have no impact on the canyons, seamounts, or the coral that grows on them. Between Retriever and Mytilus Seamounts, for instance, the monument encompasses areas that are dozens of miles from the nearest seamount. Yet in other areas, the monument's boundary lies right next to a seamount excluding areas that are at most only several miles away\"; and (2) \"the monument's canyon unit broadly sweeps in the entire area between the canyons, as well as significant area closer to the shore than the canyons.\" Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 73-74. The crux of the Lobstermen's argument seems to be that the Monument reserves large areas of ocean beyond the objects the Proclamation designated for protection.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11441185,3700228\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1132/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The problem is that this position is based on the incorrect factual assumption that the only objects designated for protection are the canyons and seamounts themselves. The Proclamation makes clear that the \"objects of historic and scientific interest\" include\n    not just the \"canyons and seamounts\" but also \"the natural resources and ecosystems in and around them.\" Proclamation at 2. Insofar as Plaintiffs allege otherwise, the Court need not accept such allegations as true because they \"contradict exhibits to the complaint or matters subject to judicial notice.\"\n    <em>\n     Kaempe v. Myers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5661013,9248894\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/958/\">\n     367 F.3d 958\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 963 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    With that cleared up, it becomes obvious that Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient. Even if it were true that the Monument's boundaries do not perfectly align with the canyons and seamounts, that would not call into question the Monument's size. As Intervenors explain, the Monument's boundaries presumably align with the resources and ecosystems around them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 44 (Intervenors Reply) at 24. Plaintiffs allege no facts to the contrary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The Lobstermen insist that the boundaries cannot be based on the ecosystems and natural resources because they are not \"objects\" under the Antiquities Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl., \u00b6 75.

Cir. 2002) (\"Inclusion of such items as ecosystems and scenic vistas in the Proclamation did not contravene the terms of the statute by relying on nonqualifying features.\"). Plaintiffs also suggest that highly migratory species cannot be designated as monuments under the Act because they are not \" 'situated' upon federal lands.\" Pl. Opp. at 39-40. Their concerns are misplaced: the Proclamation did not designate highly migratory species as objects - it instead so designated the\n    <em>\n     ecosystems\n    </em>\n    surrounding the canyons and seamounts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Proclamation at 2. Insofar as they might relatedly suggest that the ecosystems are not situated on federal lands, they would be mistaken. As the Proclamation explains, the protected ecosystems are formed by \"corals\" and \"other structure-forming fauna such as sponges and anemones\" that physically rest on, and are otherwise dependent on, the canyons and seamounts themselves.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700339,11441205\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1138/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    In all, Plaintiffs offer no factual allegations explaining why the entire Monument, including not just the seamounts and canyons but also their ecosystems, is too large.
