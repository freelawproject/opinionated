For the Plaintiffs, good fortune bestowed upon them the opportunity to purchase a Mercedes-Benz automobile. However, as the reader will soon discover, the blissful relationship between these Plaintiffs and their respective Mercedes-Benz vehicles did not last. Rather, the relationship grew acrimonious due to an interloping third party hidden deep inside the vehicle's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (\"HVAC System\")-mold. As a result, Plaintiffs, Sunil Amin and Trushar Patel (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\"), spurred in large part by the \"noxious, pungent, sour, musty odor\" being emitted \"by the HVAC System\" as well as the \"unexpected, extraordinary, and costly maintenance steps ... necessary to prevent [the mold's] development,\" bring this putative class action against Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (\"MBUSA\"), and Daimler AG (\"Daimler\") (collectively, the \"Defendants\") alleging various state statutory and common law causes of action stemming from \"the design, manufacture, marketing, advertising, selling, warranting, and servicing\" associated with the \"heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems installed in certain categories of vehicles designed and manufactured by Daimler.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Complaint (\"Compl.\") (Doc. 1). Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the HVAC System installed in these vehicles harbors a \"serious design defect that causes the HVAC System to (a) accumulate mold and mildew residue or growth within the HVAC System; (b) emit a moldy or mildew odor that permeates the vehicle cabin when the HVAC System is activated; and (c) cause\n   the Vehicle's passenger cabin to be unbearable and thus unusable for its intended purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Plaintiffs have interposed the following causes of action against Daimler: (1) violations of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act ( O.C.G.A. Section 10-1-390 ) (Count V); (2) violations of Georgia's Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act ( O.C.G.A. Section 10-1-370 ) (Count VI); (3) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Count VII); (4) Fraud by Concealment (Count VIII) and (5) Unjust Enrichment (Count IX).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs seek damages, declaratory and injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Relief Requested).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently before the Court is Daimler's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion [Doc 41]. Plaintiffs oppose the motion.

Specifically, Daimler maintains that Plaintiffs' pleading runs afoul of Rule 8(a) for two reasons: (1) \"[e]ach of the Complaint's nine counts incorporates by reference all of the allegations that come before it in the Complaint\" making it \"impossible to discern which allegations are relevant to which count\" and (2) the Complaint \"repeatedly uses the term 'Mercedes' to refer indiscriminately to both Daimler [ ] and MBUSA\" and that \"[a]s a result, it is impossible for Defendants to know which conduct Plaintiffs allege as the basis for Daimler['s] liability and which conduct Plaintiffs allege as the basis for MBUSA's liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. In addition, Daimler asserts that this \"grouping\" of Daimler and MBUSA into a single fictitious entity named \"Mercedes\" is \"especially egregious with respect to their fraud-based claims, which are subject to the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs assert that Daimler, in its \"shotgun\" pleading attack, has \"completely disregard[ed] Plaintiffs' core theory of agency liability-that Daimler directed and acted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, MBUSA-including the Complaint's [ ] allegations that MBUSA was Daimler's agent for purposes of marketing, sales, warranty claims, and customer relationships....\" Pls.' Opp'n at 3-4 (citing Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 42-46).

Opp'n at 4. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant's \"shotgun\" pleading attack fails because: (1) \"any concerns about a failure to distinguish between defendants are eliminated where [ ] a defendant is alleged to have violated the law by acting through its agent\" and in this case the Complaint \"fairly apprises Daimler of its liability for all [of] the allegations against 'Mercedes'-which includes both defendants-detailed in the Complaint;\" (2) the claims are \"plead[ed] in abundant detail, articulating a clear factual basis for their allegations;\" (3) \"Daimler has received abundant notice of the claims and legal theories at issue in this case\" since both \"Daimler and MBUSA-represented by the same counsel-filed substantive [ ] Rule 12(b)(6) motions rather than moving for a more definite statement in this case (or in\n   <em>\n    Bhatt\n   </em>\n   ), demonstrating that they had no difficulty responding to Plaintiffs' pleading;\" and (4) \"Complaints that give defendants adequate notice of the claims against them need not be dismissed as shotgun pleadings even if they reincorporate prior paragraphs in each cause of action\" and, in any event, \"Daimler itself employs these same pleading conventions when it files litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-19 (citing complaints filed by Daimler in two federal district court cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In reply, Daimler asserts that (1) even recognizing Plaintiffs' agency theory, the Complaint still constitutes a \"shotgun\" pleading since \"such allegations do not excuse Plaintiffs' failure to distinguish between multiple defendants\" and thus \"are insufficient to meet the pleading standard of Rule 8\" and (2) Even if Plaintiffs' agency theory were able to cure the alleged pleading insufficiency, the Complaint, according to Daimler, fails to sufficiently plead an agency relationship as between Daimler (as principal) and MBUSA (as agent).

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Initially, the Court points out that it is somewhat troubled and vexed by Daimler's \"shotgun\" pleading attack at this juncture since, in light of the pendency of this litigation, in which the Court has already adjudicated a motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) filed by MBUSA (represented by the same counsel as Daimler), as well as the parallel action in\n   <em>\n    Bhatt et al. v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2:16-cv-03171, presently pending in the Central District of California which involves identical defendants and nearly parallel claims, the Court finds Daimler's assertions, which profess a state of utter confusion as to \"which allegations are relevant to which count\" and \"which conduct Plaintiffs allege as the basis for Daimler['s] and which conduct Plaintiffs allege as the basis for MBUSA's liability\" to be, at best, disingenuous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While it is true that Plaintiffs' Complaint does \"incorporate by reference each allegation set forth in the preceding paragraphs,\"\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.

Indeed, the balance of Daimler's own motion, which segues from a Rule 8(a)(2) attack into a traditional 12(b)(6) attack, belies any such notion. Rather, if the Complaint was so incomprehensible such that Daimler had no fair notice of the specific claims being interposed and the grounds upon which those claims rest, the Court finds it improbable that Daimler would be able to formulate coherent arguments as to why each of Plaintiffs' individual causes of action fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Yet, after leading the charge with the instant argument, which encompasses 11 of the total 18 pages of its argument section, that is precisely what Daimler has done here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 16-21;\n   <em>\n    Abrams v.

Indeed, defendants' own filings in support of their Rule 12(b) Motion reveal that they understand, at least in general terms, the nature of the claims against them.

If the mere utilization of such an unwelcome-but-pervasive pleading device mandated that a complaint be jettisoned as a shotgun pleading, then precious few civil pleadings would survive. The defining defect in shotgun pleadings is not incorporation by reference\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , but is instead the net effect that it is \"virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v District Bd. of Trustees of Cent.

For that reason, the Complaint will not be dismissed as a shotgun pleading merely because of the incorporation-by-reference language.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The same conclusion attaches to Ameri-Force's objection that in certain places the Complaint refers to \"Defendants\" generically, rather than specifying which defendant is alleged to have done what. From reviewing the Complaint as a whole, the Court finds no realistic likelihood that Ameri-Force will be confused or unable \"to decipher with reasonable specificity which acts or omissions are alleged against it.\" (Doc. 11, at 18.)

Plaintiffs argue that they have alleged harm that is both ongoing and will likely occur in the future.\" Order at 32-33. Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that \"the denial of the defect by Mercedes and the regular, periodic charging of Class Members for temporary 'band-aid' fixes - flushing the system and changing the air filters - are deceptive trade practices.\" (citing Compl. \u00b6 7). Based upon these allegations the Court determined that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that they are \"likely to be damaged by [this] deceptive trade practice.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-373(a).

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In support of their unjust enrichment claim, Plaintiffs assert the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   251. Mercedes has been unjustly enriched by the Plaintiffs and Class Members through Plaintiffs' and Class Members' purchasing and/or leasing Class\n   Vehicles from Mercedes and purchasing replacement parts and service from Mercedes that Plaintiffs and Class Members would not have purchased but for the HVAC System Defect and Mercedes's concealment of the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   252. Plaintiffs and Class Members unknowingly conferred a benefit on Mercedes of which Mercedes had knowledge, since Mercedes was aware of the defective nature of its Class Vehicles' HVAC Systems and the resultant moldy odor problems, but failed to disclose this knowledge and misled Plaintiffs and the Class Members regarding the nature and quality of the subject Class Vehicles while profiting from this deception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   253. The circumstances are such that it would be inequitable, unconscionable, and unjust to permit Mercedes to retain the benefit of revenue that it unfairly obtained from Plaintiffs and Class Members. This revenue include the premium price Plaintiffs and the Class paid for the Class Vehicles and the cost of the parts and service bought from Mercedes used to temporarily alleviate the moldy odor emitted by the HVAC Systems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   254. Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class, having been damaged by Mercedes's conduct, are entitled to recover or recoup damages as a result of the unjust enrichment of Mercedes to their detriment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 251-254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In light of the above facts, which, similar to Plaintiffs' other substantive claims, are based upon an agency theory of liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 25 (such theory having been plausibly pleaded at this stage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1357-58), the Court finds Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim for unjust enrichment. Specifically, Plaintiffs have pleaded (1) conferral of a benefit upon Daimler (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , purchase and/or lease of Class Vehicles and purchase of parts and service); (2) that Daimler had knowledge of the benefit via the purported agency relationship (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , since Daimler, as the alleged principal, \"was aware of the defective nature of its Class Vehicles' HVAC Systems and the resultant moldy odor problems, but failed to disclose this knowledge and misled Plaintiffs ... regarding the nature and quality of the ... Class Vehicles while profiting from this deception\") and (3) that Daimler's retention of the benefit (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"revenue\" including \"the premium price Plaintiffs ... paid for the Class Vehicles and the cost of the parts and service bought [from Daimler and] used to temporarily alleviate the moldy odor emitted by the HVAC System\") would, under the above circumstances, be unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   While Daimler attempts to attack Plaintiffs' allegations based upon the fact that no\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   benefit has been conferred, the Court finds this argument without merit since the conferral of direct benefit as opposed to indirect benefit is not required to adequately plead a cause of action sounding in unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146488\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/838/1340/#p1366\">\n    838 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1367 ;\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286785\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/899/1259/#p1268\">\n    899 F.Supp.2d at 1268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, while Daimler also attempts to impugn the sufficiency of this claim based upon the assertion that Daimler had no knowledge of the benefit, this argument fails for two reasons: (1) taking as true Plaintiffs' allegations of agency, any knowledge of the benefit, even if conferred directly on MBUSA, would nevertheless be imputed to Daimler as the principal; and, in any event (2) the nature and extent of Daimler's knowledge, in this regard, requires a factual inquiry that is not ripe for adjudication at this stage of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   At this point in the litigation, the Court takes Plaintiffs' well-pleaded allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in their favor. Having done so, and in light of the foregoing analysis, the Court finds Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded a claim\n   for unjust enrichment and Daimler's motion to dismiss is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . As stated previously, whether Plaintiffs can come forward with sufficient evidence to prove up this claim is another matter. The Court holds only that they be given the chance to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   For the foregoing reasons Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 41] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety.
