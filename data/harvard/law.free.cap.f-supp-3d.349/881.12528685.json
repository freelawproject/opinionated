BREYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 18, 2015, the public learned that Volkswagen had been selling diesel cars in the United States since 2009 that were equipped with emission cheating software. Litigation ensued and VW quickly settled claims brought by consumers who owned or leased the cars as of September 18. This order addresses a lawsuit by a putative class of consumers with whom VW has not settled: consumers who had owned or leased an affected car but who resold the car or exited the lease before September 18. VW contends that these consumers were not injured by the fraud because they did not experience a drop in the resale value of the cars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The former owners rely on a well-accepted theory of injury (overpayment) but with a novel twist. They acknowledge that the price of the cars was likely inflated not only when they purchased them, but also when they resold them. Yet they contend that they did not recover all of their overpayment through resale because a portion of the premium they paid for a low-emission vehicle depreciated. To be clear, the former owners do not assert that their injury is equal to the entire amount by which the cars depreciated, only that a portion of the low-emission premium depreciated and that, because the premium was for a feature the cars never had, this extra depreciation is a loss that is attributable to VW's deceit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on these relatively unique allegations-where consumers each purchased a car, a well-known depreciating asset, where they each paid a premium for a feature they did not receive, and where they resold the cars before learning that\n   the feature was missing-the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have alleged an injury that is sufficiently concrete to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing. Whether this depreciation-based injury can be accurately quantified and whether the former owners' losses are more than de minimis remains to be seen. But what matters at the pleading stage is that the fact of damage, rather than the amount of damage, is not speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A variety of other issues are also addressed in this order, including whether other injury allegations are sufficiently concrete, whether Plaintiffs' RICO claims against Robert Bosch GmbH and Robert Bosch LLC are well pled, whether state law claims against VW are preempted or alternatively fail to satisfy Rules 8(a) and 9(b), and whether certain of the state law claims fail for miscellaneous reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2009, VW began selling its VW and Audi branded TDI \"clean diesel\" vehicles, which it marketed as being low-emission, environmentally friendly, fuel efficient, and high performing. (Compl. \u00b6 6.) Concealed was the fact that VW had installed software in these cars that caused their emission controls to perform one way during emissions testing, and another (less effective) way during normal driving conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203.) During regular on-road use, the cars are alleged to have emitted nitrogen oxides (NOx) at levels that were sometimes 40 times higher than EPA's legal limit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 203.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 18, 2015, the public learned of the fraud when EPA issued a Notice of Violation to VW, alleging that the company's use of the defeat device violated the Clean Air Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 344.) Consumers nationwide responded by filing hundreds of lawsuits. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred those cases here. The Court then appointed Lead Plaintiffs' Counsel and a Plaintiffs' Steering Committee (PSC), which filed a consolidated class action complaint against VW, related entities, and Bosch (who allegedly assisted in developing and implementing the defeat device). The consolidated complaint was on behalf of all persons and entities in the United States who purchased or leased an affected vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1804 \u00b6 424.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Settlement talks began almost immediately, and VW and Bosch soon agreed to a series of settlements to compensate consumers who were registered owners or lessees of the cars as of September 18, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 2102, 3229, 3230.) Excluded from the settlement class definitions were Plaintiffs here: all persons and entities in the United States who \"owned, leased, or otherwise acquired\" an affected vehicle but who \"no longer owned, held an active lease for, or otherwise had a legal interest in that Eligible Vehicle on or after September 18, 2015.\" (Compl. \u00b6 401.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit after the Court approved the PSC-led settlements. They contend that VW, VW related entities (such as Audi), Bosch, and certain individual defendants engaged in a racketeering enterprise in violation of RICO, and that VW also violated 21 states' consumer protection and false advertising laws by deceiving consumers about its vehicles. The complaint also includes a claim for violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, but Plaintiffs have agreed not to pursue that claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n, Dkt. No. 4713 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   VW and Bosch have filed motions to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To have standing to sue in federal court, Plaintiffs must establish (1) that they have suffered an injury in fact, (2) that their injury is fairly traceable to Defendants' conduct, and (3) that their injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

First, they contend that they overpaid to purchase and lease the class vehicles-paying a \"clean diesel\" premium for cars that were supposed to, but did not, have low emissions. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 379-82.) Second, they contend that they paid financing and leasing fees for the class vehicles, which they would not have paid, or which would have been less, had they known about the cars' actual emission levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 383.) Third, they contend that even if they did not each pay a premium to buy or lease a class vehicle, they were still injured because they never would have bought or leased the cars in the first place if they had known about the fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 384.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   VW argues that the allegations are insufficient to support an injury in fact under any of these theories. In ruling on VW's challenge, which is a facial challenge to federal jurisdiction, the Court \"must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.\"\n   <em>\n    Warth v. Seldin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p501\">\n    422 U.S. 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p501\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9528\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/490/#p501\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Payment of a \"Clean Diesel\" Premium\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In considering whether Plaintiffs were injured by paying a \"clean diesel\" premium, the Court discusses former owners and former lessees of the class vehicles separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Former Owners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they overpaid for the class vehicles because they paid a premium for a feature-low emissions-that they did not receive. When a consumer overpays for a product because of the seller's conduct, the overpayment is ordinarily \"a quintessential injury-in-fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Maya v. Centex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836770\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1060/#p1069\">\n    658 F.3d 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1069 (9th Cir. 2011). But the purchasing Plaintiffs here are in a unique situation, because they resold the class vehicles before VW's emissions fraud was public knowledge. So even though they purchased the cars at a price that did not take into account the fraud, they also sold them at a price that did not take into account the fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 4 (acknowledging that, because they sold the class vehicles before VW's fraud was known, Plaintiffs \"might have escaped the ... injury of lost resale value\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by arguing that, although they sold the cars before they or the new purchasers knew about the emissions fraud, they were not able to recover the entire \"clean diesel\" premium through\n   resale. The reason they were not able to do so, they argue, is because of depreciation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Of course, vehicle depreciation is a fact of life: as vehicles age they decline in value, and this decline is not a loss that is treated as an injury by the law. But Plaintiffs do not argue that VW is somehow responsible for the natural depreciation of the class vehicles; what they argue is that they were not able to fully recover the premium VW charged for the cars because a portion of the premium effectively depreciated. And because the premium was for a feature they did not receive, Plaintiffs contend that they were injured by the amount of the premium that they were not able to recover through resale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is easiest to understand Plaintiffs' argument through examples. Assume that the purchase price of a new VW car without a \"clean diesel\" premium is $30,000. If the value of the car depreciates by 20% during the first year, its value will decline by $6,000, leaving a resale value of $24,000.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-30\"><strong>Scenario 1: No \"Clean Diesel\" Premium</strong> Purchase price $30,000 Depreciation rate 20% Value after 1 year $24,000 Decline in value from original purchase price <strong>$6,000</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Now assume that the same car is sold with a \"clean diesel\" premium of $6,000. Using the same 20% depreciation rate, the car's value will now decline by $7,200 during the first year, leaving a resale value of $28,800.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-32\"><strong>Scenario 2: \"Clean Diesel\" Premium</strong> Purchase price ($6,000 premium) $36,000 Depreciation rate 20% Value after 1 year $28,800 Decline in value from original purchase price <strong>$7,200</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The \"clean diesel\" premium increased depreciation. This is because of the relationship between vehicle purchase price and depreciation: assuming the depreciation rate is fixed, a higher purchase price will invariably lead to a higher depreciation amount. In Scenario 2, the \"clean diesel\" premium raises the vehicle purchase price from $30,000 to $36,000. Multiplying this $6,000 increase by a 20% depreciation rate, the premium also raises year one depreciation by $1,200. Or put differently, the premium itself depreciates by 20% after one year of use: a consumer pays $6,000 for \"clean diesel\" attributes and, if sold after one year, sells those attributes for $4,800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In a market without fraud, the $1,200 difference in depreciation between a\n   $30,000 car and a $36,000 car would simply reflect a cost of buying a more expensive depreciating asset. But if the increase in the purchase price is attributable to a premium charged by the seller for a certain feature, and the car does not have that feature, then the $1,200 increase plausibly represents a loss that is attributable to the seller's deceit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that this is what happened to them. They allege that they paid a premium for VW's vehicles, not knowing that the vehicles lacked a feature-low emissions-that supported the premium. And even though they sold these cars before the emissions fraud came to light, they were not able to recover the entire premium because, by increasing the cost of the cars, the premium also increased the amount by which the cars depreciated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Neither Plaintiffs nor VW has cited to any decision in which a court has either accepted or rejected this depreciation-based theory of injury. The case that is most analogous, a case VW cites, is\n   <em>\n    Licul v. Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-61686-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206328734\">\n    2013 WL 6328734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. Dec. 5, 2013), where the court held that the original purchaser of a latently defective vehicle did not suffer a loss when she resold the vehicle before the defect was discovered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (\"[Plaintiff] purchased the Jetta at a price that did not take account of the defect, and she sold the Jetta at a price that did not take account of the defect.\"). But the\n   <em>\n    Licul\n   </em>\n   court did not consider the effect of depreciation on the potential resale value of the vehicle there; nor did the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Licul\n   </em>\n   allege that she paid a specific premium for an attribute that she did not receive.\n   <em>\n    Licul\n   </em>\n   is therefore not particularly instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   VW also attempts to link this case with two other lines of cases, but neither line is implicated here. First, VW compares Plaintiffs to \"in-and-out traders\" who buy and sell stock before fraud by the issuer is revealed. Courts have held that traders like these are not injured by their stock purchase.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p342\">\n    544 U.S. 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p342\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p342\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (holding that stock purchasers do not suffer a loss the moment they purchase stock at an inflated price due to the issuer's fraud, but only when they sell the stock after \"the truth makes its way into the marketplace\"). The analogy with this case is inapt because, unlike vehicles, stock does not naturally depreciate. So even if a trader purchases stock for a premium on account of fraud, none of the premium will be lost if the trader sells the stock before the fraud is revealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, VW compares this case to those in which consumers have alleged that they overpaid for defective vehicles, even when the defect has not manifested and is unlikely to manifest in the future. Courts have dismissed cases based on claims like these for failure to establish an injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cahen v. Toyota Motor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269688\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/147/955/#p968\">\n    147 F.Supp.3d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (dismissing complaint when \"plaintiffs [did] not allege that any consumer, outside the realm of controlled experiments, has ever been a victim of [the harm that might be caused by the alleged defect]\"),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=717%20F.%20App%27x%20720\">\n    717 F. App'x 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Tae Hee Lee v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325284\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/992/962/#p972\">\n    992 F.Supp.2d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972 (C.D. Cal. 2014) (dismissing complaint when plaintiffs acknowledged that the vehicle systems they challenged \"perform[ed] as described\"). These cases do not shed light on Plaintiffs' depreciation-based theory of injury; they are also clearly distinguishable. Underlying these no-injury defect cases is a critical eye toward allegations of overpayment for vehicles that essentially work as advertised. That is not the case here. Plaintiffs allege that the class vehicles\n   emitted NOx at levels up to 40 times the legal limit from the moment they were put in use. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 203.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   VW also cites to the declaration of Professor Robert H. Klonoff that the PSC submitted in support of the prior consumer settlements. Professor Klonoff, a law professor, stated there that \"individuals who sold their vehicles prior to disclosure of the fraud ... suffered no economic harm, since they sold their vehicles before the announcement of the fraud and the resulting price drop of the vehicles.\" (Dkt. No. 1976-1 \u00b6 79.) This evidence is not helpful to VW here for three reasons. First, it does not appear that Professor Klonoff considered the effects of depreciation in his analysis. Second, the declaration is outside the complaint and VW does not claim to be mounting a factual attack on standing such that the Court could rely on extrinsic evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9236006\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/373/1035/#p1039\">\n    373 F.3d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 (9th Cir. 2004). And third, Professor Klonoff does not purport to be an expert on economics or vehicle depreciation, so he may not be sufficiently qualified to render an expert opinion on the depreciation question at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Without any caselaw on point, the ultimate question is whether, when the allegations are taken as true, Plaintiffs have identified a \"concrete and particularized\" injury.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There are two questions that must be answered to make this determination here. First, is the theory of injury plausible? Second, are the allegations sufficient to support that Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   pay a premium for the class vehicles and that they did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   get what they paid for?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The two scenarios laid out above answer the first question affirmatively. These scenarios illustrate that when a premium is charged for a depreciating asset, the premium will plausibly increase the total amount by which the asset depreciates. And if the premium is for a feature that the asset does not actually have, then the original purchaser cannot recover the full value of the premium through resale because of depreciation. The amount of the premium that is unrecoverable plausibly constitutes overpayment, which is \"a quintessential injury-in-fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Maya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836770\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/1060/#p1069\">\n    658 F.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The second question (which has two subparts) requires an examination of the actual facts alleged rather than of hypotheticals. Subpart one: do the allegations support that Plaintiffs paid a premium for the class vehicles? They do. The class vehicles are VW's 2.0-liter and 3.0-liter TDI diesel engine vehicles, model years 2009\n   through 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9.) Plaintiffs allege that VW charged 7 to 27 percent more for the 2.0-liter TDIs over the non-diesel versions. (Compl. \u00b6 379.) As an example, they highlight the 2015 Passat. The non-diesel version started at $21,340, while the diesel version started at $27,100, a price that was approximately 27 percent higher and $6,000 more than the non-diesel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Fewer specifics are offered for the 3.0-liter vehicles. But because the distinguishing characteristics of the cars, which are discussed more below, were allegedly the same for both the 2.0-liter and 3.0-liter versions, it is plausible that these cars also sold for a premium. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 302 (alleging that in 2012 VW used the same \"clean diesel\" brochure for six models of TDIs then on the market, one of which was the Touareg, a 3.0-liter model).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Subpart two: do the allegations support that Plaintiffs did not get what they paid for in return for the premium? They do. Plaintiffs allege that they paid a premium for \"low-emission, environmentally friendly vehicles, with high fuel economy and exceptional performance.\" (Compl. \u00b6 6.) They also allege that, in fact, the class vehicles emitted NOx, a toxic pollutant that produces smog and leads to environmental and health problems, at levels up to 40 times the legal limit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 203.) Given the cars' NOx emissions, it would be reasonable for the trier of fact to conclude that the cars were not \"low-emission\" or \"environmentally friendly\" as advertised. It is therefore plausible that Plaintiffs paid a premium for something they did not receive. And given the workings of depreciation, it is also plausible that they did not recover the entire amount of this premium through resale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   VW responds by flagging what it argues are shortcomings with Plaintiffs' pleading of the \"clean diesel\" premium. The first of these, VW argues, is that the complaint \"lacks any factual allegations showing that any portion of the difference-let alone the entire difference-in price between the TDI and gasoline vehicles stems specifically from\n   <em>\n    lower NOx emissions\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to other factors.\" (VW Mot., Dkt. No. 4534 at 37.) Because of this, VW contends that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled that they paid a premium for something that they did not receive-a vehicle with lower NOx emissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It is true that Plaintiffs have not pled that they paid a premium specifically for lower NOx emissions. Yet they do not need to. For if they each paid a premium for a low-emission vehicle, and they each received a vehicle that emitted unreasonably high amounts of NOx, it would be reasonable to conclude that they did not get what they paid for. This is because a premium for low emissions reasonably can be viewed as covering\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   vehicle emissions, including NOx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As alleged, there is also no reason to doubt that Plaintiffs each paid a premium for a car with low emissions. The complaint includes detailed allegations about how low emissions were \"the identifying characteristic\" of the class vehicles and formed the basis for VW's marketing of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 380.) Plaintiffs explain that diesel engine cars were known to have better fuel efficiency than gasoline engine cars, but that diesel's Achilles' heel was its emission of \"thick, toxic smoke full of dangerous and destructive pollutants.\" (Compl. \u00b6 181;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185.) Through \"millions of dollars in research and development,\" VW claimed to have solved these \"environmental problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 179.) And VW's asserted breakthrough was a key point that it championed in advertising. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 290 (advertising that the Jetta TDI had \"Ultra low emissions\"); \u00b6 302 (advertising that \"[t]hese are not the\n   kind of diesel engines that you find spewing sooty exhaust like an old 18-wheeler\").) Plaintiffs' assertion that they paid a premium for a low-emission vehicle is entirely plausible in light of these allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   VW next notes that the alleged premium was not just for a vehicle with low emissions, but also for a vehicle with \"high fuel economy\" and \"exceptional performance.\" (Compl. \u00b6 6.) As to these other features, VW contends that there are no well-pled allegations supporting that the class vehicles did not provide what was promised. So, VW asserts, the amount of money that Plaintiffs paid specifically for a low-emission vehicle is speculative, and the amount that was not recovered through depreciation is even more speculative, making Plaintiffs' injuries entirely \" 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical' \" rather than \"actual or imminent\" as required to satisfy Article III.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   If, as alleged, low emissions was one of several features in a \"clean diesel\" package for which Plaintiffs paid a premium, it indeed may be challenging for Plaintiffs to prove the amount that they paid specifically for low emissions. And it is doubtful that Plaintiffs' overpayment would have been equivalent to the entire cost of the package if the package also included features that Plaintiffs received. Each Plaintiff's overpayment, then, may have only represented a fraction of the $6,000 average premium paid for the \"clean diesel\" package. And their economic losses were likely even less because they probably recovered most of the premium through resale. Only the amount of the premium that depreciated and could not be recovered through resale would be a concrete injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At this stage in the proceedings, however, these concerns are premature.

Cal. Aug. 11, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The fact of damage is not speculative here. When the allegations are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, it is plausible that some portion of the $6,000 average \"clean diesel\" premium was for a vehicle with low emissions, which is a feature that the class vehicles did not have. These allegations, combined with the plausible theory that a portion of the premium depreciated before Plaintiffs resold the cars, are sufficient at the pleading stage to support an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Former Lessees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The proposed class also includes persons who leased a VW TDI vehicle if their lease ended before September 18, 2015. Plaintiffs contend that these former lessees were also harmed by the emissions fraud because VW used its vehicles' initial purchase prices to set lease payments, and for the class vehicles the initial purchase prices were inflated by the \"clean diesel\" premium. Each lease payment, then, contained an amount that Plaintiffs contend was directly attributable to the inflated premium, and Plaintiffs assert that class members \"were injured in that amount, which they paid for a feature they did not receive.\" (Compl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The former lessees' premium-related injury theory is more straightforward than the former owners' theory. Unlike former owners, former lessees did not have the opportunity to resell the class vehicles because they did not own them. So even though their leases ended before VW's fraud was known, they were plausibly injured if, as alleged, their lease payments were artificially inflated by a premium for a low-emission vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   VW nevertheless challenges the former lessees' theory, noting that the lease payments for each vehicle were allegedly based on the difference between the vehicle's initial purchase price and \"residual value,\" with the residual value being the vehicle's estimated value at the end of the lease term. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204755335\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (acknowledging that lease rates were based in part on the vehicles' residual value).) Because of this, VW argues that even if the purchase price of the cars was inflated when Plaintiffs entered into their leases, so was the residual value, as both values would have taken into account the \"clean diesel\" premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   VW is correct that, based on the lease formula that Plaintiffs identify, both the initial purchase price and the residual value of the class vehicles would have included an amount attributable to the \"clean diesel\" premium. But VW overlooks that the residual value also would have plausibly taken into account depreciation. Because of depreciation, the value of the premium would be expected to decline between the initial purchase price and the\n   residual value, which would mean that lease payments would have been higher because of the premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Examples are again helpful. Assume a $30,000 purchase price for a new VW car without a \"clean diesel\" premium, a 20% depreciation rate, a one-year lease, and monthly lease payments. Using the formula that Plaintiffs allege VW used, the total lease amount will be equal to the difference between the initial purchase price ($30,000) and the residual value of the car after one year. In this example, the residual value will be $24,000, as the car will decline in value by 20% after one year due to depreciation. The difference between the initial purchase price and the residual value is $6,000. Dividing this amount by 12 leads to monthly lease payments of $500.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-61\"><strong>Lease Scenario 1: No \"Clean Diesel\" Premium/One-Year Lease</strong> Purchase price $30,000 Depreciation rate 20% Vehicle's residual value $24,000 Total cost of lease $6,000 Monthly payments <strong>$500</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Now assume that a $6,000 \"clean diesel\" premium is added to the initial price for the same car, raising the purchase price to $36,000. The residual value at the end of the lease will now be $28,800, which represents a 20% decline in value due to depreciation. The difference between the initial purchase price and the residual value is now $7,200. And dividing this amount by 12 leads to monthly lease payments of $600.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-63\"><strong>Lease Scenario 2: \"Clean Diesel\" Premium/One-Year Lease</strong> Purchase price ($6,000 premium) $36,000 Depreciation rate 20% Vehicle's residual value $28,800 Total cost of lease $7,200 Monthly payments <strong>$600</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   These examples show, under the lease formula alleged, that when the initial purchase price of a VW vehicle increases, the lease payments will also increase-a result that is consistent with common knowledge. (It is not surprising that a $50,000 vehicle would cost more to lease than a $20,000 vehicle.) Applied here, this means that if the \"clean diesel\" premium increased the initial purchase price of the class vehicles, as Plaintiffs allege, then the amount of Plaintiffs' lease payments also would have\n   risen. In arguing to the contrary-asserting that the lease payments would not have been affected by the premium because the premium would have been included in both the initial purchase price and the residual value-VW does not take into account depreciation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   If the amount of Plaintiffs' lease payments increased because of the \"clean diesel\" premium, then Plaintiffs were plausibly injured. This is because Plaintiffs allege that the premium was in part for the benefit of low emissions, which is a feature that VW did not provide. Similar to the former owners, the former lessees will eventually need to identify with more precision the amount of the premium that was specifically for low emissions. But at this stage, the fact of damage is concrete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11424858\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/301/1163/#p1171\">\n    301 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1171 ;\n   <em>\n    Los Gatos Mercantile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204755335\">\n    2015 WL 4755335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15.

The Court now moves on to address the other two alleged injuries: Plaintiffs' payment of financing charges and leasing fees and Plaintiffs' assertion that they were injured when they purchased and leased the class vehicles even if they did not pay a premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Financing Charges and Leasing Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs who purchased class vehicles assert that they were also injured when they paid inflated financing fees, and Plaintiffs who leased class vehicles assert that they were also injured when they paid lease acquisition and lease termination fees, which they contend they would not have paid if they had known about VW's emissions fraud. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The complaint does not include much detail on these fees, but Plaintiffs indirectly allege that the financing fees, at least, increased in proportion to the price of the financed vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13 (alleging that if the \"clean diesel\" premium was 27% of the vehicle purchase price, then 27% of the financing charges would have been on account of the premium);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n, Dkt. No. 4713 at 33 (asserting that the financing fees were \"inflated as a result of the clean-diesel premium they paid\").) Taking these allegations as true, the increased financing fees are fairly traceable to VW's conduct. The \"clean diesel\" premium plausibly increased the price of the financed vehicles, which in turn would have led directly to higher financing fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In arguing that the financing fees are not traceable to it, VW contends that these fees are dependent on many factors, such as applicants' \"personal finances, credit ratings, willingness to take loans, occupations, and the state of the auto financing market in general and in their own areas.\" (VW Mot. at 40.) This may be true, but even if these factors affected the amount of the financing fees, the \"clean diesel\" premium would have marginally increased those fees in an amount proportional to the price of the financed vehicles; and this marginal increase is fairly traceable to VW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As an example of this marginal increase, assume that an individual with robust personal finances and a good credit rating (named Allison) is able to finance a new $30,000 VW vehicle at a low interest rate and with a 1% financing fee. The dollar amount of Allison's financing fee will be $300. If Allison instead purchases a $36,000 \"clean diesel\" vehicle, again with a 1% financing fee, then the dollar amount of\n   the financing fee will rise to $360, a 20% increase.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-73\"><strong>Financing Scenario 1: Allison</strong> <strong>No \"Clean Diesel\" Premium</strong> <strong>\"Clean Diesel\" Premium</strong> Purchase Price $30,000 $36,000 Financing fee rate 1% 1% Financing fee amount $300 $360 % Increase 20%</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Now take the same two scenarios, but replace Allison with an individual with shaky personal finances and a poor credit rating (named Matthew). Due to his finances, Matthew must pay a high interest rate and a 2% financing fee to finance his purchase of a VW vehicle. Yet although Matthew's financing fee is greater than Allison's, the dollar amount of Matthew's financing fee, like Allison's, will rise by 20% in the \"clean diesel\" scenario.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-75\"><strong>Financing Scenario 2: Matthew</strong> <strong>No \"Clean Diesel\" Premium</strong> <strong>\"Clean Diesel\" Premium</strong> Purchase Price $30,000 $36,000 Financing fee rate 2% 2% Financing fee amount $600 $720 % Increase 20%</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Even though Allison and Matthew pay different financing fees due to their personal finances, both of them experience a 20% increase in their fee from buying a \"clean diesel.\" Thus, regardless of the individual factors that are considered in setting the financing fee percentage (personal finances, credit ratings, etc.), a portion of the fee is directly attributable to VW's challenged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because Plaintiffs allege that the amount of their financing fees increased in proportion to vehicle purchase price, their injury from increased fees is not \"dependent upon many factors\" in the same way that the alleged injury was in\n   <em>\n    Kaing v.

Causation here, then, is much clearer than in\n   <em>\n    Kaing\n   </em>\n   where there was no identified way to tie the defendant developer's practices to a specific decline in the value of plaintiff's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Unlike the financing fees, Plaintiffs do not allege that the lease acquisition and lease termination fees increased in proportion to the cost of the lease.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 43 (\"[T]he Lease committed [named plaintiff Tonya Dreher] to pay a $695 acquisition fee and a $350 turn-in/disposition fee at the expiration of the Lease-fees that Plaintiff would never have paid had Plaintiff been informed of the fraud either before or during the course of the Lease.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The causal connection between VW's emissions fraud and Plaintiffs' payments of these lease acquisition and termination fees is shaky, as Plaintiffs very well may have paid similar fees to lease other cars if they had known about the fraud. Plaintiffs do not allege that these leasing fees were unique to the class vehicles. And it is unlikely, or at best speculative, that those who leased class vehicles would have forgone leasing a car altogether if they had known of VW's fraud. Thus, because Plaintiffs plausibly would have paid similar lease acquisition and termination fees even if they had known of VW's fraud, Plaintiffs have not shown a \"causal connection between [this] injury and the conduct complained of\" as required for Article III standing.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For if there was no premium, then former owners would have fully recovered the money they paid for the class vehicles (minus depreciation based on standard wear and tear) when they resold the vehicles before they or the public learned of the emissions fraud.

Bosch's proximate cause arguments center on these factors and the Court considers them below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    1. More Direct Victims Factor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   With respect to the first factor, Bosch argues that there are three more direct victims of the alleged RICO enterprise: (1) consumers who still owned or leased an affected vehicle when the emissions fraud was publicly disclosed, (2) the regulators (EPA and CARB), and (3) VW dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Consumers in the first of these categories were not more direct victims of the alleged RICO enterprise. They may have been deceived at a different point in time and in different amounts, but all consumers who bought or leased the affected vehicles were plausibly deceived, even if they resold the vehicles or completed their leases prior to public disclosure of the emissions fraud. Neither set of consumers is further ahead in the causal chain than the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The second group, the regulators, were in front of Plaintiffs in the causal chain to some degree: before consumers were deceived into purchasing the class vehicles, the regulators were deceived into certifying them. But the regulators were more like gatekeepers than victims of the fraud: they did not lose money from the fraud like consumers did.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p653\">\n    553 U.S. 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653-58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p653\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674023\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/639/#p653\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) (concluding that a county treasurer's office, although deceived by racketeering conduct, was not the direct victim as it did not lose any money from the fraud),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    547 U.S. at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275572\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/451/#p461\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a state taxing authority\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   a more direct victim of racketeering conduct when it was defrauded \"out of a substantial amount of money\"). Also, Plaintiffs base their RICO claims at least in part on allegations that VW (on behalf of the enterprise) directly deceived consumers into believing that the class vehicles were \"clean\" and \"environmentally friendly,\" when they were not. (Compl. \u00b6 418.) To prevail on this theory, Plaintiffs would not even need to prove that VW first defrauded EPA and CARB; they would only need to demonstrate that VW defrauded\n   <em>\n    them\n   </em>\n   about certain vehicle attributes. As to this specific deceit, Plaintiffs are clearly the direct victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The third group, VW dealers, were also in front of Plaintiffs in the causal chain because they sold the class vehicles to Plaintiffs. But if dealers sold the cars for a profit then they would not have been injured by the premium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 24 (\"Dealers, who by definition resold cars at a profit prior to the fraud's discovery, did not suffer this [overpayment] injury ....\").) Complicating the issue, the VW dealers in\n   <em>\n    Napleton\n   </em>\n   do allege an overpayment RICO injury. If the basis for that alleged injury is that dealers did not automatically pass on the entire premium to consumers, then proximate cause could be lacking.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pillsbury, Madison &amp; Sutro v.

There are no allegations to the contrary in Plaintiffs' complaint. If it turns out otherwise during discovery, Bosch may renew its proximate cause challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newcal Indus., Inc. v.

The first\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   factor therefore weighs in favor of proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Ascertaining Damages Factor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The second proximate cause factor requires a non-speculative connection between the plaintiff's alleged injury and the alleged RICO violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canyon Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552784\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/969/#p972\">\n    519 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   982 &amp; n.12. Bosch argues that this factor cuts against proximate cause for two reasons. First, Bosch asserts that Plaintiffs do not allege a direct injury \"from the fallout of September 18, 2015.\" (Bosch Mot., Dkt. No. 4533 at 17.) This argument mistakes the fraud with the later disclosure of the fraud. It was the fraud itself that harmed Plaintiffs, and they have plausibly established a direct connection between their injuries and the fraud: VW deceived them into paying a premium for vehicles that were marketed as \"clean\" and \"environmentally friendly,\" but that were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Second, Bosch argues that there is no meaningful way to connect Plaintiffs' alleged overpayment to any conduct by Bosch. Bosch notes, for example, that there are no allegations that it had any role in determining the prices Plaintiffs paid for their vehicles. Bosch also argues that the decision to charge a premium for the cars was \"contrary to the Bosch Defendants' purported goal to sell more EDC17s, because raising prices typically reduces demand, which would result in fewer EDC17s being sold than if VW charged lower prices for the Affected Vehicles.\" (Bosch Mot. at 18 (citation omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Bosch made similar arguments in\n   <em>\n    Chrysler\n   </em>\n   and the court rejected them on grounds that are persuasive. \"That the Bosch Defendants are not alleged to have played a role in setting the price for the Class Vehicles,\" the\n   <em>\n    Chrysler\n   </em>\n   court reasoned, \"does not support\" that the Bosch Defendants did not proximately cause the plaintiffs' injuries. For \"[w]hatever price was set, that price was for a defect-free car. That is not what Plaintiffs allege they received. And because the Bosch Defendants directly contributed to the Class Vehicles' defects, they directly contributed to Plaintiffs' economic injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Chrysler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523896\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/927/#p948\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   967 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The district court in\n   <em>\n    In re Duramax Diesel Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. 2018), also rejected similar arguments by Bosch. The plaintiffs there alleged that they each paid a premium for diesel vehicles that GM marketed as having low emissions, but which utilized Bosch\n   defeat devices and actually emitted NOx at levels that exceeded EPA's limit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n    at 1045-48, 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court reasoned that the plaintiffs allegedly \"overpaid for their vehicles\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   Bosch worked closely with GM to install working defeat devices in the Duramax vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n    at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also noted that \"Bosch has provided no authority for the proposition that a RICO defendant may avoid liability simply by identifying a separate action by its codefendant which partially contributed to the plaintiff's injury (especially, when, as here, the Plaintiffs allege that the RICO Defendants worked together to cause the injury).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524098\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/1037/\">\n    at 1074-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiffs have identified a non-speculative connection between their alleged overpayment injuries and the alleged RICO violations by Bosch. The second\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   factor also weighs in favor of proximate cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Risk of Double Recoveries Factor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, Bosch argues that Plaintiffs' RICO claims create a risk of double recoveries and will lead to difficult apportionment questions because the injuries asserted are tied to vehicles \"for which, by definition, compensation has already been provided by the VW Defendants and the Bosch Defendants to other parties\"-namely, to consumers who owned or were leasing the vehicles when the fraud was disclosed. (Bosch Mot. at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Plaintiffs' case will not necessarily lead to apportionment problems, as the prior consumer settlements valued the affected vehicles based on their trade-in values immediately before the fraud was disclosed, not based on their values when they were brand new. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 2102 at 6, 3229 at 8.) So to the extent a portion of the premium depreciated before the fraud was disclosed, consumers in those settlements would not have recovered that portion of the premium. Also, Plaintiffs seek to recover certain fees that they paid. These fees do not overlap with the damages that were recovered by consumers in the earlier class settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Practically, it may be difficult to identify with precision the portion of the premium that Plaintiffs did not recover, and this difficultly may pose a risk of double recoveries. But that outcome is not certain at this stage. Whether Plaintiffs' claims pose a serious risk of multiple recoveries is a factual question that should be resolved in later proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newcal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165795\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/1038/#p1055\">\n    513 F.3d at 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to address the apportionment factor at the motion to dismiss stage because it raised factual questions).

As a result, proximate cause is well pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to support that Bosch engaged in racketeering activity in violation of RICO, and that Plaintiffs suffered a concrete injury to their property \"by reason\" of this activity. The RICO claims against Bosch are well pled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. STATE LAW CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that VW violated the consumer protection and false advertising\n   laws of 21 states. These laws generally prohibit companies from misrepresenting the characteristics of their goods to consumers, whether through affirmative misrepresentations or by concealing material facts about the goods. Plaintiffs assert that VW violated these laws in both ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   For their affirmative misrepresentation claims, Plaintiffs generally allege that VW misrepresented its vehicles \"as legal, reliable, environmentally clean, efficient, and of high quality.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 542 (California CLRA claim); \u00b6 576 (Connecticut CUTPA claim); \u00b6 592 (Illinois CFA claim).) More specific examples include that VW advertised that the Jetta TDI \"Clean Diesel\" had \"Ultra low emissions,\" that VW's TDI technology \"help[ed] reduce sooty emissions by up to 90% compared to previous diesel engines,\" and that VW's \"Clean diesel vehicles meet the strictest EPA standards in the U.S.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 290, 300, 302.) These representations were false, Plaintiffs assert, because VW's vehicles only operated in a low-emission mode during testing and did not comply with EPA regulations. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 542-44, 576-77, 592-94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   As for the concealment claims, Plaintiffs allege that VW failed to disclose and actively concealed that \"the Clean Diesel engine systems were not EPA-compliant and used software that caused the vehicles to operate in a low-emission test mode only during emissions testing.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 527 (Arizona CFA claim);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 609 (Maryland CPA claim); \u00b6 688 (New Jersey CFA claim).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   VW argues that the state law claims cannot proceed because (1) they are preempted by the Clean Air Act, (2) they are not well pled, and (3) several of them have other deficiencies (such as expired statutes of limitations) or are subject to pre-suits requirements that Plaintiffs have not satisfied or state bars on class actions. These issues are considered below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Congress can preempt state law either expressly, by enacting a statute that prohibits states from regulating certain conduct, or implicitly, either by occupying a given field with so much federal law that it is reasonable to conclude that Congress did not intend for states to regulate in that field, or by enacting federal law that conflicts with state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chae v.

With respect to express preemption, VW argues that the state law claims are preempted by Section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act. In relevant part, Section 209(a) states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   No State or any political subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines subject to this part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207543\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   VW contends that 209(a) preempts the state law claims because, as VW puts it, \"the fundamental misconduct underlying all the claims is the sale of vehicles that failed to meet the federal standards promulgated by the EPA.\" (VW Reply, Dkt. No. 4934 at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Framed in this way, VW asserts that Plaintiffs are using state law to \"attempt to enforce\" federal \"standard[s] relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207543\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Plaintiffs respond that 209(a) does not bar their claims because they are not attempting to enforce the types of standards covered 209(a), but rather are attempting to enforce laws that prohibit deceiving consumers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The federal standards at issue, which are found in regulations promulgated by EPA pursuant to the Clean Air Act, bar the use of \"defeat devices\" in, and limit NOx emissions from, new motor vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2086.1803-01\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 86.1803-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86.1809-10(a), 86.1811-04. As VW notes, Plaintiffs assert in multiple sections of their complaint (sometimes directly and other times indirectly) that VW violated these standards. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 207, 324, 343-44, 355, 359-360.) And VW argues that Plaintiffs \"effectively seek to use state law to penalize Volkswagen for producing engines which failed to comply with the Federal standards promulgated pursuant to the CAA.\" (VW Reply at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although Plaintiffs refer to these federal standards in their complaint, ultimately their state law claims are not an attempt to enforce them. This is because the state law claims require proof of both more and less than what is required to enforce the federal standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   First, all of the state law claims require proof of some conduct above and beyond what is required to prove a violation of the federal standards. To prevail on their state law claims, Plaintiffs must prove that VW lied to them, or that VW deceived them by concealing material information about the class vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 540-42 (basing California CLRA claim on allegations of misrepresentations and concealment of material facts concerning the class vehicles).) No similar showing that VW deceived consumers is needed to prove noncompliance with EPA's NOx emission and defeat device standards. That Plaintiffs' state law claims require a showing of more than what is required for a violation of the federal standards suggests that the claims are not an attempt to enforce those standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Second, not only do the state law claims require proof of more than what is required to prove a violation of the federal standards, but they also do not require proof of a regulatory violation to succeed. Plaintiffs could prove, for example, that VW lied when it said that the class vehicles had \"[u]ltra low emissions\" (Compl. \u00b6 290) by showing that the vehicles' actual emissions were far above the industry average and thus not \"ultra low.\" Proof that emissions exceeded federal limits would not be necessary. Nor would proof that VW installed an EPA-prohibited \"defeat device\" in the class vehicles be needed for Plaintiffs to prevail on their fraudulent concealment theory. Plaintiffs could instead prove, without reference to EPA's defeat device definition, that VW installed and concealed software in the cars that reasonable consumers would have wanted to know about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   To be sure, this second point does not apply to some of the alleged misrepresentations. For example, to prove that VW lied when it represented in advertising that its vehicles \"me[t] the strictest EPA standards in the U.S.\" (Compl. \u00b6 302), Plaintiffs would need to prove the opposite-that the class vehicles did not meet EPA standards. If Plaintiffs proceed by basing their claims on statements like this one, their claims get closer to the line of \"attempting to enforce\" standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles. But at least some of the representations do not pose this problem-including the \"[u]ltra low emissions\" representation highlighted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   For a consumer to \"attempt to enforce\" the federal standards at issue here, one would expect that the consumer would need to attempt to prove that those standards were violated. But Plaintiffs do not need to make such a showing to prevail on their state law claims. Not only that, but to prevail Plaintiffs need to prove that VW deceived them, which is conduct that is not required to prove that VW violated the federal standards. These are key differences which show that Plaintiffs' state law claims are not an \"attempt to enforce\" standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Five courts have considered the same 209(a) preemption argument that VW raises here in other \"clean\" or \"eco\" diesel consumer fraud cases. All five, on substantially the same two grounds highlighted above, have held that 209(a) does not preempt consumers' fraud based claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chrysler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523896\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/295/927/#p948\">\n    295 F.Supp.3d at 993-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he wrongful conduct being targeted by [consumers] is not [Fiat Chrysler's] failure to comply with federal law (the CAA), but rather [Fiat Chrysler's]\n   <em>\n    deceit\n   </em>\n   about the vehicles' emissions....

Unlike Nemet, Field does identify what was represented-\"Green Car of the Year\"-but like Nemet, Field does not identify when and where he saw this advertising.

Plaintiffs allege that they have suffered economic injury through overpayment, and VW has not pointed to any state law claim in the complaint for which an overpayment injury would not be actionable. Instead, as in the section of VW's brief addressing Article III, VW argues that the overpayment injury is not well pled because \"Plaintiffs have not adequately pled any premium related to NOx emissions, and even if they had they would have recovered that amount when they sold their vehicles.\" (VW Mot. at 53-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   As discussed above, Plaintiffs' premium allegations are sufficient because they support that Plaintiffs paid a premium for low emissions generally, which would reasonably include low NOx emissions. Further, the allegations support that Plaintiffs were not able to recover the full amount of the emissions premium through resale because the lessee Plaintiffs did not have the opportunity to resell their vehicles and the purchaser Plaintiffs plausibly did not recover a portion of the premium because of depreciation. Plaintiffs' premium allegations not only satisfy Article III's injury-in-fact requirement, but they also satisfy the damages element of their state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The main point VW makes is that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' overpayment injury is not fairly traceable to VW's conduct (Article III),\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   it follows that the same injury also was not proximately caused by VW's conduct (state law). As noted above, VW's Article III arguments are not persuasive. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs' injuries are not too remote from VW's conduct to satisfy the state law proximate cause requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   VW argues that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege reliance as required under Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia law because the complaint does not identify the misrepresentations or omissions on which each named plaintiff personally relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Plaintiffs respond first by challenging VW's assessment of the complaint, which Plaintiffs contend includes \"explicit allegations that Plaintiffs and Class members relied on VW's misrepresentations.\" (Pls.' Opp'n at 44.) Plaintiffs' characterization of their allegations is not accurate. As discussed above in the analysis of Rule 9(b), the complaint only vaguely references an \"advertised\" combination of low emissions, high performance and fuel economy, and other \"Clean Diesel\" advertising on which the named plaintiffs relied. And although the complaint does include more detail about VW's marketing campaign-including allegations about specific display, television, and brochure advertisements-Plaintiffs do not allege that any of the named plaintiffs actually saw and relied on these advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by suggesting that less detail is required to plead reliance under the laws of the states at issue than is needed to satisfy Rule 9(b), particularly when, as here, there are allegations of a pervasive, market-wide fraud. There is support for this point, at least under the laws of some of the states at issue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pulaski &amp; Middleman, LLC v.

But the pleading requirements for reliance are at times imprecise and vary depending on the state laws at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Ultimately, the Court does not need to delve into the state laws on reliance at this point. For even if the state law reliance standards can be satisfied with allegations that are less specific than those needed to satisfy Rule 9(b), Plaintiffs must satisfy Rule 9(b) to bring these claims in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kearns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652195\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/1120/#p1125\">\n    567 F.3d at 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is well-settled that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in federal court, 'irrespective of the source of the subject matter jurisdiction, and irrespective of whether the substantive law at issue is state or\n   federal.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vess v.

Further, if Plaintiffs eventually\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   satisfy Rule 9(b), those same allegations may be sufficient to satisfy the actual reliance requirements under the state laws at issue. The Court therefore will not consider the reliance issue as to the affirmative misrepresentation claims at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The omission claims are different. Those claims satisfy Rule 9(b), as Plaintiffs have identified the specific omissions at issue: VW's failure to disclose that (1) \"the Clean Diesel engine systems were not EPA-compliant,\" and (2) that the class vehicles \"used software that caused the vehicles to operate in a low-emission test mode only during emissions testing.\" (Compl. \u00b6 527.) VW argues, however, that these allegations are insufficient to establish reliance under Arizona, California, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Pleading reliance on an omission is not a particularly difficult burden.

VW has not cited to any authority suggesting that more is required to plead reliance on an omission under the laws of the other states at issue. And the named plaintiffs from those other states make similar allegations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 109 (North Carolina plaintiff Mark Miller alleges that \"had Defendants not concealed the illegal cheat device ...

Miscellaneous State Law Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   VW lastly argues that certain state law claims should be dismissed because (1) the relevant statutes of limitations have expired, (2) certain states bar or place limits on class actions to enforce their consumer protection laws, (3) Plaintiffs have not satisfied two states' pre-suit requirements, and (4) Plaintiffs lack statutory standing under another state's consumer protection laws because they do not allege a commercial injury.

(Compl. \u00b6 2.) Sixty days' notice was therefore not practicable\n   at the time Plaintiffs filed suit, making them eligible for the \u00a7 17.505(b) exception.
