(Doc. No. 74.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendant's motion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Green Plains Otter Tail (\"Green Plains\") owns and operates an ethanol production facility (\"Plant\") located in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. (Doc. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 5.) The Plant uses a large rotary drum dryer and regenerative thermal oxidizer (\"RTO\") to process ethanol co-product. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 77 (\"Cialkowski Decl.\") \u00b6 10, Ex. 8 (\"Barbera Report\") at 3; Compl. \u00b6 6.) Defendant Pro-Environmental, Inc. (\"PEI\") designed, manufactured, distributed, and/or sold the RTO and its related equipment installed at the Plant. (Compl. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The RTO collects vapors from the dryer's exhaust duct and burns off pollutants before releasing the vapors to the atmosphere. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barbera Report at 3.) It consists of three chambers and a group of dampers that control the vapor's flow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The dampers are powered by a hydraulic power unit (\"HPU\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 6.) In the event of an emergency, a dump stack damper is supposed to open automatically for vapor and gases to escape the RTO. (Comp. \u00b6 6.) At the same time, an isolation damper should close, as to prevent the heated vapors from entering the dryer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plant's HPU is operated by a pump that supplies hydraulic pressure to the RTO. (Barbera Report at 3.) In lieu of a back-up pump, the HPU contains an accumulator designed to expand and supply sufficient hydraulic fluid to move the dampers to their fail-safe positions should the main power unit fail. (Barbera Report at 3.) The accumulator consists of a rubber bladder pre-charged with nitrogen gas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When the system pressure fails, the bladder pressure forces fluid from the accumulator back into the system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The accumulator does not work unless it is charged. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cialkowski Decl. \u00b6 13, Ex. 11 (\"Operation Manual\") at MINDEN017996.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 10, 2014, the RTO experienced a high temperature failure and alarm. (Compl. \u00b6 9.) The Plant's staff discovered that a coupling in the HPU's driveshaft had failed, resulting in a loss of pressure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The dump stack damper and isolation damper then locked into the open and closed positions, respectively - the opposite of their fail-safe positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly after the failure, a fire and explosion occurred in the dryer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During a subsequent inspection, investigators determined that the accumulator had no remaining pre-charge pressure, indicating that it had failed as well. (Barbera Report at 4.) Without a charge, it was unable to provide a backup source of power to move the dampers to the desired positions dampers when the main power source failed. (\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this action, Green Plains brings two claims: (1) negligence (design defect and failure to warn), and (2) strict liability (design defect and failure to warn). (Compl. \u00b6 11-17.) PEI argues that the fire and explosion would not have taken place but for Green Plains' failure to maintain a well-designed product and moves for summary judgment. (Doc. No. 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

No. 80 (\"Opp.\") at 31.) Green Plains alleges in its Complaint that the RTO was defectively designed because: (1) it lacked an adequate alarm to alert Plant operators to a failure of its hydraulic system; and (2) it did not contain a backup pump or motor in the event of a hydraulic pump or motor failure. (Compl. \u00b6 16.) It further alleges a number of other design defect theories in its memorandum in opposition to PEI's motion for summary judgment including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   PEI designed the dump stack and isolation dampers to move to their failsafe positions by hydraulic pressure, instead of compressed air.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   PEI's design only measured the hydraulic pressure of the system as a whole, and did not monitor the individual pressure in the HPU or the accumulator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   PEI's design of the PLC [programmable logic controller] software allowed the RTO system to continue operations for an additional 50 seconds when there was insufficient hydraulic pressure in the system to move the dump stack and isolation dampers to failsafe positions in the event of an RTO shutdown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   PEI designed the RTO to use hydraulic pressure from both the HPU and the accumulator to change the positions of the dump stack and isolation dampers within 6 seconds. Without a functioning accumulator, the HPU could change the positions of the dampers within 9 seconds. PEI designed the PLC program to alarm if the dampers did not change position within\n   <em>\n    15\n   </em>\n   seconds. Had PEI simply set the PLC to warn if the damper change took between\n   6 and 9 seconds, Green Plains would have been notified the accumulator was not functioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   When the facility was being built, PEI specified an accumulator with only a 10 gallon reserve, even though there were larger reserve tanks available to ensure adequate backup hydraulic fluid to move the dampers to a failsafe position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Emphasis in original.) (Opp. at 6 \u00b6 10, 8 \u00b6 21, 9 \u00b6 24, 10 \u00b6 29, 11 \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nonetheless, the mere fact of alternative designs does not prove that PEI's design was defective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larsen v. General Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2103091\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/391/495/#p497\">\n    391 F.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (8th Cir. 1968) (\"[A] manufacturer is under no duty to design an accident-proof or fool-proof product.\"). Here, the RTO manufactured by PEI was consistent with industry standards. (Cialkowski Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. 2 (\"Pennington Report\") at 17.) The use of a single pump is the standard approach, and the hydraulic system has been industry custom for over 40 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Green Plains acknowledges that the same model is installed at 75 other locations but does not explain how its own Plant differs such that the design flaw effects only its Plant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opp. at 31.) Further, there is no evidence that this model is prone to catastrophic failure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   While Green Plains suggests that a proper design should monitor the individual pressure in the accumulator, its model does measure the accumulator's pressure. (Operation Manual at MINDEN017993.) Arguably, a better design would isolate just the charge in the accumulator's bladder while the HPU is powered up, but Green Plains' expert testified that no such technology exists. (Cialkowski Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 1 (\"Minden Dep.\") at 105-106.) There is a way to monitor the bladder's charge, but it requires the system to be powered off and use of a charging and gauging assembly. (Operation Manual at MINDEN017996.) Green Plains did not own the charging and gauging assembly necessary to check the charge. (Cialkowski Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex. 7 at 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Further, there is no indication that an accumulator with a larger reserve would have made a difference; because the accumulator's bladder had no charge, it would not have operated regardless of the size of reserve. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barbera Report at 4 (\"[T]he accumulator was measured to have no remaining pre-charge pressure indicating that the accumulator had failed.\").) Green Plains' expert stated that if the accumulator had been charged, it had the capacity to move the dampers to their failsafe positions. (Minden Dep. at 100.) There is no evidence, however, that Green Plains ever checked or charged the bladder in the accumulator. (Cialkowski Decl. \u00b6 7, Ex. 5 (\"Systma Dep.\") at 154.) A larger reserve would not have prevented the fire and explosion because it still needed a charge to function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, Green Plains references software which allows the RTO to operate for 50 seconds before shutting down. While Green Plains' expert described this software (Doc. No. 81 (\"Foran Decl.\") \u00b6 14, Ex. L (\"Minden Report\") at\n   13-14), there is nothing in the record which indicates that the 50-second delay is linked to the actual fire and explosion. Green Plains' expert testified that the RTO likely shut off \"within a few seconds.\" (Minden Dep. at 60.) \"A plaintiff cannot prevail in a design-defect case simply by arguing, in the abstract, that a product is defectively designed. Instead, the plaintiff must explain why, under the reasonable-care balancing test, the world would be a better place if the product were either designed differently or taken off the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Kapps v. Biosense Webster, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184480\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/813/1128/#p1161\">\n    813 F.Supp.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1161 (D. Minn. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Green Plains also suggests that the 15-second alarm system was flawed because it was not based on the HPU's actual pump capacity. (Minden Report at 23.) \"Since the pump could operate the dampers in 9 seconds, the 15-second time limit was never met, and the system was unable to issue a warning to the operators as to the hazard of the non-functional accumulator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Green Plains argues that the alarm should have been set between 6 and 9 seconds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Had PEI undertaken this reasonable step, the PLC logic would have been able to determine that the accumulator would have lost its pre-charge pressure and was no longer providing flow assistance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   If a loss of charge was the only trigger for the alarms, this would be a compelling argument. The same expert proposing this alteration, though, testified that worn seals, hose leakage, or leakage past a particular cylinder may also decrease the speed of the dampers and trigger the alarm. (Minden Dep. at 106-107.) He affirmed that there were a number of things to check when the alarms sounded, \"in addition to the accumulator.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107.) Despite frequent alarms, there is no indication that any Green Plains employee ever checked the charge on the accumulator's bladder. (Systma Dep. at 32, 129.) It is unclear how the additional time would have changed this outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While there is also dispute over whether the accumulator was ever charged at all, Green Plains' expert testified that the RTO would not have functioned correctly to meet EPA regulations if the accumulator was not initially charged. (Minden Dep. at 133.) PEI's corporate designee who was responsible for the Plant's commissioning process also testified that he verified the accumulator was properly charged. (Cialkowski Decl. \u00b6 14, Ex. 12 at 78.) Although the Court finds that there is sufficient testimony to conclude that the accumulator was charged at the time of commissioning, it is worth noting that if Green Plains had performed monthly checks, it would have known whether or not it was charged. Nonetheless, Green Plains urges that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to precisely when the accumulator lost its charge. Because this model is not unique, and there is no evidence that it is prone to catastrophic failure, it is mere speculation that the accumulator failed suddenly. To defeat summary judgment, the non-moving party \"must substantiate [its] allegations with sufficient probative evidence that would permit a finding in [its] favor based on more than mere speculation, conjecture, or fantasy.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Int'l Bus. Mach.

While it could have used a second accumulator, or compressed air, or an alarm that sounded between 6 and 9 seconds instead of 15, it did not have to; PEI struck an acceptable balance among competing factors. The RTO conformed to industry standard, it included an accumulator sufficient to serve as a back-up source of power, it incorporated available technology to monitor pressure, and included a functioning alarm system. Even allowing for some sort of defect, the Court is unconvinced that any alleged defect was the proximate cause of the fire and explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While proximate cause is generally a question of fact for the jury, \"where reasonable minds can arrive at only one conclusion, proximate cause is a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lubbers v.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Serra\n   </em>\n   , the RTO was not compromised from the start; it conformed to industry standards. Further, it is unforeseeable that Green Plains would fail to maintain its equipment. While Green Plains submits that it conducted routine maintenance on the HPU as a whole, there is no evidence that it checked or maintained the accumulator and/or its bladder. To the contrary, Green Plains' chief boiler engineer testified that while he was aware the accumulator needed to be maintained, he did not check or maintain it, nor was he aware of anyone who had. (Systma Dep. at 129, 151, 153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Green Plains asserts, \"even if all recommended maintenance was performed, the HPU and accumulator could still fail at any time.\" (Opp. at 30.) It also argues that even well-maintained equipment can fail at any time without warning. (Opp. at 23.) The Court is not convinced. Just as one does not buy a new car and question why it fails after six years without an oil change, it is unreasonable to fault a manufacturer for equipment that breaks down after failing to maintain it. Even if PEI had used one of the alternative designs suggested by Green Plains, maintenance was still required. Any alleged negligence by PEI was not continuous and ongoing such that the first element fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Similarly, the second and third elements are satisfied. But for Green Plains' lack of maintenance, the accident would not have occurred. Two experts agree that the RTO failed because it was not properly maintained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The HPU failed due to a lack of proper maintenance. A drive coupling between the motor and the pump failed and the system could no longer generate hydraulic pressure. Additionally, an accumulator within the HPU which was intended, in part, to provide pressurized fluid to the system in the event of a motor or pump failure, was not functioning. Preventative maintenance would have revealed these defects before a catastrophic system malfunction was imminent, and would have prevented the subject explosion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Barbera Report at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The March 10, 2014 incident at Green Plains resulted from Green Plains' failure to maintain equipment, including checking the pressure of the accumulator and failing to conduct sufficient and consistent burns out of the RTO.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Pennington Report at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A third expert concludes that, \"the cause of the incident which took place on March 10, 2014, is attributable to the isolation and vent stack dampers not moving to their failsafe positions when the RTO lost hydraulic pressure due to pump coupling failure.\" (Minden Report at 24.) He further attributes the incident to a faulty accumulator and poor alarm system but does not speculate on what role maintenance played in the failure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court finds that Green Plains' lack of maintenance was the sole cause of the fire and explosion, and that its negligence did not follow any condition created by PEI. Three experts agree that the fire and explosion occurred because both the HPU and the accumulator lacked the necessary power to move the dampers to their failsafe positions. To go so far as to conclude that the reason both the HPU and the accumulator failed was because Green Plains failed to conduct proper maintenance. The third expert does not speculate but provides no alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Green Plains relies on\n   <em>\n    Bursch v.

Even allowing for some sort of defect, the Court finds that Green Plains' lack of maintenance was a superseding cause negating PEI's liability. Further, the Court finds that PEI provided adequate instructions and warnings for Plant personnel to periodically inspect, monitor, and maintain its hydraulic system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Based on the files, records, and proceedings herein, and for the reasons set forth above,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   1. Defendants' Motion to for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. [74] ) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2. Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. No. [1] ) is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    LET JUDGMENT BE ENTERED ACCORDINGLY\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Green Plains argues that because no two of the 75 facilities are alike in terms of capacity and configuration, PEI should have designed individual RTO and dryers to match the hydraulic system at each plant. (Transcript of Mot. Hr'g at 38.) Nonetheless, this does not explain why the system functions well at every other location.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The Operation Manual indicates that bladders lose their charge over time. (Cialkowski Decl, 13, Ex. 11 at MINDEN017996.) There is nothing in the record to contradict this, or to suggest that bladders are prone to sudden failure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The Court finds it inconsequential that Green Plains' HPU manual referenced an accumulator with a piston as opposed to a bladder. (Opp. at 11 \u00b6 37.) The pertinent instructions were the same in each manual: the accumulator needs to be checked every 30 days. (Doc. No. 87 (\"Transcript\") at 6;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Operation Manual at MINDEN018072.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
