Walker, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On November 6, 2018, the State of Maine conducted an election and presented voters with a ballot that asked them to rank their choices for who should be the people's representative for Maine's Second Congressional District. The congressional election was subject to Maine's Ranked-Choice Voting Act, 21 M.R.S. \u00a7 723-A. Defendant Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap is invested with the duty to \"tabulate the election returns and submit the tabulation to the Governor\" no later than 20 days following the election. 21-A M.R.S. \u00a7 722.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 13, after Defendant Dunlap announced that no contestant had received enough votes to achieve an outright majority victory in Second Congressional District election, and that the ballot counting process would continue as outlined in section 723-A, Plaintiffs, Representative Bruce Poliquin,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed this civil action. In their complaint, Plaintiffs maintain that Maine's experiment in ranked-choice voting violates Article I, section 2 of the United States Constitution, and deprives Plaintiffs of rights secured to them under\n   the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment, as applied to the State of Maine through incorporation in the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Voting Rights Act. (Complaint,\n   <em>\n    passim.\n   </em>\n   ) They request the Court declare that their rights have been violated, and they further request injunctive relief that, in effect, requires Defendant to certify Representative Poliquin to be the winner of the election. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25,\n   <em>\n    prayer for relief.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 14, 2018, the Court conducted a hearing on Plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order (TRO). The Court heard argument from Plaintiffs, Defendant, and Intervenors Tiffany Bond, et al.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to an order enjoining Defendant from finalizing the ballot count under Maine's ranked-choice scheme, such that no final tabulation of votes will occur until this Court is able to rule on Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction or the merits of Plaintiffs' action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For reasons that follow, Plaintiffs' request for TRO is denied. The case will proceed in the normal course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This is not the first time a challenge has been raised concerning the constitutionality of Maine's Ranked-Choice Voting Act (\"RCV Act\") when used for the selection of Maine's congressional representatives. Due to the emergency nature of the pending motion, the following background statement is borrowed from this Court's prior order in the matter of\n   <em>\n    Maine Republican Party v. Dunlap\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:18-cv-179 (Levy, J., presiding).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Prior to passage of the RCV Act], Maine law required a single-choice voting system in primary and general elections, in which voters voted for a single candidate, and the candidate with the most votes (but not necessarily a majority of votes) won.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Opinion of the Justices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317374\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/162/188/#p197\">\n    162 A.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (Me. 2017). That system is referred to by the parties as a \"plurality\" system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The RCV Act defines ranked-choice voting as \"the method of casting and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates are defeated and the candidate with the most votes in the final round is elected.\" 21-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 1(35-A) ). Under ranked-choice voting, the first round proceeds much in the same way it did under the plurality system: Each voter's first choice vote is counted, and if any candidate captures an outright majority of the first choice votes that candidate wins. But, if no candidate captures a majority of the first choice votes, there is an instant run-off. The candidate with the fewest first choice votes is eliminated [and potentially all candidates for whom it is \"mathematically impossible to be elected\" are also eliminated at the same time], and all of the ballots that listed him or her [or them] as the first choice candidate are counted for their second choice candidate. The process repeats and eliminates more [non-viable] candidates until one candidate receives a majority [or plurality] of the votes [counted through the RCV process].

In fact, it appears that both majority and plurality standards have historical antecedents in American politics.

For instance, if the Court were to sustain Plaintiffs' claim, and if the Court were to determine, as Plaintiffs request, that the appropriate remedy is to declare Representative Poliquin the winner, there are many who would consider the cure to be worse than the alleged disease, at least insofar as the professed concern is with the right of voters to cast effective ballots in a fair election. Intervenor Bond, for example, maintains that she would not have stood for the election if she had known prior to the election that the RCV system could be invalidated in this way, or that the result would be the one proposed by Plaintiffs.

The\n   contention, however, is that the injury is established because they have demonstrated a constitutional violation. (Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 18.)

In opposition, Defendant asserted orally that there is an appreciable administrative duty that needs to be addressed, without incurring unnecessary costs, as the deadline for final tabulation is November 26, 2018. In Defendants' view, a TRO not only would disrupt the process in the absence of any showing of a constitutional violation, but would also prevent the creation of a complete record for this Court to consider in the context of Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and/or merits briefing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I am not persuaded that the balance tips in favor of Plaintiffs.

The Public's Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument as to this final factor is more of the same. For the reasons set forth above, I am not persuaded that an order enjoining a final tabulation pending resolution of the motion for preliminary injunction would serve the public's interest. Even if I concluded that Plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success, I would be inclined to deny the request for a restraining order because I am not persuaded that the public is not entitled to know the result of the election conducted pursuant to the RCV system, particularly where Plaintiffs have not developed their claim as to the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In denying Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order, I do not discount the sincerity of their complaints regarding the RCV system. The remedy in a democracy, when no constitutional infirmity appears likely, is to exercise the protected rights of speech and association granted by the First Amendment to persuade one's fellow citizens of the correctness of one's position and to petition the political branch to change the law. As it stands, the citizens of Maine have rejected the policy arguments Plaintiffs advance against RCV. Maine voters cast their ballots in reliance on the RCV system. For the reasons indicated above, I am not persuaded that the United States Constitution compels the Court to interfere with this most sacred expression of democratic will by enjoining the ballot-counting process and declaring Representative Poliquin the victor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Representative Poliquin is joined in this action by Plaintiffs Brett Baber, Terry Hamm-Morris, and May Hartt.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Ms. Bond is a contestant in the election.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Phillips\n    </em>\n    , the Second Circuit observed that it was significant to the analysis that \"New York has permitted the candidate for United States Senate who receives the highest number of votes, even if that number be a mere plurality, to be duly elected,\" and that, consequently, certification of the candidate based on a plurality of votes \"would be in accord with the mandate of the Seventeenth Amendment that Senators be 'elected by the people.' \"\n    <em>\n     Phillips v.

Chiefly, they content that instant run offs can give rise to a number of hypothetical scenarios in which voters are forced to make choices or predictions with imperfect information. At oral argument, Plaintiffs expressed it as a vote made \"in the dark.\" With respect to the instant election, the Court is not persuaded that the electorate, with reasonable diligence, could not inform itself as to who among the candidates was likely to survive the first round of the RCV process. The fact that there could be another election at which such concerns could be of paramount importance is not a sufficient basis, in the Court's view, to grant relief in the form of a TRO.

In other words, persons who voted for Ms. Bond will not be excluded from consideration in the Poliquin-Golden contest, which treatment would be unequal vis-\u00e0-vis those voters who ranked Mr. Hoar as their first choice.

State of Colorado\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339146\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/673/#p687\">\n     514 U.S. 673\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 687,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339146\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/673/#p687\">\n     115 S.Ct. 1733\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339146\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/673/#p687\">\n     131 L.Ed.2d 759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1995) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 875 (6th ed. 1990) ). Plaintiffs evidently appreciate that laches could be relevant to their action. Plaintiffs maintain that they would have lacked standing or did not have a live case or controversy prior to the first round of ranked choice ballot counting. Plaintiffs have not briefed the contention, however, and the Court is not prepared at this time to assess Article III ripeness considerations, for purposes of assessing laches. Ultimately, it may prove unnecessary to reach the issue, if Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that their claims have merit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    On the morning of the hearing, Defendants filed the Declaration of Deputy Secretary of State Julie L. Flynn (ECF No. 24). While the declaration is informative and helpful, the declaration is not necessary to overcome Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order and, consequently, I have not summarized its content here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
