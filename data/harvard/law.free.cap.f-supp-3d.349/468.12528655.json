GIBSON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court are the Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 80) filed by Plaintiff Westport Insurance Corp. (\"Westport\") and the Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 87) filed by Defendants Hippo Fleming &amp; Pertile Law Offices (\"HFP\") and Attorney Charles Wayne Hippo, Jr. (\"Hippo\") (collectively the \"Defendants\"). These motions have been fully briefed (ECF Nos. 81-82, 86-88, 91-92) and are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises from a dispute involving a professional liability insurance policy that Westport issued to Defendants (the \"Policy\"). The action in front of this Court is a consolidation of two actions involving the same parties and insurance-coverage issues. Both actions involved Westport's refusal to defend or indemnify HFP and one of its attorneys, Hippo, in an action brought against them by Gregory S. Morris and Morris Development, Inc. (collectively \"Morris\") in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County, Pennsylvania (the \"Underlying Suit\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   . ECF No. 81-1 at A002-088.) The Underlying Suit arises from legal services that Defendants provided Morris in real-estate development\n   matters. Morris alleges that Defendants used information derived from their attorney-client relationship with Morris to benefit their own real-estate development projects, thereby harming Morris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Westport's Motion for Summary Judgment on Count I for declaratory judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   it with respect to Counts II and III for rescission and voidance. The Court further\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims and counterclaims in this case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) because it involves citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1; ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Westport's claims occurred in the Western District of Pennsylvania, venue is proper in this district under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1; ECF No. 42 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Relevant Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court includes additional material facts in Part VI where necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Westport Issues a Professional Liability Insurance Policy to Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HFP applied for professional-liability insurance from Westport in early 2007. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 26; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 26.) The application for the Policy included an \"Outside Interest Supplement\" that broadly required HFP to disclose all outside interests of its attorneys, including all instances where an attorney acts as director, officer, partner, trustee, manager, fiduciary, or otherwise exercises control over a for-profit business other than HFP. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 29; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 29.) HFP disclosed the involvement of Hippo and Jeff Fleming (\"Fleming\"), another HFP attorney, in an outside entity named VIP Ventures, LLC (\"VIP Ventures\"), but did not disclose the pair's involvement in two other entities - Templar Development, LLC and Templar Elmerton, LLC (collectively the \"Templar Entities\"). (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 33; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 33.) VIP Ventures held ownership shares in both of the Templar Entities. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 36; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Westport issued the Policy - Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance Policy No. WLW305008391200-to HFP in March 2007. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 21; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 21.) The Policy covered HFP and its attorneys for certain professional liability claims from March 1, 2007, until March 1, 2008. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; ECF No. 86 \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section VII(C) of the Policy specifically excludes coverage for lawsuits arising from the outside business interests of the insured attorneys (the \"Outside Business Exclusion\"). The Outside Business Exclusion provides that the Policy does not apply to claims related to \"any INSURED'S activities as an officer, director, partner,\n   manager, or employee of any company, corporation, operation, organization, partnership, or association other than the NAMED INSURED or PRIOR firm.\" (ECF No. 81-1 at A106-07; ECF No. 81 \u00b6 22; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Representation of Morris and the Underlying Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants had a \"long-standing\" attorney-client relationship with Morris and his business entities. (ECF No. 81-1 at A134.) Morris retained HFP and Hippo to assist Morris with various real-estate development projects. (ECF No. 81-1 at A129; ECF No. 81 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 2.) In early 2008, Morris threatened Defendants with litigation after a dispute arose in the development of a shopping center in Blair County, Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 81-1 at A135; ECF No. 81 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 4.) Morris alleged that Defendants used information from their representation of Morris to benefit real estate development projects that Defendants undertook through the Templar Entities, thereby harming Morris. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16-18; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hippo notified Westport of the threatened litigation via letter on January 9, 2008. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 2; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 2.) Westport responded with a letter acknowledging the potential claim and noting that it was not aware of any potential coverage issues. (ECF No. 81-1 at A130.) Then, in October of 2009, Morris sent an unfiled draft complaint to an attorney for Hippo, which Hippo forwarded to Westport. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 4.) Westport sent Hippo a letter on October 30, 2009, where Westport \"reserved its rights\" and noted that several exclusions in the Policy may bar coverage of Morris's claim. (ECF No. 81-1 at A133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Underlying Suit was officially initiated on December 8, 2009, when the Clerk of Courts for the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County, Pennsylvania issued a Writ of Summons in a case that Morris brought against Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81-1 at A141-42.) But due to unrelated bankruptcy proceedings, Morris took no action in the Underlying Suit until they first filed a complaint on July 24, 2015. (ECF No. 81-1 at A002; ECF No. 81 \u00b6 9; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 9.) In the period between the filing of the Writ of Summons and Complaint in the Underlying Suit, Westport retained Attorney Edwin Schwartz of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to represent Defendants in the Underlying Suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 86 at 21 \u00b6 8; ECF No. 92 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Morris's Complaint against Defendants contains eleven counts: (1) negligence (i.e., legal malpractice); (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of fiduciary duties; (4) interference with contractual relationship; (5) constructive trust; (6) unjust enrichment; (7) a violation of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act; (8) civil conspiracy; (9) conversion; (10) defamation; and (11) vicarious liability. (ECF No. 81-1 at A002-070; ECF No. 81 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Westport Refuses to Defend or Indemnify Defendants Against the Underlying Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Westport evaluated coverage for the Underlying Suit after Morris filed the Complaint against Defendants in 2015. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 25; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 25.) On August 11, 2015, Westport sent Defendants a letter\n   stating that Westport was denying coverage for the Underlying Suit based on the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion. (ECF No. 81-1 at A410; ECF No. 81 \u00b6 25; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 25.) Westport's denial of coverage triggered this litigation. Section IV addresses the procedural history of the action pending in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The action pending in this Court is the consolidation of two separately filed cases relating to the Policy that Westport issued to Defendants. In the first action, Westport brought a declaratory judgment action against Defendants in this Court on September 29, 2015. (ECF No. 1.) Westport seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no duty or obligation to defend or indemnify Defendants in the Underlying Suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the second action, HFP and Hippo filed a Complaint against Westport in the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County, Pennsylvania on November 30, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3:15-cv-0322, ECF No. 1-A1.) HFP and Hippo brought claims against Westport for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, and bad faith stemming from Westport's refusal to defend and indemnify Defendants in the Underlying Suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Westport removed this action to this Court on December 11, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3:15-cv-0322, ECF No. 1.) The Court denied Defendants' Motion to Remand the case to state court (3:15-cv-0322, ECF No. 17) and denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction (ECF No. 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In May of 2016, the Court entered an Order (ECF No. 39; 3:15-cv-0322, ECF No. 19) granting the parties' Joint Motion to Consolidate (ECF No. 38), thereby combining the two ongoing actions between Westport and Defendants into the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After consolidation, the parties litigated a discovery dispute. (ECF Nos. 47-56, 65-66.) Additionally, Westport filed its First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 67) in March of 2017. Westport added claims to rescind the policy (Count II) and for voidance (Count III) based on Defendants' failure to disclose their outside business interests in their application for the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The case reached its current posture in early 2018 when the Court entered Orders (ECF Nos. 74, 77, 79) setting a briefing schedule. Westport filed its Motion for Summary Judgment, Brief in Support, and Concise Statement of Material Facts on May 18, 2018. (ECF Nos. 80-82.) Defendants filed a Response to Westport's Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Brief in Support, and Concise Statement of Material Facts on June 18, 2018. (ECF Nos. 85-87.) Finally, Westport filed its Reply Brief and Reply to Defendants' Concise Statement of Material Facts on August 3, 2018. (ECF No. 91-92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The Policy's Outside Business Exclusion, which appears in Section VII(C), states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [the Policy] shall not apply to any CLAIM based upon, attributable to, or directly or indirectly resulting from ... any INSURED'S activities as an officer, director, partner, manager, or employee of any company, corporation, operation, organization, partnership, or association other than the NAMED INSURED or PRIOR FIRM, except as a member, director, or officer of any Bar Association, its governing board or any of its committees, or as a member of a formal accreditation, ethics, peer review, licensing board, standards review, or similar professional board or committee related to the practice of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (ECF No. 81-1 at A106-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While the language of the Outside Business Exclusion is broad, it is reasonably susceptible to only one interpretation. The Policy does not apply to\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     any\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   claim that arises from an HFP attorney's involvement as an officer, director, partner, manager, or employee of any entity other than HFP. The broad language of the Outside Business Exclusion-that the Policy shall not apply to claims \"based on, attributable to, or directly or indirectly resulting from\"-clearly excludes coverage for any claim arising from an attorney's outside business activities, regardless of the extent or degree that the claim involves an attorney's outside business activities. Taken as a whole, the language of the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion unambiguously indicates that the parties' intention was to exclude coverage for any and all claims arising from the outside business activities of HFP attorneys. Thus, the Court must give full effect to the Policy's language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. There Is No Genuine Dispute of Material Fact that the Allegations In the Underlying Complaint Trigger the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Templar Entities Are Outside Business Entities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There is no genuine dispute of material fact that the Templar Entities are uninsured outside business entities under the Policy. The Outside Business Exclusion applies to \"any company, corporation, operation, organization, partnership, or association other than the NAMED INSURED or PRIOR FIRM.\" (ECF No. 81-1 at A107.) The parties do not dispute that the Templar Entities are wholly distinct entities from HFP, the sole insured entity under the Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 57, 59; ECF No. 86 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 57, 59) (establishing that both of the Templar Entities are LLCs that filed Certificates of Organization with the Pennsylvania Secretary of State).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Moreover, Defendants admit that the explicit purpose of the Templar Entities\n   was for Hippo and Fleming to conduct business in a way that was not associated with HFP. Defendants established VIP Ventures and the Templar Entities to \"keep their outside business earnings separate from the [earnings of] the [HFP] law firm.\" (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 39; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 39.) Hippo testified in a deposition that VIP Ventures and the Templar Entities were \"a way of isolating money [from HFP]\" (ECF No. 81-1 at A425) and that any earnings from the Templar Entities were paid through VIP Ventures, not HFP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A427.) Therefore, there is no dispute that the Templar Entities are outside business interests independent of HFP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hippo Acted as an Officer, Partner, Director, and Manager of the Templar Entities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Policy's Outside Business Exclusion bars coverage for any claim arising from an insured attorney's work \"as an officer, partner, director, [or] manager ... of any company ... other than the named insured.\" (ECF No. 81-1 at A106-07.) There is no genuine dispute that Hippo acted as an officer, director, and partner of the Templar Entities. Similarly, there is no genuine dispute that Fleming acted as a partner of the Templar Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, Hippo acted as an officer of the Templar Entities. An officer is \"a person elected or appointed by the board of directors to manage the daily operations of a corporation, such as CEO, president, secretary, or treasurer.\"\n   <em>\n    Officer\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Moreover, a de facto officer is \"[s]omeone who is acting under color of right and with apparent authority but who is not legally a corporate officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Officer de Facto\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Music Grp. Macao Commer. Offshore, Ltd. v. Foote\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-03078,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203882448\">\n    2015 WL 3882448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *68 (N.D. Cal. June 22, 2015) (\"[C]ourts will recognize a de facto officer where the apparent officer assumes possession of an officer under the claim and color of election or appointment and actually discharges the duty of that office.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants maintain that Hippo was not an officer of the Templar Entities and, alternatively, that the Templar Entities did not have officers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 86 at 23 \u00b6 13.) However, there is no dispute that Hippo held himself out as an officer of both Templar Development and Templar Elmerton. Hippo testified in a deposition that he held himself out as Templar Development's \"Vice President of Operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 \u00b6 16; ECF No. 88 at A619.) A vice president is \"[a] corporate officer of mid-level to high rank.\"\n   <em>\n    Vice President\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Hippo obtained business cards that listed him as Templar Development's Vice President of Operations, which clearly indicates that he intended to hold himself out as an officer of Templar Development. (ECF No. 86 at 24, \u00b6 16; ECF No. 92 \u00b6 16.) Further, Hippo was also the President of Templar Development for a period of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67 \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; ECF No. 68 \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Defendants argue that Hippo was not an officer because he was not given an official title in Templar Development's operating agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81 \u00b6 42; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 42.) This distinction is irrelevant,\n   however, because Hippo was at the very least a de facto officer after holding himself out as Templar Development's President and Vice President of Operations and conducting business on its behalf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also admitted that Hippo served as both President and Vice President of Operations for Templar Elmerton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 67 \u00b6\u00b6 54-56; ECF No. 68 \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.) Thus, there is no dispute that Hippo was an officer of the Templar Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, Hippo and Fleming acted as partners of the Templar Entities. A partner is \"[s]omeone who shares or takes part with another, especially in a venture with shared benefits and shared risks\" or \"[o]ne of two or more persons who jointly own and carry on a business for profit.\"\n   <em>\n    Partner\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Hippo and Fleming were partners of the Templar Entities because they jointly carried on business for profit through the Templar Entities. Defendants admit that Hippo \"performed various dealings on behalf of Templar Development\" by drafting purchase agreements to acquire property, seeking out potential buyers, and negotiating with potential tenants. (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 50; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 50.) Moreover, both Hippo and Fleming shared the benefits and risks associated with the Templar Entities. Defendants admit that Hippo and Fleming had a financial stake in both Templar Entities, thereby sharing risks and benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 81 \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 56; ECF No. 86 \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 56.) Fleming testified that he became involved with the Templar Entities because he \"was willing to take a great deal of risk for a potential return.\" (ECF No. 81-1 at A511.) Similarly, when asked about a hotel deal that Templar Development pursued, Hippo testified that he \"stood the chance of losing [his] shirt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A546.) Therefore, there is no genuine dispute that Hippo and Fleming were partners in the Templar Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Third, Hippo acted as both a director and manager of the Templar Entities. A director is \"[s]omeone who manages, guides, or orders; a chief administrator\" or \"[a] person appointed or elected to sit on a board that manages the affairs of a corporation ... by exercising control over its affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Director\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Similarly, a manager is generally \"[s]omeone who administers or\n   supervises the affairs of a business.\"\n   <em>\n    Manager\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Under Pennsylvania LLC law, a manager is broadly defined as someone who is responsible for controlling matters relating to the affairs and activities of the company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 PA. CONS. STAT. \u00a7\u00a7 8812(a) ; 8847(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There is no dispute that Hippo exercised some degree of control over the affairs of the Templar Entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Hippo performed significant work on behalf of the Templar Entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 81 \u00b6 50; ECF No. 86 \u00b6 50.) Hippo testified that his role at Templar Development was \"to get the job done. There were certain things that had to take place to get it done. I was doing what I could to advance what we were trying to accomplish.\" (ECF No. 81-1 at A211.) Hippo admits that he made business decisions regarding the Templar Entities' real estate projects, including major strategic decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A200-225.) For instance, Hippo testified that he made an offer on behalf of Templar Development to purchase a piece of property on Route 22 in Blairsville, Pennsylvania, because he thought a client of HFP may be interested in developing the property into a service station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A286-88.) Collectively, Hippo's title as Vice President of Development, his own description of his role at Templar Development, and his actions on Templar Development's behalf lead to the conclusion that he was responsible for carrying out Templar Development's affairs and activities. Thus, Hippo was a director and manager of the Templar Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Hippo was an officer, director, and manager of the Templar Entities. Similarly, there is no dispute of material fact that both Hippo and Fleming were partners of the Templar Entities. Hippo and Fleming's involvement with the Templar Entities therefore triggers the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, to determine if the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion applies to Counts I and II in the Underlying Suit, the Court confines its inquiry to whether Counts I and II arise solely from the attorney-client relationship between Hippo and Morris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In arguing that Counts I and II of the Underlying Complaint arise solely from the attorney-client relationship between Morris and Hippo, Defendants contend that Counts I and II do not involve the Templar Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) While Counts I and II certainly involve an attorney-client relationship between Hippo and Morris, they also explicitly involve Hippo's outside business activities with the Templar Entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants argue that \"[o]f the 12 paragraphs that appear in Count I ...\n   <strong>\n    none\n   </strong>\n   of them mention Templar.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original.) This claim is clearly false. Paragraph 73, which is contained within Count I of the Underlying Complaint, mentions the Templar Entities four times. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67-2 \u00b6 73.) Count I alleges: (1) that Hippo improperly provided information to Templar Development to benefit his own competing real estate projects (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73(d) ); (2) that Hippo worked in concert with one of Morris's employees to seek out and facilitate real estate development opportunities for the Templar Entities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73(f) ); (3) that Hippo procured financing and development opportunities on behalf of the Templar Entities instead of the Morris\n   entities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73(i) ); and (4) that Hippo charged Morris legal fees and expenses for time that Hippo spent advancing the interests of the Templar Entities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73(r) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants similarly argue that none of the paragraphs in Count II of the Underlying Complaint mention the Templar Entities. (ECF No. 87 at 22.) But the Templar Entities are also mentioned three times in the paragraphs under Count II. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67-2 \u00b6\u00b6 80(i); 80(r); 81(i).) Like in Count I, the paragraphs mentioning the Templar Entities under Count II allege that Hippo used information he obtained in his representation of Morris to usurp development and financing opportunities to benefit the Templar Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plain language of the Complaint in the Underlying Suit entirely discredits Defendants' argument that Counts I and II are based solely on Hippo's role as Morris's attorney. Rather, the allegations in Morris's Complaint straightforwardly characterize the legal malpractice and breach of contract claims as resulting from Hippo's self-dealing on behalf of the Templar Entities. Put differently, Counts I and II of the Complaint allege that Hippo committed legal malpractice and breach of contract by simultaneously acting as Morris's attorney and a competing real-estate developer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Therefore, Westport has no duty to defend because each claim in the Underlying Suit falls unambiguously within the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peccadillos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7274189\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/27/259/#p267\">\n    27 A.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an insurer's \"obligation to defend remains unless [an] exclusion clearly defeats every cause of action averred in the underlying complaint\");\n   <em>\n    Biborosch v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 86 \u00b6 33) (\"Defendants admit that HFP did not disclose Templar Development or Templar Elmerton in the Outside Interest Supplement [to the application for the Policy].\"). However, there are disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment for Westport on its claim for rescission of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   First, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Defendants knowingly and intentionally misled Westport by failing to disclose the Templar Entities in their application for the Policy. Defendants argue that they did not disclose the Templar Entities on the application for the Policy because VIP Ventures, another outside entity which Defendants disclosed on the application, was the actual owner of the Templar Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, \u00b6 10.) Fleming, the HFP attorney who filled out the application for the Policy, testified that he did not disclose the Templar Entities on the application because he disclosed VIP Ventures, the outside entity that technically held Hippo and Fleming's ownership shares in the Templar Entities. (ECF No. 81-1 at A517.) He further testified that he had no reason to believe that he or HFP would intentionally omit the Templar Entities on the application for the Policy. (ECF No. 81-1 at A512; ECF No. 86 at 22, \u00b6 10.) Thus, Westport is not entitled to summary judgment on its claim for rescission because there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether HFP, through Fleming, acted in bad faith or with the intent to deceive when he filled out the application for the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Second, there is a genuine dispute as to whether Defendants' nondisclosure was material to the risk to be insured. A misrepresentation on an insurance application is material if the \"information would influence the decision of an issuer in the issuance of a policy, assessing the nature of the risk, or setting premium rates.\"\n   <em>\n    A.G.

(ECF No. 81-1 at A593-55.) The affidavit avers that Westport \"would have included a 'Specified Entities Exclusion,' which would have stated that any claims or suits in any way arising out of the lawyer's or firm's involvement with [the] Templar [Entities] would have been excluded from coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A594, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This affidavit, however, does not establish the materiality of Defendants' omission of the Templar Entities on their application. Westport does not clearly establish that Defendants' involvement with the Templar entities would have influenced Westport's decision on the issuance of the policy, its assessment of the risk, or its decision on premium rates. Westport does not allege that it would have chosen not to issue the Policy had Defendants disclosed the Templar Entities. And although the affidavit states that Westport may have assessed the risk differently,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   it appears Westport would have issued a substantially similar policy had Defendants disclosed the Templar Entities. The affidavit merely avers that Westport would have included a \"Specified Entities Exclusion\" to explicitly exclude coverage for any claims involving the Templar Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, a separate Specified Entities Exclusion would not affect the risk underlying the Policy because the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion already broadly excludes coverage for all lawsuits involving outside businesses, including the Templar Entities. Moreover, Westport does not allege that it would have charged Defendants a higher premium had they disclosed the Templar Entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants' omission of the Templar Entities on their application for the Policy was knowing and intentional and whether the omission was material. Accordingly, the Court will deny summary judgment on Westport's claims for rescission and voidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The draft Complaint mentioned the Templar Entities several times. (ECF No. 88 at A849-75.) Namely, the draft Complaint alleges that Hippo concealed the creation of the Templar Entities from Morris (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at A849-50 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 20) and that Hippo usurped real estate opportunities from Morris in favor of the Templar Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A854 \u00b6\u00b6 34(i), 41(i).) Therefore, the Court finds that the draft Complaint put Westport on notice of the existence of the Templar Entities as of October 2009. Accordingly, Westport's claims for rescission and voidance would be time-barred if the four-year statute of limitations was triggered in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Westport argues that although the draft Complaint it received in 2009 clearly mentioned the Templar Entities, \"a draft complaint could not provide Westport the facts sufficient to determine a material misrepresentation was made ... in order to allow rescission.\" (ECF No. 91 at 16.) Westport claims that it did not learn of the extent of Hippo's involvement with the Templar Entities until it obtained a transcript of Hippo's deposition sometime in 2016. Therefore, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to when Westport learned the facts supporting its claims for rescission and voidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   There is also a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants were prejudiced by Westport's delay in bringing its claims for rescission and voidance. \"The party asserting laches as a defense must present evidence demonstrating prejudice ... [such as] that a witness has died or become unavailable, that substantiating records were lost or destroyed, or that the defendant has changed his position in anticipation that the opposing party has waived his claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth ex rel.

Defendants argue that they are prejudiced by Westport's delay because they have incurred legal fees defending the Underlying Suit and litigating this case. However, from the facts in evidence and the parties' briefs, it is not clear that Defendants changed their position or that Defendants were otherwise prejudiced by any delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Therefore, genuine disputes of material fact as to whether laches bars Westport's rescission and voidance claims preclude summary judgment in its favor on these claims. Conversely, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Westport's claims for rescission and voidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court finds there is no genuine dispute of material fact that the Policy's Outside Business Exclusion applies to Morris's claims\n   against Defendants in the Underlying Suit and Westport is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count I. Therefore, Westport has no duty to defend Defendants against the Underlying Suit. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Westport's Motion for Summary Judgment on Count I for declaratory judgment.
