(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 6; Dkt. 10). For the reasons discussed below, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 10) is granted and Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 6) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed his application for DIB on March 6, 2014.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 78-88). Plaintiff's application was initially denied on May 14, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92-103). At Plaintiff's request, a hearing was held before administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") Lisa Martin in Alexandria, Virginia, on July 1, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 47-77). Plaintiff appeared with his attorney in Jamestown, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On August 11, 2016, the ALJ issued a partially favorable decision, awarding Plaintiff benefits as of February 1, 2016, but finding that Plaintiff was not disabled between his alleged onset date of March 1, 2013, and January 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-35). Plaintiff requested Appeals Council review; his request was denied on December 6, 2017, making the ALJ's determination the Commissioner's final decision.

Dr. Ouweleen also found that Plaintiff's left hand was neurovascularly intact and that Plaintiff had a \"good active range of motion of his fingers and his elbow.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the heading \"PLAN,\" Dr. Ouweleen noted that Plaintiff \"currently is on total disability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff treated with Dr. Ouweleen on June 13, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 421). Dr. Ouweleen noted that Plaintiff \"was doing very well,\" and an examination revealed \"very good forward flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation,\" and that Plaintiff had \"excellent rotator cuff strength.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Ouweleen's impression was \"excellent progress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under \"PLAN,\" Dr. Ouweleen assessed that Plaintiff would be able to return to light duty on June 17, 2013, with no \"explosive situations with the left shoulder,\" or \"heavy lifting or carrying.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Ouweleen noted that Plaintiff would be considered to have a \"mild partial disability at this point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At a follow-up visit with Dr. Ouweleen on July 25, 2013, Plaintiff reported that \"although he went back to light duty, he basically has been doing normal duty,\" and that he \"stopped therapy a few weeks ago.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 420). An examination revealed \"very good\" range of motion for Plaintiff's left shoulder, and \"excellent\" rotator cuff strength. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff had \"no pain with provocative testing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under \"PLAN,\" Dr. Ouweleen noted that Plaintiff was \"allowed activities as tolerated at this point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff visited Dr. Ouweleen on September 5, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419). Plaintiff reported that he was back at work lifting duct work overhead and had developed pain in his left shoulder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff found it difficult to continue working. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). An examination revealed tenderness over the biceps, but good range of motion and good rotator cuff strength. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Ouweleen assessed biceps tendonitis, and noted that Plaintiff would continue working, but reassess his pain in 10 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). A September 7, 2013 MRI of Plaintiff's left shoulder (ordered by Dr. Ouweleen) was unremarkable, other than a small amount of fluid in the subacromion bursa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 432). Additional findings included a \"status post successful surgical repair of a supraspinatus tendon rotator cuff tear,\" and \"status post successful surgical repair of a SLAP tendon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Medical records from the months following reveal that Plaintiff was laid off from work, and that his left shoulder pain continued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 415-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On January 3, 2014, Plaintiff underwent an additional surgery - a left shoulder arthroscopy with biceps tenotomy and a labral debridement with an open subpectoral biceps tenodesis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 388, 392). Plaintiff tolerated the procedure well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 393). Following the procedure, Plaintiff returned to physical therapy on February 10, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 485). Plaintiff followed-up with Dr. Ouweleen over the next several months, during which he reported soreness, but demonstrated good and improving ranges of motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 774, 776, 780, 782, 784, 786, 788). For example, on March 6, 2014, Dr. Ouweleen noted that Plaintiff \"report[ed] continued improvement,\" and found Plaintiff's range of motion \"ha[d] improved dramatically since [his] last visit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 776). Plaintiff's forward flexion\n   was full, abduction was 120 degrees, and internal and external rotation were almost equal to the right. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under the \"Plan\" section for these treatment notes, Dr. Ouweleen noted that Plaintiff was \"totally disabled.\" On January 5, 2015, Dr. Ouweleen examined Plaintiff and found that, based on New York State Workers' Compensation Guidelines, Plaintiff had a 52 percent loss of use of his left arm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 792).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ALJ afforded \"great weight\" to Dr. Ouweleen's opinion that Plaintiff could return to light duty work after his first left shoulder surgery, and \"some weight\" to Dr. Ouweleen's January 2015 opinion that Plaintiff had a problem with his left shoulder following his second left shoulder surgery without specific limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). Plaintiff argues that the ALJ did not address any of the factors articulated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; however, a review of the written determination reveals that this is not the case. The ALJ discussed that Dr. Ouweleen was Plaintiff's treating surgeon (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32), and that Dr. Ouweleen began treating Plaintiff in 2006, and performed three surgeries on Plaintiff between 2006 and 2014 (one on his right shoulder, and two on his left), prior to February 1, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 715-718). The ALJ also discussed the assessments of Louis Nunez, M.D., who performed an IME in May 2014, and Dr. Coniglio's February 2015 IME. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31). At the May 2014 IME, Dr. Nunez noted some reduced range in Plaintiff's left shoulder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 732). At the February 2015 IME, Dr. Coniglio found reduced range of motion and tenderness over the left joint, but assessed no sitting, lifting, bending, or standing restrictions.

Plaintiff points to seven visits during which Dr. Ouweleen opined that Plaintiff was \"totally disabled\" following Plaintiff's January 2014 surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   These \"opinions\" are not accompanied by any meaningful functional assessment and are listed under a heading entitled \"Plan\" at the end of the treatment notes for Plaintiff's left shoulder injury; they appear to be status updates for planning and treatment purposes, rather than a formal opinion on Plaintiff's ability to work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201527\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201527\">\n    at 772, 776, 780, 782, 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . 786, 788). The Court further notes that Dr. Ouweleen's notations that Plaintiff is totally disabled appear to conflict with his treatment notes which, as explained above, reveal that Plaintiff's condition was improving.

To the contrary, aside from Dr. Ouweleen's January 2015 opinion relating to Plaintiff's loss of use of his left arm, the ALJ also discussed and relied on (1) treatment records from Dr. Ouweleen, from between 2013 and 2015, including that Plaintiff was permitted to return to light duty work following his 2013 left shoulder surgery; (2) a May 2014 consultative examination with Dr. Jenouri, which revealed some improvement in Plaintiff's shoulder, as well as his examination findings of Plaintiff's shoulder, which included shoulder forward elevation right 150 degrees and left 100 degrees, abduction right 150 degrees and left 100 degrees, full range of motion adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation bilaterally; (3) a\n   May 2014 IME with Dr. Nunez, which revealed some reduced range of motion in Plaintiff's left shoulder; and (4) a February 2015 IME with Dr. Coniglio, which revealed reduced range of motion, flexion, and adduction, and a 42.4 percent loss of use of Plaintiff's left arm (an opinion to which the ALJ afforded \"some weight\").

Rather, these medical opinions, which all reveal some loss of use in Plaintiff's left arm due to his shoulder impairment, are consistent with the RFC assessment that Plaintiff \"is precluded from all overhead reaching tasks with the upper extremities, and he is limited to frequent, but not constant, upper extremity forward reaching, handling, and fingering tasks.\" The fact that the ALJ did not adopt a specific RFC proposed by any one medical opinion is of no consequence and is not required.\n   <em>\n    Matta v.
