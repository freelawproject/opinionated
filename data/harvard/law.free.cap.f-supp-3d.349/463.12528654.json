Hay filed a Motion for Leave to Proceed\n   <em>\n    In Forma Pauperis\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1) and a Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the George W. Hill Correctional Facility based on conditions he endured during his incarceration there (ECF No. 2). By Order entered on August 17, 2018, the Court granted Hay leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismissed his Complaint. (ECF No. 4.) Specifically, the Court noted that the George W. Hill Correctional Facility is not an entity subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 and that, \"to the extent that [Hay] wished to sue medical staff or guards,\" he had failed to allege how those individuals were personally involved in the violation of his rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court granted Hay leave to file an amended complaint no later than September 20, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hay did not file an amended complaint by that date. Accordingly, by Order entered on October 3, 2018, the Court dismissed this action without prejudice for failure to prosecute. (ECF No. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court received an Amended Complaint from Hay on November 14, 2018. (ECF No. 6.) In the caption of his Amended Complaint, Hay names the \"George Hill Correction Facility\" and \"the Warden, Guards, Medical Staff\" as the Defendants. In light of Hay's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status, the Court will reopen this case and vacate its October 3, 2018 Order. However, for the following reasons, the Court will dismiss the Amended Complaint and provide Hay one final opportunity to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hay's claims arise from the alleged conditions of confinement during his incarceration at the George W. Hill Correctional Facility. (Am. Compl. at 2.) He alleges as follows: \"I was denied medical attention, medication, my medication 20 MG oxycodone was taken from me and destroyed. I was made to sleep on urine soaked floor, I\n   had sores on my legs, hips. Denied bathroom [privileges], I asked several guards to clean up urine on floor-denied clean sheets-denied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He further contends that guards told him \"that there were no request forms to see doctor\" and that he was told to find his own pen and paper when he asked for those supplies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Hay also mentions that he was \"made to sleep on dirty cell floor with a bad back\" and that he was \"bitten by bugs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) As relief, Hay seeks $50,000.00 in damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As noted above, the Court previously granted Hay leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court is required to dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii) if it fails to state a claim.

As Hay is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court must construe his allegations liberally.\n   <em>\n    Higgs v. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828353\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/333/#p339\">\n    655 F.3d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (3d Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Amended Complaint Fails to State a Claim as Pled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Once again, it is difficult to determine whether Hay has a basis for a plausible claim because of the generalized manner in which he has pled his Amended Complaint. Hay names \"George Hill Correctional Facility\" and \"The Warden, Guards, Medical Staff\" as the Defendants in the caption of his Amended Complaint, but names Warden John Doe, Guards John Doe, Counselors John Doe, and Medical Staff John Doe on the second page of the Amended Complaint. Thus, it is difficult to assess the validity of Hay's claims because of the uncertainty of who he has intended the named Defendants to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As the Court previously informed Hay, it is appropriate for him to identify individuals as \"John Doe\" or \"Jane Doe\" if he does not know their names. However, he is still obligated to explain how each individual named in the Amended Complaint was personally involved in the violation of his constitutional rights, whether due to the prison official's own misconduct or the official's deliberate indifference to known deficiencies in a policy or procedure that violated Hay's rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barkes v. First Corr. Med., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201543\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/307/#p320\">\n    766 F.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320 (3d Cir. 2014),\n   <em>\n    reversed on other grounds,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v. Barkes\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589956\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2042/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589956\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2042/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). It is not proper for Hay to sue all personnel at the George W. Hill Correctional Center based on alleged failures by various departments unless each and every staff member was personally involved in violating his rights. In other words, it is insufficient to pin liability on every staff member based solely on the fact that those staff members are part of a flawed system, if that is what Hay is trying to do. Instead, Hay must\n   limit his claims to those individuals and entities who played a role-whether through acts or inaction-in violating his rights. His allegations are simply insufficient to state a claim without any reference to which specific individual engaged in what conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawal v. McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3813386\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/546/107/#p113\">\n    546 F. App'x 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 (3d Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In sum, Hay cannot move forward on his Amended Complaint as pled because it is not clear who he named as Defendants or what each individual did to violate his rights. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the Amended Complaint with one final opportunity to amend. Some of Hay's claims also suffer from other deficiencies, which the Court will address below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Additional Deficiencies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hay again appears to name \"George Hill Correctional Facility\" as a Defendant in this matter The Court previously informed Hay that he could not maintain claims against the facility because it is \"not a legal entity susceptible to suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Cephas v. George W. Hill Corr. Facility\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A.

Mar. 11, 2009) (\"[A] prison or correctional facility is not a 'person' that is subject to suit under federal civil rights laws.\"). Accordingly, Hay's claims against the \"George Hill Correctional Facility\" will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Many of Hay's claims also fail substantively. The Eighth Amendment governs claims brought by convicted inmates challenging their conditions of confinement, while the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governs claims brought by pretrial detainees.\n   <em>\n    Hubbard v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hubbard I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1547088\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/150/#p166\">\n    399 F.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (3d Cir. 2005). Because Hay's status during his incarceration is not clear from the Complaint, the Court will analyze the Complaint under both amendments. To establish an Eighth Amendment violation based on the conditions of confinement, a prisoner must establish that prison officials' acts or omissions denied him \"the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.\"\n   <em>\n    Rhodes v. Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313782\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/337/#p347\">\n    452 U.S. 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313782\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/337/#p347\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313782\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/337/#p347\">\n    69 L.Ed.2d 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).

(Am. Compl. at 3-4.) He also states that he was denied bathroom privileges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) At this time, Hay's vague allegations again do not set forth a plausible claim regarding conditions of confinement. While being deprived of a toilet can rise to the level of a deprivation of basic human needs,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In sum, without more, Hay's sparse allegations fail to state a claim because they do not plausibly establish that the conditions of confinement at the George W.
