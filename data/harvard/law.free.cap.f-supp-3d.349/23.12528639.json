Defendant has moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) to suppress certain statements Defendant made to law enforcement agents that were allegedly procured unconstitutionally. The government has indicated that it does not intend to use Defendant's statements during its case in chief but does want the option of using the statements for impeachment. Defendant argues that the government cannot use the statements, even for impeachment, because they were obtained involuntarily in violation of the Due Process Clause. Because the government will not use the statements during the case in chief, the Court need only determine if the statements were obtained voluntarily as required by the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oregon v.

The Court has considered the evidence presented at both days of the hearing. In doing so, the Court considered the demeanor and behavior of the witnesses on the stand, the witnesses' manner of testifying, whether the witnesses impressed the Court as truthful, whether the witnesses impressed the Court as having an accurate memory and recollection, whether the witnesses had any motive for not telling the truth, whether the witnesses had a full opportunity to observe the matters about which they testified, and whether the witnesses had any interest in the outcome of the case, or friendship or hostility to the other persons concerned with the case. The Court also considered the reasonableness or unreasonableness and the probability or improbability of the testimony of the witnesses in determining whether to accept it as true and accurate, as well as whether the testimony was contradicted or supported by other credible evidence. The Court has also considered the pleadings and the entire record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court credits the testimony of the witnesses Joseph Lewis, Daniel Harding, and Yossi Avitan as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court makes the following findings of fact. The Court will first make findings of fact that are relevant to the Defendant's motion and undisputed and/or uncontroverted by any evidence, and then make findings as to facts that are relevant and disputed or controverted by some evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 5: 1. On March 2, 2017, arrests took place in the United States and in Israel involving the allegedly illegal money transmitting service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 5: 8-11. Defendant Yossi Avitan was not arrested at that time because law enforcement anticipated his presence at a residence in Miami, Florida, but he was not there.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 5: 21-25.

There was also some discussion of an oil mine in Nevada that Defendant had attempted to purchase. September 5, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 36: 23-24.

Defendant testified that when he did not understand he would tell the agents that he does not speak English very well or he would tell them that he does not know how to say something.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 95: 18-23. Additionally, if there were words that the Defendant did not know how to say in English, he used an application on his phone that would translate the Hebrew word into English.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 101: 7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the interviews were not recorded, throughout the interview, Agent Harding took contemporaneous notes on his laptop of what Defendant was saying.

On the following morning of August 24, 2017, the agents took Defendant to the Washington, D.C. field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he was processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 43: 5-9. Defendant was then taken to the courthouse and handed over to the U.S. Marshal's Service for his initial appearance in court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 43: 8-11.

The agents had been under the impression that they were going to continue working with Defendant, but the agents were instructed that all future communication should go through Defendant's counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 43: 15-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following the initial appearance, the agents transported Defendant to an apartment in Washington, D.C. where he was going to stay.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 43: 22-25.

September 5, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 19: 11-25. A Hebrew interpreter was also present.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20: 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The agents' final interaction with Defendant occurred on September 10, 2017. Defendant called and left a voicemail on Agent Harding's office phone.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 25: 20-21. In the voicemail, Defendant mentioned something about antiquities and wanting to see Agent Harding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26: 1-3. Defendant asked Agent Harding to call him back.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26: 2. When Agent Harding called Defendant back, Defendant reiterated what he had said in the voicemail. Agent Harding told Defendant that, following the instructions of Defendant's attorney, he could not meet Defendant or have any interactions with him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26: 8-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Disputed or Controverted Relevant Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court also notes two relevant points that were the subject of competing evidence at the evidentiary hearing. First, some contradictory evidence was presented regarding the extent to which Defendant used the Hebrew interpreter during the August 28, 2017 debrief. Agent Harding testified that the interpreter provided some instruction to Defendant at the beginning of the debrief, but the interpreter did not interpret throughout.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20: 11-17. Instead, Defendant directly answered the questions he was being asked in English.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21: 1-4. But, Defendant testified that he used the interpreter throughout most of the meeting and only occasionally spoke in English when he thought the interpreter did not understand what he was saying.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 95: 4-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court credits the testimony of Agent Harding on this point. At the evidentiary hearing, Defendant testified about his use of the interpreter at the debrief only after all the witnesses were finished and counsel had made their final arguments. Following counsels' arguments, the Court asked Defendant's counsel if he had a response to Agent Harding's testimony that Defendant had not used the interpreter at the debriefing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 87: 22- 88:11. A discussion then ensued between counsel and the Court about whether Defendant had required the interpreter during the debrief. It was only after this prompting that Defendant, having been recalled as a witness, testified that he had used the interpreter for the majority of the debrief. Accordingly, the Court credits Agent Harding's testimony on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, there is contradictory testimony around a statement that Agent Lewis allegedly made to Defendant about his need for counsel. Defendant testified that before he signed the Waiver of Right to Presentment Without Unnecessary Delay and the Advice of Rights forms at the airport on August 22, 2017, Defendant asked the agents if he needed a lawyer. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 94: 6-7. Defendant testified that Agent Lewis told him that \"if I haven't done anything I don't need an attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 94: 7-8. Agent Lewis testified that he did not recall whether Defendant asked him this question or whether he responded with that statement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644491\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/714/#p723\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 74: 7-8. Agent Harding testified that it was his best memory that this exchange did not happen.

The Court's analysis concentrates on Defendant's role in initiating discussions, the agents' general treatment of Defendant, Defendant's characteristics, and Defendant's advisement of his rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, Defendant played an important role in initiating and continuing communication with the agents. Defendant contacted Agent Lewis and offered to come to the United States to resolve the charges against him. When Agent Lewis could not speak on August 8, 2018, Defendant called him back to talk the next day. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 7: 13-16. Prior to contacting Agent Lewis, Defendant had previously been told about the arrests of those involved in the allegedly illegal money transmitting service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 103: 9-12. Defendant knew that agents had come to his home in Miami and insinuated that Defendant had legal problems.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7: 1-5. Defendant had also seen a copy of the indictment with his name in it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 90: 22-25. And Defendant had spoken to a lawyer, who is his friend, about the indictment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 90: 18-20. In addition to his awareness of the pending charges in the United States, Defendant also knew that as long as he remained in Morocco, it would be impossible for the United States to extradite him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 111: 4-6. Despite knowing that there were pending charges against him in the United States and that he could not be extradited from Morocco, Defendant, of his own volition, reached out to Agent Lewis and asked to come to the United States so that he could discuss his legal problems with the agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant's voluntary choice to speak with the agents was evidenced even after he was appointed counsel. Following Defendant's appointment of counsel and debrief with the government, Defendant called Agent Harding. Agent Harding informed Defendant that he could only speak to Defendant through defense counsel. September 5, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 26: 1-13. Defendant's repeated decisions to reach out to the agents, even after he had been appointed counsel, are evidence that Defendant's statements were voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hallford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310321,4175942\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/850/\">\n    816 F.3d at 858-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding evidence of voluntariness where defendant agreed to the interview without pressure from agents).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, the Court considers the agents' general treatment of Defendant as evidence that Defendant's statements were made voluntarily. The circumstances surrounding Defendant's two interviews do not show any signs of intimidation, coercion, or deception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n    479 U.S. at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n    107 S.Ct. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing coercive police activity as a predicate for involuntariness). Once agents had taken custody of Defendant, they escorted him to a quiet, secluded area of the airport to go over his rights. August 27, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 13: 7-9. Defendant was not handcuffed and he was free to move about the area.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 13: 25. Upon leaving the airport on August 22, 2017, the agents took Defendant to a specialty grocery store so that he could get Kosher food.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21: 9-12. After Defendant got food, the agents took him to a hotel. Defendant had a private bedroom and a private bathroom.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 23: 13-17. The agents engaged in small talk with Defendant at the hotel that night but did not ask him substantive questions about\n   the investigation because Defendant was tired due to the length of his flight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213196\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/157/#p167\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 82: 1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The interview the following morning lasted approximately three to five hours. September 5, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 14: 9-15. Before beginning the interview, Defendant was given breakfast and the agents took breaks, including lunch, throughout. August 27, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 40: 19-23. Again, Defendant was not handcuffed and was free to move about the hotel suite. September 5, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 14: 16-20. Additionally, the agents did not pressure Defendant to answer questions, and there is no evidence that Defendant wanted to stop answering questions. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 40: 9-11. The Court concludes that the circumstances surrounding Defendant's statements, in which defendant's essential needs were provided for, are further evidence that Defendant's statements were voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hallford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310321,4175942\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/850/\">\n    816 F.3d at 858-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding evidence of voluntariness where the interview setting was not a \"police-dominated atmosphere\" and the agents did not deprive defendant of essentials);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204567\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/428/#p438\">\n    640 F.3d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 438 (1st Cir. 2011) (finding statements voluntary where the \"tone of the interview was cordial, its length was reasonable, and the defendant was not deprived of any essentials\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, the Court considers Defendant's characteristics and finds that they support the conclusion that the Defendant's statements were voluntarily made. Defendant is an adult who has previously lived and worked in the United States for short periods of time. Defendant lived and worked in New York for about three months and Miami for about a month and returned in 2015 for an unknown period of time. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 26: 20-25; 89: 14-16. Defendant is also a sophisticated, international businessman. While in the United States, Defendant started a business which he later moved to Israel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204567\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/428/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26: 24-27: 3. Defendant also owned an international mining company which was registered in London, England.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204567\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/428/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 112: 20. These characteristics support a finding that Defendant's will was not overborne by the manner of the agents' questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant argues that the fact that he is not an American citizen and is not familiar with the American legal system supports a finding that his statements were involuntary. But, Defendant's citizenship is just one consideration. Despite being a non-citizen, Defendant understood the American legal system sufficiently to realize that he was suspected of a crime, had been indicted, and had agents looking for him in the United States. Additionally, Defendant spoke with a lawyer in Morocco about his indictment prior to contacting Agent Lewis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204567\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/428/#p438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 90: 22-25. So, even if Defendant did not understand the nuances of the American legal system, he knew that he was in legal trouble and that he wanted to speak to law enforcement about it. Moreover, there is no evidence that Defendant had any mental impairments or that he otherwise would not have understood the import of his decisions. Instead, Defendant is a sophisticated, international businessman who has lived intermittently in the United States, started businesses in the United States, and had an international mining company registered in London.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4214966\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/611/12/#p33\">\n    611 F.Supp.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33-34 (D.D.C. 2009) (finding statements voluntary where defendant was a non-citizen living outside of the United States with limited knowledge of the U.S. legal system and limited education);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bourdet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3900500\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/477/164/#p180\">\n    477 F.Supp.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180 (D.D.C. 2007) (finding defendant's confession voluntary despite defendant's attempts to portray himself as a \"uneducated pig farmer\" from Guatemala \"who could not understand his rights\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant also argues that the fact that he spoke English as a second language is evidence that his statement was involuntary. But, the fact that Defendant spoke English as a second language does not render his statements involuntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campaneria v. Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n    891 F.2d 1014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1020 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding defendant's statements voluntary even though he was foreign-born, young, and had a poor command of English). As will be further explained below, the Court finds that Defendant had a sufficient command of English to be able to understand the questions asked of him by the agents and to understand the information he was conveying to the agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   pgs. 34-37. Accordingly, Defendant's command of English was sufficient to provide agents with voluntary statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the Court considers as evidence of voluntariness the fact that the agents repeatedly advised Defendant of his rights. Upon taking custody of Defendant, the agents immediately took him to a secluded, quiet location where they could advise him of his rights. The agents first showed Defendant the FBI's form for Waiver of Right to Presentment Without Unnecessary Delay. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 15: 3-4. This form advised Defendant of his right to be taken to a court without unnecessary delay where a judge would advise him of his other rights and the charges pending against him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 16: 4-9. Agent Lewis read the entire form aloud to Defendant\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 16: 11-12.

This form advised Defendant of his right to remain silent and that anything he said could be used against him. The form also advised Defendant of his right to an attorney.

While the agents read portions of the language to Defendant, they did not read the entire form aloud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 37: 23-24. Instead, the agents summarized the form for Defendant and reviewed parts of it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 37: 16-19. Defendant signed the form. Defendant did not ask any question, nor did he ask to be taken to a judge, to have an attorney present, or to remain silent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 38: 3-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Despite the fact that agents twice reviewed Defendant's rights with him, Defendant argues that the advisement was insufficient under the Due Process Clause. Defendant has two arguments for why the advisement of rights was insufficient. First, Defendant argues that his command of English was too poor to understand what rights he had and what rights he was waiving. Second, Defendant argues that Agent Lewis's alleged comment that he needed counsel only if he had done something wrong rendered his subsequent statements to the agents involuntary. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that these arguments do not make Defendant's statements involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the Court finds that Defendant's command of English was sufficient to understand his rights and to decide voluntarily to speak with the agents. The fact that a person is not proficient in speaking and understanding English has a bearing on that person's ability to understand his or her freedom of choice. A non-English speaking person may be unable to understand what rights they possess or how the waiver of those rights could be detrimental.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Han\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175576\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/38/#p53\">\n    199 F.Supp.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (D.D.C. 2016). But, a non-native English speaker can still voluntarily waive their rights if their command of English is sufficient to have understood the warnings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campaneria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n    891 F.2d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Court finds that Defendant had a sufficient command of English to understand his rights as explained to him by the agents and to decide to speak with the agents anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On August 8, 2017, Defendant called Agent Lewis to discuss the pending criminal matter. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 91: 6-9. In English, Agent Lewis directed Defendant to call back the next day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7: 13-16. Defendant did so. Over the next two weeks, Agent Lewis and Defendant spoke in English over the phone and over text to coordinate Defendant's travel to the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9: 6-8. Defendant comprehended these conversations sufficiently to arrange his flight for the proper date, time, and location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On August 22, 2017, while the agents were explaining Defendant's rights, Agent Lewis asked Defendant to read a line from the Advice of Rights form aloud. Defendant was able to read the line aloud in English.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 18: 1-5. Moreover, after Agent Lewis read the Waiver of Right to Presentment Without Unnecessary Delay and the Advice of Rights forms to Defendant, Defendant never indicated that he did not understand the forms or his rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20: 2-7. Upon leaving the airport, the agents and Defendant conversed in English about various topics on the way to the grocery store and to the hotel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 21: 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The following day, August 23, 2017, the agents questioned Defendant in English for three to five hours about the allegedly illegal money transmitting service. September 5, 2018 Hr'g, Tr. at 14: 9-15. During the interview, the agents reported that if there were words that Defendant did not understand, they might have to rephrase something. But Defendant's command of English was sufficient to allow him to communicate about sophisticated topics in English for hours. While Defendant spoke, Agent Harding took contemporaneous notes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 15: 8-10. These notes on Defendant's communications in English resulted in a comprehensive 302 memorandum of understanding that was approximately 15-pages long. It seems doubtful that Defendant would have been able to convey so much detailed information if his command of English was as limited as he now claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, there were times when Defendant had access to translation services and chose to forgo them. During the August 23, 2017 interview, Defendant had a translation application on his phone that he could use. August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 101: 7-10. Defendant reported that he used this application only to translate words from Hebrew into English.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant never used the application to translate the agents' statements from English into Hebrew so that he could understand what the agents were saying.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 102: 12-16. Agent Harding testified that he remembered Defendant using his translation application only once when there was a \"slang\" word that the parties could not understand. September 5, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 57: 5-16. Additionally, at his August 28, 2017 debrief, Defendant had access to an interpreter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20: 4-5. Despite the presence of the interpreter, Defendant chose to communicate in English with the prosecution for at least some, if not most, of the session.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20: 11-21: 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition to the numerous occasions on which Defendant demonstrated a sufficient command of the English language, there is also testimony from the agents on Defendant's ability to understand English. Agent Lewis acknowledged that Defendant spoke in \"broken\" English and that \"[s]ome of his words may not be the same present tense, past tense. He may not use the exact same English word that we may use in our natural speaking.\" August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 53: 16-21. But, Agent Lewis was still able to understand and to communicate with Defendant without significant issues.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Agent Harding echoed this sentiment, explaining that, while he could tell that English was not Defendant's first language, \"[h]e had good English.\" September 5, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 43: 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Even Defendant Avitan explained that \"I can communicate in English, in a regular conversation. I can communicate with almost anyone.\" August 27, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 112: 6-7. Defendant went on to explain that there are some words, especially higher-level words, that he does not understand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 95: 10-12. Moreover, when Defendant was asked if he read and understood the Waiver of Right to Presentment Without Unnecessary Delay and the Advice of Rights forms, Defendant responded that, while he could not read the forms, the agent explained the forms to the him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 93: 2-5. When given the opportunity, Defendant did not testify that he did not understand his rights as communicated to him by the agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on the evidence, the Court concludes that Defendant had a sufficient command of English to understand his rights and to voluntarily waive them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campaneria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536113\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1014/#p1020\">\n    891 F.2d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding waiver valid where defendant's native language was Spanish and \"he spoke in broken English with an accent and occasionally lapsed into Spanish\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Assuming arguendo that Agent Lewis did make this comment, the Court concludes that the comment does not render Defendant's statements involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Statements made by a defendant \"in circumstances violating the strictures of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   'are admissible for impeachment if their trustworthiness ... satisfies legal standards.' \"\n   <em>\n    Murdock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716069,3769399\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/1302/\">\n    667 F.3d at 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mincey v.

On first taking custody of Defendant on August 22, 2017, the agents read him his rights, and Defendant never indicated that he did not understand them. It was while apprising Defendant of his rights the night of August 22, 2017 that Agent Lewis allegedly told Defendant he needed a lawyer only if he had done something wrong. But, the agents did not begin interviewing Defendant immediately after this. Instead, the agents only began substantively interviewing Defendant the following morning after they had again apprised Defendant of his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant primarily relies on\n   <em>\n    Doody v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715056\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/986/\">\n    649 F.3d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2011), for the proposition that Agent Lewis's comment rendered Defendant's statements involuntary. In\n   <em>\n    Doody\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the defendant's confession was made involuntarily, in part, because the agent gave the defendant\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings which deviated substantially from the required format and repeatedly minimized the warning's significance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715056\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/986/\">\n    649 F.3d at 1002-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the faulty\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning alone did not render the defendant's confession involuntary. Instead, the court in that case considered the entirety of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715056\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/986/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715056\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/986/\">\n    at 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circumstances leading the court to conclude that the defendant's confession was involuntary included the fact that the defendant was a juvenile, the agents relentlessly questioned the defendant for thirteen hours, the defendant was not alert and non-responsive throughout much of the interview, the agents had a harsh and accusing tone and demeanor, and the agents told the defendant that he \"had\" to answer their questions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715056\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/986/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715056\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/986/\">\n    at 1008-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In this case, none of the other factors are present which led the\n   <em>\n    Doody\n   </em>\n   court to find the defendant's confession involuntary. Here, at the time of the interview, Defendant was 33 years old and a sophisticated, international businessman. Defendant had voluntarily come to the United States to speak with the agents despite knowing that he had been charged with a crime. The agents were courteous to Defendant throughout the interview, giving him a private bedroom and bathroom, finding Kosher food for him, and allowing him breaks throughout. While Agent Lewis's alleged statement is some evidence of involuntariness, the Supreme Court's line of cases assessing voluntariness has never\n   \"turned on the presence or absence of a single controlling criterion; each reflected a careful scrutiny of all the surrounding circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Schneckloth v.

And, here, a careful scrutiny of all the surrounding circumstances demonstrates that Defendant's statements were voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on all of the evidence presented and the totality of the circumstances, the Court does not find these circumstances the sort of egregious circumstances that would render Defendant's statements involuntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
