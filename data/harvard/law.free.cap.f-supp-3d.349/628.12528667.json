Fully briefed, this matter is ripe for decision. For the following reasons, the Plaintiff's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In early 2015, Plaintiff Joseph J. Sims suffered a bilateral inguinal hernia in his lower abdomen. On or about May 27, 2015, Dr. Anthony Kaiser performed a bilateral laparoscopic hernia repair on Sims at Deaconess Health System in Evansville, Indiana. Dr. Kaiser used tacks and two identical pieces of surgical mesh. The mesh was ProLite Mesh made by Defendant Atrium Medical Corp. (\"Atrium\"). Following the initial surgery, Sims suffered chronic pain. After initial efforts failed to resolve Sims' chronic pain and other symptoms, Dr. Kaiser performed a laparoscopic removal of one of the pieces of mesh on or about February 24, 2017, at the same hospital in Evansville. Dr. Kaiser noted in his operative report that Sims suffered significant adhesions of the mesh, eventually requiring cauterization of the mesh from Sims' bone. Later, on or about September 29, 2017, Dr. Kaiser performed an additional repair surgery during which he removed more mesh which had adhered to Sims' intestines. Despite both reparative surgeries, Sims was unable to continue working at his job due to chronic pain and he remains unable to work today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Sims filed a Complaint alleging six causes of action against Atrium-Negligence (Count I), Strict Products Liability (Count II), Negligence Per Se (Count III), Breach of Implied Warranty (Count IV), Breach of Express Warranty (Count V), and Negligent Misrepresentation (Count V). [DN 1]. Thereafter, Atrium filed a Motion to Dismiss stating that Sims' Complaint failed for three independent reasons: \"(1) the ProLite Mesh Instructions for Use, cited and relied upon by Plaintiff in the Complaint, contain the very warnings Plaintiff alleges were not provided; (2) each of the claims asserted fails to satisfy the pleading standards articulated in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) Plaintiff cannot adequately plead causation.\" [DN 8 at 2]. In response, Sims refuted Atrium's claims and requested that the Motion to Dismiss be denied, or, in the alternative, that he be given leave to amend his Complaint. [DN 13]. Atrium replied, stating that Sims' failure to respond to arguments in the Motion to Dismiss constituted admissions and, as such, granting leave to amend would be futile. [DN 14]. On July 16, 2018, the Court issued an Order stating that Sims' prior request for leave to amend was deficient and that if he wished to amend his complaint \"he must file a proper motion to amend and tender the proposed amended complaint within 15 days of the entry of this order.\" [DN 15 at 2]. The Order further stated that the Court would not rule on Atrium's Motion to Dismiss until it decided whether to allow the amended complaint. On July 31, 2018, 15 days after the Court's Order, Sims filed a Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint and attached a Proposed Amended Complaint asserting the same causes of action. [DN 16, 16-1]. Atrium responded on August 21, 2018, asserting that Sims' motion should be denied because Sims waived his arguments, amendment would cause undue delay, and amendment would be futile.

Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Atrium challenged Sims' Complaint and moved for dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. [DN 8]. According to Atrium, Sims' Complaint fails for the three independent reasons stated above. [DN 8-1 at 2]. In response, Sims states that his claims are sufficiently pled, and, in the alternative, asks the Court for leave to file an amended complaint. [DN 13]. Sims filed a Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint, which if granted, would make Atriums' argument of lack of factual allegations moot. [DN 16]. As Sims filed a Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint to cure any deficiencies in the original Complaint, the Court must first address whether it will grant Sims' Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint. [DN 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A motion for leave to file an amended complaint is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) which states that \"a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" A district court should freely grant a plaintiff leave to amend a pleading \"when justice so requires.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). However, a district court may deny a motion to amend where there is \"undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    Foman v.

Waiver of Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Atrium's Response to Sims' Motion to Amend, Atrium argues that the motion should be denied \"because amendment is futile where Plaintiff has waived opposition to Atrium's dismissal arguments by failing to address them in his response to Atrium's motion to dismiss.\" [DN 18 at 2]. As per the Court's July 16, 2018 Order, if the Court grants Sims' Motion to Amend, Atrium's Motion to Dismiss will be moot. [DN 15]. As such, Sims' response in his Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss is of no consequence to his Motion to Amend. [DN 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Undue Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As further support for denial of the Motion for Leave to Amend, Atrium states that \"Plaintiff makes no effort to show how the publicly available medical literature, as well as adverse event reporting, was not known to him at the time the original complaint was filed. This delay is undue and compels denial of Plaintiff's motion.\" [DN 18 at 5]. \"Ordinarily, delay alone, does not justify denial of leave to amend.\"\n   <em>\n    Morse v.

Further, in the Proposed First Amended Complaint, Sims does not assert any additional claims or rely on information that would not otherwise have been available to Atrium. [DN 16-1].

Sims claims that Atrium breached its duty \"in the manufacture, design, packaging, labeling, warning, instructions, sale, marketing, distribution, and recruitment and training of physicians to implant the ProLite product.\" [DN 16-1 at 12].

Negligent Design\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to Sims, Atrium negligently designed its ProLite surgical mesh and, because of the negligent design, he suffered extensive injuries and chronic pain. Sims alleges that Atrium owed a duty to individuals, including himself to exercise reasonably and ordinary care in the design of the ProLite mesh. [DN 16-1 at 11]. Further, Sim argues that Atrium breached its duty by failing to design the ProLite mesh so as to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm. Specifically, Sims claims Atrium was negligent in its design of the mesh because it produced the mesh with \"hundreds of polypropylene loops ... [which] increase[ ] the intensity and duration of the inflammatory response.\" According to the Amended Complaint, the use of such material \"in turn increases mesh contracture, mesh migration, hernia recurrence, foreign body reaction, chronic severe pain,\n   and more.\" [DN 16-1 at 13]. Sims alleges that Atrium was aware that the material used would cause adverse reactions and employed the design \"in reckless disregard for the safety of patients, including Plaintiff.\" [DN 16-1 at 14]. Finally, Sims' alleges that the negligently designed product caused him damage and that Atrium knew that the product presented an unacceptable risk to consumers that would result in damage. [DN 16-1 at 15]. Despite Atrium's arguments to the contrary, viewing the amended complaint in the light most favorable to Sims, the Court finds that the allegations are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. As such, Sims' motion to amend as to this claim is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Negligent Manufacturing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sims alleges that Atrium negligently manufactured its ProLite surgical mesh. With respect to this claim, the Court finds that Sims has not included any factual allegations as to how Atrium breached the duty of care as to manufacturing of ProLite surgical mesh or how the ProLite surgical mesh deviated from Atrium's intended design.

Negligent Failure to Warn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sims alleges that Atrium negligently failed to warn patients, the public, and medical professionals about the gravity and severity of the risks associated with the use of its ProLite surgical mesh. Specifically, Sims claims that Atrium owed a duty to individuals, including himself, to exercise reasonable and ordinary care in the instructions and warnings of the ProLite mesh. Further, Sims alleges that Atrium's duty was breached by its willful failure to warn physicians of the potential risks [DN 16-1 at 12-15], and the negligent failure to test and study those associated risks. [DN 16-1 at 12, 14]. Finally, Sims' alleges that the product caused him damage-and that Atrium knew that the product presented an unacceptable risk to consumers that would result in damage. [DN 16-1 at 14-15]. The Court finds that the allegations in the amended complaint are sufficient to satisfy a motion to dismiss and Sims' motion to amend as to this claim is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Finally, Atrium argues that Sims \"fails to allege what safer, alternative, and practicable designs existed.\" [DN 8 at 14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court disagrees with Atrium's arguments. The allegations in the Amended Complaint state a plausible claim for relief for a strict liability design defect claim.

Sims alleges that such material \"utilizes hundreds of polypropylene loops that increase surface area [of the mesh] and inflammation.\" [DN 16-1 at 16]. In so doing, Sims identifies the aspect of the mesh's design that is defective and how that alleged defect caused his injuries, satisfying the causal element of the claim.

In this case, the Court finds that Sims' Amended Complaint contains such allegations. Sims alleges that alternative designs for implantation and treatment of hernias and soft tissue repair exist.

Although Sims alleges that \"the ProLite surgical mesh manufactured ... by Atrium was defective in ... formulation, because when the mesh left the hands of Atrium ... it was unreasonably dangerous and more dangerous than an ordinary consumer would expect\" [DN 16-1 at 15-16], Sims fails to allege specific facts to support the manufacturing defect claim. He does not allege any specific manufacturing\n   defect or failure that occurred with Atrium's product. He similarly does not allege how Atrium deviated from the product's specifications. Due to the lack of factual allegations, the Court holds that Sims failed to properly state a plausible manufacturing defect claim.

Failure to Warn\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To plead a failure to warn claim under Kentucky law, a plaintiff must allege facts for the Court to infer that (1) the manufacturer failed to provide his prescribing physician with adequate warnings about risks of which it knew or should have known and (2) the inadequate warnings proximately caused his injuries.\n   <em>\n    Prather v.

Additionally, Sims contends that Atrium's failure to adequately test and study the risks further rendered the warnings for the mesh inadequate. [DN 16-1 at 16].

[DN 16-1]. However, Sims fails to make any statement regarding whether the cited statute is penal in nature or whether the statute provides for a civil remedy. By failing to provide any factual content on those elements, Sims cannot satisfy the pleading requirement of\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal.\n   </em>\n   Further, Sims relies on a statute that is definitional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   K.R.S. \u00a7 411.300 (defining \"product liability action\" and \"plaintiff\"). \"Statutory definitions ... are not penal statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    K.F. v.

Sims' Motion to Amend as to his negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Count IV - Breach of Implied Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In Count IV, Sims alleges that Atrium breached an implied warranty. To plead a plausible breach of implied warranty claim in Kentucky, a plaintiff must provide evidence that the seller is a merchant with respect to the goods involved in the sale. K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-314. Specifically, Kentucky law makes clear that a plaintiff asserting \"a claim based upon an implied warranty must establish that it enjoyed privity of contract with the defendant-seller against whom the implied warranty claim is asserted.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown Sprinkler Corp. v. Plumbers Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8200915\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/265/237/#p240\">\n    265 S.W.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (Ky.

Atrium correctly states that, \"[t]o establish the requisite privity relationship, Plaintiff must plead that he purchased ProLite Mesh directly from Atrium.\" [DN 8 at 20]. As a rule under Kentucky law, \"privity of contract does not extend beyond the buyer-seller setting.\"\n   <em>\n    Bosch v.

Ky. April 8, 2014). In neither Sims' original Complaint nor his Amended Complaint does Sims allege that he purchased the ProLite Mesh from Atrium. Because Sims is unable to establish the privity of contract element necessary to establish a claim for breach of implied warranty, allowing Sims to amend this claim would be futile. As such, Sims' Motion to Amend as to his breach of implied warranty claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Count V - Breach of Express Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sims next claims that Atrium expressly warranted that the ProLite surgical mesh was safe, effective, and fit and proper for its intended use. To plead a plausible claim for breach of express warranty, the plaintiff must prove more than there was simply a warranty. The plaintiff must prove: (1) the seller made an affirmation of fact or promise; (2) that related to the goods; and (3) became part of the basis of the bargain between the parties. K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-313(1)(a). A warranty is the basis of the bargain if it has been relied upon as one of the inducements for purchasing the product.\n   <em>\n    Overstreet v.

Under Kentucky law, \"[i]t is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as 'warrant' or 'guarantee' or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty.\" K.R.S. \u00a7 355.2-313(2). However, \"[e]very statement made by a seller ... does not create an express warranty.\"\n   <em>\n    Overstreet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1161328\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/669/1286/#p1290\">\n    669 F.2d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Sims asserts that Atrium \"expressly warranted\" that the ProLite surgical mesh was \"safe, effective, fit and proper for its intended use.\" [DN 16-1 at 19]. Sims further alleges that he and his physician relied on Atrium's representations in allowing the implantation of the mesh, including those representations made in its labeling and Instructions for Use. According to Sims, Atrium breached these express warranties because the mesh was not safe and was unfit for the uses for which it was intended. Specifically, Sims states that Atrium breached its warranty by \"continuing sales and marketing campaigns highlighting the safety and efficacy of their product, while they knew or should have known of the defects and risk of product failure and resulting patient injuries\" as well as by \"not disclosing that [the mesh] was made of dangerous non-medical grade polypropylene that is toxic to the human body.\" [DN 16-1 at 19-20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court concludes these allegations are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss because they offer nothing more than \"a formulaic recitation\" of the elements of a claim for breach of express warranty.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Concerning the claims which the Court has denied Sims' Motion for Leave to Amend, it is necessary to address Atrium's Motion to Dismiss. As previously stated, the futility standard for considering a motion to amend is the same standard used to assess a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Rose v. Hartford Underwriters Ins.

Because the proposed Amended Complaint [DN 16-1] includes the same allegations as those included in the original Complaint [DN 1], the above analysis applies to the original claims. For the same reasons articulated above, Sims' Negligent Manufacture, Strict Products Liability Manufacturing Defect, Negligence Per Se, Breach of Implied Warranty, Breach of Express Warranty, and Negligent Misrepresentation claims as articulated in his original Complaint fail to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.
