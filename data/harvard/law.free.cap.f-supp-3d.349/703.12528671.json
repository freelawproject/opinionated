As a result of the State's inattention to the need, too long manifest, to take effective steps to ensure that Lake Erie (the Lake) will dependably provide clean, healthful water, the risk remains that sometime in the future, upwards of 500,000 Northwest Ohio residents will again, as they did in August 2014, be deprived of clean, safe water for drinking, bathing, and other normal and necessary uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The principal problem is that for years, with varying degrees of intensity, summertime Harmful Algae Blooms (HABs) have afflicted the Lake's Western Basin. There is no dispute - not even on the part of Ohio's elected and appointed officials - that HABs result from unregulated and uncontrolled phosphorus-containing runoff from farmland in the watersheds of the Lake's northwestern tributaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   HABs present a significant threat to public safety because they can produce microcystin- a \"cyanotoxin\" hazardous to \"humans, animals, and ecosystems.\" (Doc. 29, ID 9001). The effects of the ongoing phosphorus pollution and annual HABs has not been limited to the August 2014 Toledo Water Crisis. Those effects, albeit\n   to a lesser degree, have also impacted everyone who relies on the Lake not just for drinking water, but for recreation and their livelihoods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That crisis and those effects notwithstanding, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA) failed in 2014 and again in 2016, to determine, as the CWA requires, whether Lake Erie's open waters met the State's own water quality standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ohio's failure in 2016 to list Ohio's Lake Erie open waters as \"impaired\" led the plaintiffs, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie, and private citizens Michael Ferner and Susan Matz, to file this suit against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA or the Agency), acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, and Regional Administrator Cathy Stepp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their suit sought reversal of the U.S. EPA's decision to approve, despite the omission of Lake Erie's open waters, Ohio's impaired waters list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three motions are pending: defendants' counter-motion for summary judgment (Doc. 38); plaintiffs' motion for leave to supplement their initial complaint (Doc. 36); and intervenor the Lucas County Board of Commissioners' motion to join the case as a party plaintiff (Doc. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons that follow, I grant defendants' counter-motion for summary judgment, deny leave to plaintiffs to supplement the complaint, and deny leave to the Lucas County Board of Commissioners to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Doc. 29, ID 9006). Ohio nonetheless declined to evaluate the area for that year's \u00a7 303(d) list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2014, the year of the Toledo Water Crisis, the Ohio EPA designated assessment units in Lake Erie's shoreline as impaired. But, once again, the Ohio EPA did not include the waters beyond the shoreline,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Lake's open waters, on that list. The State did so despite alarming test results from Toledo and Oregon's water intake points - results that, not surprisingly, exceeded Ohio's own threshold limit for microsystin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While the U.S. EPA expressed concern at the omission, it approved Ohio's 2014\n   \u00a7 303(d) list with one caveat: based on Ohio's promise for the 2016 listing cycle to \"expand coverage to all drinking water intakes in the Western Lake Erie Basin,\" the U.S. EPA deferred its final decision on whether waters beyond the shoreline should also be listed as impaired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In hindsight, even this conditional approval reflected an undue measure of confidence in Ohio's willingness to evaluate the condition of Lake Erie's open waters. Indeed, in preparing its 2016 impaired waters list, Ohio, despite its promise, gave no heed to the U.S. EPA's expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ohio's 2016 \u00a7 303(d) list identified more impaired shoreline assessment units, but explicitly declined \"to pursue development of the open water assessment units and methods at this time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9009). When the U.S. EPA again reminded the State of its statutory obligations - pointing to the 2014 Toledo Water Crisis as a reason to be more proactive - Ohio refused. Instead, in derogation of its CWA-imposed duty to assess all the waters within its boundaries, Ohio reiterated its \"firm and consistent position\" that the U.S. EPA, rather than Ohio, should itself \"develop a coordinated response\" for Lake Erie. Ohio's EPA dismissed the Agency's instruction to fulfill its CWA obligations as \"absurd.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After failing to respond for seven months, and following plaintiffs' initial lawsuit against the U.S. EPA demanding that it, in accordance with the CWA, either approve or disapprove Ohio's 2016 \u00a7 303(d) list, the Agency issued a letter approving the State's 2016 \u00a7 303(d) list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs then filed this, their second suit, challenging the substance of the Agency's approval decision. They argued the U.S. EPA's approval was untenable due to the Ohio EPA's express refusal to \"assemble and evaluate all existing and readily available water-quality related data and information\" relating to Lake Erie's open waters.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20130.7\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rather than defending or reversing outright its approval of Ohio's 2016 impaired waters list, the U.S. EPA withdrew its approval for further consideration. In doing so, the Agency cited the very failing that had provoked plaintiffs' lawsuit: \"Specifically, the State's submission does not demonstrate that the State has satisfied its statutory and regulatory obligations to assemble and evaluate all existing and readily available data and information regarding nutrients in the open waters of Lake Erie within the State's boundaries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Agency's withdrawal of its approval meant that it had no longer taken final agency action on Ohio's deficient 2016 \u00a7 303(d) list. Consequently, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , compelled me to conclude that plaintiffs could not maintain their claim challenging that revoked decision. Thus, on April 11, 2018, I denied their motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 29).\n   <em>\n    Envt'l Law and Policy Ctr. v.

Ohio).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I remanded the case to the Agency for \"further action consistent with the correct legal standards\" within thirty days of that order and retained jurisdiction. I also withheld ruling on defendants' counter-motion\n   for summary judgment - which I address in this order.

Events Following The April 11, 2018 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Since April 11, 2018, the Ohio EPA has submitted an amended 2016 \u00a7 303(d) list, adding three new assessment units for Lake Erie's open waters, and declaring all three impaired. The U.S. EPA approved Ohio's amended 2016 submission (the Amended Submission) on May 10, 2018, just within the thirty-day deadline imposed in my order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While Ohio had hoped its Amended Submission would \"resolve the pending litigation\" (Doc. 30-2, ID 9027), the U.S. EPA's approval prompted plaintiffs to seek leave under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) to supplement their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In support of that request, plaintiffs point out that although the Ohio EPA at last declared its new open waters assessment units impaired, it also \"refused to develop ... a 'Total Maximum Daily Load' [TMDL] for the phosphorus pollution that causes\" HABs in Lake Erie. (Doc. 36, ID 9220).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Developing a TMDL is a bedrock obligation under the CWA.

Earlier in the letter, the U.S. EPA says just that: \"This supplemental decision and the May 2017 decision together complete the EPA's review and approval of Ohio EPA's 2016 CWA Section 303(d) list.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9091).

Section 303(d) list,\" one might assume it would use equivalent language to communicate an equally final approval of a state's TMDL plans. Yet the U.S. EPA used no such language relative to Ohio's discussion of its plan to substitute the GLWQA process as an alternative to the TMDL process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Nevertheless, plaintiffs maintain the Agency approved that variant approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In support of their contention, plaintiffs point to the U.S. EPA's statement \"[f]ind[ing] that Ohio EPA's discussion of its prioritization of Lake Erie satisfies the requirement to submit a priority ranking\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20130.7\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). (Doc. 30-3, ID 9092). According to plaintiffs, the \"Ohio EPA's discussion of its prioritization\" necessarily includes its statements characterizing the GLWQA as \"the best approach for solving the issues in western Lake Erie,\" and indicating that it will develop a TMDL only after this \"collaborative process fail[s] to restore\" the Lake to its \"designated use attainment.\" (Doc. 30-2 ID 9035).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Since the U.S. EPA found that the \"Ohio EPA's discussion of its prioritization ... satisfies the requirement to submit a priority\n   ranking,\" plaintiffs argue it must have also found that the Ohio EPA's TMDL-related statements \"satisfie[d]\" the CWA's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Their interpretation does not persuade me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The regulation the U.S. EPA cited,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20130.7\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), merely requires states to \"include a priority ranking for all water quality-limited segments still requiring TMDLs\" in their impaired water lists. It does not authorize the U.S. EPA to review or pass judgment on a state's priority ranking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   More to the point, the U.S. EPA did not cite the statutory provision that directs the EPA Administrator to approve or disapprove a state's proposed TMDLs \"not later than thirty days after the date of submission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2).

But its Amended Submission notes that the GLWQA has two built-in benchmarks: \"phosphorus reduction goals of 20 percent by 2020, and 40 percent by 2025\" - though these may be \"revised\" based on an \"adaptive management philosophy.\" (Doc. 30-2, ID 9035). Presumably, if the State does meet these goals, it will begin TDML work in either 2020, or 2025.

Ohio's description of what that has entailed and will entail is opaque. Success appears to depend, perhaps in no small part, on the commitment of the other jurisdictions that will be working with Ohio. The prospect that come 2025 Ohio will conclude that, if such proves to be so, the GLWQA has failed is, at best, worrisome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   If that occurs, time that Ohio could spent, probably for profitably, on determining TDMLs will have been irredeemably lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   This is even more so if Ohio continues to rely on its past, utterly failed, wastefully costly efforts to secure voluntary compliance from those who want to remain free from statutory or regulatory restraint.

But they are not. Rather, plaintiffs allege the May 10, 2018 letter approves Ohio's TMDL statements, when in fact it doesn't. I accept defendants' argument that there is no \"requirement for states to submit TMDLs with their Section 303(d) lists or as part of an integrated report,\" (Doc. 43, ID 9428) and that \"the TMDLs themselves are not part of the integrated report\" or the \u00a7 303(d) list. (Doc. 39, ID 9275). Having accepted those claims, I do not see how one letter, which does not approve the TMDL statements in Ohio's Amended 2016 submission, is superseded and mooted by another letter that, as best I can tell, also does not approve the TMDL statements in Ohio's 2018 impaired waters list.

Whether plaintiffs have satisfied these requirements is unclear. Plaintiffs acknowledge they initially sent defendants notice via priority, rather than certified mail, and then sent the correct notice less than sixty days prior to seeking leave to supplement. (Doc. 40, ID 9309 n.3). Defendants asserted the lack of notice as a defense in their opposition to plaintiffs' motion to supplement (Doc. 39, ID 9286-87), but dropped that argument during a subsequent status teleconference discussion (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 58, ID 9713-14). Ultimately, however, I need not address the notice-and-delay issue to rule on plaintiffs' motion to supplement.
