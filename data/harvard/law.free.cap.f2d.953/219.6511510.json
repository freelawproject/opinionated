Adams, Independent Executrix of the Estate of Janie Hughston, appeals a judgment of the district court affirming a judgment of the bankruptcy court overruling the Appellant\u2019s objection to the disclosure statement of the Appellee, First Financial Development Corporation (First Financial or Debtor). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-30\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-31\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-32\">In May of 1989, Janie Hughston obtained a Texas state court judgment against First Financial Development Corporation in the principal sum of $987,396.90, together with ten percent post-judgment interest and court costs, none of which has been paid. That judgment is currently on appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>In October of 1989, First Financial filed a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Shortly after the bankruptcy was filed, Janie Hughston died, and Appellant was appointed independent executrix of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-4\">Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, First Financial filed a disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court in anticipation of confirmation of its plan of reorganization. Appellant objected to the disclosure statement, claiming that it should include information regarding suits currently pending against Robert E. Williams, who is president, sole director, and a forty-five percent shareholder of First Financial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These suits were filed against Mr. Williams personally, not in his capacity as a principal in First Financial, and none has been reduced to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">The bankruptcy court overruled Appellant\u2019s objection to the disclosure statement, and declined to require First Financial to include information about Mr. Williams\u2019s personal suits in the disclosure statement. Appellant appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. Appellant then timely filed a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">The determination of the adequacy of information contained in the disclosure statement is largely within the discretion of the bankruptcy court. Although we review the factual findings of the bankruptcy court and the district court under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard and review all issues of law <em>de novo, </em>we review determinations with respect to the adequacy of the disclosure statement for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1179-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 specifies that a creditor in a Chapter 11 proceeding must receive a copy of the plan or a summary of the plan and a written disclosure statement before the creditor is called upon to vote on the plan's confirmation. After notice and a hearing, the bankruptcy court determines whether the disclosure statement contains \u201cadequate information.\u201d Adequate information is loosely defined in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), as \u201cinformation of a kind, and in sufficient detail ... that would enable a hypothetical reasonable investor typical of holders of claims or interests of the relevant class to make an informed judgment about the plan.\u201d The Bankruptcy Code specifies no particular information that <em>must </em>be included in the disclosure statement, and the Code\u2019s legislative history supports the proposition that a bankruptcy court should make determinations concerning disclosure statements on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nonetheless, some courts have attempted to fashion laundry lists of helpful data, albeit such lists are neither disposi-tive nor all-inclusive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These lists invariably include information regarding those who will manage the debtor after confirmation, no doubt derived from 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(5)(A), which specifies that a plan of reorganization cannot be confirmed until, <em>inter alia, </em>the plan\u2019s proponent has disclosed the \u201cidentity and affiliations\u201d of directors, officers and voting trustees of the debtor. Neither guideline nor case, much less the Code itself, mandates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>inclusion of personal financial information of the principal in a corporation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">We discern no reason why a creditor, treated as a \u201chypothetical reasonable investor,\u201d must know about personal law suits against Mr. Williams. Appellant conjectures that these suits, which she contends allege fraud or breach of fiduciary duty by Mr. Williams, reflect on his character and his ability to manage the Debtor. Her argument collapses under its own weight. Even if we were to accept the proposition that a civil <em>judgment </em>based in part on fraud or breach of fiduciary duty would reflect on Mr. Williams\u2019s competence as president of the Debtor, Appellant has wholly failed to demonstrate that there is a likelihood that the confirmed plan would not be consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">Because the Code defines \u201cadequate information\u201d as a type that would be considered important or material by a \u201chypothetical reasonable investor,\u201d Appellant would have us apply a disclosure standard at least as stringent as that required for disclosure under federal securities laws. This we decline to do. Section 1125(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides, \u201c[wjhether a disclosure statement required under subsection (b) of this section contains adequate information is not governed by any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law, rule, or regulation ...\u201d This section clearly forecloses any direct application or incorporation by reference of federal securities laws to bankruptcy disclosure statements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Even if we were to use federal securities regulations by analogy, they would not command disclosure of the personal suits. Item 401 of Regulation S-K<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, requires that the corporation making disclosure reveal the involvement of its directors and officers in only those types of legal proceedings that are material to an evaluation of the individuals\u2019 abilities or integrity. The proceedings to be disclosed include certain bankruptcies; criminal convictions and pending criminal proceedings; final orders, judgments or decrees enjoining or limiting the subject\u2019s activities with respect to certain financial occupations, business practices, or the sale or purchase of securities or commodities; or final judgments in civil actions with respect to violation of securities or commodities laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With the exception of criminal proceedings, the only litigation required to be disclosed is the kind that have resulted in final adjudication against the director or officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">We reiterate the well known truism that anyone with the filing fee can commence a lawsuit and allege any complaint against anyone else, notwithstanding the threat of sanctions. Appellant has not demonstrated that any of the actions she seeks to have disclosed to the creditors has any merit;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> neither would such a demonstration benefit her. The Bankruptcy Code simply does not require that such information be disclosed. Furthermore, while Appellant casts aspersions on Mr. Williams\u2019s character, she has failed to present any evidence that his character will adversely affect the consummation of the First Financial plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-14\">We find no mandatory requirement to disclose this information. We speculate that Appellant seeks its inclusion for the prejudicial reaction it might engender among those creditors who will vote on the plan. That purpose, however, is not legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court abused its discretion in deciding to overrule Appellant\u2019s objection to the Debtor\u2019s disclosure statement. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AzU\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">. June Williams, wife of Robert E.
