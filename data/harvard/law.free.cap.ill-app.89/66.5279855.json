S., 1897; that the petition for laying out the new road, and vacation of the old road, bad never been filed in the office of the town clerk, with the action of the board of highway commissioners indorsed thereon, as required by law; and that by reason of the failure of the commissioners to give notice as above stated, petitioners had no opportunity of appealing from their action in the premises. The petition prays for a writ of certiorari, and that the proceedings be quashed. The court directed the issuance of the writ, and the commissioners made return thereto in substance as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\" pgmap=\"89\">1st. A petition of twelve property owners of the town, residing within two miles of the road sought to be laid out, and wfithin the same distance of the road sought to be vacated, showing the land that will be taken for the new road and the.names of the owners thereof; praying for laying out and opening a new road, and for the vacation of the old road. The petition was filed in the office of the town clerk on the 27th day of August, 1897; and indorsed thereon is a statement that the prayer of the petition was granted September 18, 1897, and is signed by the commissioners.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\" pgmap=\"89\">2d. The minutes of four meetings of the board of highway commissioners, to wit, the minutes of a meeting of September 4, 1897, which showed no order for the posting of the notices or any time or place for the holding of any meeting to consider the petition filed on August 27th; the minutes of a meeting-of September IS, 1897, which showed that the commissioners met at Emile Marie\u2019s residence and \u201c decided, after hearing reasons for and against, to grant said petition and disannul the old road after the new road was placed in good condition for travel; \u201d the minutes of a meeting of May 7, 1889, which showed that the commissioners \u201c decided to receive the new road and vacate the old road;\u201d and the minutes of a meeting of January 7,1899, as follows:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\" pgmap=\"89(19) 90(281)\">\u201c Commissioners of Highways of Somerset Twp. met at Grange Hall, Jan. 7, 1899, in regular session; all present except clerk. Upon motion and due consideration and evidence heard, it is ordered unanimously by the board, that the minutes of the meeting of the board of highway commissioners of September 4, 1897, be amended and corrected by adding before the signature of the clerk and the president, the following: \u2018And at this time came petitioners and presented a petition, signed Emile Marie and others, known as the Kennedy petition, praying that a certain road, running through and over a portion of section 31, T. 8 S., K. 2 west of the 3d P. M., in Jackson County, be vacated and a new road be laid out over the route in the petition described, in lieu thereof, which petition is by the board received and ordered filed; and it is ordered by the board that September IS, 1897, be fixed for the time, and the residence of Emile Marie, in said Somerset Township, in Jackson County, be fixed as the place for hearing reasons for and against the prayet1 of the petition] and to examine the route of said road; and it is ordered that the clerk give notice of such meeting, according to law; \u2019 and that the minutes of the meeting of September 18,1897, be amended, so as to show that said meeting was held at Emile Marie\u2019s residence, and by prefixing the following: \u2018 It appears from the evidence that due notice was given and posted, according to law, to hear reasons for and against granting the prayer of said petition, and for other purposes.! And it is ordered that the clerk make such amendments on the minute book of the respective dates.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\" pgmap=\"90\">3d. The record book of laying out roads showing that the new road had. been surveyed, and a statement in the surveyor\u2019s certificate that the old road as now existing be declared vacated and annulled. This certificate is not signed by the commissioners of highways.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\" pgmap=\"90\">On this return to the writ, the commissioners moved the court to quash the writ, and the petitioners entered their cross-motion to quash the return and also the record of the highway commissioners. The court quashed the writ of certiorari, overruled petitioner\u2019s cross-motion and rendered judgment against petitioners for costs, and the petitioners have appealed, and assign as error the rulings of the court on the motion and cross-motion.</p><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-7\" pgmap=\"90\">A.

It is not shown that the new road will take any of the land owned by the petitioners, and while it is stated they are tax-payers, it is not alleged that the new road will have to be paid for in whole or in part by the levy of taxes on petitioners\u2019 property. Petitioners have no land damages for the taking of which ought to have been released, as was the case in Hyslop v. Finch, 99 Ill. 171, and the absence from the commissioners\u2019 record of the release of the land owners, furnishes no cause of complaint to petitioners, unless they will in some way be injured thereby. If the damages are not released or agreed upon, the certificate provided for by Sec. 45, of Chapter 121, Hurd\u2019s E. S., 1899, must be filed in ten days from the granting of the petition, or the commissioners can not proceed. Trainor v. Lawrence, 36 Ill. App. 90. So that in no view of the case are we able to see there is even a threatened invasion of any right held by the petitioners. by reason of the record of the highway commissioners, in so far as it relates to the new road; hence the court did not err in quashing the writ so far as it relates to the new road.</p> <p id=\"b91-10\" pgmap=\"91(22) 92(37)\">With regard to the vacation of the old road, the record presents some serious questions as to the power of the board of highway commissioners to amend its records in jurisdictional matters, without notice, if it were necessary to pass upon them; but the question of power is not raised by the present record, for reasons hereafter stated.</p> <p id=\"b92-5\" pgmap=\"92\">It was held in Whitmer v. Commissioners of Highways, 96 Ill. 289, that persons living within three (by the present statute, two) miles of the road sought to be vacated, had a right, as \u201c persons interested,\u201d to appeal, under Sec. \u2022 59 of the Road and Bridge law. Petitioners have, under that decision, a sufficient interest to apply for a writ of certiorari.</p> <p id=\"b92-6\" pgmap=\"92(279) 93(47)\">That the record of the board of highway commissioners would have been vulnerable to certiorari up to the' meeting of January 7,1899, is not seriously questioned. The record does not preserve the notice provided for by the statute, and there is no recital that notice was given, except as the amendment of January 7, 1899, attempts to cure the defect. Waiving the power of the board to amend its record, as relied on by the case of County of DuPage v. Com\u2019rs of Highways, 142 Ill. 607, we are of the opinion that the recital in the amended record, \u201c it appears from the evidence that due notice has been given and posted according to law,\u201d is insufficient. The recital is a mere conclusion of law; no fact is stated from which the court is able to see that this conclusion is true. Whether time and place was specified in the notice when the petition would be heard, is not stated, nor are other details in regard to time and place of posting the notices. A quasi judicial tribunal of inferior jurisdiction must recite the facts, or preserve the facts themselves, upon which its jurisdiction depends. Whether the above recital vTould be sufficient against a collateral attack is not a question presented by this record; certiorari is a direct attack on the record. Van Fleet\u2019s Collateral Attack, Sec. 2. The record must show affirmatively that the notice provided for in the statute has been given, so that the court may be able to see; either from the facts themselves, or specific recitals of those facts, that \u201c due notice \u201d was given. Com\u2019rs v. Harper, 38 Ill. 103; Shinkle v. Magill, 58 Ill. 422. The amended record, as to notice, is substantially the same as the original record, in the case of Johnson v. Stephenson, 39 Ill. App. 88. That case seems to be in point here and we concur in its statement of the lawr.</p> <p id=\"b93-4\" pgmap=\"93\">Section 52 of Chap. 121, Hurd\u2019s R. S., 1897, reads as follows :</p> <blockquote id=\"b93-5\" pgmap=\"93\">\u201c The record of the town clerk, or a certified copy of such record and papers relating to the establishment, location, alteration, widening or vacation of any road, shall be prima facie evidence in all cases that all necessary antecedent provisions have been complied with and that the action of the commissioners, or other persons and officers, in regard thereto, was regular in all respects.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b93-6\" pgmap=\"93\">This section has been appealed to as settling that the jurisdictional steps have been taken in this case, at least, prima facie. We are inclined to adopt the views of the court in the case of Commissioners of Highways v. People, 2 Ill. App. 24, that such effect can only be given when the papers show jurisdiction on their face.</p> <p id=\"b93-7\" pgmap=\"93\">Suppose a case where no notice has in fact been given, or notice given for too short a time, so that the proceeding would come within the principle of Johnston v. Baker, 38 Ill. 98, and so be professedly void, it would amount to a denial that such a record could be attacked by certiorari, when it is affirmed that the order vacating or laying out. a highway would create a prima facie case. For in certiorari, as the writ is administered in this State, no issue of fact can be taken on the record; the record is tried by itself, and in the case supposed, no matter that the jurisdiction may be lacking, either in fact, or by reason of the want of recitals of facts to show the jurisdiction, the order laying out or vacating the highway becomes absolutely conclusive that all jurisdictional steps have been taken, unless an issue, supported by proof, could be taken on the jurisdictional question, so as to overcome the prima facie case believed by appellees to exist by virtue of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b93-8\" pgmap=\"93(34) 94(137)\">We do not think that the legislature intended, in the enactment of the section, to broaden the scope of the issues to be tried in certiorari, so as to form an issue for the admission of matters in pais; nor do we think that it was intended to narrow the scope of the writ, as would be the case if, on the one hand, it is said that no issue can be tried except by the record itself, and on the other, that such record is prima facie correct. The result would be that no records could be attacked by certiorari except such as carry on their face proof that no jurisdictional steps have been taken. But the law is that, \u201c in tribunals of special and limited jurisdiction, the particular facts and circumstances upon which their jurisdiction is based, must appear from the face of the proceedings, and if they do not thus appear, certiorari will lie.\u201d Yol. 4 of Ency. of Pleading and Practice, pp. 92 to 93.</p> <p id=\"b94-4\" pgmap=\"94\">Had the petition and order concerned only the laying out of a new road, the ruling of the court in quashing the writ and denying appellants\u2019 cross-motion to quash the return, would have been right, but only for the reason that appellants had no legal standing in court entitling them to \u2022the right to attack the record.</p> <p id=\"b94-5\" pgmap=\"94\">The laying out of the new road and the vacation of the old road, were interdependent acts to such an extent as to make them legally but one act, which could not be severed, and since the order vacating the old road is void, for want of proper notice of the proceedings on which it is based, the order laying out the new road must be held void also.</p> <p id=\"b94-6\" pgmap=\"94\">The court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 cross-motion to quash the return, and in sustaining appellee\u2019s motion to quash the writ, and for this error the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to the Circuit Court to quash the return to the writ.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
