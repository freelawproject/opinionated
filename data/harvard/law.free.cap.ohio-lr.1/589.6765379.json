But the probate court may modify these terms, if it deems the same proper to do in respect to times of payment.

Ogan.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-9\">In his petition the plaintiff alleged that at the time of the execution of said will, to-wit, April 17, 1894, J. Q. A. Baker, Mary P. Taylor and Justice L. H. Baker, the legatees therein'named, were all in full life. That thereafter, and during the lifetime of the testator, Justice L. H. Baker died, leaving surviving him, as his children and only heirs at law, G. O. Baker, Elma B. Bush, Anna R. Baker, John L. Baker, Emma J. Baker, Frank Baker, Justus W. Baker, Wilbur 0. Baker and Zola Baker. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>further appears from the averments of said petition that Justice L. H. Baker, a legatee under said will, and the father of the plaintiffs in error, was at the time of his death indebted to the testator, Jacob W. Baker, upon two promissory notes, in the sum of about $1,400, and .the prayer of the petition was that plaintiff might have \u201cthe direction and judgment of the court in the matter of his duties respecting said notes. Whether the amount due thereon is to be taken as a part of the assets of the estate of his testator, Jacob W. Baker, and whether such amount is to be deducted from the distributive share that would be coming to the children and heirs of said Justice L. H. Baker, deceased.\u201d The answer, so-called, which was filed by the children of justice L. H. Baker, who are plaintiffs in error herein, does not controvert or deny the allegations of the petition, but asserts the claim only: \u201cThe one-third of the entire estate of said Jacob Baker, after the payment of certain debts and charges, was by his said will devised to said L. H. Baker without being subject to any other or further charges, debts, or deductions; and that these defendants by reason of the death of said J. L. H. Baker after the execution of said will and prior to the death of said testator, take the estate devised to said J. L. H. Baker (their father) without any charges, debts, or deductions by reason of or on account of said promissory notes mentioned in said petition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-4\">Upon the hearing of this cause in the court of common pleas that court found and adjudged that said notes were due the estate of said Jacob Baker, deceased; that they were assets in the hands of plaintiff as his executor, and directed plaintiff to deduct and retain the amount due thereon from the distributive share belonging to the children and heirs at law of said Justice L. H. Baker, deceased, under the provisions of said will. The case was appealed by defendants below, plaintiffs in error here, to the circuit court, and a like order and judgment was made and entered by that court. To reverse this finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>and judgment of the circuit court this proceeding in error is prosecuted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-4\"><em>W.

That section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201cWhen a devise of real or personal estate is made to any child or other relative of the testator, if such child or other relative shall have been dead at the time of making of the will, or shall die thereafter leaving issue surviving the testator, in either case such issue shall take the estate devised in the same manner as the devisee would have done if he had survived the testator; or if such devisee shall leave no such issue, and the devise be of a residuary estate to him or her, and other child or relative of the testator, the estate devised shall pass to, and vest in such residuary devisee surviving the testator, unless a different disposition shall be made or required by the will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">It is the claim of counsel for plaintiff in error in this case that by force of the provisions of this section, that on the death of Justice L. H. Baker, their father, the interest and estate bequeathed to him by the will of Jacob W. Baker, vested in them as the children of said Justice L. H. Baker, directly and immediately under the will of their grandfather, as a devised estate, and that they take the same unincumbered by and discharged of any debt due the testator from their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The sole question we are called upon to consider and determine in this case is, whether these plaintiffs in error \u2022who are not named in the will of Jacob W. Baker as de-visees or legatees, but are such only by way of substitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tion and by force of the provisions of above Section 5971, take the property or estate bequeathed to their father subject to the equities which would have existed against it in his hands had he survived the testator, or whether they take it in their own absolute right and discharged of all such equities. There can be no doubt, and counsel for plaintiffs in error concede, that if Justice L. H. Baker, the primary legatee named in this will, were here in person asking to recover his legacy or his distributive share of his father\u2019s estate under said will, that the court would say to him, if you would have your legacy you must pay your debt, if you will not pay you must suffer your legacy to be applied in discharge of it, and such decree would not only be in accord with justice and sound reason but would be in keeping and harmony with the principle of equality which pervades our laws of descent and distribution. Such then being the standard- by Avhich the rights of a primary legatee thus situated must be measured and determined, are these plaintiffs in error, who are devisees or legatees only by substitution, entitled to have or to hold a better or more advantageous position in the distribution of this estate than could their immediate ancestor, the primary legatee? The answer is to be found in the construction and interpretation proper to be given to above Section 5971, Revised Statutes. TV hat then is the true interpretation, meaning and effect of this statute? In the construction and interpretation of statutes of this character \u2014 remedial statutes \u2014 and as an aid both in determining the legislative intent and the meaning and effect proper to be given to the statute itself, it is helpful and important to inquire what was the old law, what the mischief which existed under it, and what the remedy intended to be applied by the Legislature by the enactment of the particular statute, the interpretation of which is being considered. Before the enactment of Section 5971, under the rule of the common law if a legatee should die before his testator, his legacy would lapse, and such lapsed legacy would fall into the residuary fund, if any, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of testator\u2019s estate, and thus might pass to those who had no natural or rightful claim whatever upon the testator\u2019s bounty. Prior to the time of the enactment of this <em>section, </em>such was the law of this state that if a father made a will distributing his estate as he thought proper among his children, and one of them should die in the father\u2019s lifetime, leaving children, unless the testator was wise enough and thoughtful enough to anticipate and provide in his will for such contingency, the children of his deceased child would take nothing, but the children of the testator who survived him would take the whole estate. To remedy this imperfection and to relieve against this harshness and injustice of the common law our statute was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The statute, as its title shows, was designed and intended to relieve against a hardship by preventing the lapsing of devises and legacies, and its sole purpose and effect, as we think, was and is, npon the happening of the contingency therein mentioned, to place the grandchildren of a testator in their parent\u2019s stead, and to give to them the right to take what such parent would have taken if he had survived the testator. But certainly we think it was not the purpose, and could never have been the intention of the Legislature by the enactment of this statute, to secure to the grandchildren of the testator greater rights and privileges than their parent \u2014 the primary legatee\u2014 could have had; nor may we reasonably assume that it was the intention of the Legislature to give to such grandchildren rights against other beneficiaries under the will which the person in whose place they stand, and for whom they are substituted, never would himself have been permitted to assert. Yet such result must inevitably follow if the statute under consideration is to have the construction and interpretation contended for by the plaintiffs in error. The rule of construction is elementary that statutes must always be construed so as to give effect to the intent and object of the Legislature. The statute now under review, as we have seen, was designed to relieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>from a hardship, and should, therefore, be so read and interpreted as to cure the mischief it was intended to remedy, but its meaning and effect must not be enlarged or extended by construction beyond the purpose of its enactment. The plaintiffs in error in this case are not named in-the will of Jacob W. Baker as legatees, nor anywhere designated in said will as beneficiaries of the testator; they are mere \u201cstatute made\u201d legatees, Avho by force of the provisions of Section 5971 take the place of their father and are given what, but for his death, would have gone to him as primary legatee under said will, and as such substituted legatees they must bear the burdens and be subject to the same equities that would have existed against him if he had survived the testator. In other words, in the language of the statute itself, they \u201cmust take in the same manner as he would have done had he survived the testator.\u201d The circuit court in this case having so found and adjudged, its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
