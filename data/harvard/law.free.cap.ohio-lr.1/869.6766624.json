He left a large personal estate, also real estate situate in Cincinnati, which descended to his daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Leora. All this he had derived by deed of gift from his father. In 1897 the guardian of Leora applied to the probate court of Hamilton for authority to sell certain of the real estate, under favor of Section 6280, Revised Statutes, on the ground that a better investment could be made in government bonds or ground rents. The court made the order prayed for directing the sale. The net proceeds amounted to $8,253.14. Prior to this the guardian had received $5,000, the proceeds of certain policies of fire insurance upon buildings belonging to his ward and inherited by her from her father. The \u2022 guardian invested this entire fund in government bonds, and subsequently sold the bonds, and in pursuance of the order of the probate court invested the proceeds, together with the proceeds of the real estate, in a ground rent. October 3, 1898, the guardian resigned, and the defendant in error, Harry L. Cooper, was by the probate court appointed trustee. The privilege of purchase being exercised as to the above named ground rent, $20,000, the proceeds were received by the trustee and that amount was thereupon by him reinvested in other ground rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b884-4\">Subsequently, in 1900, Leora McCammon died, aged fifteen, intestate and unmarried. The trustee settled his account in the probate court, and was ordered, on motion of the mother, now Ida Leora Olmstead, to convey to her the said real estate or ground rents in his name as trustee in fee simple, and to turn over to the administrator of Leora, deceased, the money and personal property in his hands. From this order plaintiffs in error, William McCammon, the brother of George McCam-mon, and John L. McCammon, the nephew of George McCam-mon, his only heirs at law, having theretofore appeared in the probate court to resist the motion, and having filed their claim to' said two funds, $8,253.14 and $5,000, appealed the case to the court of common pleas. In that court, upon hearing, the same order was made as that of the probate court. The judgment was affirmed by the circuit court, and the MeCammons bring error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b884-5\"><em>Harlan Cleveland, John E.

Not that the precise estate which was owned by Leora McCammon, at her decease, came to her by inheritance, for without question it did not, but that property was purchased by the proceeds of the real estate which she did inherit, and which had been sold by her guardian; and that by applying the rule of equitable conversion, the funds derived from the sale continued during the life of Leora, in whatever form they were invested, to be impressed with the character of ancestral property for purposes of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">We think the proposition can not be maintained. It is conceded that under the authority of <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 Ohio, 119, and <em>Pence </em>v. <em>Pence, </em>11 Ohio St., 290, the proceeds of the sale of land would have become personal property, with all the incidents of such property as to distribution, in' the event of the death of Leora, but for the act of March 18, 1890, which added a proviso to Section 4163, Revised Statutes (the section which directs the distribution of personal property), which proviso is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-5\">\u201cProvided, that any fund in the hands of any administrator, guardian, assignee or other trustee which has arisen from the sale of real estate, which real estate .came to such intestate by descent, devise or deed of gift from an ancestor, shall descend according to the course of descent described by Section 4158 for ancestral real estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">And the contention with respect to this proviso is that the term \u201cany fund in the hands of any * * * \u2014guardian # * # or other trustee\u201d means the proceeds of the sale so long as held by the guardian or trustee under his trust and unexpended, into whatever form he may in fact change them by investment, thus seeking by construction to engraft upon our statute the equitable rule, enforced in many jurisdictions, that when for any reason the court changes the character of the property belonging to infants, it will not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>mit the change to alter its devolution. The proposition, as applied to this case, is open to many answers. One is that the proviso, in it's language and apparent intent, is dealing with present conditions. It does not deal with the past except that if the fund which then exists has arisen from the sale of ancestral real estate its evolution is controlled by this proviso. But the proviso can not be aided or enlarged by the application of any equitable rule. As held in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Lamson, 45 </em>Ohio St., 77, \u201cthe statutes of descent and distribution are not to be construed and administered upon equitable principles, but by rules of law,\u201d and in <em>Hutchings </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>68 Ohio St., 160, \u201ccourts can not, by reason of any real or imagined equities limit, qualify or annul rights granted by legislative enactment. \u2019 \u2019 In other words, the General Assembly must be held to have intended to express its entire meaning by the natural import of the words used. The natural import of the term \u201cfund which has arisen from the sale of real estate\u201d implies a fund which has directly arisen from that source. The principle of <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>18 Ohio St., 311, is applicable here. It is there held that: \u201cThe title to real estate which must have come to an intestate by devise, or deed of gift from an ancestor, to constitute ancestral property, is the title under which the intestate <em>immediately </em>held.\u201d \u2022 Not that the word \u201cdirectly\u201d is found in this proviso, but neither was the word \u201cimmediately\u201d found in the statute under review in the case above cited. If the intention had been by this proviso to give ancestral heirs any right to the proceeds of the sale of infants\u2019 real estate inherited from the ancestor, in any form it may be made to assume in the future, such intention would have been expressed in apt language. It is -not, we think, reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended to go farther in the adoption of the doctrine of equitable conversion than the ordinary meaning of the words used imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\">But it seems hardly worth while to pursue this line further. Another answer fully covers the case. The proviso does not apply because the property in question was not a fund in the hands' of the\u2019 trustee. A fund is well defined as money or its equivalent gathered .for, or to be appropriated to a specific objeet. The property in controversy is not personal property of any kind; it is a right to real estate, and it isn\u2019t of conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>quence what form the inheritance of the minor assumed from time to time after her father\u2019s decease and before her own. At the time of the latter event the inheritance had taken the form of. real estate to which she had a right. And this applies as well to the insurance money as to the other; so that no different rule of law is involved. The descent of real esate as to which the owner dies intestate, is controlled by either Section 4158 or 4159, Revised Statutes, depending upon whether the estate thus left came to the deceased by descent, devise, or deed of gift, or by purchase. If by purchase, and that is the character of this estate, then the latter section controls, and the estate in controversy would under the fifth clause of that section, and by force of the ruling in <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Miller, supra, </em>and <em>Pence </em>v. <em>Pence, supra, </em>pass to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">There is no error in the judgment of the circuit court affirming that of the common pleas, and it will be</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
