Thereupon, on the same day, judgment was given on the verdict, and the defendant was fined in the sum of $50 and costs. The affidavit charged that \u201con or about the twenty-fifth day of February, A. D. 1901, at the county of Hamilton and state of Ohio, one Nicholas J, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Arata unlawfully did sell and deliver to the said Anthony Sauer, dairy and food inspector of the state of Ohio, one-half (1-2) pound of oleomargarine; said oleomargarine being a substance not pure butter and containing only three and seventy-seven hundredths (3.77) per cent: of butter fats, which said oleomargarine, when so sold as aforesaid, containing coloring matter, to-wit, butter yellow, contrary to the statute in such ease made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state of of Ohio.\u201d On petition in error in the court of common pleas the judgment of the justice of the peace was reversed on the ground that the affidavit filed with the justice of the peace charging the offense was defective, and that the justice of the peace committed error in overruling the demurrer of the defendant thereto.

It charges Arata with having sold oleomargarine which contained coloring matter, to-wit, butter yellow. This is all that is required, because the meaning of the word \u201coleomargarine,\u201d as used in the statute, is defined by the statute itself.' The descriptive words contained in the affidavit do not wholly describe oleomargarine as defined in the statute, but do not contradict the charge as made. Therefore, whether they completely describe the substance sold or not, these words neither add to nor subtract from the meaning of the charge. They are surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">\n<em>Exceptions siistained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
