Shay, a member of the law firm of Shay &amp; Cogan, and one of counsel for defendant, \"Frederick Roselot, but who had been absent from the city of Cincinnati and had not theretofore appeared at or participated in said tidal, appeared in court and filed his affidavit, suggesting and alleging the then present insanity of said Frederick Roselot, and asking \u201cthat this case should be passed until a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>opportunity is afforded to inquire into the question of the defendant\u2019s present sanity.\u201d Counter affidavits were submitted on bebalf of the State tending to establish the sanity of the defendant. Upon consideration of these several affidavits, and after inquiry made by the court of divers persons to ascertain if defendant was in mental condition to proceed with the trial, the court decided and announced as follows: \u2018 \u2018 It is the opinion of the court at this time that the defendant is able to proceed with the trial, and the trial must go on.\u201d Thereupon the trial proceeded. On the following morning, to-wit, December 18, 1901, Thomas F. Shay, counsel for defendant, filed and presented to the court his further affidavit, alleging and suggesting the insanity of the defendant, Frederick Roselot, and at the \u25a0same time also filing and presenting to the court the following certificate of Dr. John T. Booth, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-3\">\u201cCincinnati, December 18, 1901.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuIu\">\n<em>\u201cTo- the Honorable Win. Littleford:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">\u201c1, the undersigned, being a respectable physician practicing medicine in the city of Cincinnati, do hereby present to this court that I have examined the defendant, Fred. Roselot, and say to this court that he is at present an insane man wholly unable to give his counsel any assistance at present and is wholly unable to give intelligent testimony as a witness in his own behalf on this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201c(Signed) John T. Booti-i, M. D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Thereupon, and before proceeding further with said trial, counsel for defendant demanded that a special jury be impan-neled under Section 7240, Revised Statutes, \u201cto try whether or not the accused is sane.\u201d The court refused to impannel said jury and directed the trial to proceed. After hearing the evidence, arguments of counsel, and charge of the court, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Thereafter a motion for new trial and in arrest of judgment was overruled by the court of common pleas; the case was taken to the circuit court, where the judgment of-the <em>common </em>pleas was reversed on the ground, as appears from the journal entry, that there was error in the record and proceedings of the court of common pleas in this, towit': \u201cThat the court below, on the application being filed under Section 7240, Revised Statutes of Ohio, should have ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>rested the proceedings of the trial and impanneled a special jury to try said issue. \u2019 \u2019 To procure a reversal of this judgment of the circuit court this proceeding in error is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\">The principal question presented for determination by the record in this case is: Whether the provisions of this Section 7240, Revised Statutes of Ohio, which prescribe the mode and provide the means for a trial of the issue of present insanity of a person under indictment, were intended to he and are mandatory and exclusive, or whether the provisions of said section are so far directory only, as that a court may in its discretion adopt some other and' different mode of ascertaining- the fact as to the sanity or insanity of the accused. Section 7240 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">\u201cWhen the attorney of a person indicted for an offense suggests to the court in which the indictment is pending, at any time before sentence, that such person is not then sane, and a certificate of a respectable physician to the same effect is presented to the court, the court shall order a jury to be impanneled to try whether or not the accused is sane at the time of such im-panneling; thereupon a time shall be fixed for a trial, and a jury shall be drawn from the jury box, and a venire issued, unless the prosecuting attorney, or the attorney of the accused, demand a struck jury, in which case such jury shall be selected and summoned as required by law; the jury shall be sworn to try the question whether the accused is or is not sane, and a true verdict given according to the law and the evidence; and on the trial the accused shall hold the affirmative: if three-fourths of the jurors agree upon a verdict, their finding may be returned as the verdict of the jury; and a new trial may be granted on application of the attorney of the accused, for the causes and in the manner provided in this title. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">This statute is explicit in its terms as to the manner in which the question of the insanity of a defendant under indictment, when properly brought to the attention of the court, shall be submitted and determined, and it is peremptory in its requirement that when the insanity of a defendant is, at any time before sentence, suggested to the court in the manner therein provided, that the court shall order a jury to be impanneled to try the question whether or not -the accused is sane 'at the time of such impaneling, and further, it prescribes the form of oath that shall be administered to the jury when so impanneled. While it has long been the humane and settled policy of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>law that no man shall be indicted and put upon trial npon a criminal charge, or be called upon to make his defense to such charge in a court of justice, who by reason of insanity is unable to comprehend his position, or is by reason of his insanity incapable of making his defense, yet in this state prior to the enactment of Section 7240, Revised Statutes, the method of determining the question of the sanity or insanity of a person under indictment was a matter largely within the discretion -of the trial court and had not been made the subject of statutory regulation. Prior to this enactment the court might, in the exercise of its discretion, either submit the question to a jury, or it might itself inquire into and determine the same without the aid or intervention of a jury. The practice was by no means uniform, but differed in different jurisdictions. To provide for uniformity in the method of procedure, and to secure the accused the right to have the question of his sanity submitted to and determined by a jury specially impanneled and specifically sworn and instructed to try that particular issue, was, we think, plainly the purpose of this enactment. And such being its purpose, it must have been intended\u2019by the Legislature that the method therein provided for the submission and determination of such question should be followed, and should be exclusive, and this whether the question be raised before or during the progress of the trial, provided only that it be raised at sometime before sentence. Whether this enactment without other or further limitation and restriction than is therein contained as to the time when the question of insanity may be raised or presented to the court is wise and expedient legislation, is a matter with we are not now concerned, inasmuch as the right to enact such statute is clearly within the legislative authority. The language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, and its provisions mandatory and emphatic that when, at any time before sentence,, the attorney of a person indicted suggests to the court that such person is insane and presents to the court the certificate of a \u201crespectable\u201d physician to the same effect, such court <em>shall </em>-order -a jury to be selected and impanneled as therein provided ; which jury when so impanneled shall be sworn to try the question whether the accused is or is not sane at the time such jury is impanneled. Upon the admitted facts of this case there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>was, we think, such compliance with the requirements of this statute on the part of the defendant\u2019s counsel as to clearly entitle the defendant' to avail himself of its provisions and to give to him the right to demand and have impanneled a special jury, particularly sworn, to try and determine the question of his sanity. This privilege and right was denied him by the court of common pleas, and in this the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\">It is however insisted by counsel for the State that if this action and judgment of the court of common pleas was erroneous, that nevertheless such error was not prejudicial to the defendant, and he ought not to be heard to 'complain thereof, for the reason, as is claimed, that the court thereafter submitted to the regular jury then trying the case the question of defendant\u2019s sanity, and that such question was submitted under an instruction from the court most favorable to the defendant. That instruction is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">\u201cIt may be that he (defendant) has been prevented from disclosing matters to you that are of great importance to him. If you think that you have not heard all the truth in this case because of the defendant\u2019s mental condition and that you believe that you are not justified, because of that fact, in finding him guilty as charged, you may acquit him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Palpably erroneous and unauthorized as this charge was, and apparently favorable to defendant as in some respects it certainly is, yet nevertheless the instruction so given is not the equivalent of such instruction as the defendant was entitled to have upon the submission to a jury of the question of his present insanity. Nor is this charge so favorable to. the defendant as his counsel would seem to understand and assume. Counsel for the State, in argument, erroneously assume that the jury was told by this charge that if they should find that at the time of the trial defendant was then insane that they <em>must </em>acquit him. But such is not the language of this charge. By this charge the jury was not instructed that if they so found that they must acquit, nor that it would be their <em>cktty </em>to acquit, but were told only that in the event they should so find and believe that they <em>might </em>acquit him. This charge cannot, because favorable to the defendant, have the effect- to deprive him of the right to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>plain of the submission of the question of his then present insanity to the trial jury \u2014 a jury impanneled and sworn to try only the question of whether or not he was guilty of the crime with which he stood charged and for which he was then on trial. Under this charge the jury was told \u201cthat if they thought they had not heard all of the truth in this case, because of the defendant \u2019s mental condition,, they might acquit him. \u2019 \u2019 Thus-the jury was given to determine whether they had heard all of the truth and if they should be of the opinion that they had not, because of the defendant\u2019s mental condition, they were told that they might acquit him. Under this instruction the insanity of the acquital could be had on that ground only after a finding by the defendant could only avail him as ground for acquittal; and acquittal could be had on that ground only after a finding by the jury that defendant was then insane, and before this jury was authorized to make such finding it was necessary that the whole of their number should concur therein. But the law provides\u2014 Section 7240, <em>supra </em>\u2014 that on the trial of such issue \u2014 that of the present insanity \u2014 that \u201cif three-fourths of the jurors agree upon a verdict their finding may be returned as the verdict of the jury. \u2019 \u2019 Defendant through his counsel having made proper demand therefor, was entitled to have the question of his insanity submitted to a jury impanneled and sworn to try that question alone, three-fourths of whom could have determined a verdict. The right to such jury having been denied him by the court of common pleas, the judgment of that court was properly reversed by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\">\n<em>Judgment of the circuit court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
