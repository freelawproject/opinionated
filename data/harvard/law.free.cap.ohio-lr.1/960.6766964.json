The annual assessor for the year 1900 added $1,000 to the valuation of one property because of its improvements, and $750 to the other, and so made his return to the auditor. The annual board of ecinalization confirmed the addition and ordered it placed on the duplicate, which was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-3\">The owner received no notice of the increased valuation under Section 2804, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">For the reasons given in the principal case (8425), and which we need not repeat here, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and the petition of relator dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
