On July 7, 2011, the District Court sentenced Hernandez to concurrent prison terms of 202 months. He now appeals his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Hernandez appeals his convictions on the grounds that the District Court failed adequately to instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cpossession\u201d and to respond to a jury question asking for a definition of possession. We find no merit in either ground. The definition of possession in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury conformed substantially to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Pattern Jury Instructions. Here is what the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-13\">Possession, there are four kinds of possession I guess. A person [has] actual possession, constructive possession, sole possession or joint possession. A person can have all of those. Actual possession of a thing occurs when a person knowingly has direct, physical control over that item.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-14\">Constructive possession is a thing when a person does not have actual possession of it but both has the power and the intention to take control of it at a later time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-15\">Sole possession occurs if a person is the only person to possess it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-16\">Joint possession of a thing occurs when two or more persons share possession. The term possession includes as we have used it in the instructions means [sic] actual[,] constructive^] sole[,] and joint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">When the jury sent out a note during deliberations asking for the definition of possession, the court referred them to page 13 of the written instructions, which had been given to the jury prior to deliberations. Hernandez\u2019s argument regarding the court\u2019s handling of the jury\u2019s request is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-19\">Hernandez challenges his sentences as procedurally unreasonable because the District Court erred both in estimating the amount of cocaine attributable to him and in finding that he destroyed material evidence for purposes of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 obstruction-of-justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>enhancement. The sentences are not procedurally unreasonable because, in estimating the drug quantity attributable to Hernandez, the court relied on uncontested evidence. As for the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, the evidence that Hernandez destroyed material evidence was compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">We find no merit in Hernandez\u2019s argument that the sentences are substantively unreasonable because the court properly took into account the purposes of a criminal sentence, as set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and, in sentencing Hernandez to concurrent terms of 202 months, varied downward from the sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines \u2014 292 to 365 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
