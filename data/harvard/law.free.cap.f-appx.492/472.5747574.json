He now moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) motion for reduction of sentence and the denial of his motion for reconsideration. He has also filed his appellate brief. Although Skyers did not timely notice his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>appeal from the district court\u2019s initial judgment, this does not deprive us of jurisdiction over his appeal. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">By moving for IFP status in this court, Skyers challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, which was grounded in its determination that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Consistent with his filings in the district court, Skyers avers that the district court improperly calculated the drug quantity upon which his sentence was based. A motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not to be used for raising claims related to the original sentencing. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009). Skyers\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus is not taken in good faith. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Consequently, his IFP motion is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
