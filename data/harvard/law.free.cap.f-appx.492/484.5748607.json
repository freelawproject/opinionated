Hollowell contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because: the district court abused its discretion in balancing the sentencing factors by failing to account for his drug addiction\u2019s role in his criminal history, the family tragedies he had recently suffered, and his efforts to cooper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ate with authorities; and it is \u201cnot comparable\u201d to his codefendants\u2019 sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 399 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The district court considered Hollowell\u2019s assertions for a lower sentence, and weighed them against other relevant sentencing factors. In that regard, the court twice explained it accounted for Hollowell\u2019s cooperation with authorities. Hollowell challenges the court\u2019s balancing of the sentencing factors, but he fails to show its decision was based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Regarding Hollowell\u2019s contention that his sentence is \u201cnot comparable\u201d to his codefendants\u2019 sentences, he fails to show his codefendants were similarly situated to him. <em>E.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (district court must consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with <em>similar </em>records who have been found guilty of <em>similar </em>conduct\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Guillermo Balleza, </em>613 F.3d 432, 435 (5th Cir.2010) (no unwarranted disparity where co-defendant convicted of different crime or received downward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
