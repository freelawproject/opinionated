On appeal, Butler argues that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors before <em>sua sponte </em>reducing his sentence. The district court\u2019s order did not mention \u00a7 3553(a) at all. The government concedes that the district court erred, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In considering whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court must first recalculate the defendant\u2019s advisory guidelines range under the amended guidelines. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The district court \u201cnext must consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). The district court \u201cis not required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s consideration of the factors may be demonstrated based on the \u201crecord as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, if it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Here, nothing in the record indicates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in choosing a new sentence. The district court order established that, after Amendment 750, Butler\u2019s new guidelines range was 92 to 115 months and reduced Butler\u2019s prison term to 103 months. However, the district court\u2019s order did not mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at all. In addition, because the district court ruled <em>sua sponte, </em>there were no pri- or pleadings or arguments as to the applicability of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the district court could have considered before it reduced Butler\u2019s sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928-29 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that the record showed consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors where the district court\u2019s order referred to the defendant\u2019s motion, which argued that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a more lenient sentence, and the district court held a hearing at which the parties argued the applicability of the factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Because here the record as a whole does not show that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we vacate Butler\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
