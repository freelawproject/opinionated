Rosso\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) calculated a sentence guideline range of 51 to 60 months imprisonment, based on a criminal history category of IV, and a total offense level of 17. This included a two-level identity theft enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Granting in part Rosso\u2019s request for a downward variance, the district court sentenced Rosso to a term of 37 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">On appeal, Rosso argues that his sentence must be vacated because the district court erred by enhancing his sentencing guideline range pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), the identify theft enhancement. \u201cWe apply a two-pronged standard to review claims that the district court erroneously applied sentencing guidelines adjustments.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>527 F.3d 1235, 1247 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cFirst, we review the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for clear error. We then review the court\u2019s application of those facts to the guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-16\">Rosso does not contest the factual basis for the enhancement. Indeed, he concedes that in September 2009 he used a fictitious social security number, and the name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>birth date of a previously deceased man (Michael Jerome Calabrese) to obtain a replacement Florida drivers license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, Rosso\u2019s claim goes to the second prong of the analysis. Rosso argues that the identity theft enhancement does not apply to his conduct. Specifically, Rosso argues first that Calabrese was deceased when Rosso used Calabrese\u2019s name and birth date to obtain the replacement drivers license, and thus Rosso did not use a \u201cmeans of identification unlawfully to ... obtain [another] means of identification\u201d within the meaning of section 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i); and, second, that \u201cbecause the social security number used was not that of an actual individual, [Rosso\u2019s] conduct is not within the reach of the enhancement.\u201d For the reasons that follow, neither argument prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Section 2B1.1 (b)(l 0) (C) (i) provides that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f the offense involved ... the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The commentary to section 2B1.1 adopts the definition of \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as it appears in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7), <em>see </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1, which, in turn, defines \u201cmeans of identification\u201d as including \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any name [or] date of birth.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7). Section 2B1.1 clarifies, however, \u201cthat such means of identification shall be of an actual <em>(i.e., </em>not fictitious) individual, other than the defendant....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Rosso argues first that \u201cthe enhancement provision is unclear as to whether an \u2018actual person,\u2019 within the meaning of this provision, includes deceased persons,\u201d and therefore that \u201cthe rule of lenity requires that it be construed most favorable to his position.\u201d This court has recently rejected a similar argument in the context of another statute. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Arteaga, </em>681 F.3d 1220, 1223 (11th Cir.2012). In <em>Zuniga-Arteaga </em>we concluded that the aggravated identity theft statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), \u201cpunishes theft of the identity of any actual person, regardless of whether that person is still alive.\u201d <em>Zuniga-Arteaga, </em>681 F.3d at 1223. Consistent with the reasoning of <em>Zunigar-Arteaga^ </em>we reject Rosso\u2019s argument that the identity theft enhancement can only apply where the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d belongs to a living person. <em>See also United States v. Castillo-Hernandez, </em>152 Fed.Appx. 811, 812 (11th Cir.2005) (reasoning that an \u201cactual person\u201d within the plain meaning of the sentencing guidelines includes a deceased person).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">Second, Rosso argues that \u201chis conduct does not come within this provision\u201d because the social security number he used in conjunction with Calabrese\u2019s name and birth date to obtain the replacement drivers license was fictitious. This argument also fails. We interpret the sentencing guidelines according to their \u201cplain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>17 F.3d 351, 354 (11th Cir.1994). The commentary to section 2B1.1 makes it plain that \u201cmeans of identification\u201d means <em>\u201cany name or number </em>that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7) (emphasis added). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. Rosso\u2019s use of Calabrese\u2019s name and date of birth was sufficient by itself to warrant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>identity theft enhancement. <em>See id. </em>Thus, we need not decide whether Rosso\u2019s use of a fictitious social security number, standing alone, would support the enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s sentence for Rosso is</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-11\">. The probation office prepared the PSR on October 31, 2011 and, thus, referred to the 2010 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines. PSR \u00b6 7. In the 2011 edition, effective November 1, 2011, section 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) was renumbered as section 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(C)(i); in substance, however, the enhancement remained the same. For clarity, we will refer to the enhancement as it appeared in the 2010 edition, <em>i.e. </em>section 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-7\">. Rosso's use of the fictitious social security number to get a replacement Florida drivers license provided the factual basis for his false representation of a social security number conviction, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b53-18\">. Rosso repeatedly points out that the factual findings underlying the identity theft enhancement are unrelated to his convictions for counts one and two of the indictment, theft of government property, and failure to disclose events affecting his continued eligibility for social security benefits, respectively. Even if true, this observation is beside the point. Regardless of whether Rosso\u2019s use of Calabrese\u2019s name and birth date to obtain a fraudulent drivers license was related to his social security benefits fraud, it was clearly related to his conviction for false representation of a social security number, the offense to which the identity theft enhancement was applied.
