Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court granted a motion by Ransom pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence to a total of 235 months of imprisonment. Ransom now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">In his initial brief, Ransom argued that the district court erred by ruling on his sentence reduction without providing him with a copy of the presentence worksheet, which the district court relied on when deciding his motion. While his appeal was pending, this court granted Ransom\u2019s motion to review the report. After Ransom reviewed the report, he filed a motion to supplement his appellate brief, which this court also granted. Because Ransom received and reviewed the relevant report and was permitted to supplement his challenges on appeal, we will address his challenges to the district court\u2019s grant of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-22\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce a sentence after considering the applicable factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the applicable guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-23\">A review of the record reveals that, when granting Ransom\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, guideline policy statements, Ransom\u2019s self-improvement achievements, and Ransom\u2019s lack of disciplinary incidents. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10; \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Ransom has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in granting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>\u00a7 8582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
