On appeal, Wright challenges the district court\u2019s: (1) denial of his two motions to withdraw his guilty plea; and (2) failure to apply the penalty provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) as amended by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) at sentencing. After review, we affirm Wright\u2019s convictions, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>I. MOTIONS TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">After the district court has accepted a guilty plea and before sentencing, the defendant may withdraw the guilty plea if \u201cthe defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). In determining whether the defendant has met his burden, the district court may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea, including \u201c(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 472 (11th Cir.1988) (citation omitted). The district court decides the good faith, credibility and weight due a defendant\u2019s assertions in support of a motion to withdraw his plea. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wright\u2019s two motions to withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plea colloquy conducted by the magistrate judge was thorough, and Wright points to no procedural defect in it. In addition, Wright does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that Wright had close assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty, that his decision to do so was voluntary and made without coercion, and that judicial resources would be conserved by denying Wright\u2019s motions, three of the four <em>Buckles </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Instead, Wright contends that he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because the government admitted to the district court that it would not suffer any prejudice, the fourth <em>Buckles </em>factor. However, the district court \u201cneed not find prejudice to the government before it can deny a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw.\u201d <em>Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Moreover, the record reflects that Wright\u2019s reasons for wanting to withdraw his plea were not \u201cfair or just.\u201d The basis for Wright\u2019s first (counseled) motion to withdraw his guilty plea was that \u201c[ujpon further review of the discovery provided by the government in this case, [Wright] now believes he has a viable defense to the charges against him, and desires a trial by a jury of his peers.\u201d At a hearing on the motion, Wright explained that his counsel had failed to review discovery materials with him and, when Wright later reviewed the discovery materials by himself, he found \u201ca lot of mistakes and lies in it\u201d and became convinced that he had a viable defense. However, Wright did not dispute that he received all of the government\u2019s discovery materials prior to his plea hearing. In fact, at the plea hearing, Wright admitted that his counsel had delivered copies of the government\u2019s discovery to him before the hearing and that he had already looked it over. Moreover, the magistrate judge adjourned the plea hearing to allow Wright to discuss the discovery materials with his counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The basis for Wright\u2019s second <em>(pro se) </em>motion to withdraw his guilty plea was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>that, at the time of his guilty plea, he did not know his statutory mandatory minimum penalty or that he was waiving his right to appeal. However, the record belies Wright\u2019s claim. First, the plea agreement listed the mandatory minimum prison terms for each count and contained the appeal waiver, and, during the plea colloquy, Wright advised the magistrate judge that he understood the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Medlock, </em>12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cThere is a strong presumption that the statements made during the colloquy are true.\u201d). Further, during the plea colloquy, the magistrate judge advised Wright of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for each count and reviewed the substance of the appeal waiver. In each instance, Wright indicated that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in denying either of Wright\u2019s motions to withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">II. FAIR SENTENCING ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">In January 2010, when Wright was charged, a defendant who was convicted of a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) offense involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and who had two prior felony drug convictions faced a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). On August 8, 2010, before Wright\u2019s sentencing had occurred, the FSA went into effect. After the FSA, such a defendant faced a statutory mandatory minimum prison term of only ten years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">At sentencing, the district court used the November 2010 Sentencing Guidelines, which reflected the FSA\u2019s changes, to calculate Wright\u2019s base offense level of 26 and his initial advisory guidelines range of 110 to 137 months imprisonment. However, without any objection from Wright, the district court then applied the old mandatory minimum of life, rather than the new ten-year mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), as amended by the FSA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As such, the district court found that Wright\u2019s guidelines sentence became life imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). The district court then granted the government\u2019s substantial assistance motion, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(e), and imposed 240-month concurrent sentences on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The Supreme Court recently concluded that the FSA\u2019s \u201cmore lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3, 2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2326. Therefore, as the government concedes, the district court erred by failing to sentence Williams using the FSA\u2019s ten-year mandatory minimum in \u00a7 841(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That error is also plain. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cAlthough the error was.not \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of sentencing, \u2018where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal-it is enough that the error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1549, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">Moreover, the error affected Wright\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831-32 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the defendant shows his substantial rights were affected when \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that there would have been a different result had there been no error\u201d). When properly calculated using the post-FSA ten-year mandatory minimum, Wright\u2019s advisory guidelines range, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2), is 120 to 137 months, well-below the total 240-month sentence the district court actually imposed after granting a substantial \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">For these reasons, we affirm Wright\u2019s convictions, but vacate his concurrent 240-month sentences and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-6\">.We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2006). There is no abuse of discretion unless the denial is arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>Further, there is no abuse of discretion if the court conducted extensive Rule 11 inquiries before accepting and entering the guilty plea. <em>Id.; see </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b996-10\">. Wright's first motion to withdraw his guilty plea, filed <em>pro se, </em>was withdrawn before the district court could rule upon it and is not part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b996-11\">. Specifically, at the plea hearing, Wright told the magistrate judge that he had not reviewed the discovery materials with his counsel, that he had seen things in the discovery materials \"that might be a problem with the case\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>that he had not yet discussed them with his counsel. The magistrate judge then took a one-hour recess to allow Wright to confer with his counsel about the discovery materials. When the hearing reconvened, Wright was prepared to proceed with the plea hearing and in fact pled guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b997-9\">. Wright also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion to remove his appointed counsel in which he alleged that his attorney had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. As with his two motions to withdraw, Wright claimed that his attorney wanted him to plead guilty, did not review the government's discovery materials with him before the plea hearing and did not advise him of the mandatory minimum sentences. Because the district court denied Wright\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion as \"premature\u201d and did not develop the record with respect to his ineffective assistance allegations, we decline to consider this claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (\"We will not generally consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b997-13\">. Because Wright did not object in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007). To meet this standard, Wright must show: (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) that affected his substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the forfeited error if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1276.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b998-9\">. We do not address whether the appeal waiver in Wright\u2019s plea agreement applies to his FSA claim because on appeal the government did not seek to enforce the appeal waiver with respect to this claim. Instead, the government addressed the FSA claim on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
