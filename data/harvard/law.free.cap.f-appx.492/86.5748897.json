The order suspended Gleason from practice before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the bankruptcy court for sixty days. Gleason contends that (1) the sixty-day suspension violated his First Amendment right to free speech and his Fifth Amendment right to due process; (2) the bankruptcy court lacked the authority to conduct <em>en banc </em>disciplinary proceedings and to suspend a member of the district court bar; and (3) it was clear error to find that he engaged in an impermissible <em>ex parte </em>contact while his disciplinary proceedings were pending when he sent a bankruptcy judge a bottle of wine and a note suggesting that they resolve their differences \u201cprivately.\u201d Gleason also argues that the bankruptcy court clearly erred by finding that he acted in bad faith and that it abused its discretion by suspending him from practicing before it for sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s and bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions and review the findings of fact only for clear error. <em>In re Mroz, </em>65 F.3d 1567, 1572 (11th Cir.1995). We review the decision to impose sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 1571-72. Under that standard, we must affirm unless we find that the bankruptcy court made a clear error of judgment or applied the wrong legal standard. <em>See Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2007). \u201c \u2018The application of an abuse-of-discretion review recognizes the range of possible conclusions the [bankruptcy court] may reach.\u2019\u201d <em>Norelus v. Denny's, Inc., </em>628 F.3d 1270, 1280 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Gleason contends his sixty-day suspension from practice violates his First Amendment right to free speech. He argues that the bankruptcy court should not have disciplined him based on the \u201ctone\u201d of his submissions, which he describes as \u201ctruthful responses to a string of unjustified abuses.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He asserts that his First Amendment rights supersede the rules that regulate attorney conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Gleason has identified no authority supporting his contention that the First Amendment shields from sanctions an attorney who files an inappropriate and unprofessional pleading and then contacts a presiding judge <em>ex parte </em>with an offer to share a bottle of wine and \u201cprivately\u201d resolve their dispute. When an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>files inappropriate and unprofessional documents, a court may impose sanctions based on its \u201cinherent power to oversee attorneys practicing before it.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging Co., </em>293 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2002) (upholding a district court\u2019s decision to sanction an attorney who submitted documents containing personal attacks on opposing.counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In the present case, the bankruptcy court found that Gleason\u2019s written submissions to the court and sending a judge a bottle of wine with an offer to resolve their differences privately amounted to \u201csanc-tionable professional misconduct.\u201d In ordering sanctions, the court exercised its inherent authority to oversee an attorney practicing before it. Proper procedures for challenging rulings that an attorney believes are wrong do not include filing an inappropriate response to a show cause order and then compounding that problem by contacting the judge ex parte. If Gleason believed that the rulings in the underlying bankruptcy case were based on errors of fact or law, his proper procedure was an appeal. Under the circumstances of this case, the bankruptcy court did not violate Gleason\u2019s First Amendment rights by sanctioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Gleason also contends that the bankruptcy court violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process by holding an <em>en banc </em>hearing even though there are no rules that authorize that procedure and by suspending him from practice even though there is no \u201cbankruptcy bar\u201d to which lawyers are admitted. He argues that the bankruptcy court failed to provide him with sufficient notice of his alleged violations, the procedures that the <em>en banc </em>court would follow at his disciplinary hearing, and the rules the court would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">A bankruptcy court is authorized to \u201cissue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions\u201d of Title 11 of the United States Code, which governs bankruptcy proceedings. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a). The court may <em>sua sponte </em>take any action or make any determination \u201cnecessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to prevent an abuse of process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the bankruptcy court\u2019s local rules, a single judge has the authority to discipline an attorney, including the authority to suspend him from practice after providing notice and a hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">Upon order to show cause entered by <em>at least </em>one judge, any attorney appearing before the court may, after 30 days\u2019 notice and hearing and for good cause shown, be suspended from practice before the court ... or otherwise disciplined, by a judge whose order to show cause initiated the disciplinary proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Bankr. S.D. Fla. R.2090-2(B)(1) (emphasis added). Under that rule, there is nothing to prevent the <em>en banc </em>bankruptcy court from disciplining an attorney who practices before it. Bankr. S.D. Fla. R.2090-2(A) (providing that the rule should not \u201cbe construed as providing an exclusive procedure for the discipline of attorneys appearing before the court\u201d). Section 105(a) and the bankruptcy court\u2019s local rules authorized it to conduct the disciplinary proceedings that led to Gleason\u2019s suspension and to suspend Gleason from practice before it for sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The bankruptcy code and the local rules, however, were not the only sources of authority for the bankruptcy court\u2019s actions; the court also invoked its inherent power to impose sanctions. <em>See Mroz, </em>65 F.3d at 1575 (\u201c[T]he inherent power of a court can be invoked even if procedural rules exist which sanction the same con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>duct\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). A federal court\u2019s inherent powers \u201cinclude the power to control and discipline attorneys appearing before it,\u201d <em>id., </em>and to suspend attorneys who practice before it, <em>see In re Snyder, </em>472 U.S. 634, 643, 105 S.Ct. 2874, 2880, 86 L.Ed.2d 504 (1985); <em>see also In re Evergreen Sec., Ltd., </em>570 F.3d 1257, 1280 (11th Cir.2009) (upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment imposing monetary sanctions and suspending an attorney from practice before the bankruptcy court for five years).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">An attorney subject to sanctions is entitled to due process, which includes \u201cfair notice that [his] conduct may warrant sanctions and the reasons why,\u201d as well as the opportunity to respond. <em>Mroz, </em>65 F.3d at 1575. He must be given the opportunity to justify his actions either orally or in writing. <em>Id. </em>at 1575-76. After that, a finding of bad faith is \u201cthe key to unlocking the court\u2019s inherent power\u201d to impose sanctions. <em>In re Porto, </em>645 F.3d 1294, 1304 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Gleason received both notice and an opportunity to respond. Before his disciplinary hearing, the bankruptcy court issued several orders addressing his behavior. Those orders informed Gleason of the conduct for which the bankruptcy court intended to sanction him, explained why that conduct warranted sanctions, and set out the rules under which the conduct would be judged. The bankruptcy court then held an <em>en banc </em>disciplinary hearing, a procedure permitted under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a), the court\u2019s local rules, and its inherent powers. At that hearing, Gleason and his counsel had the opportunity to address the court. After the hearing, the bankruptcy court issued an order finding that Gleason\u2019s written responses to the court\u2019s show cause order and his attempt to contact a judge <em>ex parte </em>violated his professional responsibilities as an attorney and were damaging to the court as an institution. The court concluded that Gleason had acted in bad faith and that sanctions were warranted. Gleason received all of the process he was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Gleason next contends that the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of bad faith is clearly erroneous and that the court abused its discretion by imposing a sixty-day suspension, instead of a less severe sanction such as a reprimand. Before exercising its inherent power to impose sanctions, a court must make a finding of bad faith. <em>Mroz, </em>65 F.3d at 1575. A finding of bad faith may be appropriate when counsel has acted \u201cvexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To support a finding of bad faith, the bankruptcy court should make specific findings about the party\u2019s conduct that warrants sanctions. <em>In re Porto, </em>645 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in determining that Gleason\u2019s filing of inappropriate and unprofessional responses to a show cause order and his attempt to contact a judge <em>ex parte </em>amounted to bad faith that warranted the imposition of sanctions. The <em>en banc </em>bankruptcy court\u2019s order demonstrates that it gave reasoned consideration to the gravity of Gleason\u2019s conduct and to the various aggravating and mitigating circumstances involved in this case. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to suspend Gleason from practice for sixty days, which it determined to be \u201cthe minimal sanction necessary to preserve the authority and integrity\u201d of the court, does not constitute a misapplication of the law or otherwise amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">. The tone of Gleason\u2019s response to the bankruptcy court's show cause order is illustrated by its opening and closing paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">In your fourth published example of \"Ready-Fire-Aim\u201d against this attorney, it is obvious that you have not reviewed the record in this case which does not support the purported findings of fact. It is further quite obvious that you do not believe that the same respect mandated to be shown to you should also be shown to me. Your conclusion that [my client's] attempt to exempt his commissions as the head of a household is not supported by law is belied by the language of the actual statute. Your conduct in this case [h]as been without citation to any authority for the propositions that: your jurisdiction is never ending and without geographic bounds; your unconditional releases are meaningless; and pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court are mere suggestions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">It is sad when a man of your intellectual ability cannot get it right when your own record does not support your half-baked findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">Doc. 592 at 1, 4 (footnote omitted). In a supplemental response, Gleason stated that he \"delivered a nice bottle of wine to the Court's chambers, with a hand-written note, which read as follows, \u2018Dear Judge Olson, a Donnybrook ends when someone buys the first drink. May we resolve our issues privately?\u2019 \u201d Doc. 614 at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
