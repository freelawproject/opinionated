Jackson argues that district court erred in not conducting an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 analysis; the applicable Guidelines violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>due process and equal protection rights; the district court should have applied a 1:1 ratio; his sentence was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and then enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and, therefore, the district court erred in denying his motion because he was sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1; and the sentencing judge should have decided his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as the sentencing judge expressly stated that if Congress ever reduced the guidelines range for this offense, Jackson\u2019s sentence should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Because Jackson\u2019s sentence was based on the career offender guidelines provision, \u00a7 4B1.1, the reductions resulting from the amended \u00a7 2D1.1 would have no impact on his offense level or the applicable guidelines range. Therefore, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a reduction in Jackson\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">For the first time on appeal, Jackson also contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to do a complete \u00a7 3553 analysis, including consideration of numerous additional issues. Because Jackson did not raise these issues in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir.2010). To show plain error, Jackson must show a forfeited error that was clear or obvious and that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he made this showing, this court would have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Because Jackson\u2019s arguments are not based on a retroactively applicable amendment to the Guidelines, he may not raise them in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a); <em>see Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court determined that Jackson was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and, therefore, the district court was not required to determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a reduction. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92. The principles of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny also do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings; a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce a sentence further than the reduction allowed pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2692; <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-39 (5th Cir.2009). Jackson\u2019s arguments based upon extra-circuit opinions are unavailing as this court is bound by its precedent unless it is overruled by an en banc decision of this court or by a decision of the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 425 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
