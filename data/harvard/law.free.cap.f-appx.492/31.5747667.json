The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the finding of the immigration judge that Baig\u2019s future eligibility for an adjustment of status did not constitute good cause to continue his and Fathima\u2019s removal proceeding. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">The immigration judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the motion to continue. To be eligible for an adjustment of status, an alien must be \u201celigible to receive an immigration visa\u201d and the visa must be \u201cimmediately available\u201d to the alien. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A), (B). Baig has an approved third-preference employment-based visa petition with a priority date of October 20, 2003, but when the immigration judge considered Baig\u2019s motion, visas were available only to aliens with a priority date of October 1, 2001, or earlier. Notably, when the Board issued its decision, third-preference employment-based visas were available to aliens with a priority date of July 22, 2002, or earlier. Because of the indefinite wait that Baig faced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>obtain an immigrant visa, no good cause existed to continue the removal proceeding. <em>See Chacku v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1363-64 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We DENY Baig and Fathima\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
