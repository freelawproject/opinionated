At sentencing, the district court applied a two-level increase to his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B)(i), because it determined that the underlying offense involved the production of the counterfeit credit cards that Padr\u00f3n used during the offense. On appeal, Padr\u00f3n argues that the district court erred in applying the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B)(i) increase because there is no evidence linking him to the production of the cards, as opposed to his use of the cards. According to Padr\u00f3n, because he was individually charged, his actual and relevant conduct did not extend to the actions of third parties. Padr\u00f3n contends that although someone must have produced the cards, there was no nexus between who produced the cards and Padr\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and, in most cases, review a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts with due deference, which is equivalent to clear error review. <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1202-03 (11th Cir.2011) (reviewing the district court\u2019s finding as to whether a defendant\u2019s offense involved the production of unauthorized access devices for clear error and determining that the court properly applied a two-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(10)(B)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have previously stated that there is no clear error in cases where the record supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>United States v. Petrie, </em>302 F.3d 1280, 1290 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, there is no clear error where the sentencing court fails to make individualized findings regarding the scope of a defendant\u2019s activity, but the record supports the court\u2019s determination with respect to offense conduct, including the imputation of others\u2019 unlawful acts to the defendant. <em>Id.; see United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939-40 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (providing that, in making the ultimate determination as to whether a minor role reduction applies, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, the sentencing court is not required to make any specific subsidiary findings). A district court\u2019s choice between two permissible views of the evidence is not clearly erroneous. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945. We must be left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court has committed a mistake in order for its finding to be clearly erroneous. <em>Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B)(i), a two-level increase applies where an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>involved the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device. An \u201caccess device\u201d includes a card or an account number that can be used to obtain a thing of value. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1); <em>see Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1201 (defining \u201caccess device\u201d as used in \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(B)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1066, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012). The term \u201cproduce\u201d includes the terms \u201cdesign, alter, authenticate, duplicate, or assemble.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(4); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The Guidelines provide that specific offense characteristics are based on a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 comment. (n. 1(H)) (defining \u201coffense\u201d as the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3). Relevant conduct includes all acts and omissions committed by the defendant, as well as all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A) and (B). To determine the defendant\u2019s accountability for the conduct of others, the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n. 2); <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (describing the findings a district court must make before holding a defendant accountable for the conduct of others). Then, the court must determine whether the conduct of others was in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n. 2). If so, then that conduct is attributable to the defendant as relevant conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The undisputed facts in Padron\u2019s pre-sentence investigation report demonstrate that there was jointly undertaken criminal activity, because Padr\u00f3n agreed at a meeting with a friend to use credit cards, provided by that friend, to obtain things of value. The fact that those counterfeit cards were embossed with Padron\u2019s name demonstrates that there was a nexus between the jointly undertaken criminal activity and the production of the cards, such that it could be inferred that someone involved in the joint criminal activity produced the cards in furtherance of that activity. Thus, the district court properly applied the two-level increase because it did not clearly err in its determination that the offense, which included all relevant conduct, involved the cards\u2019 production, as the record supports its finding. Accordingly, we affirm Padron\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\">.
