Garcia argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He maintains that his within-guidelines range sentence should not be considered presumptively reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed. He further contends that the presumption of reasonableness has been rebutted because the district court made a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. Garcia asserts that the sentence was greater than necessary to meet the needs of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because it did not sufficiently account for his cultural assimilation, the double counting of his criminal history in both his offense level and criminal history category, and his family circumstances. He argues that the district court did not give proper weight to the mitigating factors he presented because it concentrated only on his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-19\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). As Garcia concedes, his argument that his within-guidelines range sentence should not be considered presumptively reasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). The fact that this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court had before it both mitigating and aggravating factors. The district court balanced these factors, and it determined that a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was appropriate. We conclude there is no reason to disturb the presumption of reasonableness in this case. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
