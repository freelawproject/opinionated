She argues that given the circumstances of this case, there is no procedural bar on multiple motions to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). An exercise of administrative discretion will not be upheld if it is arbitrary or capricious. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-22\">On appeal, Tobias does not argue that she has not filed two motions to reconsider, and any such argument is therefore abandoned. <em>Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root Serv., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir.2009). Agency regulations state that only one motion to reconsider can be filed for any decision, and a party may not request reconsideration of a motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Because there is no argument that she does not have two motions to reconsider, her present motion was her second motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the BIA correctly denied it and did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-24\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
