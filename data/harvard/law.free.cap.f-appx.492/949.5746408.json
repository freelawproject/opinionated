The government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Santa\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, and should have construed it as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Santa argues that the court properly construed the motion, but that the court should have granted the Rule 60(b) motion because the court previously had failed to address all of the claims in Santa\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. After careful review we affirm both the district court\u2019s exercise of its jurisdiction, and its denial of Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction to hear a matter. <em>Holston Invs., Inc. B.V.I. v. LanLogistics Corp., </em>677 F.3d 1068, 1070 (11th Cir.2012). Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and may only hear cases where authorized by the Constitution and by statute. <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 1675, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). A district court lacks the jurisdiction to hear a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion absent authorization from a Court of Appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); 2255(h); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">A state prisoner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration of his \u00a7 2254 petition may be construed as a second or successive petition where it advances one or more claims, as defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 530-31, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). However when a Rule 60(b) motion attacks \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings\u201d it should not be treated as a successive habe-as petition. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648. For example, \u201c[a] motion that ... challenges only the District Court\u2019s failure to reach the merits ... can therefore be ruled upon by the District Court without precertification by the Court of Appeals <em>....\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 538, 125 S.Ct. at 2651.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">The issue of whether or not a district court had jurisdiction to entertain a Rule 60(b) motion is determined based on the nature of any arguments contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>motion, and without regard for their validity. <em>See Id. </em>at 535-36, 125 S.Ct. at 2650. We have previously held that <em>Gonzalez </em>applies equally to federal prisoners in the course of \u00a7 2255 litigation as it does to state prisoners in \u00a7 2254 litigation. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The government essentially argues that, because Santa\u2019s arguments in support of his Rule 60(b) motion lacked validity, the motion should be construed as attacking the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits of his \u00a7 2255 motion. However, as the Supreme Court has demonstrated, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is based on the nature of the Rule 60(b) arguments, and not their underlying validity. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 535-36, 125 S.Ct. at 2650.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Santa argued in his Rule 60(b) motion that the district court failed to consider all of the claims he raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion. That argument does not attack the district court\u2019s merits determinations, but rather \u201cchallenges only the District Court\u2019s failure to reach the merits.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 538, 125 S.Ct. at 2651. Accordingly, Santa\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was not a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and the district court had jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">We may review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60(b) motion only for abuse of discretion. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). We will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision on abuse-of-discretion review if its decision falls within a range of permissible choices, and it is not influenced by a mistake of law. <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 483 (11th Cir.2006). The appeal from a denial of Rule 60(b) relief addresses only that decision, and does not bring up the underlying judgment for review. <em>Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. at 560 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Rule 60(b) names five specific circumstances under which a party to a case may receive relief from a final judgment. Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). Under Rule 60(b)(6), a party may obtain relief for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). A movant seeking relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) must show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying the reopening of a final judgment. <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 535, 125 S.Ct. at 2649.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">In <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc), we emphasized that it is important for the district court to resolve all claims presented in a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936-38. We reached that holding in the name of judicial economy, however, and not as a protection of a petitioner\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 938. The rationale of <em>Clisby </em>also applies to motions filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">The record demonstrates that the district court in fact did consider each of the claims in Santa\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, and decided that none required that his convictions be vacated. Whether the district court was correct in reaching that conclusion is beyond the scope of this appeal. <em>See Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. at 560 n. 7. Santa\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion argued only that the district court failed to consider all of his claims. The fact that the district court considered and rejected all of Santa\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims on their merits is enough for us to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Santa Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
