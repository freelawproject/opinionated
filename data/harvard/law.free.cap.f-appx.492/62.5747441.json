For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Cockran\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">In 1993, Cockran pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. According the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), from 1987 to 1989, law enforcement officials investigated Cockran\u2019s role as the \u201chead of a large crack cocaine distribution organization in the Tallahassee, Florida area.\u201d During the investigation, Josephine Rucker, a witness who police officers questioned in relation to a 1987 drug seizure, stated that Cockran was \u201cactive in dealing large quan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>tities (kilograms) of crack cocaine.\u201d Additionally, Austin Sanders, a cooperating witness, stated that Cockran \u201ccould handle multi-kilo deals,\u201d and that he \u201cconsistently handled kilograms over a period of eight months.\u201d Finally, Ranee Conner, a drug courier in the drug organization, indicated that Cockran had \u201chandled kilograms of cocaine more than once, and possibly as many as five times in 1988.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Based on the 1987 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the probation officer assigned a base offense level of 36, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(a)(3). The PSI noted that the government believed that Cockran was involved with \u201cnumerous kilograms of cocaine base\u201d in the conspiracy, and the base offense level was 36 because Cockran was accountable for more than 500 grams of crack cocaine. He received a four-level enhancement for his leadership role, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, and a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Thus, his total offense level was 40. Based on an offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of II, Cockran\u2019s guideline range was 324 to 405 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">During the sentencing hearing, Cockran did not object to the drug quantity, and as a result, the court did not address any drug quantity issues. The court adopted the PSI\u2019s guideline calculations, and sentenced Cockran to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In December 2011, Cockran filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. In his motion, Cockran asserted that, because he pled guilty to possessing 50 grams of cocaine base as charged in the indictment, he was eligible for a sentence reduction. Further, he alleged that his counsel objected to the PSI during sentencing. Applying Amendment 750 would result in a guideline range of 88 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finally, Cockran asserted that several \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The district court denied Cockran\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The court explained that Cockran was sentenced \u201cpursuant to the 1987 Guidelines, which attributed a base offense level of 36 (the highest level at that time) to conduct involving more than 500 grams of cocaine base.\u201d However, the PSI indicated that Cockran was active in dealing \u201ckilograms\u201d of cocaine. Cockran did not object to the drug quantities described in the PSI, and accordingly, the sentencing court did not address the issue of drug quantity. The sentencing court, however, adopted the factual findings in the PSI. Applying the revised guidelines to \u201cthe multi-kilo drug quantities\u201d described in the PSI, Cockran\u2019s base offense level would still be at least a 36. Because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750, the court lacked jurisdiction to reduce Cockran\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Cockran moved to amend or alter the judgment, essentially requesting reconsideration of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district court denied Cock-ran\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment, finding that nothing in the motion affected the court\u2019s prior decision as to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under the sentencing guidelines and its factfindings for clear error. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). A court may only modify a term of imprisonment in limited circumstances, including where a defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A defendant is not entitled to be resentenced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the amendment \u201cwould not result in a lower base offense level and guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 986 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Additionally, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not grant the district court jurisdiction to reconsider all original sentencing determinations. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). In fact, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, when an amendment does not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and district court lacks authority to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court need not examine the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In determining the applicable guideline range for purposes of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court is bound by the original sentencing court\u2019s factual determinations. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 n. 5 (11th Cir.1997) (affirming district court\u2019s refusal to re-examine the number of marijuana plants attributed to the defendant by the original sentencing court). The court conducting the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, however, does not make an \u201cimpermissible new finding of fact\u201d if it holds a defendant responsible for a drug quantity that was (1) set forth in the original PSI, (2) not objected to by the government or defendant, and (3) adopted by the original sentencing court. <em>Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303-04 (affirming district court\u2019s determination that defendant was ineligible for relief based on the original sentencing court\u2019s adoption of the PSI\u2019s factual finding that the offense involved at least 8 kilograms of crack cocaine, even though the original court had not specified an exact quantity in excess of 1.5 kilograms).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, made permanent an amendment lowering the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amends. 748, 750. These amendments altered the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) so that a base offense level of 36 applies to cases involving at least 2.8 kilograms but less than 8.4 kilograms of cocaine base. <em>See id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The district court correctly denied Cock-ran\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Here, Cockran did not object to the drug quantity amounts or factual allegations in the PSI, and the original sentencing court expressly adopted the PSI\u2019s guideline calculations and factual findings. The PSI assigned Cockran an offense level of 36, which at that time required a minimum drug quantity amount of 500 grams of cocaine base. However, the undisputed factual allegations in the PSI supported the district court\u2019s factual finding that Cockran trafficked in at least 2.8 kilograms of cocaine, as required for a base offense level of 36 under Amendment 750. Specifically, the PSI indicated that: (1) Cockran whs \u201cactive in dealing large quantities (kilograms) of cocaine,\u201d (2) he could handle \u201cmulti-kilo\u201d deals; (3) he had consistently handled kilograms of cocaine over several months; and (4) he had \u201chandled kilograms of crack cocaine more than once, and possibly as many as five times in 1988.\u201d As in <em>Davis, </em>although the district court did not specify an exact quantity of cocaine, other than the minimum 500 gram requirement, the sentencing court\u2019s adoption of the PSI\u2019s factual findings was sufficient to establish that Cockran was responsible for dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>in multiple kilograms of cocaine. <em>See Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Although Coekran alleges that his indictment only referenced an amount greater than 50 grams of cocaine, he never objected to the drug quantities described in the PSI. Further, Coekran relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), but he fails to explain the relevance of <em>Freeman </em>to this appeal. <em>Freeman </em>addressed whether a defendant who enters a Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Freeman, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2691. In this case, however, the district court did not deny Cockran\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction because he entered a Rule 11 plea agreement, but instead, it found that his applicable guideline range was not subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Finally, although Coekran alleges that the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors warranted a reduced sentence, the district court was not required to consider those factors. <em>See Webb, </em>565 F.3d at 793. Because the application of Amendment 750 would not result in a lower base offense level or guideline range, Coekran was not entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Cockran\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
