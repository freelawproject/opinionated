He argues that the sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court imposed a supervised-release term without explanation, notwithstanding that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) says that supervised release should not ordinarily be imposed on a deportable alien. Iruegas-Val-dez also asserts that the district court did not give notice of its intent to depart from the guidelines\u2019 advice concerning supervised release and that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court did not account for a factor that should have received significant weight \u2014 the recommendation in \u00a7 5Dl.l(e) against imposing supervised release on deportable aliens. As Iruegas-Valdez concedes, review is limited to plain error, because he did not raise these arguments in the district court. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">The court did not plainly err in imposing a term of supervised release. Because that term was within the statutory and guidelines range for the offense of conviction, it was not a departure, so no notice was required. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2012). The court adopted the presentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which cited the current version of \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) and listed Iruegas-Valdez\u2019s extensive criminal history and substance-abuse problems. <em>See United States v. Ollison, </em>555 F.3d 152, 164 (5th Cir.2009). The court denied Iruegas-Valdez\u2019s request for a downward departure, noting that he had an extensive criminal history; that the sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary; and that the sentence was warranted based on the advisory guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The reasons for the sentence based on the PSR and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors were sufficient to support the supervised-release term. <em>See Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
