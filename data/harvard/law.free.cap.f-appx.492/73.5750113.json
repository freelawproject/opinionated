The district court awarded Coca-Cola attorney\u2019s fees and costs because Vergara \u201cshould reasonably have known that his assignment [of his copyright interest] would be determined to be valid prior to filing the suit\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cas soon [as] it became clear during discovery that his claim would lose.\u201d Vergara argues that Coca-Cola is not entitled to recover any of its expenses because his claim of copyright infringement was objectively reasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Vergara sued Coca-Cola for allegedly infringing a copyright that Vergara held in a remixed song, the Celebration Mix, which he had adapted into Spanish for Coca-Cola to use in an advertising campaign. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of Coca-Cola, and we affirmed on the ground that \u201cthe record established] without dispute that Vergara assigned [by email] his copyright interest [in the adaptation] to Universal\u201d Music Latin America, which in turn had assigned its rights to the adaptation to Coca-Cola. <em>Hermosilla v. The Coca-Cola Co., </em>446 Fed.Appx. 201 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">Coca-Cola moved for an award of $1,576,852.48 for attorney\u2019s fees and $125,285.78 for costs, but the district court awarded Coca-Cola $535,135 for attorney\u2019s fees and $43,011.99 for costs. The district court reduced the hourly rate and number of hours billed by counsel and support personnel. Although the district court awarded costs \u201cnecessary in the case,\u201d such as court costs, photocopying, and telephone charges, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920, the district court denied or reduced the charges for litigation support services, travel, and retaining an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The Copyright Act gives a district court the district power to award \u201ccosts by or against any party\u201d and \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. When the district court weighs the factors that the Supreme Court identified to \u201cguide courts\u2019 discretion\u201d in <em>Fogerby v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 534 &amp; n. 19, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 1033 &amp; n. 19, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994), \u201cwe will not question the court\u2019s decision to grant or deny fees absent an abuse of that discretion,\u201d <em>MiTek Holdings, Inc. v. Arce Eng\u2019g Co., </em>198 F.3d 840, 842 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cWe will find an abuse of discretion only when a decision is in clear error, the district court applied an incorrect legal standard or followed improper procedures, or when neither the district court\u2019s decision nor the record provide sufficient explanation to enable meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Friends of the Everglades v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., </em>678 F.3d 1199, 1201 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Coca-Cola. The district court ruled that Vergara\u2019s litigation was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d because Florida law, which Vergara acknowledged as governing the interpretation of copyright contracts, provided that an email satisfied the statute of frauds. The district court was entitled to conclude that Vergara\u2019s complaint, or at least his decision to continue litigating his complaint, was factually and legally unreasonable. The purposes of the copyright law are served only when parties \u201clitigate meritorious claims of infringement.\u201d <em>Fogerty, </em>510 U.S. at 527, 114 S.Ct. at 1030; <em>see MiTek, </em>198 F.3d at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We AFFIRM the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Coca-Cola Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
