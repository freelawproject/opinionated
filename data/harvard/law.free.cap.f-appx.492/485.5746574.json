The district court granted Doyle\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, reduced his total offense level by two levels pursuant to Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and modified his sentence to 292 months of imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Doyle is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Doyle argues that in granting relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court erred in its determination of the base offense level. He asserts that under Amendment 750, his base offense level should have been 32 and that the district court sentenced him using a base offense level of 34. Thus, he contends that the district court considered the incorrect guidelines range when imposing the 292-month sentence and seeks remand for consideration of the appropriate range.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The assertion by Doyle that the district court employed a base offense level of 34 is incorrect. The district court calculated the guidelines range with a <em>total </em>offense level of 34, which resulted from a base offense level of 32 plus the addition of the two-level enhancement for possessing a firearm, and a Category V criminal history score. Doyle\u2019s 292-month sentence is within that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Doyle has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
