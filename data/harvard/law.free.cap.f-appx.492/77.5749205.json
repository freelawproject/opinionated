The action was brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, against NF Energy Saving Corporation of America (\u201cNF Energy\u201d); Gang Li, NF Energy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d); and Don A. Hernandez, NF Energy\u2019s counsel (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-23\">Dawley filed an initial complaint against defendants alleging ten counts of fraud, fraud pertaining to a series of transactions he entered into with NF Energy. The first four counts referenced a series of four contracts between Dawley and NF Energy on his purchase of \u201crenewable convertible notes\u201d that could be converted to stock. The fifth and sixth counts in Dawley\u2019s complaint cited to defendants\u2019 alleged mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>representations during an earlier trial and later appeal about breach-of-contract claims in <em>Dawley v. NF Energy Saving Corp. of Am. et al., </em>374 Fed.Appx. 921 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished) <em>(\u201cDawley I\u201d). </em>His remaining four counts alleged that, on four separate occasions between March 2007 and June 2010, requests he sent to Hernandez that NF Energy honor his contracts were ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The district court dismissed Dawley\u2019s first six claims as barred by <em>res judicata. </em>In addition, the court concluded that counts five and six in Dawley\u2019s complaint were barred by Florida\u2019s litigation privilege. The district court dismissed, without prejudice, Dawley\u2019s four remaining fraud claims because they had not been pleaded with the requisite particularity, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ. P. 9(b); and the court granted him leave to amend those counts. Daw-ley then filed an amended complaint with minor changes to the four claims, but defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim based on Dawley\u2019s failure to plead fraud with particularity. The district court then dismissed Dawley\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On appeal, Dawley does not specifically argue that the district court erred in dismissing his first six fraud claims as barred by <em>res judicata, </em>but instead asserts that <em>Dawley I </em>should be reversed because it violated the intent of the contracting parties and failed to conform to the Florida parol evidence rule. To the extent that Dawley argues that we should revisit and reconsider our rulings in <em>Dawley I, </em>his present notice of appeal \u2014 filed in July 2011, more than a year after the <em>Dawley </em>rulings in April and May 2010<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 is untimely; we lack jurisdiction to consider these issues. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(A) (requiring that notices of appeal must be filed within 30 days after entry of judgment); <em>Rinaldo v. Corbett, </em>256 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that the timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional). Dawley seeks appellate review of the merits of his fraud claims, despite the <em>res judicata </em>finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">A later action is barred by <em>res judicata </em>if (1) there is a prior final judgment on the merits, (2) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) the parties are identical in both suits, and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases. <em>Shurick v. Boeing Co., </em>623 F.3d 1114, 1116-17 (11th Cir.2010). After review, we conclude that the district court committed no reversible error in determining that Dawley\u2019s first six claims were barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The district court\u2019s ruling in <em>Dawley I </em>was final and on the merits. Dawley\u2019s first four claims stem from the same factual predicate as <em>Dawley I: </em>(1) his ownership of 900,000 shares of NF Energy; (2) the notes-to-stock conversion in March 2006; and (3) the sale of the company to Li despite Li\u2019s lack of knowledge of Dawley\u2019s existing contracts, and Li\u2019s later refusal to honor Dawley\u2019s contracts. <em>See Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1239 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted) (stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that two cases are considered to involve the same claim or cause of action if the latter case \u201carises out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or is based upon the same factual predicate\u201d as the former case). Dawley\u2019s sixth claim about NF Energy\u2019s appeal in <em>Dawley I, </em>in which Daw-ley alleged that the defendants knew or should have known that their appeal \u201cviolated the contract terms\u201d and constituted intentional fraud, also arises out of the same breach of a contract at issue in <em>Daw-ley I; </em>it properly was barred by <em>res judi-cata.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Here, Dawley is attempting to sue the defendants using different labels, even though the instant fraud case involves the same cause of action as his earlier breach-of-contract suit. Because the fraud claims already existed when the original complaint was filed in the first case and arose from the same contracts, they should have been raised there. <em>See Trustmark Ins. Co. v. ESLU, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 1265, 1270 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002) (stating that because the same contract was the foundation of the factual predicate in both eases, \u201cas long as the relevant claims had occurred prior to filing the first lawsuit, [plaintiff] should have brought the negligent misrepresentation and fraud claims at that time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Next, the district court properly concluded that Dawley\u2019s fifth and sixth claims were barred by the Florida litigation privilege. Under Florida law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> any act occurring during the course of a judicial proceeding is entitled to absolute immunity as long as the act had some relation to the proceeding. <em>Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>341 F.3d 1292, 1302 (11th Cir.2003). Florida courts have extended this immunity to counsel. <em>See Levin, Middlebrooks, Mabie, Thomas, Mayes &amp; Mitchell, P.A. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>639 So.2d 606, 608 (Fla.1994) (stating that this immunity extends not only to parties in a proceeding but to judges, witnesses, and counsel as well). Because Dawley\u2019s fifth and sixth charges concerned the defendants\u2019 alleged omissions during the <em>Dawley I </em>trial and Hernandez\u2019s alleged fraud in appealing <em>Daw-ley I, </em>the charges involved the judicial proceedings; and the district court properly dismissed these claims as barred by Florida\u2019s litigation privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Dawley does not specifically argue on appeal that the district court erred by dismissing the four claims in his amended complaint with prejudice for failure to plead fraud with particularity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, he maintains that the defendants\u2019 acts constitute intentional fraud because they failed to follow their own contracts, hid the intent of the contracting parties from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>district court, and converted his notes into stock without proper authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">When alleging fraud, a plaintiff \u201cmust state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d at 1288 (quoting Fed. R.CivJP. 9(b)). Under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must allege (1) the precise statement or misrepresentation made; (2) the time, place, and person responsible for the statement; (3) the content and manner in which the statement misled the plaintiff; and (4) what the defendants gained from the alleged fraud. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Dawley\u2019s amended complaint \u2014 copied almost word-for-word from his initial complaint \u2014 alleged only that he made multiple unsuccessful requests to Hernandez to honor his existing contracts. Yet, he does not specify with the requisite particularity how these instances of non-response constitute fraud or the manner in which these failures to respond misled, him. Accordingly, Dawley failed to plead the four fraud claims in his amended complaint with particularity, as required by Rule 9(b), and the district court properly dismissed these claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-15\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>Am. Dental Ass'n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir. 2010). In doing so, we take the factual allegations as true and construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. Dawley first brought suit against NF Energy and Li in May 2007, alleging that they had breached four separate contracts that Dawley had entered into with NF Energy\u2019s predecessor company, Global Broadcast Group, Inc. In April 2010, following an appeal by NF Energy, we reversed the district court\u2019s award of $400,000 to Dawley after the court reformed a lifetime consulting agreement into a contract for interest. In May 2010, we denied Dawley\u2019s petition for a rehearing; and the district court denied his motion for a retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\">. We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. Hernandez was no party to <em>Dawley I, </em>and, thus, <em>res judicata </em>does not bar Dawley\u2019s fifth and sixth claims, as they relate to Hernandez. There is nothing to suggest that Hernandez was in privity with either Li or NF Energy. <em>See Hart v. Yamaha-Parts Distribs., Inc., </em>787 F.2d 1468, 1472 (11th Cir.1986) (noting that <em>res judicata </em>also applies to those persons in privity with the parties in the earlier action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. \"Federal courts sitting in diversity apply the substantive law of the state in which the case arose.\u201d <em>Pendergast v.

Dawley fails to argue on appeal that the district court erred in dismissing his amended complaint with prejudice instead of providing him with another opportunity to amend his complaint; he has abandoned this issue. <em>See N.
