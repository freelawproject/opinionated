By moving to proceed IFP, he is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-21\">The district court held that Johnson had not demonstrated extraordinary cause or a clear and indisputable right to relief that would allow the court to authorize him to file either a petition for writ of prohibition or a writ of mandamus. Johnson argues that the district court erred in denying him permission to appeal IFP because he has been allowed to appeal IFP in the past and his status has not changed. He does not address the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith, nor does he address any of the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>sion. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, his challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Additionally, Johnson has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">This dismissal counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
