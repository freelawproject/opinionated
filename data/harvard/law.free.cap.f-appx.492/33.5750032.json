Because we agree with the district court that Hogan\u2019s claim is barred by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-23\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b55-24\">The relevant facts of this case are undisputed. The United States Post Office branch in Lake Park, Georgia (Post Office) provides twenty-four hour access to post office boxes in its facility. Access is provided to customers even when the Post Office service counter is closed and even when no Post Office employees are on duty. Hogan receives his mail at a post office box in the Post Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-25\">On Saturday, March 28, 2009 Hogan went to the Post Office at around 8:00 p.m. to check his mail. It was raining at the time, and as Hogan stepped through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>entryway into the Post Office lobby, he immediately slipped and fell due to water that had accumulated on the lobby floor. As a result of his fall, Hogan injured his back, hip, and jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Hogan filed suit against the United States under the FTCA in the Middle District of Georgia, alleging that the Post Office should have been aware of the dangerous condition presented by slippery floors and should have taken precautionary measures to ensure that the Post Office remained safe. The United States moved for summary judgment, arguing that on the facts alleged, the Post Office was not negligent under Georgia law. The United States then filed an amended motion for summary judgment, asserting that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the complaint because the Post Office\u2019s decision to maintain a twenty-four hour access facility fell within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA. The district court granted the amended motion for summary judgment, rendering moot the arguments about Georgia law on negligence made on behalf of the Post Office in the original motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">We address one issue: whether the discretionary function exception to the FTCA bars Hogan\u2019s suit against the United States. By arguing that Hogan\u2019s claim is governed by the discretionary function exception, the United States factually attacks our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>U.S. Aviation Underwriters, Inc. v. United States, </em>562 F.3d 1297, 1299 (11th Cir.2009). Our review of factual attacks on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is <em>de novo. Id. </em>We also review the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u201cThe United States cannot be sued except as it consents to be sued.\u201d <em>Powers v. United States, </em>996 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1993). Congress, through the FTCA, waived the sovereign immunity of the United States in certain limited circumstances, and gave the federal district courts jurisdiction over certain tort actions against the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b); <em>Powers, </em>996 F.2d at 1124. Exempted from this limited waiver of sovereign immunity, however, is \u201c[a]ny claim ... based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a). \u201cThe discretionary function exception is intended to prevent the courts from second-guessing administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, or political policy through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d <em>Aviation Underwriters, </em>562 F.3d at 1299 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">A precise definition of \u201cdiscretionary\u201d for purposes of applying the discretionary function exception does not exist. <em>Id. </em>Instead, in determining whether the discretionary function exception applies, courts administer a two-part test. <em>See United States v. Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 322, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 1273, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">First, the court must examine whether the challenged conduct is discretionary in nature or whether the conduct involves an element of judgment or choice. Second, the court must decide whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield, <em>i.e. </em>whether it is susceptible to policy analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\"><em>Aviation Underwriters, </em>562 F.3d at 1299 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA function is non-discretionary if a federal statute, regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>lation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow where the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201cBefore we address whether the government\u2019s conduct violated a mandatory regulation or policy, we must determine exactly what conduct is at issue.\u201d <em>Autery v. United States, </em>992 F.2d 1523, 1527 (11th Cir. 1993). Hogan argues that \u201c[t]he conduct at issue in this case is the following of the safety procedures [related to cleanup of wet floors] in the Post Office.\u201d The government, on the other hand, contends that \u201cthe [conduct] at issue ... [is] whether to allow twenty-four hour access to post offices [sic] boxes, and under what conditions. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In deciding what conduct is at issue here, a review of the facts and holding of <em>Autery </em>is instructive. In that case, Roy Autery was killed and Charlotte Schreiner was injured when a tree fell on their car as they drove through Great Smokey Mountain National Park (GSMNP). <em>Autery, </em>992 F.2d at 1524. Autery\u2019s estate and Schreiner (the plaintiffs) brought a negligence action against the United States under the FTCA. <em>Id. </em>After a bench trial, the district court entered judgment for the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>The government appealed, and we reversed. In pertinent part, we took issue with the plaintiffs\u2019 and the district court\u2019s description of the \u201cconduct at issue\u201d as \u201cthe park\u2019s failure to carry out the mandates of its then existing policy of identifying and eliminating known hazardous trees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1527. This focus was \u201ctoo narrow,\u201d we said. <em>Id. </em>We went on to clarify that it is \u201cthe governing administrative policy ... that determines whether certain conduct is mandatory for purposes of the discretionary function exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1528. Because no statutes, regulations or administrative policies mandated that the Park Service inspect for hazardous trees in a specific manner, the Park Service\u2019s decision to employ a particular inspection procedure was necessarily made pursuant to the grant of discretion given to the Secretary of the Interior \u201cto provide ... for the destruction of plant life as may be detrimental to the use of the national parks,\u201d pursuant to 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted). Thus the conduct at issue was the Park Service\u2019s \u201cdiscretion to design and implement a policy for evaluating and removing trees from GSMNP,\u201d not its failure to carry out the mandates of its then existing policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">As in <em>Autery, </em>Hogan\u2019s characterization of the conduct here is too narrow. Relying entirely on provisions in the United States Postal Service Maintenance Handbook MS-10 regarding cleanup of wet floors, Hogan argues that Post Office employees had no judgment or choice but to prevent the accumulation of water in the entryway, and therefore the conduct at issue is the Post Office\u2019s failure to follow these provisions. In support of his argument, Hogan notes that \u201c[t]here is no exception in the handbook for conditions that arise after normal business hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Even if there is no exception set out in the handbook, however, neither is there an express statement that .the provisions in the handbook <em>do </em>apply after business hours. Lacking a statute, regulation, or administrative policy mandating cleanup of accumulated water after normal business hours, the existence (or nonexistence) of a procedure for after-hours water cleanup was made pursuant to the local postmaster\u2019s discretion to keep the Post Office lobby open to the public after hours. <em>See </em>Postal Operations Manual (POM) \u00a7 126.44 (July 2002) (\u201cAt the postmaster\u2019s discretion, when no one is on duty, lobbies may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>remain open to allow customers access to Post Office boxes and self-service equipment, provided that customer safety, security provisions, and police protection are deemed adequate by the Inspection Service.\u201d)- Thus, under <em>Autery, </em>the \u201cgoverning administrative policy\u201d and \u201cconduct at issue\u201d here is the postmaster\u2019s decision to maintain twenty-four hour customer access to the Post Office lobby and the decision to maintain certain safety procedures in connection with that twenty-four hour access. <em>See Autery, </em>992 F.2d at 1527-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Having identified the conduct at issue as the postmaster\u2019s discretion to maintain twenty-four hour customer access to the Post Office lobby, the remaining question in Hogan\u2019s appeal is straightforward. Under the first prong of the two-prong test for determining if the discretionary function exception applies, \u201cthe court must examine whether the challenged conduct is discretionary in nature or whether the conduct involves an element of judgment or choice.\u201d <em>Aviation Underwriters, </em>562 F.3d at 1299 (quotation marks omitted). As interpreted by this Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">Under the first part of the test, the relevant inquiry is whether the controlling statute or regulation mandates that a government agent perform his or her function in a specific manner.... Only if a federal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action embodying a <em>fixed or readily ascertainable standard, </em>will a government employee\u2019s conduct not fall within the discretionary function exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\"><em>Hughes v. United States, </em>110 F.3d 765, 768 (11th Cir.1997) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The controlling regulation here is POM \u00a7 126.44, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]t the postmaster\u2019s discretion, when no one is on duty, lobbies may remain open to allow customers access to Post Office boxes and self-service equipment, provided that customer safety, security provisions, and police protection are deemed adequate by the Inspection Service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrary to Hogan\u2019s argument, nothing about POM \u00a7 126.44 suggests that it mandates the specific procedures for wet floor maintenance contained in the Postal Service Maintenance Handbook. Therefore a decision, if any, to mandate procedures for after hours water cleanup in the Post Office lobby is \u201cdiscretionary\u201d within the meaning of the discretionary function exception and the first prong of the discretionary function exception test is satisfied. <em>Cf. Hughes, </em>110 F.3d at 768 (interpreting POM \u00a7 126.44\u2019s nearly identical predecessor to determine that its \u201cgeneral guidelines do not mandate a specific course of conduct regarding security at a post office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">The second prong of the discretionary function exception test requires us to \u201cdecide whether [the] judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield, <em>i.e. </em>whether it is susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d <em>Aviation Underwriters, </em>562 F.3d at 1299 (quotation marks omitted). In his brief Hogan expressly disavowed a \u201cneed to address the second part of the test.\u201d Issues not briefed on appeal are deemed abandoned. <em>Denney v. City of Albany, </em>247 F.3d 1172, 1182 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, we decline to decide this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s determination that Hogan\u2019s claim was barred by the discretionary function exception to the FTCA is</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
