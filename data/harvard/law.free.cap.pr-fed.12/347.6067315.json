As to the remaining prayer of the complaint in its said bill, this court declined to issue an injunction. With respect to packages coming to the Island of Porto Rico for the said complainant from any point in the United States, each and all of the defendants and their servants, employees, and agents are enjoined and restrained hereby from enforcing or attempting to enforce against the said complainant any of the provisions of the said statute hereinbefore mentioned as amended, as long as the articles so brought to Porto Rico remain in their original package or packages; likewise the defendants, each and all of them, and all persons under their authority, arc hereby enjoined until the further order of this court from collecting or attempting to collect, from the complainant any tax of any kind on any of such articles as long as such articles remain in tlieir original package or packages, and likewise from causing any embargo or attachment to issue as against such original packages, and they are also enjoined from withholding or in any manner whatsoever interfering with the property or business of the said complainant under the pretext of collecting or attempting to collect from the complainant any tax on any of the said articles, as long as the same remain in the original package or packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>It is further affirmatively ordered that the said Treasurer of Porto Pico and bis assistant shall \u00e1t once release and discharge any embargo and attachment which may have been hitherto placed upon any of said original packages, either by them directly or through any agent or employee of theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">This injunction, however, shall not be in force unless the complainant shall give a bond in favor of the Treasurer of Porto Pico in favor of Jos\u00e9 E.
