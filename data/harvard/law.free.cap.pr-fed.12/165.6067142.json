It certainly cannot be law that a party can recover the land and also keep what has been paid as interest. That cannot be true, whichever way the suit may be. Land and what is damages for detention plus keeping, <em>also </em>the interest, \u2014 that cannot be right. I am not quite sure whether this is the exact way to get at it or not, whether taxes must be offset against the damages or the rental value. I do not think it can be set off against the land, because one has nothing to do with the other. They are two separate classes -of claims. You can set off money against money, and I suppose you could set off land against land, if that case ever comes up.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The demurrer is sustained to the extent that the recovery of taxes will be limited, in the first place, by the consent of parties, to what has been paid during the tenancy of the present owner; in the second place, whatever that may be will be set off against the rents and profits only, damages for detention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and net against tbe laud. To that extent it is sustained; otherwise overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">I might add to that, so far as sovereignty can be considered as involved, I take it that when a party, even a sovereign, comes into a court, whether originally or by setting np an answer or other defense, he does the one or the other subject to everything that is involved in the litigation. He cannot come into a court half way. He has got to come clean in the door or ho does not come in at all. So I do not think the defense of sovereignty will apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
