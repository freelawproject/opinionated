In support of this contention counsel for the defendant cites \u00a7 97, page 295, of Clark\u2019s Criminal Procedure, 2d ed. But when we turn to page- 296 of the same book we find that in indictments for misdemeanors there is not required the same strictness with respect to the repetition of time and place as there is in cases of felony. The offense of which the defendant in the present indictment is accused being a misdemeanor, and not a felony, the court overrules the demurrer filed by counsel for said defendant, and directs that the defendant plead to the indictment on Saturday, January 14, 1922,. at 9 a. m. To this ruling counsel.for defendant excepts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
