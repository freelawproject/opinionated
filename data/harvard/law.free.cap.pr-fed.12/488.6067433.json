Tbe language of \u00a7 65 makes it a felony if any person shall <em>forcibly </em>assault, resist, oppose, prevent, impede, or interfere with any officer of the customs or of the internal revenue, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Tbis indictment charges that tbis defendant did wilfully, knowingly, unlawfully and feloniously resist, oppose, impede, and interfere with a certain customs inspector, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Tbis court cannot say that a charge of wilfully, or knowingly, or unlawfully, or feloniously interfering with a customs inspector is indictable, taken in connection with tbe plain, clear language of \u00a7 65. Tbe absence of tbe adverb \u201cforcibly\u201d from tbe indictment and tbe presence of said adverb \u201cforcibly\u201d in tbe law obliges me to grant tbe motion of counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Done and Ordered in open court tbis 1st day of December,. 1922.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
