But in considering'the forum which shall grant a hearing to the said widow, Maria Mata, it is only fair to take into consideration the matter of costs and expenses to the parties litigant. This present controversy involves property of so large a value that the case will probably ultimately go to the circuit court of appeals at Boston in any event, and it is only fair to take into consideration that if the proposed suit shall be filed in the Insular court at ITumacao the proceedings will bo in Spanish, and there will be two appeals, one in Spanish to the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, and a second appeal in English to the circuit court of appeals at Boston. It is safe to say that the actual costs of litigation in that form would be five times the amount of costs if the litigation would proceed in the United States district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Eor this reason alone, it is ordered that the proposed suit proceed against the receiver in this court, and, inasmuch as counsel for the receiver has already been served with a copy of the cause of action, it is now ordered that the receiver do answer the same on or before the 2d day of January, 1922.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
