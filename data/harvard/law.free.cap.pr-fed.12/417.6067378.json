The court holds that this ground is not sufficient to deny the writ, because of an act of the Porto Pico legislature, which has been relied upon by the petitioner and which confers certain rights upon him aside from the formal issuance of the usual license.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The supplemental answer then goes on and sets forth that under tho National Prohibition Act the issuance of all permits is in the hands of the National Prohibition Commissioner at Washington, and that the only power that the respondent in his capacity of National Prohibition Director of Porto Pico has is to recommend to said Commissioner at Washington the granting of such permit, and that the issuance thereof is in the discretion of said Prohibition Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">It is also alleged and not denied that tho respondent herein has, as prohibition director, made a thorough examination and investigation with respect to this application by the petitioner, and believes that on account of the circumstances of the caso and the character of the petitioner, the privileges which would be conferred by tbe permit would be abused, and this is based upon tbe allegation that when said petitioner had a permit heretofore he violated the law, and the respondent states, under oath, that lie has every reason to believe that the petitioner would do so again.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">This court is of the opinion that it has the power to control the actions of the prohibition director only in such cases which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>plainly show that his action is arbitrary, unreasonable, and actually deprives a petitioner of a right to which such petitioner is clearly entitled. The writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy. No court should grant a writ of mandamus unless the right of applicant therefor is clearly shown. This court is convinced that if the writ of mandamus were to issue in this case it would bo error in view of the supplemental answer of the respondent, duly verified, which has in no way been denied by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">For these reasons the proceedings in mandamus are dismissed and the petitioner will pay the cost of same.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
