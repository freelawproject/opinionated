As a result the plaintiff claims sundry damages. The demurrer sets up several alleged defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">1. The jurisdiction of this court seems to be wider than that of Federal courts in the States, in that under \u00a7 41 of the Jones Act it embraces litigation where the party on either sido is a foreigner and not domiciled in Porto Pico. It would seem, that, as jurisdiction is not presumed, the plaintiff should allege this lack of domicil. Complaint at bar does not seem to do so, and the first ground of demurrer must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">2.' Acts arising under \u00a7 1803 of the Civil Code as to' fault or negligence are barred in one year under \u00a7 1869. The complaint, however, does not seem to be drawn under \u00a7 1803. It does not allege fault or negligence, but a direct breach of a contract. The prescription referred to, therefore, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">3. The demurrer further sets out that the itemized bill annexed to the complaint makes two claims of $2,000 for the same injury, and that if one of these is struck out the suit falls below the jurisdictional amount of $3,000. Allegation \u201cG\u201d is \u201cdamage to credit suffered by reason of plain!iff not being-able to return money loaned from Roman Tembleg and Tembleg refusing further business with plaintiff,\u201d this being estimated at $2,000. Allegation \u201cII\u201d is \u201cdamage suffered by plaintiff in his business by reason of the loss of assistance in a financial way of Roman Tembleg, and due to the loss thereof not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>able to increase and develop bis business,\u201d also estimated at $2,000. Stating it in different language, tbe first allegation would seem to be damage to plaintiff\u2019s existing credit from inability to return Tembleg\u2019s loan and bis refusing further business, and tbe second to bo inability of plaintiff, due to loss of Tembleg\u2019s assistance, to increase business in future. The one injury therefore relates to existing business and tbe other to future business, which might constitute two different elements of damage, even though stated at $2,000 in each case. A more serious question would be whether the damage to future business is a proper subject of recovery in a law suit. \"Where there is a direct contract or enterprise outstanding of scope which can be determined in money, the law allows damage's. If the enterprise in question depends upon the state of the* market, questions of war and peace, climate, enterprise and health of the party himself, it becomes too indefinite to\u2019 be a subject of legal recovery. What was the fact in the case at bar is not stated in the complaint, and the demurrer, therefore* will have to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The demurrer is sustained, therefore, on the first and third grounds and overruled on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
