G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(a). On appeal, she claims that the judge erred (1) in denying her motion for a required finding of not guilty; (2) in admitting hearsay and opinion evidence; and (3) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>basing the defendant\u2019s sentence on improper considerations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that she was entitled to a required finding of not guilty, we conclude that the introduction over objection of hearsay questions which indicated the defendant was the seller of the drugs requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Officer William Duggan of the Boston police department was the sole witness at trial. Based on his testimony, the jury were warranted in finding the following facts. On May 1, 1995, Duggan and Sergeant Aldrich, in an unmarked police car and dressed in plain clothes, set up an observation post to watch a \u201cheroin house\u201d on Norfolk Avenue in Roxbury. Duggan had previously made undercover drug purchases at the house. In the early afternoon of May 1, 1995, the officers saw, with the aid of binoculars, a woman in a tan Ford automobile park on Norfolk Avenue approximately 100 yards from their post. Some fifteen minutes later, a Chevrolet Camaro driven by the defendant parked behind the Ford. The defendant was known to Duggan. Seconds after the Camaro appeared, the woman in the Ford signalled with her tail lights and then drove toward Marshfield Street. The defendant followed in the Camaro as did the officers in their car. The Ford and the Camaro stopped approximately one block from the location where the automobiles had originally met on Norfolk Avenue. The defendant left the Camaro and approached the driver\u2019s side of the Ford. Although Duggan did not see anything in the defendant\u2019s hands, he saw her reach inside the driver\u2019s window of the Ford, remove her hand, and proceed back to the Camaro. She was at the driver\u2019s door of the Ford for no more than fifteen seconds. Thereafter both cars drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The officers followed and stopped the Ford. Duggan approached the driver, one April Miller, informed her of her rights, described what he had just observed, and asked her whether she was willing to cooperate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereupon, Miller reached into her bra and removed a plastic bag containing a white powder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>substance which was later determined to be cocaine. After additional questioning of Miller \u2014 she did not refuse to answer any questions \u2014 Duggan informed her that he would charge her with possession of a class B controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The next day a complaint was lodged against the defendant charging her with distribution of a class B controlled substance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">1. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>\u201cIn considering whether a denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty is proper, we must consider whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, . . . any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 648 (1997). In some instances, the facts are not susceptible of proof by direct evidence and resort must be had by inference from all the facts and circumstances at trial. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, this is not a case like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Senati, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 306 (1975), where the evidence was \u201cinconclusive both as to the passage of [the] drug and as to the direction of any such passage.\u201d The following findings and inferences were warranted. The defendant had a planned rendezvous with the driver of the Ford, the location was a street containing a \u201cheroin house\u201d where Duggan had previously purchased drugs. After the driver of the Ford signalled, the two cars did not remain at the location but drove one block away from Norfolk Avenue to reduce the chances of detection. The defendant approached the Ford, reached into it with her arm and left within fifteen seconds. Both cars attempted to leave. When the driver of the Ford was stopped and informed of the police observations, she answered all questions and produced from her bra a plastic bag containing cocaine. Although the officer did not see an exchange or what was transferred, the reaching into the Ford by the defendant in the circumstances of the purposeful meeting, the drive to another location, and the exceedingly brief interval of the encounter, coupled with the production of the packet of cocaine from Miller\u2019s bra, tended to show that there was at least a transfer, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>not a hand-to-hand exchange. On these facts, the jury could properly infer that this was a drug transaction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Small quantities of drugs are easily concealed, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>426 Mass. 703, 710 (1998), and in certain situations, an illegal drug transaction may be inferred from other circumstances even if what is transferred is not actually seen. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savageau, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 518, 519 (1997). Although the <em>Kennedy </em>case involved probable cause to arrest, and not, as here, a conviction, we consider the reasonable inferences from the evidence in this case sufficiently strong so as not to require the officer to have seen the actual transfer of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that even if there were sufficient evidence to indicate that a drug transaction had taken place, the evidence was such that it was equally likely that the defendant was the purchaser as that she was the seller. Here, unlike the cases of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Senati, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. at 306; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 997, 998 (1982); and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 537, 539 (1990), where it could not reasonably be determined who was the buyer or who was the seller, the jury were warranted in finding that the packet of cocaine produced from Miller\u2019s bra almost immediately after her encounter with the defendant, and as a consequence of her discussion with Duggan, came from the defendant, and that Miller had been the buyer. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>419 Mass. 366, 376 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Although it is conceivable that Miller was the seller and remained with a single additional packet of cocaine in her bra after a sale to the defendant, the finder of fact in the circumstances could reasonably conclude that that scenario was less likely and that it was more probable that the single packet in her bra was obtained by her as buyer. The Commonwealth in proving its case need not exclude every hypothesis. The inference that the defendant sold the drags \u201cneed not be necessary or inescapable so long as it is reasonable and possible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. 375, 380 (1992). The Commonwealth must \u201cpresent evidence from which a finder may [without speculation] infer the essential facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 262 (1997). It has met that burden here. The record supports a finding by the jury of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>2. <em>Hearsay testimony of Officer Duggan. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, Duggan was permitted to testify that in questioning Miller, he had asked her how she had communicated with the defendant, the phone number she had called, who had answered the phone, whether there had been a beeper, why she had met the defendant on Norfolk Avenue, and what she had paid for the drugs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The defendant argues that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay and was prejudicial because it indicated to the jury that a drag transaction had just taken place and that the defendant was the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Duggan\u2019s series of extrajudicial statements or questions to. Miller were hearsay and subject to exclusion, unless offered and admitted for purposes other than their truth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 555 n.2 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The Commonwealth seeks to justify the admission of these questions as being offered not for their truth but to establish the state of Duggan\u2019s knowledge which led him to the defendant. It is true that policemen or other investigators may explain what they did in consequence of conversations with others. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordle, </em>404 Mass. 733, 743-744 (1989). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 554, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 947, 948 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. 644, 659 (1972). \u201cThe reason for this rale, which is one of long standing, is that such testimony makes the discovery of the actual evidence of identity seem more natural and less mysterious.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, supra </em>at 554 (internal citations omitted). As pointed out in that case, <em>supra </em>at 555, and by the commentators, the specific details are seldom needed and present the likelihood of serious prejudice. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 249, at 104 (4th ed. 1992); Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, Modern Evidence \u00a7 8.18, at 1101-1102 (1995). \u201cFor this reason a statement that an officer acted \u2018upon information received,\u2019 or \u2018as a consequence of a conversation,\u2019 or words to that effect \u2014 without further detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u2014 satisfy the purpose of explaining police conduct.\u201d <em>Perez, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 555 (citations omitted). See <em>Cordle, </em>404 Mass. at 743. While in some instances the admission of the statements themselves has not been found to be error, in those cases the statements were either of greater materiality, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaVelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 156-157 (1993),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or were of little prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>412 Mass. at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Here, the statements were not only highly damaging, they were unneeded \u2014 there was no mystery as to the defendant\u2019s identity; she was known to the police. Moreover, there was no testimony to connect the questions with the subsequent charging of the defendant. Duggan testified that when he finished getting the information from Miller, \u201cshe was allowed to leave at that point. Sergeant Aldrich and I returned to the station to fill out the reports and log in the bag of cocaine.\u201d In these circumstances, where the evidence was highly prejudicial and only of marginal relevance to Duggan\u2019s actions, we conclude there was an \u201cactive danger that a jury could misuse the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>409 Mass. 461, 469 (1991). \u201c[I]ts prejudicial impact far outweigh[ed] its relevance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Demars, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 598 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urena, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 22 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">3. <em>Duggan\u2019s opinion testimony. </em>At trial, when asked why he stopped Miller, Duggan testified that he stopped her \u201cin the belief that she had just purchased cocaine.\u201d There was no objection to this testimony. The Commonwealth properly concedes that the testimony was improper. \u201cAn expert may not. . . offer an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>419 Mass. 366, 375 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 555 (1995). While it is unlikely that this evidence alone created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, see <em>Woods, </em>supra at 376 (improper testimony only slightly beyond the opinion evidence which would have been admissible, namely that the activities were consistent with drug dealing), we need not reach the issue in view of our conclusion in part 2, <em>supra, </em>of this opinion. In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>event, if there is a retrial, the officer\u2019s opinion should be limited as required.'</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The remaining issues raised by the defendant are unlikely to arise on retrial, and are, in any event, withoht merit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Since the evidence in this case that the defendant was the seller was not overwhelming, and since, we are persuaded that the error described in part 2, <em>supra, </em>was sufficiently significant in the context of the trial to make plausible an inference that the result might have been otherwise but for the error, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Demars, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 599, we conclude that the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed. Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-16\">See part 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The defendant was sentenced to two years in the Suffolk County house of correction, one year to be served, the balance suspended for two years until September 23, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\">After Duggan testified that he asked if she was willing to cooperate, he added, \u201cAt that point, she . . . The defendant objected and her objection was sustained. The next question to the officer was: \u201cAfter you asked her if she was willing to cooperate with you, what happened?\u201d The answer to this second question was: \u201cShe reached into her bra, and handed me one plastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>bag, containing what I believed to be cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOv\">As there was no objection to the second question, it would appear that the objection was directed to the characterization of Ms. Miller\u2019s response and not to the fact that the officer asked Ms. Miller whether she would cooperate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">The defendant was also charged with conspiracy to violate the controlled substance law, but this charge was dismissed at the request of the Commonwealth with the consent of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Duggan also testified that he had asked Miller how many times she had bought drugs from the defendant prior to the May 1, 1995, occasion. The judge sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to this question, ordered that it be struck from the record, and told the jury to \u201ctotally disregard\u201d the testimony and draw no inference that \u201cthere was any prior activity whatsoever between the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>361 Mass. at 658-659. In that case a witness was permitted to testify that a number of drug users and pushers had mentioned the defendant\u2019s name. It was held that the testimony was material and admissible for the limited purpose of showing, as against a defense of entrapment, that the inducement by the police of the defendant was not shocking and offensive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the prosecutor did not go beyond the judge\u2019s pretrial rulings except in a single case of an inadvertent fleeting reference. The claim of an improper basis of sentencing is disposed of by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 610 (1985), where the court held that it was not enough to show that the judge accepted the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, as there was nothing in the record (as there is nothing here) which indicated that the judge accepted the prosecutor\u2019s reasoning behind those recommendations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
