The victims, Maria Acuna and her son Israel Rodriguez, are Mexican-American. The defendant is predominately African-American. During the incident, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>defendant allegedly threatened to kill Acuna and Rodriguez, calling them, among other things, \u201cdamn Mexicans\u201d and telling them to \u201cGet out of here.\u201d After trial, a jury convicted the defendant of two counts of assault or battery for the purpose of intimidation, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39, and two counts of threatening to commit a crime, G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial judge erred in (1) denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the two counts of assault or battery for the purpose of intimidation; (2) improperly instructing the jury on intent; and (3) denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Taking the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the incident unfolded as follows. In the early evening of September 21, 1995, Maria Acuna (Acuna) was working at her computer on the second floor of her home in Lexington, where she had been living with her son, Israel Rodriguez (Rodriguez), since May, 1995. The defendant was next door at his sister\u2019s house babysitting his niece. Acuna heard a loud noise, like someone banging or shaking a wooden fence, looked out her window, and saw the defendant trying to enter her back yard to retrieve his niece\u2019s ball. Concerned that the defendant was going to break her fence, Acuna called through the window to the defendant to please not trespass, and that she would come downstairs to help him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The defendant shouted, \u201cYou bitch, I just came to pick up my ball.\u201d Acuna went downstairs and walked into her backyard, and observed that the defendant had entered her yard, and was turning to leave. As the defendant left her yard, he repeatedly called her a \u201cbitch\u201d and told her that she could keep the ball the next time. Acuna walked towards the fence to latch the gate and the defendant said: \u201cYou bitch. You don\u2019t fit here. What are you doing here, you damn Mexican. Why don\u2019t you go back to your country? All of you come and get our jobs and our houses. Get out of here. You don\u2019t fit here. I\u2019ll kill you and your son.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">While standing next to the fence shouting at Acuna, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>defendant thrust his fist towards her face so that she \u201ccould almost feel the hit of his fist\u201d in her nose and face. The defendant then threw his fingers in a forking motion toward her, coming to within an inch of her eyes. The defendant was yelling at Acuna so loudly that Rodriguez awoke from his nap and came outside to the backyard. Rodriguez testified that he could hear the defendant shouting \u201cfuck,\u201d \u201cshit,\u201d and \u201cMexican,\u201d \u201cGet the hell out of the country,\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d and \u201cMexicans don\u2019t belong here\u201d at his mother. He pulled his mother away from the fence and demanded to know from the defendant what was going on. The defendant now attempted to hit Rodriguez with his fists, from the other side of the fence, rattling the gate, trying to enter the backyard, and saying: \u201cYou little shit. Come up here. I\u2019m going to take the fucking shit out of you and your mother together. I will beat you both to death.\u201d The defendant continued saying, \u201cDamn Mexicans. What are you doing here?\u201d Acuna and Rodriguez both testified that they felt afraid and threatened by the defendant\u2019s rage and determination to hit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At the time of the incident, the defendant\u2019s neighbor, Michael Townes, was barbecuing in his backyard, approximately twenty feet away. Townes heard the defendant yell at Acuna and Rodriguez \u201cYou should go back to where you\u2019re from,\u201d and refer to \u201cwhupping\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s ass. Townes came over and, smelling alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath, told the defendant to \u201cLet it go\u201d and to go home and \u201csleep it off.\u201d Townes put his hands on the defendant and led him away. Rodriguez went inside and, after calling Townes to express his gratitude, called. the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Officer Paul Callahan responded to the call and arrived at Acuna\u2019s residence to find her and her son visibly upset. Callahan filed an incident report and tried, unsuccessfully, to locate the defendant. The next day, Detective Charles Mercer returned to the neighborhood and interviewed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In response to the detective\u2019s questions, the defendant asserted that he entered the yard to retrieve the ball only after knocking on the fence and not receiving a response, that Acuna had appeared and yelled at him for not going around to ring the bell, and that he did not swear at or threaten Acuna. Nonetheless, the defendant did admit that he had said that Acuna should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cgo back to where she came from,\u201d but claims to have said it to his neighbor Townes, not directly to Acuna.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">1. <em>Motion for required finding of not guilty. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the two counts of assault or battery for the purpose of intimidation. The defendant claims that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence that he acted \u201cfor the purpose of intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case, we must \u201cconsider and determine whether the evidence, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient... to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979) (citations omitted). The evidence and the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom must be of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 39, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 165, \u00a7 1, is a so-called \u201chate crime\u201d statute. It provides that \u201c[w]hoever commits an assault or a battery upon a person . . . for the purpose of intimidation because of said person\u2019s race, color, religion, or national origin, shall be punished . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As instructed by the trial judge, the essential elements of the crime are (1) the commission of an assault or battery (2) with the intent to intimidate (3) because of a person\u2019s race, color, religion, or national origin. In general, a hate crime is \u201ca crime in which the defendant\u2019s conduct was motivated by hatred, bias, or prejudice, based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation of another individual or group of individuals.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 709 n.5 (1995). Thus, hate crime laws such as G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39, operate to \u201cenhance the penalty of criminal conduct when it is motivated by racial hatred or bigotry.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is not the conduct but the underlying motivation that distinguishes the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Here, the defendant was convicted of assaulting the victims for the purpose of intimidation. The intent required by G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 39, was not only that required to establish the underlying assault, i.e., the intent either to cause a battery or to cause apprehension of immediate bodily harm, but also the intent to intimidate because of the victim\u2019s membership in a protected class. The defendant argues that, in order to satisfy the intimidation element, the Commonwealth was required to but did not prove that he had the specific intent to put Acuna and Rodriguez in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The defendant urges us, in construing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39, to employ a definition of \u201cintimidation\u201d that has been used in the context of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11H.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There, the concept of intimidation has been defined as \u201cputting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>417 Mass. 467, 474 (1994). See <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Kervin, </em>41 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We decline this invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 11H, is not a criminal statute. It provides a civil cause of action against those who interfere or attempt to interfere with a person\u2019s constitutional rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion. In the context of c. 12, .\u00a7 11H, intimidation describes the prohibited conduct itself and not any underlying intent. We discern neither reason nor necessity to transplant this definition of intimidation to the hate crime at issue. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1184 (1993), to which this court often resorts in construing criminal statutes, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 762, 767 n.8 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiPietro, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 777 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belete, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 425-426 (1994), defines the verb intimidate as \u201cto make timid or fearful: inspire or affect with fear.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 926 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 233, 235 (1998). This straightforward definition of intimidation is all that we think is meant in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The defendant next argues that, if intimidation does not mean to compel or deter the victim\u2019s conduct but simply means to put the victims in fear, the intimidation element of the hate crime becomes redundant of the intent requirement of the underlying assault. The intent requirement of the underlying assault, namely, the intent to cause a battery or to cause apprehension of an imminent battery, would not, however, standing alone, be sufficient to satisfy the intimidation element of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39. The latter is satisfied only by establishing that the defendant had the specific intent to put his victims in fear because of their membership in a protected class, not simply the intent to put them in fear of an imminent battery. There is no redundancy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">At trial, Acuna and Rodriguez both testified that, throughout the altercation that gave rise to this case, the defendant repeatedly called them \u201cdamn Mexicans,\u201d and demanded that they \u201c[g]et out of here.\u201d Acuna testified that the defendant verbally attacked her, saying that she should go back to her country and that he would kill her and her son. Rodriguez testified that the defendant told him that he was going to beat up Rodriguez and his \u201cbitchy\u201d mother. Both Acuna and Rodriguez also testified that they felt threatened by the defendant\u2019s behavior. The Commonwealth presented ample evidence that the defendant assaulted Acuna and Rodriguez with the intent to intimidate them because of their national origin in violation of c. 265, \u00a7 39. A rational trier of fact could find that the defendant\u2019s repetition of the phrase \u201cdamn Mexican,\u201d accompanied by his repeated demand that Acuna and Rodriguez \u201cGet out of here,\u201d demonstrated a purpose of intimidation because of the victims\u2019 national origin. The trial judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>39 Mass App. Ct. at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">2. <em>Jury instructions on intent. </em>The defendant also contends that the trial judge erred in not reading the Model Jury Instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tion on specific intent, as a supplement to the judge\u2019s instructions on the crime of assault or battery for the purpose of intimidation. Although the defendant failed to object to this omission at trial, he now claims that it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">As a general rule, \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retire[] to consider [their] verdict, specifying the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). Nonetheless, an error may be of a type and seriousness which should lead to reversal even in the absence of a proper objection. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563 (1967). The test is whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, i.e., whether there is a substantial risk that the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 652 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury here were brief. The instructions on all six charges against the defendant take up only three pages of trial transcript. Although the judge did not dwell on the subtleties of each element of the crimes charged, he did correctly explain all the necessary elements. The judge explained to the jury, for example, that one of the three elements of assault or battery for the purpose of intimidation is that the defendant acted \u201cfor the purpose of intimidation.\u201d He explained that one of the three elements of threatening another person with a crime is that the defendant communicated \u201can intent to injure . . . now or in the future,\u201d and, with respect to the assault charges, the judge explained to the jury that they must find \u201cthat the defendant intended to commit a battery\u201d or that the defendant \u201cintended to put Maria Acuna or Israel Rodriguez in fear of an imminent battery.\u201d It is not necessary for a judge \u201cto refer to the defendant\u2019s <em>specific </em>intent to do something as an element of a crime. A reference to intent is sufficient.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 301 n.8 (1992) (emphasis in original). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. 259, 268-269 (1998). Although an instruction on specific intent very well might have given the jury better guidance in their deliberations, its omission did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Although the defendant did not request an intoxication instruction at trial, the defendant now argues that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>erred in not instructing the jury on voluntary intoxication where specific intent was at issue. As to intoxication, however, the evidence presented at trial was sparse. Townes, the defendant\u2019s neighbor, testified that as he approached the defendant he noticed a smell of alcohol. Yet, none of the witnesses testified that the defendant either was observed drinking alcohol or appeared to be impaired to any degree by alcohol. Nor did any other witness corroborate the observations of Townes. A voluntary intoxication instruction is not required \u201cwhere the evidence does not suggest a condition of \u2018debilitating intoxication\u2019 that could support a reasonable doubt as to whether [the] defendant was capable of forming the requisite criminal intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 789 (1997). There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in the trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on voluntary intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the trial judge improperly denied his motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel where his trial counsel failed to introduce evidence that his niece, whom he was babysitting at the time of the incident, was partially of Puerto Rican descent. The defendant believes that this information would have negated the discriminatory animus element of his conviction under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39, and, consequently, if introduced at trial, would have led the jury to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cA judge\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a new trial . . . will not be disturbed unless a review of the defendant\u2019s case shows that the decision, if not reversed, will result in \u2018manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>409 Mass. 110, 114 (1991), citing Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). Where, as here, the motion judge was also the trial judge, the decision of the motion judge is entitled to special deference. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 32-33 (1923). Moreover, where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is the basis for the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, appellate courts accord substantial deference to the trial judge\u2019s favorable evaluation of a trial counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeVincent, </em>421 Mass. 64, 69 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that the serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel, i.e., behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ordinary fallible lawyer, likely deprived him of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Thus, in order to have prevailed on his motion for new trial, the defendant would have to have shown that counsel\u2019s decision not to introduce evidence of his niece\u2019s ethnicity was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Adams, 374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The defendant contends that his outburst at Acuna and Rodriguez was motivated by his anger at being called a trespasser and was not motivated by any anti-Mexican sentiment. The defendant believes that the fact that his niece is of Puerto Rican descent demonstrates that he lacks any anti-Hispanic bias or prejudice. The uncontroverted evidence at trial, however, was that the defendant was shouting specifically anti-Mexican slurs at Acuna and Rodriguez, not that he expressed any more generalized anti-Hispanic animus. Moreover, the evidence submitted in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial established merely that the defendant\u2019s niece was of Puerto Rican descent, not that the defendant thought favorably of Puerto Ricans or Hispanics in general.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 661 (1992). The defendant has not demonstrated that counsel\u2019s failure to introduce evidence at trial of the niece\u2019s ethnicity was manifestly unreasonable or that the evidence, if introduced at trial, would have led the jury to a different result. The trial judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The defendant was also convicted of two counts of assault and battery, G.
