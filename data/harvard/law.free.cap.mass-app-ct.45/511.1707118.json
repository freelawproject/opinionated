L. c. 180 and exempt from Federal income tax under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the corporation). The corporation is affiliated with the defendant in this case. The parties have agreed, solely for the purpose of this case, to accept the defendant, Jewish Community Housing for the Elderly (JCHE), as the party legally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In exchange for their services (described below) the plaintiffs were provided with a rent-free apartment including utilities, and were initially paid $25.00 per month for basic telephone service, later increased to $30.00 per month. They received no other compensation. Following the termination of their employment effective June 13, 1994, the plaintiffs brought suit, with a jury claim,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging violations of the Minimum Fair Wage and Overtime Law, G. L. c. 151, \u00a7\u00a7 l<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 1A<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (count I), and the Weekly Payment of Wages Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 (count II). The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on count I. The judge, sua sponte, was of the opinion that the dismissal of count I also disposed of count II. Thereafter a final judgment was entered in favor of the defendant dismissing both counts of the complaint. The plaintiffs have appealed from that final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The Golda Meir House (house) is an apartment building. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>units are leased to individuals and couples over the age of sixty-two who meet certain eligibility standards set by the Federal government. Most residents pay rent equal to thirty percent of their adjusted gross annual income, with the result that those tenants pay below-market rent for their apartments. Eighty percent of the tenants receive so-called \u201cSection 8\u201d rental subsidies from the Federal government. Private charitable contributions subsidize additional health and social programs offered to the residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The mission statement of the defendant states that its basic purpose is to promote, encourage, and support the independence, safety, and security of its residents. To that end the defendant is a provider of \u201cquality of life services.\u201d and an organizer of \u201csupport services.\u201d These include safe and attractive facilities, meals, transportation, and social, cultural, and educational activities as well as home health and nursing care, special clinical diets, and personnel to assist the residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Identical employment agreements were signed by each plaintiff. The agreement recites that the rent-free apartment is the \u201cwork site\u201d for the job and, together with the provision of utilities and basic telephone service, is in exchange for the duties required to be performed. The agreement includes a job description of a \u201csite representative.\u201d The job description sets out the duties to be performed. Each site representative is required to be \u201con call\u201d one hundred twenty-three hours weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The central issue in this controversy is the need to determine the working hours of the plaintiffs for the purpose of applying the minimum wage and overtime provisions of G. L. c. 151. More particularly, the question is: when does \u201con-call\u201d time \u2014 that is to say, time when the site representative is on duty but not actually working \u2014 constitute working time for the purpose of applying the minimum wage and overtime provisions of G. L. c. 151? An agreement to work for less than the minimum wage is unenforceable. G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Since the plaintiffs, who oppose the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, will have the burden of proof at trial, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif [it] demonstrates, by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has <em>no reasonable expectation </em>of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case. To be successful, a moving party need <em>not </em>submit affirmative evidence to <em>negate </em>one or more elements of the other party\u2019s claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). If the moving party makes such a showing, then the party opposing the motion \u2014 here, the plaintiffs \u2014 must \u201crespond by settling] forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>418 Mass. 394, 397 (1994). If the moving party makes the demonstration required by <em>Kourouvacilis, </em>and the party opposing the motion does not meet that showing, the moving party will also have satisfied its obligation to demonstrate \u201cthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact on every relevant issue . . . .\u201d <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc., </em>426 Mass. 122, 127 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">With that standard in mind, we review the submissions of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\"><em>The defendant\u2019s submissions. </em>1. The employment agreement (described above) includes a job description which states that the \u201c[h]ours of Site-Rep. duty are as follows[:] . . . Monday through Thursday \u2014 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. . . . Friday through Monday \u2014 5:00 p.m. Friday eve. to 8:00 a.m. Monday morning,\u201d and a full day of duty on Jewish and legal holidays as specified by management. Holidays aside, the job description required each plaintiff to be on call one hundred twenty-three hours weekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The duties of a site representative, as stated in the job description and a handbook for site representatives, include the following: regular security rounds of the facility are to be maintained, and miscellaneous housekeeping tasks are to be performed regularly, such as monitoring and changing trash containers, and cleaning up the results of accidental spills. A log, or incident report, of all maintenance and social problems and other events which occur during duty hours is to be maintained. The overarching duty is to \u201c[r]espond[] immediately to resident emergency call[s] or alarms [and to] [c]all[] emergency medical help as needed.\u201d Also included is the need to \u201c[r]espond[] to <em>ALL </em>resident calls to determine the nature of said call.\u201d \u201cSite Representatives ... are responsible for supplying reasonable and courteous service to our residents in every situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The job description also includes the following, to which the plaintiffs subscribed: \u201cI understand that when I am on duty as a JCHE Site Representative <em>I may be required to perform services for the entire length of my shift </em>if situations arise to warrant so\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">2. The plaintiffs maintained a log of each call received from a resident. In the year 1993, for example, by which time the plaintiffs were familiar to the residents, the log showed ninety calls over the twelve months, or an average of 1.73 calls per week.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no record kept of the time needed to respond to the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">3. Excerpts from the deposition of the plaintiff Vered Dagan, which consist only of nine pages, include Vered\u2019s (Aviad Dagan\u2019s wife) testimony that weekday nightly rounds were \u201cnever\u201d performed by both plaintiffs together; that the rounds were performed twice a night \u2014 at 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. \u2014 and required about \u201c15 to 20 minutes . . . walking fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">4. Excerpts from the deposition of the plaintiff Aviad Dagan, which are more extensive but are frequently disjointed, include the following testimony: Aviad worked Monday through Thursday, during the day, at another job. On Fridays, during the day, there was a period of unknown duration when he and a \u201cpartner\u201d attempted to conduct a business \u2014 never described \u2014 which was \u201cwholesale market to the blind.\u201d The business came to nothing. Aviad made the weekday nightly rounds with considerable care. He did the regular rounds at 8:00 and 10:00 p.m. and a brief round at 5:00 p.m. when he returned from his daytime job. The 5:00 p.m. round took about thirty to forty-five minutes; the 8:00 and 10:00 p.m. rounds took not more than an hour or an hour and a quarter. When he was on call he was either in his apartment or someplace in the building. Either Vered or Aviad responded to calls, depending on who was available at the time of the call. All meals were regularly prepared and eaten in their apartment. While on call the plaintiffs were free to sleep, watch television, listen to the radio, play games on the computer, entertain friends (although done only infrequently), and take care of miscellaneous personal responsibilities such as paying bills and doing laundry.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>The plaintiffs\u2019 submissions. </em>1. The \u201cSite Representative HAND BOOK \u2014 GUIDELINES \u2014 Golda Meir House\u201d states the same on-call hours as appear in the job description. The handbook contains additional information, including the following: \u201cWeekday evening rounds must be done every 2 hours, starting at 6:00 p.m. through 10:00 p.m., unless determined otherwise by Management. When on duty it may be necessary, due to circumstances or as determined by Management, for the site representative on duty to remain \u2018active\u2019 for the entire length of one\u2019s scheduled shift. Additional duties and/or patrols may be required at the sole discretion of the Management.\u201d The handbook continues by describing the manner in which the security rounds are to be executed. The handbook also contains detailed provisions instructing site representatives how to respond to medical emergencies, fire alarms, elevator calls, and calls from the residents, namely, <em>\u201cNEVER </em>argue with the resident. They need compassion, understanding, and reassurance from the staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">2. A document on the stationery of the defendant, captioned \u201cLIVE-INS RESPONSIBILITIES,\u201d which appears to have been prepared for the benefit of the residents, states that \u201cLIVE-INS ARE EXPECTED TO RESPOND TO ALL <em>MEDICAL, SECURITY AND MAINTENANCE </em>EMERGENCY; THEY ARE ON CALL FROM 5:00 p.m. TO 8:00 a.m. ON WEEKDAYS AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WEEKEND AND HOLIDAYS. DURING THESE TIMES THEY <em>ALWAYS REMAIN ON THE PREMISES. </em>... IN THE EVENINGS, THE LIVE-INS ARE <em>ONLY REQUIRED TO STAY AWAKE UNTIL 10:00 p.m. </em>[emphasis added], THEY WILL OF COURSE RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES AT ANY TIME DURING THE NIGHT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">3. A document, captioned \u201cWage Calculation for Live-in Coverage by JCHE Paid Staff,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> states: \u201cLive-in hrs defined as follows: Weekdays: 5 p.m. - 11 p.m. plus 7 a.m. - 8 a.m. = 7 hours[;] Weekend: Fri (5 p.m. - 11 p.m. = 6 hours) + Sat/Sun (7 a.m. - 11 p.m., 2 days, = 16 x 2 = 32 hrs) + Mon (7-8 a.m. = 1 hr) = 39 hours total weekend[.] Full week: 1 Wkend (39 hrs) + 4 Wkdays (28 hrs) = 67 hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We now consider whether the defendant has made the showing required by <em>Kourouvacilis, </em>and if so, whether the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>have met that showing by setting forth facts which demonstrate that there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The essential facts put forward in the defendant\u2019s submission are these: (i) under the provisions of the job description, the on-call hours of a site representative were one hundred twenty-three hours weekly; (ii) during on-call hours, the plaintiffs were required to remain on the premises, subject to the demands of management and the residents; (iii) the plaintiffs\u2019 actual working time consisted of making nightly rounds of the facility, Monday through Friday,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and responding to emergency calls from the residents at the experienced rate of one to two calls weekly; the plaintiffs were subject to calls by the residents and by management for the remainder of the on-call hours; (iv) the plaintiffs\u2019 on-call hours included time the plaintiffs required for sleeping and eating<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; (v) the plaintiffs\u2019 weekday and weekend on-call hours, when not spent making rounds or answering calls from the residents, were available to, and in fact were used by, the plaintiffs for their exclusive, personal benefit, but subject to their remaining on the premises; and (vi) while both plaintiffs signed employment agreements, the site representative position was a \u201cone-person\u201d job, and none of the required tasks were performed by <em>both </em>plaintiffs at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">These facts are not disputed by the plaintiffs\u2019 submissions or by any other material available under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974) (pleadings, answers to interrogatories, etc.), and no additional facts are proffered by the plaintiffs regarding their use of on-call, non-working time other than the defendant\u2019s notice to the residents that the plaintiffs were not to be disturbed after 10:00 p.m. except in the case of an emergency. Given the absence of any contrary showing by the plaintiffs regarding the facts proffered by the defendant, those facts are undisputed. There being no genuine issue as to any material fact, the case is ripe for summary judgment. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c). More particularly, we must decide, as matter of law on the undisputed facts, whether the defendant\u2019s submission sufficiently demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>strates that the plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of establishing their statutory claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The plaintiffs, citing <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 136-137 (1944), and <em>DeCourcey </em>v. <em>Weston Racquet Club, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 373 (1983),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> assert simply that whether, or the extent to which, on-call time is compensable time under the minimum wage law is a question of fact (or a mixed question of law and fact) which must be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">In <em>Skidmore, </em>the Supreme Court considered the question whether on-call time was compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 et seq. (1938) (employees must be compensated at no less than the minimum wage and one and one-half times their regular rate for overtime work). The Court stated that \u201c[w]hether in a concrete case such [on-call] time falls within or without the Act is a question of fact to be resolved by appropriate findings of the trial court.\u201d <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 136-137.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">However, a number of Federal circuit court opinions have held that where the facts are undisputed, <em>Skidmore </em>does not preclude the resolution of the question as matter of law. See <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Houston N.W. Med. Center Survivor, Inc., </em>934 F.2d 671, 674-675 (5th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1036 (1992) (\u201c[T]he undisputed facts show that the on-call time is not working time\u201d; <em>Skidmore </em>distinguished; summary judgment for the defendant affirmed); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ohio Turnpike Commn., </em>968 F.2d 606 (6th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1054 (1993) (summary judgment for the defendant employer affirmed); <em>Birdwell </em>v. <em>Gadsden, Ala., </em>970 F.2d 802, 807-808 (11th Cir. 1992) (\u201cWhether a <em>certain </em>set of facts and circumstances constitute work for purposes of the FLSA is a question of law\u201d [emphasis added]; <em>Skidmore </em>explained); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Local No. 169, Assn. of Western Pulp &amp; Paper Workers, </em>971 F.2d 347, 356 (9th Cir. 1992) (plaintiffs failed to contest or rebut the defendant employer\u2019s proffered evidence, or to present any evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 personal use of on-call time, thereby permitting summary judgment for the defendant). Contrast <em>Cross </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>v. <em>Arkansas Forestry Commn., </em>938 F.2d 912, 916-917 (8th Cir. 1991) (summary judgment for employer reversed where record contained evidence of \u201csignificant interference with . . . employees\u2019 private activities\u201d during \u201csubject-to-call\u201d hours).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Further, <em>DeCourcey </em>does not provide any assistance to the plaintiffs. The case did not come to us on undisputed facts, see <em>DeCourcey, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 374-375, and thus the issue in the instant case was not presented in <em>DeCourcey.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There remains the pivotal question: whether, as a matter of law on the undisputed facts, the plaintiffs\u2019 entire on-call time (one hundred twenty-three hours)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014 i.e., working <em>and </em>waiting, as contrasted with working time only \u2014 constituted working time for purposes of applying the minimum wage and overtime provisions of c. 151. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The central fact of this case is that when not actually engaged in the nightly rounds, or responding to calls from the residents \u2014 a weekly total for both tasks of not more than eighteen and one-quarter hours, see note 14, <em>infra, </em>and related text \u2014 the plaintiffs were at home either sleeping, eating, or pursuing other desired personal or recreational activities which had no connection with \u2014 much less a benefit to \u2014 the defendant. While the plaintiffs\u2019 freedom of movement after 5:00 p.m. on weekday evenings until 8:00 a.m. the following morning, and during the entire weekend beginning at 5:00 p.m. on Friday until 8:00 a.m. on the following Monday, was limited by the requirement that they remain on the corporation\u2019s premises during all on-call hours, the plaintiffs\u2019 home was within those premises and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>was no limitation on the amount of on-call time the plaintiffs could spend at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">There is no Massachusetts appellate decision which bears directly on this case, but numerous Federal cases that arose under die cognate Fair Labor Standards Act support the conclusion reached by the judge. A United States District Court judge recently summarized the Federal case law. Recognizing that on-call time necessarily restricts in some measure the freedom of the employee, the judge wrote, \u201c[E]very case that has addressed this issue, tells us that without some significant additional restriction on the employee\u2019s off-duty [i.e., on-call but nonworking] time, such that the time can be said to have been spent primarily for the employer\u2019s benefit, the time will not be compensable.\u201d <em>Darrah </em>v. <em>Missouri Hy. &amp; Transp. Commn., </em>885 F. Supp. 1307, 1313 (W.D. Mo. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The case before us is similar to <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Hines-Rinaldi Funeral Home, Inc., </em>847 F.2d 147 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 835 (1989), where the facts were undisputed. There the plaintiff was engaged by a funeral home to perform light housekeeping from 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight and 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., six days a week. He was provided a rent-free apartment on the premises of the funeral home, and was required to stay on the premises during the night hours. Between midnight and 6:30 a.m. the plaintiff\u2019s only duty was to answer the telephone, and to go out and pick up a corpse if required. The plaintiff claimed overtime under the FLSA on the theory that he was employed to work from 9:00 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. The Court of Appeals concluded that nighttime interruptions were infrequent, and that the plaintiff was merely required to stay in his own residence during the night hours. In affirming the allowance of a defense motion for summary judgment, the court said, \u201c[I]t is not realistic to assume that [the defendant funeral home] would employ someone for 69 hours per week, thereby incurring large overtime expense, to perform the tasks assigned to [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148. After reviewing the authorities from the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits, the court concluded that the requirement of remaining on the employer\u2019s premises, coupled with infrequent interruptions, do not convert nonworking, on-call hours to compensable working hours. <em>Id. </em>at 148-149.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Also instructive is the recent decision in <em>Brekke </em>v. <em>Blackduck, </em>984 F. Supp. 1209, 1219-1221 (D. Minn. 1997) (\u201c[T]he relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>inquiry focuses upon whether the on-call time \u2018is spent predominantly for the employer\u2019s benefit or for the employee\u2019s\u2019 \u201d [citation omitted]; cases which depart from the general rule of not awarding compensation for on-call time where such time is spent predominantly for the employee\u2019s benefit \u201cdemonstrate . . . exceptional circumstances. . . .\u201d). See <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Houston N.W. Med. Center Survivor, Inc., </em>934 F.2d at 676 (\u201c[e]mployees who have received compensation for idle time generally have had almost no freedom at all\u201d [citation omitted]); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Ohio Turnpike Commn., </em>968 F.2d at 611 (plaintiffs failed to establish \u201csevere restrictions\u201d on the use of on-call time for personal pursuits); <em>Birdwell </em>v. <em>Gadsden, Ala., </em>970 F.2d at 807, 810 (\u201cThe question of whether the employees are working during [on-call] time for purposes of the FLSA depends on the degree to which the employee may use the time for personal activities. . . . [I]t is clear that an employee\u2019s free time must be severely restricted for off-time to be construed as work time for purposes of the FLSA\u201d); <em>Berry </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma, </em>30 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1150 (1995) (identifying seven relevant inquiries in \u201con-call\u201d cases, but emphasizing the question whether the employee is free to engage in personal activities while on-call); <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Division of Youth Rehabilitation Serv., </em>795 F. Supp. 668 (D. Del. 1992); <em>Burnison </em>v. <em>Memorial Hosp., Inc., </em>820 F. Supp. 549, 556 (D. Kan. 1993) (\u201c[T]he undisputed facts show that on-call time is spent primarily for the plaintiffs\u2019 benefit and therefore . . . the Hospital is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for on-call compensation\u201d); <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>ADM Milling Co., </em>827 F. Supp. 472, <em>477 </em>(N.D. I11. 1993) (\u201c[T]he undisputed evidence regarding the degree to which the plaintiffs are free to engage in personal activities while on-call and the agreements between the parties is so one-sided that ADM must prevail as a matter of law\u201d); <em>Lurvey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dade County, </em>870 F. Supp. 1570, 1579 (S.D. Fla. 1994) (\u201c[I]t is clear that an employee\u2019s free time must be <em>severely restricted </em>for [on-call time] to be construed as work time for purposes of the FLSA\u201d [emphasis added; citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We conclude that in the circumstances of this case, the one hundred four and three-quarters hours of weekly non-working, on-call time (one hundred twenty-three hours total on-call time, less eighteen and one-quarter hours of working time) is noncompensable time under G. L. c. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>There remains only the question whether the rent-free apartment effectively provided the plaintiffs with the minimum wage for the hours actually worked. In their complaint, the plaintiffs acknowledge that the value of the apartment was $700.00 per month. This is approximately $162.00 per week, which, at the then-minimum wage of $4.25 per hour, translates to 38.1 hours of paid working time each week.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">As noted above, Aviad testified that the three nightly rounds took him a total of three and one-quarter hours, a total of sixteen and one-quarter hours for five weekday nights. Emergency calls averaged approximately 1.73 calls per week, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>and related text, but no evidence was offered by either party as to the amount of time required to respond to such calls. If we assume a generous two hours per week to respond to telephone calls, the actual working time required by the job and performed by the plaintiffs was approximately eighteen and one-quarter hours weekly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The judge was correct in ruling, as a matter of law, that the plaintiffs \u201ccould not accumulate in any particular week sufficient working time to entitle them to more compensation than they received through their rent-free apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The result is that the plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of establishing their statutory claim,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and summary judgment was properly entered for the defendant on both counts of the complaint.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Since this case comes up on the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the availability of the jury claim has not been briefed or argued. For discussion of the right to a trial by jury, see <em>Dalis </em>v. <em>Buyer Advertising, Inc., </em>418 Mass. 220 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 1, as in effect prior to St. 1995, c. 196, \u00a7 1, in pertinent part read: \u201c[A]n oppressive and unreasonable wage . . . shall be null and void. A wage of less than four dollars and twenty-five cents per hour, in any occupation . . . shall conclusively be presumed to be oppressive and unreasonable . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\">The overtime statute, G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, as appearing in St. 1961, c. 431, provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[N]o employer in the commonwealth shall employ any of his employees ... for a work week longer than forty hours, unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of forty hours at a rate not less that one and one half times the regular rate at which he is employed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\">In response to the defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion was denied by the judge. The correctness of that ruling is not argued on appeal, and the point is waived. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">There is a two-year statute of limitations, G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 20A, regarding suits to recover any underpayment. Therefore, at best, the plaintiffs could recover for the period September 27, 1992 (two years before their complaint was filed), through June 13, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The judge found that, on the basis of the log of all calls during their entire period of employment, October, 1991, to June, 1994, the plaintiffs received \u201ca total of 229 calls . . . ranging from one to 15 calls in a month, with an average of one or two calls per week.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">This document appears to set forth the required coverage during the period the plaintiffs take vacation time. The coverage is to be provided by the regularly-paid staff of the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">However, under the provisions of the job description and the site representative handbook, the weekend began on Friday at 5:00 p.m., and the nightly rounds were required only during \u201cweekdays.\u201d Nevertheless, we have assumed, favorably to the plaintiffs, that the rounds were also made on Friday nights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We have noted that the plaintiffs received no cash payments from the defendant (other than for basic telephone service), and that Aviad worked a daytime job Monday through Thursday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The only other relevant Massachusetts appellate decision of which we are aware is <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 436, 442 (1974), where we said that \u201c[generally speaking, time available for, or spent, sleeping and eating is non-compensable, even where the employee is required to be on the employer\u2019s premises,\u201d quoting <em>Rapp </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 F.2d 635, 642 (Ct. Cl. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Moreover, <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>208 F.2d 805 (9th Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 951 (1954), upon which we relied as authority for the proposition that \u201cthe question whether \u2018sleep time\u2019 [is] compensable [is] a mixed question of law and fact,\u201d <em>DeCourcey, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 375, appears to have been superseded by more recent Ninth Circuit cases such as <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Local No. 169, Assn. of Western Pulp &amp; Paper Workers, </em>971 F.2d 347 (9th Cir. 1992) (described in the text, <em>supra), </em>and <em>Berry </em>v. <em>County of Sonoma, </em>30 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1150 (1995) (discussed in the text, <em>infra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">While both plaintiffs signed employment agreements, there is no evidence that the work assignment was done by more than one person. That is to say, the plaintiffs presented no evidence that both plaintiffs did each (or any) nightly round, or that both plaintiffs responded to calls from a resident. (Vered\u2019s undisputed deposition testimony was that the rounds were conducted by one person, not two.) The plaintiffs\u2019 aggregate claim to two hundred forty-six hours of compensable time weekly is entirely without foundation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">An alternative calculation would be as follows: the value of the apartment translates to 38.1 hours per week at minimum wage. As noted in the text, <em>supra, </em>weekly rounds equaled sixteen and one-quarter hours. Since it is implausible in the extreme that as much as 21.85 hours per week (38.1 less 16.25) would have been spent responding to the few emergency calls, the actual working time required by the job and performed by the plaintiffs could not realistically have approached anywhere near 38.1 hours weekly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">As the plaintiffs are not entitled to overtime pay, we need not address the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs are exempt from the provisions of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, pursuant to \u00a7 1A(1) and/or \u00a7 1A(16).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 148 (count II), requiring the prompt payment of wages earned, presents no issue on the facts of this case. The plaintiffs make no sufficient appellate argument to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
