Lally, Third (George), when the 1971 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia automobile Joyce was driving was involved in a collision with a 1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass. Joyce; George; Joyce\u2019s husband and George\u2019s father George T. Lally, Jr. (George Jr.); and Ernest Lally (George\u2019s brother), filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen of America, Inc., Volkswagen Ak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tiengesellschaft (collectively referred to as Volkswagen), and Lipman Motors, Inc. (Lipman) alleging, among other things, breach of warranty, negligence, deceit, and violation of G. L. c. 93A, in connection with the design and sale of the Karmann Ghia. The case was a so-called \u201ccrashworthiness\u201d case, in which the plaintiffs alleged that, as a result of certain design defects in the vehicle, Joyce and George were more seriously injured in the accident than they otherwise would have been.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that as the result of a defective design, the glove box door in the Karmann Ghia opened in the course of the accident, that George moved forward into the open door, and that the impact with the door\u2019s narrow edge caused his spinal injuries. They also alleged that as a result of the accident, Joyce\u2019s head struck the A-pillar, the metal pillar between the front windshield and the side window of the vehicle, and that her brain injury was caused by, and made worse as a result of, the lack of padding on the A-pillar.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">After a Superior Court jury trial that lasted nearly five weeks, the jury returned verdicts in favor of the defendants on Joyce\u2019s claims of breach of warranty,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> finding, in answer to a special question, that any defect in the vehicle was not a substantial contributing factor to her injuries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury found in favor of George on his claims of negligence and breach of warranty and awarded total damages of $750,000 to him. The jury further awarded damages of $650,000 to George Jr. for medical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>related expenses, and $35,000 for loss of consortium. Loss of consortium damages in the amount of $80,000 were also awarded to Joyce.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">On June 22, 1990, the trial judge heard arguments on a number of posttrial motions and on the plaintiffs\u2019 c. 93A claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He subsequently granted Volkswagen\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and conditionally granted a new trial pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(c), 365 Mass. 815 (1974), on George\u2019s claims, on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that George\u2019s injuries were caused by any alleged defect in the Karmann Ghia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge also issued findings of fact and rulings of law on the c. 93A claims, and ordered judgment in favor of the defendants on those claims. The plaintiffs\u2019 motions for additur and for a new trial on the issue of damages were subsequently denied, and judgment entered in favor of the defendants on all claims. Although the plaintiffs timely filed notices of appeal, the record was not fully assembled until five years after judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The plaintiffs raise a multitude of issues on appeal, including the propriety of the judge\u2019s decision to dismiss their deceit claims; to grant Volkswagen\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; and to conditionally grant Volkswagen\u2019s motions for a new trial. They also challenge the instructions on causation, and the admission of several kinds of visual evidence, as well as the admission of evidence regarding Joyce\u2019s preaccident history of substance abuse. Finally, they argue that the judge\u2019s ruling in favor of the defendants on the c. 93A claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>and the posttrial order requiring them to return to the defendants $5,900 previously placed in escrow should be vacated. We affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u201cConditional Rulings on Grant of Motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-13\">(1) If the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, provided for in subdivision (b) of this rule is granted, the court shall also rule on the motion for a new trial, if any, by determining whether it should be granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed, and shall specify the grounds for granting or denying the motion for a new trial. If the motion for a new trial is thus conditionally granted, the order thereon does not affect the finality of the judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Facts. </em>On June 10, 1984, at approximately 9:00 p.m., Joyce was driving a 1971 Karmann Ghia<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in West Springfield. Her husband, George Jr., and the couple\u2019s six month old child, George, were passengers. Although the vehicle was equipped with seat belts, neither adult wore one. George, however, was strapped into a car seat in the rear of the vehicle. Shortly before the vehicle entered the intersection of Route 20 and Sibley Avenue, George Jr. removed the baby from his car seat and brought him into the front, where he was held \u201cchest to chest.\u201d As the Karmann Ghia crossed the west-bound lane of Route 20 before turning into the east-bound lane, it was struck on the driver\u2019s side by a 1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">As a result of the collision, George sustained a distraction flexion injury to his spinal cord which rendered him a paraplegic. Joyce also sustained severe bodily injuries, including a fractured pelvis and severe head injuries resulting in permanent brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">1. <em>Motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. </em>The plaintiffs maintain that the judge erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict with respect to George\u2019s claims. In reviewing the judge\u2019s decision, the standard is \u201cwhether \u2018anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff[s].\u2019 <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978).\u201d <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Edward O. Tabor, M.D., Inc., </em>387 Mass. 783, 786 (1982), quoting from <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>383 Mass. 724, 727-728 (1981). This determination must be made \u201cwithout weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy </em>v. <em>Besse, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 728 (1979), quoting from <em>Simblest </em>v. <em>Maynard, All </em>F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1970). Rather, judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be granted only when \u201cthere can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable men could have reached.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the judge\u2019s conclusion that in this case, because \u201cthere was a glaring and fatal deficiency on the issue of causation [regarding] George\u2019s injuries,... the only verdict which could reasonably have been reached [was] a defendants\u2019 verdict.\u201d Accordingly, the motion was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Because this was a \u201ccrashworthiness\u201d case, \u201cthe plaintiffs needed to prove (1) that crashes such as the one [in which the Karmann Ghia was involved] were reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturer; (2) that the design of the [vehicle\u2019s glove box] made it unreasonably dangerous for use in the circumstances of such a crash; and (3) that because of the design, [George] was injured more seriously than he would have been had the car been reasonably designed.\u201d <em>Caron </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 753 (1994). See part 2, <em>infra. </em>The plaintiffs, however, failed to present evidence at trial sufficient to persuade a reasonable jury that George\u2019s paraplegia was caused by striking his back on the open glove box door. Indeed, all the medical testimony, including that of the plaintiffs\u2019 own expert, tended to refute the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of causation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Although called by the plaintiffs as their sole medical expert on George\u2019s claim, Dr. Peter Goldman, the neurosurgeon who operated on George immediately after the accident, was never directly asked by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel whether George\u2019s injuries were consistent with impact with a glove box door, or with an impact of any kind. Indeed, Dr. Goldman\u2019s testimony was completely at odds with the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case and actually supported the defendants\u2019 position. Dr. Goldman explained that George sustained a distraction flexion injury, generally caused by extreme stretching and bending as a result of rapid deceleration. He stated that \u201c[djistraction flexion injury of the lumbar spine is a fracture that [is] ordinarily see[n] in people who have a rapid deceleration, such as a race car hitting a wall, the driver wearing only a lap belt so that the pelvis is anchored to the seat, but the upper trunk is thrown forward and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>flexed.\u201d He likened the effect of such an injury on the structures within the spinal canal to taking \u201ca salami or sausage and . . . ben[ding] it forward and pull[ing] it apart.\u201d Moreover, on cross-examination, Dr. Goldman agreed that \u201cthere was nothing medically in the baby\u2019s condition . . . which indicated . . . that this spinal injury was caused by impact with a hard, narrow, rigid object such as the glove box door.\u201d Indeed, he testified that there were \u201cthings which were inconsistent with this being an injury caused by forceful impact on the spine, [including the absence of bruises or soft tissue injuries to George\u2019s back and fractures of the spinous process, the outer vertebral body closest to the back].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The testimony of the defendants\u2019 medical expert further impugned the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of causation, and was, to a great extent, uncontradicted. Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, a neurosurgeon with over thirty-five years of experience, testified that not only were George\u2019s injuries the result of distraction and flexion, along with rotation, but that they were not caused by striking the glove box door. Dr. Mendelsohn stated unequivocally that \u201cno narrow object hit [George\u2019s] body,\u201d and that if any such object had come in contact with George\u2019s back, he would have experienced extension, or bending backward, the very opposite of the flexion injury he sustained. Indeed, Dr. Mendelsohn opined that such an impact would not only have produced noticeable lacerations on George\u2019s back, but would have \u201ccut him in half.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In support of their claim that judgment notwithstanding the verdict was improper, the plaintiffs emphasize an isolated portion of Dr. Goldman\u2019s direct testimony. After being asked whether, assuming \u201cthe father, with the baby in his arms, chest to chest, went forward so the baby\u2019s back impacted [sic] the open edge of the glove compartment door, ... the fracture of the vertebrae and the spinal injury was probably caused by contact with the open glove compartment door,\u201d Dr. Goldman responded, \u201cAs you present the hypothetical situation, there is no other logical conclusion to be reached.\u201d The plaintiffs' argue that this statement was sufficient to overcome their burden of producing evidence on the issue of causation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In light of Dr. Goldman\u2019s extensive and detailed testimony regarding the nature and likely cause of George\u2019s injuries, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>single, reluctant<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> acknowledgement cannot be construed as his expert opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that George\u2019s injury was caused by an impact with a narrow, rigid edge such as the glove box door. Cf. <em>Oberlander\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 1, 7 (1964) (expert opinion as to causal relationship, \u201calthough clothed in the garb of probability, [was in reality] no more than [a] possibility]\u201d); <em>King\u2019s Case, </em>352 Mass. 488, 490 (1967) (expert\u2019s opinion that blow sustained by employee in previously cancerous area hastened his death, unsupported by objective medical evidence, was really \u201cno more than a mathematical likelihood\u201d of causation and, therefore, should have been disregarded). Rather, we think Dr. Goldman\u2019s \u201cso called opinion . . . [was] revealed by the cross-examination to [be] no real opinion at all.\u201d <em>Brownhill </em>v. <em>Kivlin, </em>317 Mass. 168, 170 (1944). We agree with the trial judge that a fair interpretation of Dr. Goldman\u2019s testimony was that \u201chis opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was that George\u2019s injuries were absolutely <em>not </em>caused by [an impact with] the open glove box door\u201d (emphasis supplied). Having been presented with virtually uncontroverted evidence regarding the likely cause of George\u2019s injuries, the jury were not entitled to \u201cso wrest [Dr. Goldman\u2019s] testimony from its context as to distort its [very] meaning.\u201d <em>Mosher </em>v. <em>Cape Ann Sav. Bank, </em>309 Mass. 512, 515 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that, even in the absence of expert medical testimony, the jury could infer that George\u2019s injuries occurred as a result of striking the glove box door from the testimony of their expert, John Noettl, who opined that the force of the accident would have caused George to move forward toward the glove box, and from George Jr.\u2019s testimony that he actually saw the baby\u2019s back strike the door during the accident.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">While it is true that generally a plaintiff may rely on inferences to defeat a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, those inferences cannot be based on mere speculation. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass, at 212. Moreover, our appellate courts and those in other jurisdictions have recognized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>necessity for expert medical testimony on highly technical medical issues, such as injury causation and enhancement of injury to the spine resulting in paraplegia. See <em>Look\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 112, 115 (1962) (\u201cthe causal relationship between the . . . injury and the alleged incapacity is [generally] a matter beyond the common knowledge and ability of the layman and must[, therefore,] be established by expert medical testimony\u201d); <em>Casey\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 572, 574 (1965) (expert testimony required in disability case involving aggravation of disc injury); <em>Held </em>v. <em>Bail, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 921 (1989) (when \u201cthe causation question involves questions of medical science or technology, the jury requires the assistance of expert testimony\u201d). See also <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>649 F.2d 808, 813 (10th Cir. 1981) (\u201cexpert testimony is required\u201d regarding cause of plaintiff\u2019s back injury in crashworthiness case); <em>Duran </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>101 N.M. 742, 753 (Ct. App. 1983) (on the question of whether additional intrusion caused spinal injury, \u201cexpert proof is essential\u201d). In this case, we do not think the question of precisely what caused George\u2019s spinal injury and his resultant paraplegia was \u201csufficiently obvious as to lie within [the] common knowledge\u201d of the jury. <em>Haggerty </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>344 Mass. 136, 139 (1962). Accordingly, we conclude that in the absence of expert medical testimony on the issue, the jury could have had no basis other than conjecture, surmise or speculation upon which to conclude that the injury was caused by an impact with the open glove box door. See <em>Soileau </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>639 F.2d 214, 216 (5th Cir. 1981) (plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he suffered a hyperflexion injury insufficient to avoid judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of defendant where medical experts for both sides stated that plaintiff\u2019s spinal injury was the result of hyperextension rather than hyperflexion); <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>649 F.2d at 812-813 (jury could not infer, based on plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he was positioned partially under an overturned vehicle after an accident, that his back injury was caused by the crushing force of the vehicle, where there were no bruises or other evidence of trauma on his back and no medical testimony to support his claim). See also <em>Kaye </em>v. <em>Newhall, </em>356 Mass. 300, 303 (1969) (prejudicial error to submit case to jury where plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he became impotent as a result of defendant\u2019s conduct was not supported by expert testimony of either impotence or causation). We hold, therefore, that the allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">warranted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\u2019 <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The plaintiffs next challenge the causation instruction. Initially, the judge indicated that he would give an instmction which comported with the rationale articulated in the line of cases known as <em>Fox-Mitchell. </em>See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>575 F.2d 774 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Volkswagenwerk AG, </em>669 F.2d 1199 (8th Cir. 1982). The <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>approach has been adopted by the majority of jurisdictions that have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>considered the specificity with which a plaintiff who has sustained indivisible injuries<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in a crashworthiness case must establish causation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although counsel for the plaintiffs agreed with the judge\u2019s determination that the <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>rationale was applicable, he objected to the exact language of the proposed instruction. The judge subsequently instmcted the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201c[Y]ou must decide whether the acts or omissions of the defendant constituted a substantial contributing factor in causing the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. It does not matter whether other concurrent causes contributed to the injuries, so long as you find that the defendants\u2019 actions or omissions were a substantial contributing factor in producing them. . . . The plaintiff must prove that after the original impact. . . the defect or defects in this automobile legally caused or enhanced the injuries which resulted. . . . [I]f the plaintiff has proved to you by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defective or negligently designed automobile was a substantial contributing factor in producing damages <em>over and above </em>those which probably would have been caused as a result of the original impact absent a defective design, then the plaintiff has satisfied his or her burden of proof on the element of causation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The judge further noted that the defendants\u2019 acts or omissions \u201cneed not be the sole cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries in order to establish the defendants\u2019 responsibility to the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the judge erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>including the \u201cover and above\u201d language quoted above. They maintain that since both Joyce and George suffered indivisible injuries, they were required to show only that the alleged defects in the Karmann Ghia contributed to their injuries \u2014 a burden which could be satisfied even if they would have sustained the identical injuries in the absence of any defect. The defendants argue that the judge erred in instructing in accordance with <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>rather than with the rule articulated in <em>Huddell </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>537 F.2d 726, 737-738 (3d Cir. 1976). In the alternative, they maintain that the instruction given by the judge fully comports with <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>and their progeny. We hold that the judge properly chose to instruct the jury in accordance with <em>Fox-Mitchell, </em>and that the challenged instmction was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The plaintiffs misapprehend the distinction between the <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>and <em>Huddell </em>approaches to establishing liability. The touchstone of liability in all crashworthiness cases is the existence of some enhanced injury, i.e., an injury \u201cover and above\u201d that which would have been sustained in the absence of the alleged defect. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>375 Mass. 620, 623-624 (1978) (\u201cenhanced injuries from collisions are foreseeable as incidental to the normal use of certain products and [the line of cases represented by <em>Larsen </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>391 F.2d 495 (8th Cir. 1968)] imposes liability on manufacturers for these injuries\u201d); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Monarch Mach. Tool Co., </em>413 Mass. 205, 212 (1992) (applying crashworthiness doctrine to claim arising as a result of an industrial accident, and noting that liability will attach \u201cwhere the design defect enhances the [plaintiff\u2019s] injuries\u201d); <em>Caron </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 753 (in crashworthiness case, plaintiff must establish that \u201cbecause of the [allegedly defective] design he was injured more seriously than he would have been had the car been reasonably designed\u201d); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 16 comment a, at 236 (in crashworthiness case \u201c[the plaintiff] would have suffered some injury as a result of the accident even in the absence of the claimed . . . defect . . . [and the] seller [or manufacturer] is responsible only for the increased harm\u201d). Notwithstanding their argument to the contrary, the plaintiffs fail to cite a single case which stands for the proposition that a plaintiff seeking to recover for indivisible injuries in a crashworthiness case is relieved of the burden of demonstrating that a safer design would have resulted in less severe injuries. Indeed, the distinction between <em>Huddell </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Fox-Mitchell </em>becomes relevant only after <em>some </em>enhanced injury has been established. See <em>Huddell </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>537 F.2d at 738 (\u201cone thing, at least, is clear: the automobile manufacturer is liable only for the enhanced injuries attributable to the defective product\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Under <em>Huddell, </em>a plaintiff seeking to establish liability for indivisible injuries in a crashworthiness case must demonstrate not only that the alleged product defect was a substantial factor in producing enhanced injuries, he must also prove the extent of the enhanced injuries that are attributable to the defective design. <em>Huddell, supra </em>at 737-738. Thus, in jurisdictions that have adopted the <em>Huddell </em>approach, \u201ceven if the plaintiff can establish that some increased harm was caused by the defendant, [he] is unable to recover [unless he is also able to quantify the increased harm.]\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 16, Reporters\u2019 note to comment d, at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Even under the more lenient <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>approach, however, \u201c[p]roof of a defect does not, of itself, establish a case of increased harm. The plaintiff must also establish that the defect was a substantial factor in increasing [his] harm beyond the harm that would have occurred [in the absence of any defect. Under <em>Fox-Mitchell, </em>when the proof adduced at trial] does not support [the apportionment of liability], the product seller is liable for all harm suffered by the victim. However, [this] rule does not take effect until the plaintiff establishes ... by competent testimony, that [his] harm was increased as a result of the product defect.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 16 comment b, at 238. Accordingly, although application of the <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>approach relieves a plaintiff of the burden of proving \u201cthat the damages that arose from the enhanced injury are apportionable,\u201d he must nevertheless establish that the defect upon which his claim is based \u201cwas a substantial factor in producing damages over and above those which were probably caused as a result of the original impact or collision.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Warrum, </em>535 N.E.2d 1207, 1220 (Ind. Ct. App. 1989). See <em>Czam\u00e9cki </em>v. <em>Volkswagen of America, </em>172 Ariz. 408, 413 (Ct.

See also <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>723 F.2d 830, 834-835 (11th Cir. 1984); <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>Kawasaki Motors Corp. USA, </em>799 S.W.2d 854, 867 (Mo. Ct. App. 1990). But see <em>De-Paepe </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>33 F.3d 737, 740 (7th Cir. 1994) (stating that <em>Oakes </em>is governing law of Illinois, but concluding that \u201cthe concept of enhanced injury had no place in\u201d the case because the plaintiff\u2019s injury was indivisible). The challenged instruction, therefore, represents an accurate statement of the mle articulated in <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">3. <em>Evidentiary issues. </em>The plaintiffs next contend that the judge erroneously admitted several types of visual evidence at trial, including a computer-generated animation and two videotapes prepared by the defendants\u2019 experts. They also claim that evidence of Joyce\u2019s preaccident history of substance abuse and methadone therapy unfairly prejudiced the jury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">a. <em>Visual evidence. </em>We first consider the visual evidence. The plaintiffs allege error in the admission of a computer-generated animation and two videotapes prepared by defense experts. They first argue that the admission of the evidence was error due to the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with a discovery order regarding the pretrial production of tests or literature upon which their experts relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe conduct and scope of discovery is within the sound discretion of the trial judge . . . [and we decline to] interfere with the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion [where, as here, we discern no] abuse of [that] discretion.\u201d <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 799 (1987) (citations omitted). As the defendants correctly point out, the trial judge in this case was confronted with two, somewhat inconsistent, pretrial orders regarding the defendants\u2019 obligation to produce certain test results or literature upon which their experts relied.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> With respect to one of the challenged videotapes, which depicted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sled test involving an exemplar Karmann Ghia, the judge correctly ruled that the earlier of the two orders expressly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for \u201ctests on exemplar vehicles.\u201d As for the second videotape and the computer animation offered by the defendants in conjunction with the testimony of their expert, Raymond McHenry, we agree with the trial judge that these were not tests relied upon by the defense at all, but rather, illustrations intended to assist the jury in understanding McHenry\u2019s complex testimony. Accordingly, they did not come within the terms of the second order. Finally, the plaintiffs could not have been prejudiced by any late disclosure of the tapes at issue, because the actual results of McHenry\u2019s computer analyses and a list of literature relating to the programs he used were provided by the defendants prior to trial, and the videotape of the sled test was made available approximately two weeks before it was shown to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive arguments regarding the admissibility of the challenged evidence. The first videotape introduced through McHenry, an engineer who performed a complete accident reconstmction for the defense, demonstrated the use of computers to predict and reconstmct accidents, and included a brief movie excerpt of a complex automobile stunt accomplished with the assistance of computers. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the tape was prejudicial to their case because it somehow suggested that \u201cHollywood is in use to fix the gouge mark and the point of impact,\u201d we agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the film likely \u201cassist[ed] the jury in understanding the very technical nature of [McHenry\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Moreover, any risk of prejudice to the plaintiffs was eliminated when, prior to seeing the tape, the jury were instmcted that it \u201cha[d] nothing to do with . . . the facts of th[e] case, but . . . [might] assist [them] in understanding the techniques that the witness ha[d] been talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the admission of a brief animation, also used by McHenry to depict the result of a computer simulation of the movement of the vehicles and their occupants in the accident, is equally unavailing. The plaintiffs characterize the animation as a \u201ccomputer simulation,\u201d and argue that it did not meet the foundational requirements for admissibility established for such evidence in <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number><em>Boston Edison Co., </em>412 Mass. 545, 549-550 (1992).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendants maintain that the animation was not itself a simulation, but rather, a visual representation of McHenry\u2019s testimony concerning the results of one computer simulation program, known as SMAC, which he utilized to verify his opinions in this case. Whatever the proper characterization of the challenged animation, any error in its admission would have been harmless. The animation was admitted in evidence only after McHemy had already testified, without objection, regarding the results of the SMAC simulation and his resultant opinions. Moreover, a number of additional charts depicting McHenry\u2019s reconstruction and analysis of the movement of the occupants inside the Karmann Ghia were also admitted through his testimony. Thus, the animation was merely cumulative of other evidence in the case and could not, therefore, have prejudiced the plaintiffs. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>412 Mass. 682, 689 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The final piece of visual evidence challenged by the plaintiffs is a videotaped sled test which was admitted during the testimony of defense expert, Wolfhard Albers, the safety test engineer for Volkswagen who conducted the challenged test at Volkswagen\u2019s testing facility in Germany. During the test, a modified exemplar of the Karmann Ghia containing anthropomorphic dummies was mounted on a sled which was then suddenly accelerated and decelerated to simulate certain accident conditions, including the speed and direction of the occupants\u2019 movement within the vehicle. The plaintiffs claim that the test was not sufficiently similar to the actual accident conditions so as to be relevant, and that its admission likely confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In determining whether a test such as the one at issue is admissible, a trial court must consider \u201cwhether the evidence is relevant, the extent to which the test conditions are similar to the circumstances surrounding the accident, and whether the [experiment, demonstration or reenactment] will confuse or mislead the jury.\u201d <em>Calvanese </em>v. VKW <em>Babcock Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 730 (1980). The decision whether to admit such evidence \u201cmust be largely left to the discretion of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>judge, and that discretion will not be interfered with [on appeal] unless in its exercise [the judge] clearly appears to be wrong.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>380 Mass. 362, 365 (1980). Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The sled test was offered by the defense to demonstrate two things: the real time movement of the occupants in the crash, and the components with which they would likely have come into contact if the vehicle moved at a fifty-three degree angle, as calculated by McHenry. The resulting damage to the exemplar vehicle\u2019s interior, such as deformation of the steering wheel and gear shift, could then be compared to the damage actually seen in the plaintiffs\u2019 Karmann Ghia. In these circumstances, \u201c[t]he relevancy of the [test] to [the] defendants\u2019] theory of causation can [hardly] be disputed.\u201d <em>Szeliga </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>728 F.2d 566, 567 (1st Cir. 1984). Indeed, the test illustrated the movement of the occupants of the Karmann Ghia in a manner consistent with the opinions offered by a key defense expert, and the damage sustained by the exemplar vehicle was similar to that seen in the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">While the test did not replicate the conditions of the accident exactly, it was similar enough to allow the jury to infer \u201csomething material,\u201d i,e., how the occupants would have moved inside the vehicle and what parts of the interior they would likely have struck if they moved in the direction posited by the defendants\u2019 experts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nothing more was required. See <em>Read </em>v. <em>Mt. Tom Ski Area, Inc., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 904 (1994) (test is whether jury could infer something material from proffered test). See also <em>Calvanese, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 731 (determination of whether tests are \u201csufficiently similar\u201d to actual incident is within judge\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Finally, where, as here, the differences between the sled test and the actual accident, including the use of an obviously altered exemplar vehicle at a testing facility bearing no resemblance to an actual roadway, the absence of the hood of another car intruding into the driver\u2019s side of the exemplar vehicle, and the use of anthropomorphic dummies rather than human beings, are obvious, there is little danger that the jury could have been misled or confused. Contrast <em>Swajian </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>916 F.2d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 1990); <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp, </em>11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>F.3d 259, 263-264 (1st Cir. 1993) (both cited by the defendant and involving human drivers on actual roadways).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">b. <em>Evidence of preaccident substance abuse. </em>We turn next to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the admission of evidence regarding Joyce\u2019s history of drug and alcohol abuse was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. Following the accident in June, 1984, Joyce was hospitalized, and her condition gradually improved. She was discharged from the hospital in August, and at that time, was able to \u201cmanage for herself at home\u201d with the assistance of family members. On the evening of October 28, 1984, however, Joyce consumed a significant amount of Darvocet, a prescription pain killer, along with six beers and a shot of whiskey. The following day she was again hospitalized, and, upon being discharged some five months later, her condition had significantly and permanently deteriorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The plaintiffs offered medical records and bills relating to both the first and second hospitalization, along with testimony from Joyce\u2019s physicians, in an attempt causally to relate the overdose and subsequent deterioration in her condition to her original injuries. To counter this evidence, and to rebut any inference that Joyce\u2019s excessive use of prescription narcotics and alcohol was caused by the accident, the defendants elicited testimony during their cross-examinations of George Jr. and Dr. Randolph Knob, one of Joyce\u2019s treating physicians, concerning Joyce\u2019s history of substance abuse. In addition, medical records containing references to Joyce\u2019s prior alcohol and heroin abuse, and her ongoing preaccident methadone treatment, were admitted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> After the evidence came in, the judge gave a forceful limiting instruction, in which he told the jury that it was being offered for the limited purpose of determining \u201cwhether or not [Joyce\u2019s] second hospitalization . . . was proximately caused by any acts or omissions on the part of the defendants.\u201d He further cautioned that the evidence must not be considered \u201cas evidence of bad character ... [or of] how the accident happened, [or] to prove in any way [that] there was a defect or there was not a defect in the Volkswagen . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs maintain all references to Joyce\u2019s preaccident substance abuse should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The decision whether evidence is relevant and, if so, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, is largely within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Read </em>v. <em>Mt. Tom-Ski Area, Inc., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. at 902. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>397 Mass. 351, 358-359 (1986). In these circumstances, we discern no abuse of that discretion. Rather, we think the challenged evidence was relevant to the issue of whether Joyce\u2019s second hospitalization and the resultant deterioration in her condition were caused by the conduct of the defendants. Moreover, \u201c[t]he limiting instructions given by the judge were sufficient to clarify the purpose for which the evidence could properly be used.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, supra </em>at 359. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 809 (1985) (jury is presumed to have followed proper limiting instmction).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">4. <em>Dismissal of plaintiffs \u2019 deceit claims. </em>The plaintiffs also maintain that the judge\u2019s dismissal of the deceit counts against all three defendants at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was error. They argue that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to establish the defendants\u2019 implicit representation that the Karmann Ghia was safe, as well as the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon that representation, and their resultant injury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The absolute failure of the plaintiffs in this case to establish a causal relationship between the acts or omissions of the defendants and their injuries, however, renders their claim untenable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>Atlantic Corp., </em>322 Mass. 512, 520-521 (1948) (plaintiff required to show some damage resulted from defendant\u2019s misrepresentations).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">5. <em>Plaintiffs </em>\u2019 <em>c. 93A claims. </em>The plaintiffs next argue that the judge\u2019s ruling in favor of the defendants on the c. 93A claims should be vacated. The judge issued detailed findings of fact and rulings of law in support of his decision. Specifically, he found that neither the glove box door nor the A-pillar were defective and that both were designed and manufactured in accordance with good engineering practices. He further found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Joyce\u2019s head did not strike the allegedly defective A-pillar, and that George and George Jr. moved violently to the left during the accident rather than forward, and, accordingly, that they moved in the direction of the. gearshift and the steering wheel rather than toward the glove box. Thus, he concluded that George\u2019s back never struck the glove box door. Finally, the judge found that \u201cno defendant was negligent [or] breached its implied warranty of merchantability^ and that] no defendant knowingly or willingly violated G. L. c. 93A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The judge\u2019s findings of fact, including his \u201cdetermination that [the defendants] did not engage in any unfair or deceptive act or practice [are questions] of fact and therefore must stand unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 476 (1991). The record in this case contains ample support for the judge\u2019s conclusion that neither the glove box door nor the A-pillar was defective and that both were designed and manufactured in accordance with good engineering practices. The findings that Joyce\u2019s head did not strike the A-pillar, and that George\u2019s back never struck the glove box door,-are similarly supported. Indeed, the plaintiffs do not claim that these findings are clearly erroneous. Rather, they rely on an allegedly inadequate jury instmction to support their claim, and maintain that, in ruling on the c. 93A claim, the judge failed to consider that in a breach of warranty case such as this, state of the art is irrelevant in determining liability. See <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ariens Co., </em>391 Mass. 407, 413 (1984).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, they seem to suggest that the judge erroneously concluded that, because the vehicle was designed and manufactured in accordance with good engineering practice, it could not have been defective.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Again, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Although the judge declined to give the precise instruction requested by the plaintiffs, the instruction heard by the jury and, accordingly, upon which the judge relied in reaching his own decision, adequately described the elements necessary to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of warranty claims. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 130 (1979) (as long as instructions are \u201cadequate and clear ... on the applicable law, the phraseology, method and extent of the charge are matters within [the judge\u2019s] discretion\u201d). First, the judge thoroughly discussed with the jury the concept of liability based on breach of warranty, and outlined the essential elements of such a claim: (1) that the defendant manufactured or sold the product; (2) that a defect or unreasonably dangerous condition existed at the time the product left the defendant\u2019s hands so that it was not reasonably suitable for the ordinary uses for which goods of that kind were sold; (3) that at the time of his injury, the plaintiff was using the product in a manner that the defendant intended or that could reasonably have been foreseen; and (4) that the defect or unreasonably defective condition was a legal cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965). See also <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633, 640 (1978) (\u201cLegislature has made the Massachusetts law of warranty congment in nearly all respects with the principles expressed in ... \u00a7 402A\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Moreover, the judge also told the jury that, \u201c[i]n determining whether or not a breach of warranty occurred, [their] focus [should be] on the product characteristics . . . not on the conduct of the user, manufacturer or seller of the product, [and that t]he defendant may be found to have breached its warranty even though it exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product.\u201d Finally, the judge cautioned the jury that \u201cconformity to standard [business custom or] practice ... is not dispositive and . . . controlling of the question of whether the defendant breached its implied warranty of merchantability.\u201d This instruction was sufficient. Cf. <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass, at 642-643 (judge correctly refused to instruct jury that evidence of manufacturer\u2019s conformity with industry practice was immaterial to their decision, as \u201c[e]vidence [of such conformity is] clearly relevant to issue [of whether manufacturer breached warranty of merchantability] \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">6. <em>Return to defendant of escrow. </em>Prior to trial, the defendants filed a motion to preclude the plaintiffs from offering the testimony of one of their designated experts, Paul O\u2019Shea, unless a fee of $5,900, previously advanced by the defendants for O\u2019Shea\u2019s anticipated expenses associated with his deposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>was refunded.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In support of their motion, the defendants alleged, among other things, that counsel for the plaintiffs had demanded prepayment of O\u2019Shea\u2019s fee and estimated expenses as a prerequisite to allowing the defendants to take his deposition; that a check in the amount of $5,900 had been mailed by the defendants to counsel for the plaintiffs; that the deposition was subsequently cancelled and rescheduled several times by the plaintiffs, and once by the defendants; that counsel for the plaintiffs had attempted to use the $5,900 as a retainer for O\u2019Shea\u2019s services rather than as an advance toward future expenses, and that once O\u2019Shea had been informed that the funds were intended to be an advance, he had agreed to return the full amount to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">A Superior Court judge allowed the motion, \u201cunless the plaintiffs deposited]\u201d into court $5,900, representing the sum that \u201cclearly was forwarded by the defendants and was to be used for [O\u2019Shea\u2019s] expenses.\u201d In making his ruling, the motion judge indicated that the final determination regarding the proper disposition of the funds would be made at a later date. Indeed, a posttrial evidentiary hearing was held, after which the trial judge ordered it returned to Volkswagen. In his memorandum and order, the trial judge found (1) that the $5,900 was advanced to defray fees and expenses connected with O\u2019Shea\u2019s planned deposition; (2) that O\u2019Shea did not incur any \u201cexpenses [or] suffer any financial loss;\u201d and (3) that the plaintiffs had attempted to use the $5,900 to pay O\u2019Shea\u2019s \u201cretainer for services to be rendered to the[m].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in this respect are reprehensible. They maintain first, that the motion judge should never have ordered the funds to be placed into escrow and, second, that the trial judge erred in ordering that the funds be turned over to the defendants. The plaintiffs fail to support their first contention with relevant authority or reasoned argument as contemplated by Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). Accordingly, we do not consider it. See <em>Bjorkman </em>v. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 595 (1997).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We review the trial judge\u2019s decision to turn over the $5,900 to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>defendants for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. at 799 (\u201cconduct and scope of discovery is within the sound discretion of the judge\u201d). The trial judge\u2019s findings regarding the disputed funds are amply supported in the record. There is no evidence that O\u2019Shea ever traveled to Boston or otherwise incurred expenses or financial loss associated with his planned deposition. Moreover, it does not appear that O\u2019Shea\u2019s deposition was ever taken in this case. Accordingly, the trial judge\u2019s decision that the funds should be returned to Volkswagen does not represent an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">For all of the reasons discussed above, the judgments in favor of the defendants, Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, Volkswagen. of America, Inc., and Lipman Motors, Inc., are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 16 comment a, at 236 (1998), states that \u201c[1]liability for increased harm arises most frequently in automobile crashworthiness cases ....

While \u201c[i]t would be foolhardy to expect members of the jury to be without compassion for the catastrophe that befell this familyf,] ... in a case such as this, it is not only appropriate but indeed imperative that the court remain vigilant to ensure that neither emotion nor confusion has supplanted reason.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Having determined that the judge properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in this case, there can be no doubt that he acted within his discretion in ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The plaintiffs also maintain that, because the judge based his order conditionally granting the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial on insufficient evidence of causation, the jury\u2019s verdicts on negligence and breach of warranty should be reinstated. This claim is completely without merit, as both causes of action include causation as an essential element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Another claim of error raised by the plaintiffs on appeal is their contention that because the damages awarded to George and his parents were \u201cgreatly disproportionate to the injuries] proved,\u201d see <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>391 Mass. 815, 822 (1984), the judge erroneously denied their new trial motions on the issue of damages. They further claim that the inadequate verdict resulted from an erroneous instruction regarding the proper measure of damages. However, in light of our decision to affirm the judge\u2019s order granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the defendants, we need not address the proper measure of damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">An indivisible injury is said to have been sustained when the task of allocating causal responsibility between the initial impact of the accident and the alleged defect is not possible. Here, there is no dispute that the injuries sustained by George and Joyce were indivisible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The plaintiffs had urged the court to instruct in accordance with the <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>approach, which has been adopted by twenty-three States as well as Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 16, at 235-236 (1998). <em>Fox-Mitchell </em>relieves a plaintiff in cases involving indivisible injuries of the burden of proving that his injuries are apportionable. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Warrum, </em>535 N.E.2d 1207, 1220 (Ind. Ct. App. 1989). The defendants argued that the instruction should reflect the minority view, known as the <em>Huddell </em>approach, which places an increased burden on the plaintiff in such cases. See <em>Huddell </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>537 F.2d 726, 738-739 (3d Cir. 1976). See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a7 16 comment d, illustration 6, at 240 (plaintiff must be able to \u201cquantify \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 increased harm\u201d in order to recover under <em>Huddell).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Plaintiffs also claim that certain photographs were erroneously admitted.
