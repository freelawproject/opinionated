Subsequently, in the latter part of his career (1983-1992), he became severely depressed by reason, he alleged, of harassment and discrimination against him by fellow officers and his supervisors, the Cambridge chief of police and city manager, who isolated him and repeatedly broke promises made to him about promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">A psychiatrist advised him in 1990 that he was suffering from \u201cjob-related stress.\u201d Following a paid medical leave in 1990, he returned to work in 1992 but (he maintained) could not handle the severe anxiety and emotional stress that he continued to experience from his relationship with his superiors. After Sugrue entered a hospital psychiatric emergency ward and obtained a note from his personal psychiatrist explaining to his employer that he could not \u201creturn to police duties at this time,\u201d his employment was terminated by. the city in September, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Sugrue applied thereafter to the Cambridge retirement board (CRB) for accidental disability retirement benefits. His application recited that his claim was based on a permanent psychological disability grounded in anxiety and depression which was not occasioned by a single event, but rather which reflected \u201ca deterioration type of disability\u201d as a result of a series of events. Two of the three medical panel psychiatrists who examined him pursuant to CRB\u2019s request certified to his disability; the third member deemed him not disabled. Based on the panel majority report, CRB voted to grant his application in July, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">In August, 1993, the Public Employee Retirement Administration (PERA), after reviewing the matter pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 21(1 <em>)(d), </em>rejected Sugrue\u2019s application on the ground that it had been wrongfully approved \u201cupon unlawful procedure.\u201d PERA identified that unlawful procedure as lack of a positive certification from his personal physician as to the permanency of the disability, and lack of substantial evidence to support a finding that his incapacity might have resulted from a job-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>related personal injury. After Sugrue\u2019s timely appeal to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB), an administrative magistrate to whom the appeal was assigned affirmed PERA\u2019s decision denying Sugrue\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The magistrate agreed with PERA that Sugrue did not carry his burden of demonstrating that his psychiatric condition, even assuming it to be permanently disabling, was the natural and proximate result of a \u201cpersonal injury sustained or a hazard undergone . . . while in the performance of . . . his duties,\u201d as required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1). The magistrate relied upon the principle of <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 479 (1985), which held that a claim premised on the theory advanced by Sugrue \u2014 a disability produced by gradual deterioration over time \u2014 can succeed only upon proof that the disability resulted from the exposure of the claimant by his employment to \u201can identifiable condition\u201d which is not common to all or a great many occupations. <em>Id. </em>at 485 (citation omitted). The magistrate noted that both psychiatrists who had examined Sugrue and opined that he was disabled had stressed as the most pertinent cause of disability Sugrue\u2019s \u201chumiliating\u201d interactions and disputes with his supervisors, particularly repeated broken promises about promotion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on those reports and her own evaluation of the medical and non-medical evidence in the record, the magistrate determined that Sugrue\u2019s conflicts with his superiors did not constitute an identifiable condition uncommon to all or a great many occupations within the meaning of Blanchette.\u2014 a case which also involved a claimant whose principal job-related difficulty was his inability to get along with people, manifested by frequent problems and arguments with supervisors. 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 484-485.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The magistrate also mentioned two additional and independent reasons for denial. First, she noted that the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), is, under the teaching of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>numerous cases, to be given the same meaning as the identical term used in the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A), which specifically excludes from the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d (by virtue of a 1986 amendment, St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7\u00a7 6 &amp; 55) any \u201cmental or emotional disability arising principally out of a bona fide, personnel action\u201d not amounting to the intentional infliction of emotional harm. Since the repeated failures of his supervisors to promote Sugrue (which he did not challenge as wrongful) constituted bona fide personnel actions and since Sugrue had failed to prove any intent to inflict emotional harm on their part, the magistrate determined that Sugrue had failed to establish a compensable \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The magistrate finally opined that the application must be denied because Sugrue had failed to satisfy the notice provision of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), which requires that the injury sustained occur within two years of the filing of the application or, if occurring earlier, that written notices of injury be filed with the appropriate retirement board within ninety days of each occurrence. Sugrue, having filed no notices regarding traumatic events or personnel conflicts prior to his 1992 application, was confined to the incidents that had occurred within two years of his application. All of those stressors related to his personnel problems, which could not support his claim under the <em>Blanchette </em>analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">CRAB subsequently summarily affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision, adopting her findings and conclusions as its own. On Sugrue\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court, CRAB\u2019s decision was affirmed on all of the grounds identified by the magistrate. We, too, affirm, without having to reach the issue whether the definition, with exceptions, of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in G. L. c. 152 is to be read into G. L. c. 32.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Superior Court properly upheld both CRAB\u2019s application of the statutory two-year limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>period and its determination that Sugrae had failed to sustain his burden under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), of demonstrating that his disability was the direct result of the cumulative effects of his employment or in establishing the necessary nexus between his condition and his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Assuming, arguendo, that Sugrae\u2019s condition is not excepted from c. 32, the magistrate, CRAB, and the Superior Court were correct in adopting the rationale of <em>Blanchette </em>as the predominant basis for denying Sugrue\u2019s application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Most fatally, Sugrue\u2019s position falls before the magistrate\u2019s and CRAB\u2019s determination that the only non-time-barred disability claim Sugrue presented \u2014 the cumulative stress created by his humiliating encounters and job conflicts with his superiors \u2014 was not an \u201cidentifiable condition . . . that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations.\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 487 (citations omitted). As <em>Blanchette </em>teaches, job conflicts and arguments with superiors and subordinates, including a series of incidents over several years creating feelings of \u2018\u2018persecution\u201d and unfair treatment and ultimately a diagnosed mental illness, do not \u201cdistinguish [the applicant\u2019s] occupation from a wide variety of other occupations where employees face similar pressures and demands.\u201d 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 480, 484-485, 487. Cf. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>414 Mass. 360, 366-367 (1993), and cases cited (discussing distinction between physical activities unique to job, contrasted with those required in a \u201cwide variety of other occupations\u201d). Under <em>Blanchette, supra </em>at 484, such \u201clong standing problems in [the plaintiff\u2019s] ability to get along with people,\u201d do not, standing alone, satisfy the \u201ccumulative effects\u201d hypothesis that underlay Sugrue\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In exercising our limited power of review in such cases (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>we are especially cognizant of (a) the applicant\u2019s clear burden to establish the requisite causal nexus; (b) the strictness of the causation standard imposed by c. 32; (c) the ultimate discretion belonging to CRAB on the question whether causation has been proved; (d) CRAB\u2019s unfettered discretion to reject medical panel certification and to \u201ccompletely discount the testimony of one expert and rely exclusively on [another],\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 639 (1985) (which the magistrate did here by expressly rejecting the conclusion of the majority of the medical panel and implicitly adopting the opinion of the minority member, Dr. Rosenblatt); and (e) the impropriety of a reviewing court\u2019s substitution of its judgment for that of the expert agency when there is evidentiary support in the record for the agency\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In such a constrained appellate environment, we are unable and unwilling to gainsay CRAB\u2019s rejection of Sugrue\u2019s contention that his psychiatric condition was the natural and proximate result of a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d he had sustained by reason of exposure to an uncommon identifiable condition while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>in the performance of his duties. On this record, CRAB was entitled and empowered to reach the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\">One of the medical panel majority who agreed that Sugrue was disabled (Dr. Sederer) did so in part on the basis of Sugrue\u2019s having furnished undated written descriptions of seven \u201cviolent, catastrophic, traumatic\u201d situations Sugrue had allegedly experienced at some early point in his police career. The magistrate rejected this conclusion as being dependent on events that did not in fact form the basis of Sugrue\u2019s disability application (which identified the humiliating relationship and conflicts with his superiors as the prime source of his distress), and also as being temporally irrelevant to the onset of Sugrue\u2019s inability to work, having all occurred at least seven years prior to the onset of his psychiatric problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The magistrate also premised denial independently on the failure of Sugrue\u2019s personal physician to state affirmatively that the disability was permanent, but that issue was not addressed by the Superior Court and is not pressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Sugrae\u2019s principal appellate challenge is to the magistrate\u2019s and Superior Court\u2019s reliance, in part, on the \u201cbona fide personnel action\u201d exception to the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as appearing in the workers\u2019 compensation statute, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A). He argues not only that c. 152 does not apply to police officers like himself, but also (invoking a common maxim of statutory construction) that when the exception was inserted into c. 152 in 1986, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>c. 32 was not similarly amended. See, e.g., <em>Tilcon Mass., Inc. v. Commissioner of Rev., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 264, 269 (1991). Since the denial of Sugrue\u2019s application is sustainable on other grounds, see discussion <em>infra, </em>we need not decide this issue. We observe, however, that it has long been recognized \u2014 both well before and after 1986 \u2014 that the language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, particularly in regard to the concept of \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d should be interpreted in harmony with c. 152. See <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>337 Mass. 495, 500-501 (1958); <em>Zavaglia </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>345 Mass. 483, 486 (1963); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>414 Mass. 360, 361 n.l (1993); <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 482; Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 623(3) &amp; n.l (2d ed. 1981). Other than Sugrue\u2019s arguments based upon general canons of statutory construction and the- distinguishable situation in <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Auditor of Watertown, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 246-247 (1985) (involving the interplay not of the identical terms \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d but rather of two different, \u201cunduly ambiguous,\u201d and previously unconstrued provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 94, and G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, that the court was constrained to resolve while noting the matter was \u201cnot free from doubt\u201d), he advances no policy reasons for rejecting the traditional identity of the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d concepts in c. 32 and c. 152. Compare the discussions in the authorities cited earlier in this footnote.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\">Our review proceeds under a narrow and highly deferential standard which Sugrue does not explicitly recognize. We may set aside or modify a CRAB decision only if, after giving due regard to CRAB\u2019s expertise in applying c. 32 to a variety of factual situations, the appellant has convincingly demonstrated that CRAB\u2019s decision was, considering the entirety of the record \u2014 including non-medical as well as medical facts, and recognizing that the probative value of. expert evidence is for the magistrate, and later CRAB, to accept or reject \u2014 based upon an error of law or wholly unsupported by substantial evidence. Sugrue has failed to make that demonstration. See <em>Blanchette, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 483, 487-488; <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 252 n.6, 254-258 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\">See generally for these several propositions the authorities cited in notes 4 and 5, <em>supra, </em>and, additionally, <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 45, 48-49 (1961); <em>Wakefield Contributory Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>352 Mass. 499, 502-503 (1967); <em>Woolfall\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass.
