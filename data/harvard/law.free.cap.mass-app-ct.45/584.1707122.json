The defendant contends on appeal that the trial judge erred by refusing to admit evidence concerning a specific incident of alleged sexual conduct concerning one of the two victims, and by allowing the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder of the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>We summarize the evidence presented by the prosecution. The complainants, Melissa and Janice, who are half sisters,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were placed in foster care with Beverly and Paul Gagnon, the defendant\u2019s parents, in 198'6. Melissa was five and one-half years old and Janice eight years old at the time. Also living in the home were the defendant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his brother, and two of Beverly and Paul Gagnon\u2019s young grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Mrs. Gagnon frequently left the defendant to babysit for the children when she was out of the house. Melissa testified that when she was seven years old he began forcing her to have oral sex with him at these times. He threatened to get her into trouble if she told anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Janice testified that when she was nine or ten years old the defendant began to abuse her sexually while he was babysitting. On these occasions he would digitally penetrate her vagina and have her perform oral sex on him. They began to have genital sexual intercourse when Janice was between twelve and thirteen years old. Their final sexual encounter occurred on July 3, 1992, when the defendant ejaculated inside her for the first time. Janice was fourteen years old. The defendant threatened that, if she ever told, \u201c[h]e would make it be my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Melissa and Janice both testified about an incident that occurred when Melissa was between seven and nine years old. The sisters were picking up laundry in the bathroom when the defendant came in, locked the door, and asked Janice to perform oral sex on him. Janice refused, so the defendant ordered Melissa to \u201cdo it\u201d and \u201cshow her.\u201d Melissa complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Janice left the Gagnon home on September 24, 1992.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She testified that she had been babysitting there for Melissa and Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s grandchildren the previous evening and had invited two friends into the house, although she was not permitted to do so. Two of Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s relatives saw Janice\u2019s friends leave the house and told Mrs. Gagnon. Mrs. Gagnon consequently forced Janice to leave, and Janice was placed in another foster home. Melissa ran away to her aunt\u2019s home on March 8, 1993, because, she testified, Mrs. Gagnon often hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Melissa\u2019s aunt reported the sexual abuse to the police when Melissa told her about it several weeks after she left the Gag-non home. The police interviewed Melissa in April, 1993. Melissa testified that she disclosed the abuse because her brother and sisters were going to live with the Gagnons, and she was afraid that something would happen to them there. She wanted them to live with her at her aunt\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Janice testified that in October, 1992, shortly after she left the Gagnons\u2019 house, she told her grandmother about the sexual abuse because she had missed several menstrual periods and thought she was pregnant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Her grandmother told Janice\u2019s new foster mother, who contacted the Department of Social Services. Janice disclosed the sexual abuse to her social worker that fall, but the social worker did not believe her, so Janice decided not to go to the police at that time. She spoke to the police in April, 1993, after learning that Melissa had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Both girls testified that they had contact with social workers and had \u201cbig sisters\u201d while they lived in the Gagnon home, but that they did not disclose the sexual abuse during this time because they feared that Mrs. Gagnon would find out about it. The sisters argued with her frequently, she would hit them, and she sometimes had fist fights with Janice. Both girls testified that they were afraid of Mrs. Gagnon.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The defense presented evidence to support its theory that the girls had fabricated the accusations against Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s son primarily to attack Mrs. Gagnon, toward whom they were hostile because of her strict discipline and because she had forced Janice to leave. As evidence that the girls were lying, the defendant presented witnesses who testified that Melissa had become very upset when she learned that Janice had disclosed the abuse, and that she had accused Janice of lying. The girls\u2019 social worker testified that in April, 1992, Janice told her that she was not sexually active. After Janice\u2019s disclosures, the social worker testified, Melissa denied that the defendant had assaulted her sexually or that she could verify Janice\u2019s accusations. The defense counsel presented evidence that the girls had opportunities to disclose the abuse during private meetings with their social workers or at various after-school activities but that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>failed to do so. She also brought out inconsistent statements the girls had made concerning the circumstances, dates, and number of occurrences of the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Evidence was presented of the girls\u2019 difficult relationship with Mrs. Gagnon, including Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s testimony that after Melissa moved out, they argued over a bicycle, and that Melissa had threatened, \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll get you for this.\u201d Mrs. Gagnon testified that she and Janice argued continuously the summer before Janice left because Janice wanted to go out with boys and would not follow her rules, and that Mrs. Gagnon finally forced Janice to leave because of a serious infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In closing argument, the defense counsel speculated about motives the girls may have had for fabricating the charges. These included their desire for revenge on Mrs. Gagnon, Melissa\u2019s wish to have her brother and sisters leave the Gagnon home and come to live with her at her aunt\u2019s, and Janice\u2019s attempt to deflect the blame for her presumed pregnancy away from herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">1. <em>Evidence of Janice\u2019s prior sexual conduct. </em>The defendant filed a written motion in limine before trial, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, the rape-shield statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking to admit evidence that Janice was expelled from the Gagnon household because, while babysitting for the younger children the previous evening, she locked them in the bathroom so that she could have sex with her boyfriend. The defendant proffered the testimony of Nancy Augusta, a neighbor and also the grandmother of two of the defendant\u2019s children, who would testify that she had agreed with Mrs. Gagnon to check on Janice while Janice was babysitting for Melissa and two of Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s grandchildren. When Augusta entered the apartment, she found the two younger children in the bathroom, the door tied closed, and Janice in Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s bed, naked, with a boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The defendant argued in his written motion that this evidence illustrated Janice\u2019s bias against Mrs. Gagnon because the incident resulted in Mrs. Gagnon forcing Janice to leave, and it showed that she and Janice disagreed about Janice\u2019s inviting boys into the house. The judge ruled that the defendant could cross-examine Janice concerning the incident, but could not ask about sexual activity with the boy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He stated that there was no basis for such questioning and that it was not relevant to the defense that Janice made her complaint because she had been thrown out of the Gagnon household.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that Janice had a motive for fabrication in addition to her hostility toward Mrs. Gagnon. He argues that, believing she was pregnant, Janice \u201cdid not want to admit a voluntary sexual relationship to her grandmother and made up the story about [the defendant] to shield herself or the other boy from responsibility.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The short answer to this argument is that it was not made to the judge at trial. In fact, the defense counsel explicitly denied to the judge that she was relying on the theory that Janice had accused the defendant of rape because Janice believed she was pregnant by someone else.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">It is not surprising that the defendant decided against relying on this theory as his trial strategy. The date of the alleged sexual incident \u2014 September 23 \u2014 renders such a theory farfetched, Janice having received the negative results of a pregnancy test by October 4. In any event, \u201c[a] defendant \u2018is not permitted to raise an issue before the trial court on a specific ground, and then to present that issue to this court on a different ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>387 Mass. 191, 213 (1982), cert, denied, 459 U.S. 1175 (1983), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>362 Mass. 455, 472 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Based on the arguments before him, the trial judge correctly exercised his discretion in excluding evidence of Janice\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>leged sexual encounter on September 23. \u201cUnder the rape-shield statute, it is permissible to use sexual conduct evidence to show motive to lie or to explain a complaining witness\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, 427 </em>Mass. 642, 648 (1998). However, \u201cthe judge must also determine whether \u2018the weight and relevancy of said evidence is sufficient to outweigh its prejudicial effect to the victim.\u2019 G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B. This determination is within the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The allegation that Janice was caught naked in bed with a boy was irrelevant to the defense theory that Janice falsely accused the defendant in order to hurt Mrs. Gagnon. The judge did admit relevant evidence concerning that incident. This included Janice\u2019s testimony that she allowed friends into the apartment in violation of Mrs. Gagnon\u2019s rules, and that Mrs. Gagnon consequently forced her to leave. Moreover, ample additional evidence was presented concerning Janice\u2019s difficult relationship with Mrs. Gagnon, including arguments over Janice\u2019s infractions of her rules and Janice\u2019s wanting to date boys, physical altercations between Mrs. Gagnon and Janice, and Janice\u2019s contention that she was afraid of Mrs. Gagnon. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 751 (1983), \u201cthere is no lack of evidence on the issue of bias. Where evidence of bias is available by other means, no evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual history should be admitted.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domaingue, </em>397 Mass. 693, 700 (1986),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and cases cited. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 224-232 (1981) (evidence of the complainant\u2019s fear of a third prosecution for prostitution, which constituted a motive to lie, was improperly excluded); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 873-879 (1991) (evidence of the complainant\u2019s fear of her parent\u2019s reaction to her sexual activity, which constituted a motive to lie, was improperly excluded). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">2. <em>Joinder. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder of seven indictments for rape of a child. Four indictments, for the period between March, 1990, and July, 1992, concerned Janice, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>between twelve and fourteen years old at the time. Three indictments, for the period between December, 1992, and February, 1993, concerned Melissa, who was twelve years old at the time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the joinder constituted an abuse of discretion because the indictments were insufficiently related and evidence concerning each sister had an unfair spillover effect on the evidence concerning the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\u201cJoinder is a matter \u2018committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, 427 </em>Mass. 336, 345 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 593 (1997), cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998). \u201cRule 9 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 859 (1979), allows relatively free joinder if the offenses are related in the sense that they are based on the same criminal conduct, represent a series of episodes connected together, are of similar character, or represent a common pattern. See also Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1054-1056 (2d ed. 1983).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 111 (1995). \u201cFactors such as time and location play an important role in determining whether offenses are related. . . . However, our cases have allowed considerable differences with respect to these factors and other factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, 427 </em>Mass, at 345. In order to demonstrate that he was unfairly prejudiced by joinder, \u201ca defendant must show that any prejudice resulting from a joint trial is so compelling that it prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Janice and Melissa testified to a continuing course of conduct by the defendant which began when Melissa was seven and Janice was nine. The offenses were related in terms of the nature of the abuse, the location of the abuse, and the defendant\u2019s exploitation of his position as a foster brother and sometime caretaker to perpetrate the abuse. The girls were close in age when the abuse occurred, and the indictments, although not overlapping, were close in time. Moreover, Janice and Melissa testified to one episode \u2014 the defendant\u2019s seeking oral sex from Janice, being refused, then compelling it from Melissa \u2014 that, while not included in the indictment, was witnessed by both girls. Both girls were warned by the defendant not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>disclose the abuse, and each was threatened that she would be blamed if she did so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 502-503 (1984) (four indictments concerning sexual offenses against four different women at the same hotel were properly joined); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 416-417 (1990) (indictments concerning a physician\u2019s sexual abuse of six patients in his office over an eight-month period were properly joined); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 110-112 (indictments against grandparents for sexual abuse of two grandchildren were properly joined).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The defendant contends that there were separate theories of defense regarding each girl. This is not supported by the record. The overarching defense theory was that both girls fabricated the charges because of their anger at Mrs. Gagnon. The defendant did not, as he now states, rely on Janice\u2019s belief that she was pregnant as a motive for fabrication. See part 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">An important means of evaluating whether the defendant was unfairly prejudiced by spillover evidence is to ask whether the evidence concerning one victim would have been allowed in a separate trial concerning the other victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, 427 </em>Mass, at 347; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 111-112, and cases cited. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>this case falls squarely under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 472 (1982), and its progeny, permitting evidence of noncharged criminal behavior to show \u201ca common pattern or course of conduct.\u201d Under this rule, evidence of the defendant\u2019s abuse of Janice would be admissible in a separate trial concerning Melissa, and vice versa, and therefore joinder was permitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 696 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The defendant has not demonstrated that the offenses were unrelated or that he was unfairly prejudiced. The trial judge properly exercised his discretion with respect to joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The victims\u2019 names are fictitious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\">e defendant lived in the Gagnon household for part of the approximately six years that Janice and Melissa lived there.
