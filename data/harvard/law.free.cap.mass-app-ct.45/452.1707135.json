Because the judge\u2019s reasons and specific findings are insufficient to support a departure from the guidelines, the judgment of modification is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Both parties filed financial statements and testified at an evidentiary hearing. We take our facts from the judge\u2019s findings, supplementing them on occasion by uncontroverted facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The parties were married in 1981, their only child, Emily, was bom in 1982, and the parties were divorced in March, 1989. The 1989 divorce judgment provided, inter alia, for joint legal custody of Emily with physical custody in the mother, and child support of $600 a month.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, the father\u2019s gross weekly income was $709.62, and his weekly expenses were $620.15. The mother\u2019s earnings were under $200 a week. As the judge noted in his findings on the complaint for modification, the guidelines appeared not to have been followed in the original divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The judge briefly discussed the child\u2019s needs and the parents\u2019 respective incomes and acknowledged that the amount computed under the guidelines is, as the mother asserts, $339 a week.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the judge ordered the father\u2019s payments increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>to only $1,000 a month ($230.76 per week). As to the child\u2019s needs, the judge found that Emily is now fourteen and her needs have increased. She participates in many activities including skiing, going to camp, to the movies, and to malls with her friends. \u201c[Her] mother has paid all her activity expenses, gives her an allowance of $15.00 and $30.00-40.00 when she goes to a mall or visits with. her father. The mother also pays for electrolysis treatments for [Emily].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The judge\u2019s findings, taken in large part from the mother\u2019s financial statement, included the following: the mother has a gross weekly income of $436.18 which is composed of $250 wages, $139.53 child support, and $46.15 as \u201cincome from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>property settlement.\u201d See note 2, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>She owns a condominium which she values at $85,000 and has a mortgage balance of $86,500. Since the divorce, she has accumulated an IRA account with a present value of $4,000. She \u201chas a degree in early childhood education which she attained twenty (20) years ago at Fitchburg State College. Her present employment is as a substitute child care teacher. She works at three locations: Head Start, Fitchburg, MA., U. Mass Day Care and Cottage Children Center, Lake North, Worcester, MA. Her gross salary represents part time work. [She] chooses to work part time so as to be home with her teenage daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">As to the father, the judge found that his gross weekly income at the time of the divorce was $709.62 (net after taxes was $541.54); that his present gross weekly income from employment increased to $986.53 (net after taxes $630.18); that he owns the home he lives in which he values at $100,000 with a mortgage balance of $90,000; that he owns a timeshare in Edgartown; and that in 1995 he received $2,678 in rental income from that property \u201cbut sustained a net loss primarily due to mortgage payment of $920.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">After making the foregoing findings, the judge found a change of circumstances consisting of the increased needs of the child and the increased gross income of the father \u201cenabling him to meet those needs.\u201d In deciding not to apply the guidelines, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cThis conclusion is reached based upon a consideration of the amount of the Defendant\u2019s wage increase since the prior order, the amount of spendable income he has to meet his weekly expenses,<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> the financial needs of the child taken together with the choice of the [mother] not to maximize her income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">He then found \u201cbased upon a preponderance of the credible evidence and the inferences therefrom\u201d that the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>amount of child support was $1,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Before turning to the applicable legal principles which underlie any child support order, we mention some of the additional uncontroverted facts contained in the record which were not discussed by the judge. The father had a savings and investment account with his employer of $5,477, and testified that he received $550 per month rent in 1996 from an apartment in his two-family house. He also received a $4,055 tax refund for 1995, which suggests that his Federal tax withholding (as shown on his financial statement) is too high.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">In addition to the assets described by the judge, the mother\u2019s financial statement shows that she owns an insurance policy with a cash value of $4,150. The record does not indicate whether this is the policy required to be kept in force for the benefit of the child by the original divorce judgment.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The evidence as to the mother\u2019s part-time employment is not reflected in the judge\u2019s findings. She testified that although she only works thirty hours a week, she is away from home approximately forty-two hours due to the fact that she is not paid for lunch and because her commute to and from work takes approximately one hour each day. She also attached to her complaint the 1996-1997 Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, which indicates that the median earnings of full-time child care workers in 1994 was $260 per week, or $13,520 per year. While the mother conceded that she could obtain more money if she worked full time, the judge\u2019s order of $1,000 per month would be appropriate under the guidelines formula only if the mother earned approximately $41,000 per year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Based on our examination of the record as a whole, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>conclude that the judge gave insufficient reasons for deviating from the guidelines. \u201c[T]he Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines . . . have presumptive application in all cases seeking the modification of a child support order.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 723 (1997). General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 28, as inserted by St. 1993, c. 460, \u00a7 61, explicitly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cIn furtherance of the public policy that dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>children shall be maintained as completely as possible from the resources of their parents and upon a complaint filed after a judgment of divorce, orders of maintenance and for support of minor children shall be modified if there is an inconsistency between the amount of the existing order and the amount that would result from application of the child support guidelines promulgated by the chief justice for administration and management .... There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of the order which would result from the application of the guidelines is the appropriate amount of child support to be ordered. If, after taking into consideration the best interests of the child, the court determines that a party has overcome such presumption, the court shall make <em>specific </em>written findings indicating the amount of the order that would result from application of the guidelines; that the guidelines amount would be unjust or inappropriate under the circumstances; the <em>specific </em>facts of the case which justify departure from the guidelines; and that such departure is consistent with the best interests of the child.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The judge did not refer to any specific facts which show that the guidelines are unjust or inappropriate, and only one of the reasons cited \u2014 the part-time work of the mother \u2014 bears any relation to that question. As mentioned earlier, the judge based his conclusion upon \u201ca consideration of the amount of the [father\u2019s] wage increase since the prior order, the amount of spendable income he has to meet his weekly expenses, the financial needs of the child taken together with the choice of the [mother] not to maximize her income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">If the judge\u2019s reference to \u201cthe amount of the [father\u2019s] wage increase since the prior order\u201d meant that he took into account the relation between the father\u2019s wage increase and the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>order, and increased that order based only on the father\u2019s increase in salary since that time, the judge was in error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, indicates, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>even if there is no change in circumstances, a modification is appropriate if the prior order did not follow the guidelines. What is significant for purposes of the guidelines is the amount of the father\u2019s present gross income.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See computation forms, notes 3 and 8, <em>supra. </em>Since there was no showing that the father had unusual expenses distinguishing his situation from those of other noncustodial parents, his listed expenses do not serve to rebut the guidelines. Contrast <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Juskalian, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 202, 205-206 (1992), where an order was adjusted to accommodate extended long-distance visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The judge referred to the needs of the child; however, he \u201cmade no determination of what the child\u2019s needs were.\u201d See <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. 102, 109 (1986). Although the judge could properly take into account the mother\u2019s part-time work, in view of the only indication of potential earnings, namely, the Department of Labor Handbook, there was no basis for attributing $41,000 of income to her, when her gross annual income for thirty hours per week was $13,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Accordingly, the judgment must be vacated. Our examination of the record suggests that it is most unlikely on this record that a deviation from the guidelines is in order. Since, however, the judge has considerable discretion in these matters, see <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>G.W.A., </em>412 Mass. 435, 441 (1992), if, within thirty days of the rescript, the father files a petition for additional findings, <em>and </em>the judge considers that, notwithstanding the presumption of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, a deviation is in order, he may enter an order departing from the guidelines after such hearing, if any, as he deems advisable. If such an order is entered, the judge is to make specific findings setting forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>specific facts which justify a deviation, and the specific facts which make the particular deviation appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The mother also argues that the judge should have made the increased support order retroactive to the date of service of the complaint. A judge may in his or her discretion modify retroactively a support order \u201cwith respect to any period during which there is pending a complaint for modification.\u201d G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 13. <em>Kirtz </em>v. <em>Kirtz, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 147 (1981). <em>Stolk </em>v. <em>Stolk, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 905 (1991). The judge found that the evidence did not support the mother\u2019s claim that the father deliberately delayed the proceedings in order to avoid an increased support obligation. There was here no abuse of discretion. Similarly, we find no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s order that the parties alternate taking the child as an exemption for income tax purposes. Such an order is expressly permitted by the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The judgment of modification is vacated and a new judgment is to enter in compliance with the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines ordering child support in the amount of $339 per week unless the judge enters a new order of deviation in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-15\">The department filed a complaint for modification on behalf of the mother, Susan B. Foss. See G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The divorce judgment also valued the mother\u2019s interest in the parties\u2019 real estate at $50,000 and provided that the sum should be paid \u201cupon terms as can be agreed.\u201d At the time of modification the mother was receiving $46.15 a week as settlement for this property. The judge included this amount in her weekly income. Although on appeal she objects to the inclusion of this sum in the calculation of her income, she did not raise an objection below. Accordingly, the issue of the $46.15 is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In the computation set forth in note 3, <em>infra, </em>prepared by the attorney acting on the mother\u2019s behalf, the $46.15 is not included.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The worksheet (an exhibit at trial) shows the father\u2019s weekly gross income to be $1,094. Although this figure is not the figure set forth by the judge in his findings, he accepted the $339 figure as the amount to be paid under the guidelines. The $1,094 figure includes approximately $108 of rental income, a sum consistent with the father\u2019s testimony.

As noted earlier, the father\u2019s financial statement of 1989 listed weekly expenses of $620.15. His financial statements dated December, 1995, and May, 1996, showed expenses of $620.20.
