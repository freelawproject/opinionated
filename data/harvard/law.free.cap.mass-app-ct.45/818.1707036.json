In 1995, he proposed to establish a child care facility in a barn located on his property. After interior renovations to the barn that would leave its exterior and footprint unchanged, the facility would serve forty-seven children daily and be staffed by six adults. The Westwood build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ing commissioner (commissioner) denied Petrucci\u2019s application for a building permit to begin the renovations. The denial was affirmed by the Westwood board of appeals (board), which agreed with the commissioner that Petrucci was not entitled to the \u201cchild care facility exemption\u201d he was relying on under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, third par., because the proposed use was not properly either \u201cprimary, accessory or incidental.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following Petrucci\u2019s appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, a Land Court judge agreed with Petrucci that the claimed exemption for a child care facility under \u00a7 3 applied and granted him partial summary judgment allowing the desired use.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The judge remanded the matter to the commissioner for review of Petrucci\u2019s application on the issue of the applicability of the \u201creasonable regulations\u201d that the statute permits municipalities to impose on such a facility (see note 1, <em>supra).. </em>The commissioner thereafter rejected the application because the barn failed to comply with the zoning by-law\u2019s rear yard, side yard, and height requirements. The board again affirmed the commissioner. After trial on the issue of the reasonableness of applying those regulations to the proposed project, the Land Court judge again upheld Petrucci, rating that the imposition of the town\u2019s dimensional restrictions was unreasonable and ordering the board to issue the requested building permit. On the board\u2019s appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">1. <em>Applicability of the \u00a7 3 exemption. </em>The commissioner initially denied Petrucci\u2019s application on his view that the proposed use \u201cwould result in the establishment of two principal] uses\u201d on the property and was \u201cnot clearly accessory or incidental to a residential use.\u201d The board concurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>because the proposed facility \u201cwas so intensive\u201d as to constitute a primary use of the property, and it could find \u201cno authority\u201d for \u201ctwo . . . primary uses [to] ... be situated on one property.\u201d The board further determined that the facility was not sufficiently \u201csubordinate and related to the primary [residential] use of the property . . . [to] be construed [as] . . . accessory or incidental.\u201d The judge concluded that the board\u2019s reasoning was legally erroneous. He observed that nothing in the zoning by-law prohibited either child care facilities or the existence of more than one primary or principal use on a lot. He noted that the by-law even appeared to contemplate the possibility of multiple primary uses.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The judge\u2019s chief basis for endorsing Petrucci\u2019s reliance on the \u00a7 3 exemption, however, was his rejection of the board\u2019s restrictive construction of the statute. The board focused (both below and here) on the words \u201cprimary, accessory or incidental\u201d in the third paragraph of \u00a7 3. It contended that the difference between those terms and the language of the immediately preceding (second) paragraph of \u00a7 3, providing a zoning exemption for educational or religious uses,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> betokened a much narrower exemption intended by the Legislature for child care facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The board\u2019s argument runs thus: Whereas the exemption of the second paragraph of \u00a7 3 speaks broadly and generally of \u201cuse for religious ... or for educational purposes,\u201d the third paragraph requires that the child care facility \u201cuse\u201d be either \u201cprimary, accessory or incidental.\u201d Each of those words must be read literally so as to give them their customary meaning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Since the principal use of the Petracci property is already residential, the child care facility cannot be a \u201cprimary\" use, because \u201c[i]t is . . . clear that you cannot have two primary uses [of the property] either under the by-law or by definition.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor can the facility pass muster as an \u201caccessory\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d use under the zoning decisions construing those terms, which hold that such a use not only must be minor in significance to the primary use but also must have a normal or customary subordinate relationship to that use. Compare <em>Harvard </em>v. <em>Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 438 (1971); <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dunstable, </em>418 Mass. 841, 844-846 (1994); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Acton, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (1997); <em>Maselbas </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of N. Attleborough, ante </em>54, 56-57 (1998). Given the size of the facility (six adults and forty-seven children) in relation to the several Petrucci family members already there engaged in \u201ctypical family\u201d residential living, it will be so comparatively large, intensive, and separate an operation as to be neither accessory nor incidental.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that the proposed child care facility cannot be deemed \u201caccessory\u201d or \u201cincidental\u201d to a residential use, we nonetheless conclude that the board was wrong and the judge correct in determining that the facility qualified for the exemption of the third paragraph of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3. We need look no further than the language of the statute, which states that a zoning by-law may not \u201cprohibit, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>require a special permit for, the use of . . . structures, or the expansion of existing structures, for the primary . . . purpose of operating a child care facility.\u201d Petrucci\u2019s proposal falls squarely within that injunction. His existing structure, the barn, will be used (whether or not expanded) for the primary, indeed the sole, purpose of housing a child care facility operation; it cannot, therefore, be prohibited or subject to special permit requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Even were the board correct in its assertion that the West-wood by-law does not permit multiple primary uses on a single lot, such a prohibition is exactly what the statute declares impermissible with respect to child care facilities. The board\u2019s reiterated assertions that the exemption applies only where the child care facility can be characterized as the sole primary use \u201cof the property\u201d overlook the second half of the disjunctive statutory phrase, \u201cuse of land or structures.\u201d The board thereby runs afoul of <em>Watros </em>v. <em>Greater Lynn Mental Health &amp; Retardation Assn., Inc., </em>421 Mass. 106 (1995), dealing with the educational purpose exemption of the second paragraph of \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">In dismissing the argument of abutters who challenged the proposed use on residential property of a bam to house and educate retarded adults \u2014 that the exemption applied only when the educational use occupied the entire property \u2014 the court in <em>Watros </em>stressed that the second paragraph \u201cspeaks not once, but twice, of \u2018land or structures\u2019 as the focus of the exemption.\u201d 421 Mass. at 113. The \u201cconstrictive result\u201d flowing from the abutters\u2019 reading of the statute was \u201cneither required by the language of the statute nor consistent with its purpose,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 114, which was \u201cto prevent local interference with the use of real property\u201d \u2014 whether of land or of structures thereon :\u2014 for the exempt purposes identified in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 113. Here, also, the plain language of the statute (which, as in <em>Watros, </em>speaks not once but twice of \u201cland or structures\u201d) and its manifest intent \u2014 to broaden, rather than narrow, the opportunities for establishing child care facilities in the Commonwealth<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 overwhelm the board\u2019s constrictive effort to parse any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>substantial child care facility on a residential property out of the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>2. <em>Reasonableness of regulations. </em>As in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, </em>415 Mass. 772, <em>111 </em>&amp; n.6 (1993), we are concerned with a prior nonconforming structure. Despite the <em>Campbell </em>precedent, however, there was no inquiry as to whether alterations necessary to transform the barn into a child care facility would take it outside the protection granted by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, to prior nonconforming structures. Pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, there could be no denial, of the right to use the bam as a child care facility. Accordingly, analysis pursuant to \u00a7 6 would not turn on any impact of the <em>use </em>of the bam as a child care facility but on whether the bam <em>structure, </em>as altered, would be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">This case was decided in the Land Court solely on the basis of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, third par., and, while it appears unlikely that the proposed renovations of the barn would fail the \u00a7 6 test, the record does not invite resolution under \u00a7 6. In any event, we conclude that Petmcci is entitled to relief based on \u00a7 3 and that there is no reason to require proceedings under \u00a7 6. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, </em>415 Mass. at 777-778 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The judge ruled that Petmcci had successfully demonstrated the unreasonableness of the dimensional requirements that the commissioner and the board imposed upon the barn. The relevant sections of the by-law require a side yard width of twenty feet and a rear yard depth of thirty feet, with a maximum building height of twenty-five feet. The bam is over thirty-four feet high and is located only twelve feet from both the side and rear lot lines. Compliance with the zoning requirements is possible only if the bam is physically relocated on the lot.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The parties agree that the controlling authority on the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>ableness of the application of zoning regulations to exempt uses under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, is <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>415 Mass. 753 (1993),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which announced an ad hoc, fact-specific approach to resolving disputes in most \u00a7 3 situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">\u201c[T]he question of the reasonableness of a local zoning requirement, as applied to a proposed . . . [exempt] use, will depend on the particular facts of each case. Because local zoning laws are intended to be uniformly applied, an [applicant] . . . making challenges similar to those made by Tufts will bear the burden of proving that the local requirements are unreasonable as applied to its proposed project. The . . . [applicant] might do so by demonstrating that compliance would substantially diminish or detract from the usefulness of a proposed structure, or impair the character of the . . . [applicant\u2019s property], without appreciably advancing the municipality\u2019s legitimate concerns. Excessive cost of compliance with a requirement imposed [by the zoning ordinance] . . . , without significant gain in terms of municipal concerns, might also qualify as unreasonable regulation of an . . . [exempt] use.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">415 Mass. at 759-760. The judge\u2019s conclusion, that enforcing Westwood\u2019s dimensional controls in Petrucci\u2019s circumstances would be unreasonable, represented a proper application of the factors set forth in <em>Tufts College.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Based upon the trial testimony of Petrucci\u2019s expert witnesses on zoning issues and historic buildings and of Petrucci himself (who had been in the construction business for thirty-five</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>years),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge relied on the following findings and undisputed facts:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The two-story, 4,960 square foot bam was built between 1840 and 1850 and is \u201ca wonderful example\u201d of the transitional \u201cGreek Revival Italianate\u201d style. As such, it is \u201ca rare building form\u201d that possesses historic and architectural merit deserving of preservation. It is surrounded by mature trees and particularly dense foliage on the sides closest to adjoining lots. In order to comply with the by-law by relocating the bam elsewhere on Petrucci\u2019s lot, numerous mature trees would have to be cut down and removed (from both the old and the new locations), a new foundation excavated, the entire bam lifted up and moved to the new foundation, and its roof reconstmcted to lower its height. All of that compliance work not only would destroy the barn\u2019s unique Italianate cupola and Palladian window, but also would adversely change the massing of the structure, disturb the sense of the building\u2019s continuity, and min both its historical character and architectural integrity. The cost to Petrucci to move the bam would be approximately $150,000, beyond the cost of renovating it to serve as a child care facility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The municipality\u2019s legitimate concerns served by the setback and height requirements in the by-law \u2014 safety, aesthetics, and privacy<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 would all be negatively affected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>relocation of Petrucci\u2019s barn. In its new, unscreened location, the barn would be significantly closer and more visible to Petrucci\u2019s residence and to neighboring homes. As a result, the potential fire danger would be increased, the privacy of the Petruccis and their neighbors would be reduced, and the loss of so many trees would adversely impair the community\u2019s character. Were the bam not moved and the child care facility abandoned, all of the present zoning infirmities would continue to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">In light of this evidence, the judge determined that imposition of the town\u2019s dimensional requirements on the project would levy excessive costs of compliance on Petrucci and effectively deny the use of the premises for a child care facility; would serve no valid goals of municipal zoning regulation, see <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>City Council of Lynn, </em>415 Mass. at 779; and would, in fact, detrimentally affect neighborhood safety, aesthetics, and privacy. Therefore, he was satisfied that Petrucci had carried his burden under <em>Tufts College </em>of showing the unreasonableness of requiring compliance with those requirements. We agree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Tufts College, </em>415 Mass. at 762-764 (challenged zoning requirements were not shown to be unreasonable as applied to project because applicant failed to put in any evidence regarding estimated cost or difficulty or hardship of compliance, whereas municipality demonstrated that compliance would enhance safety and ease serious parking problems in the affected area).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">3. <em>Judge\u2019s ordering of the permit. </em>The amended final judgment ordered the board, over its objection, to issue Petrucci a building permit for the child care facility. The board charged that such an order erroneously deprived abutters of their appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>late rights under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. The board\u2019s theory was that so long as it was defending its decisions upholding the commissioner, abutters were adequately represented and not aggrieved; but that they might become aggrieved, on bases other than those relied on by the board, when the board issued the building permit. The judge observed that the board had failed to state that any such potential abutters even existed (much less to identify them or their supposedly novel, separate grievances) or to suggest any additional issues that might be raised by such hypothetical abutters. Consequently, he rejected the board\u2019s position as sheer speculation supported by no relevant authority. He was satisfied that the facts in this case encompassed every criticism of the project which an abutter might reasonably raise in a \u00a7 17 appeal and reflected the board\u2019s protective persistence in pursuing all legitimate issues. The judge\u2019s refusal to allow further delay in implementing Petrucci\u2019s lawful project appears eminently sound to us. It was an exercise of his discretion under \u00a7 17 to grant such relief \u201cas justice and equity may require,\u201d since it is clear from the record that the same ultimate result would ensue from an unspecific remand as that effected by the challenged order.

There, the court concluded that the many distinctions between normal, residential use dnd a busy day care operation made the latter so different from the former that it could not be deemed a usual incident of residential living. Cases in other jurisdictions appear divergent. Compare <em>Schofield </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Dennis, </em>169 N.J.

Co. of America, </em>390 Mass. 701, 704-705 (1984), both related statutes, see <em>Plymouth County Retirement Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub.

L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3, second par., does not distinguish between \u201cprincipal\u201d and \u201caccessory\u201d uses, while the third paragraph of \u00a7 3 explicitly does. The board\u2019s invocation of <em>Watros </em>fails precisely because it rests on the assumption, rejected by <em>Watros, </em>that an entire parcel of \u201cland\u201d must be used to benefit from the exemption and ignores the presence of the word \u201cstructure\u201d in the statute. The board cites no other relevant authority for its statutory construction argument, but presumably relies on two standard canons. First, the use of different language in related statutes dealing with the same subject matter ordinarily indicates that different meanings were intended. See 2B Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 51.02 (5th ed. 1992). Cf. <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982). However, like all such canons, this one does not apply when (as here) the statutory language is so clear as to make extrinsic aids unnecessary, especially an aid whose application would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s undoubted purpose. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 483-484 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fall River Motor Sales, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 302, 315-316 (1991). Second, \u201c[w]henever possible, we give meaning to each word in the legislation; no word in a statute should be considered superfluous.\u201d <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots, Atl. &amp; Gulf Maritime Region, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). Again, even if applicable, this is not an ineluctable doctrine, see <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Greyhound Real Estate Fin. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 289 (1996), and in any event must yield to the even more fundamental precept, expressly relied on by the Land Court judge, that \u201ca strictly literal reading of a statute should not be adopted if the result will be to thwart or hamper the accomplishment of the statute\u2019s obvious purpose, and if another construction which would avoid this undesirable result is possible.\u201d <em>Watros, </em>421 Mass. at 113. In light of our holding above, we do not have to depend upon the judge\u2019s rationale \u2014 that by use of the words \u201cprimary, accessory or incidental\u201d in the statute \u201cthe legislature intended to cover all bases. . . and to leave no type of [child care facility] use beyond the reach\u201d of the exemption \u2014 although we find the judge\u2019s construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>this remedial statute persuasive. See <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996); <em>Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., ante </em>226, 233 (1998). We note, in this connection, that the board has failed to identify any use or purpose that might be but was not included or encompassed within the words \u201cprincipal, accessory or incidental.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The commissioner and the board determined that, short of relocation, Petrucci would have to obtain a variance, after site plan review. On Petrucci\u2019s second motion for partial summary judgment, the judge ruled that the proposed exempt use could not be made subject to either variance procedures or site plan review, a conclusion in accord with <em>Trustees of Tufts College </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>415 Mass. 753, 760, 765 (1993). The board has not questioned that ruling in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b859-8\">In his first partial summary judgment decision, the judge ruled that the <em>Tufts College </em>analysis, though arising in an educational use context, was applicable to child care facilities (another ruling unchallenged here). The basic rationale of <em>Tufts College </em>has been applied to another provision of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 3. See <em>Prime </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Norwell, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 802 (1997) (involving the agricultural use exemption of the first paragraph). Given the identity of the language of the \u201creasonable regulations\u201d provisions in the second and third paragraphs of \u00a7 3, the teaching of <em>Tufts College </em>regarding the scope of the educational exemption vis-\u00e1-vis local zoning regulation was properly invoked by the judge. See <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184,. 188-189 (1969); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Provincetown, </em>404 Mass. 571, 573 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b860-5\">At the trial on the issue of the reasonableness of requiring Petrucci\u2019s compliance with Westwood\u2019s rear yard, side yard, and building height requirements, the board called no witnesses and adduced no evidence to show how the imposition of those limitations on Petrucci\u2019s project would advance legitimate municipal concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The board does not complain that any of the judge\u2019s findings or the evidence presented by Petrucci\u2019s witnesses on which the judge relied was erroneous, except with respect to the finding regarding the estimated cost of compliance to relocate the barn. The board\u2019s challenge in that respect is wrong (see note 13, <em>infra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The board incorrectly maintains that the evidence regarding the cost of the barn\u2019s relocation (and, hence, the \u201ccost of compliance\u201d highlighted by the Supreme Judicial Court in the <em>Tufts College </em>test) was tainted by hearsay. This assertion overlooks the fact that Petrucci testified to his own understanding of the cost to move the barn, based on his thirty-five years of experience as a licensed builder. See <em>Colangeli </em>v. <em>Construction Serv. Co., </em>353 Mass. 527, 529-530 (1968); <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>356 Mass. 739 (1970); <em>Larabee </em>v. <em>Potvin Lumber Co., </em>390 Mass. 636, 643 (1983). The judge noted that this testimony was received without objection. In any event, the judge ruled, quite appropriately in our view, that \u201cit is a matter of common sense that the cost to move a stmcture of the size and age of this bam would be significant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The board does not disagree that these are the municipal purposes served by the relevant by-law requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The board\u2019s sole criticism of the judge\u2019s decision on the issue of regulatory reasonableness (other than its misplaced assertion that Petrucci\u2019s cost of compliance evidence was hearsay, see note 13, supra) is that Petrucci did not demonstrate what the profits might be from his venture, which, the board suggested, might easily support the cost of compliance and make it reasonable. The board\u2019s critique fails in two respects. First, it rests on the assumption, contrary to the record, that the child care facility would be a commercial, for-profit enterprise. Second, it is based on the premise that different standards for gauging the costs of compliance ought to apply for proprietary as opposed to nonprofit chid care facilities. That premise finds no support in the language of the statute, nor in its purpose. Such a discrimination on the basis of corporate form would tend to create a significant disincentive for the private sector to address the public purpose of making child care services as widely available as their need requires.
