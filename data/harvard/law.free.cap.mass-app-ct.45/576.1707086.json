See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>399 Mass. 17, 20-21 &amp; n.5 (1987). She also contends that, cumulatively, these errors created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. In addition, she claims ineffective assistance of counsel. Although this may not have been the Commonwealth\u2019s finest hour, we are constrained to affirm. We will, however, discuss a grave concern we have with the manner in which the Commonwealth routinely utilizes expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">On July 11, 1996, at 10:30 p.m., Officer William Feeney of the Boston police department drug control unit conducted surveillance at the intersection of Tremont and Stuart Streets in front of a Christy\u2019s Market. Feeney surveyed the area through binoculars from the inside of a vehicle parked approximately 250 to 300 feet away. At trial, he testified that a woman and a man, later identified as the defendant and Charles Gomes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were standing together in front of Christy\u2019s when a white woman approached, them and began talking. The woman handed Gomes some cash; he then spit an item out of his mouth, placed it into her hand, and she walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Defense counsel objected to this portion of Feeney\u2019s testimony on the ground that it had not been disclosed during discovery. At sidebar, the judge overruled the objection, ruling the testimony admissible for the limited purpose of showing knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>411 Mass. 345, 354 (1991). See also Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.7 (6th ed. 1994). He then gave a limiting instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">When direct examination resumed Feeney stated, \u201c[F]rom my experience, I believed a drug transaction had taken place.\u201d Trial counsel objected, claiming that the officer was comment<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>ing on the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The judge responded: \u201cNo. The evidence may be used only to the extent that it\u2019s appropriate in the case, on the officer\u2019s state of mind. The officer said that that\u2019s what he believed happened. We\u2019re taking it for that limited purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Next, the officer testified that ten minutes after the transaction with the unidentified white woman, he observed the defendant and Gomes talking. The defendant then reached toward the front of her pants, pulled out an item, and gave it to Gomes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Gomes appeared to pull an item apart, put something in his hand, move his hand up to his open mouth, then throw a clear plastic bag on the ground. Moments after this incident, a black male, later identified as Nathan Gilbert, approached the defendant and Gomes. After a brief conversation, Gilbert handed Gomes money; Gomes spit something into his hand and gave it to Gilbert. After describing this incident, Feeney commented that it \u201cwas consistent with a drug deal also.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (There was no objection to this testimony.) Feeney testified that Gomes then handed the money he had received from Gilbert to the defendant. Defense counsel objected to this statement and moved to strike it on the ground that there was nothing in the discovery he had received about the transfer of money from Gomes to the defendant. (The defendant had approximately $700 in cash on her person when she was arrested.) The prosecution conceded that the information was not in the police report, but argued that a police report \u201cdoesn\u2019t always have to say everything.\u201d The trial judge, after hearing brief arguments from the parties, denied the motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Gilbert was arrested and found with five small plastic bags of crack cocaine in his pocket. Soon thereafter, the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Gomes were arrested. While approaching Gomes to arrest him, Feeney and the other officers noticed Gomes make a movement toward his mouth. They grabbed Gomes\u2019s hands and arms and wrestled him to the ground. When recalling the motion Gomes made towards his mouth, Feeney testified, over objection, \u201cI felt it was consistent with, with the drug, the drug dealer with the drugs going into his mouth.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">1. <em>Expert testimony. </em>First, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that Feeney\u2019s testimony exceeded the permissible bounds of expert evidence; we will also comment briefly on the difficult and confusing area of police expert testimony. Without question, there are many potential pitfalls in permitting a percipient police witness such as Feeney to provide expert testimony. See, e.g., Note, The Admissibility of Ultimate Issue Expert Testimony by Law Enforcement Officers in Criminal Trials, 93 Colum. L. Rev. 231 (1993). It is easy for the line between specific observations and expert generalizations to become blurred in these situations. For this reason, when possible, the practice should best be avoided. However, this is certainly not to say that, with adequate care, error must necessarily result from the admission of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">On the two occasions at issue here, the Commonwealth presented Feeney with questions as to his opinion, based on the facts of the case at hand. This alone, however, did not render the officer\u2019s testimony improper. Questions grounded in previously admitted evidence may be posed to an expert witness calling for an opinion within the expert\u2019s field of expertise, even if the witness\u2019s reply thereby touches on the ultimate issue of the case. The only limitation is that the subject matter discussed be within the witness\u2019s field of expertise and that the witness not <em>directly </em>express his views on the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>400 Mass. 550, 554 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin C., </em>419 Mass. 54, 59-60 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordero, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1993). Indeed, as with any witness, the Commonwealth is entitled \u2014 indeed expected \u2014 to focus the expert\u2019s testimony on the facts at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The real problem is the form of Feeney\u2019s testimony. As noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>he stated at one point, \u201c[F]rom my experience, I believed a drug transaction had taken place.\u201d Later he opined that Go-mes\u2019s actions were \u201cconsistent with, with the drug, the drug dealer with the drags going into his mouth.\u201d While in the latter instance Feeney used the talismanic \u201cconsistent with\u201d locution that both this court and the Supreme Judicial Court have approved in numerous prior cases, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>410 Mass. 199, 202 (1991), the former statement is very similar to expert testimony that we held improper in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 950, 951-952 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass. 366, 375 &amp; n.13 (1995). Nonetheless, we do not believe that reversal is required in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See and compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>421 Mass. 547, 555 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In <em>Woods, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 951, <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass, at 375 n.13, percipient police witnesses opined that \u201ca drag transaction had taken place\u201d and one police witness testified that he believed that \u201cthe defendant was selling crack cocaine.\u201d These statements are the functional equivalent of the first contested remark here. Such testimony amounts to a personal assurance by the witness that the crime charged had occurred, and thereby constitutes an improper intrusion into the fact-finding function of the jury. Admission of the statement in that form, therefore, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">However, in view of the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case here, including the physical evidence of the drags taken from Gilbert, the $700 recovered from the defendant, and Feeney\u2019s detailed eyewitness testimony, it is unlikely that Feeney\u2019s improper comment was a decisive factor for the jury. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 932 (1995). Even without such testimony, the jury would have known that Feeney believed that Gomes and the defendant had been involved in drag sales. The improper comment was made in reference to a transfer that was <em>not </em>part of the conduct upon which the complaint was based, further reducing the possibility for prejudice. As in <em>Woods, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 952, <em>S.C., </em>419 Mass, at 375-376, the erroneous admission of the expert testimony was insufficiently prejudicial to require relief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>425 Mass. 633, 645-646 (1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>(where Commonwealth\u2019 s evidence is strong, no retrial required despite fact that police expert testimony exceeded permissible limits).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In assessing whether expert evidence strays over the line in cases such as this, in the end the sole touchstone should not be whether a witness uses any particular figure of speech. Despite the continued emphasis in the case law on whether a police witness testifies simply that observed conduct was a drug transaction or (by virtue of better coaching) states instead that a defendant\u2019s actions were \u201cconsistent\u201d with a drug transaction, such semantical differences almost certainly make no difference to jurors. Consequently, the determination whether evidence is within the proper scope of opinion testimony should not turn exclusively on the precise locution used.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Rather, in determining whether particular expert testimony is lawful,, the better practice is to focus the analysis on whether the evidence is <em>explanatory. </em>The role of an expert witness is to help jurors interpret evidence that lies outside of common experience. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colin </em>C., 419 Mass, at 59-60; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Munera, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 384-385 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordero, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 924. So long as expert testimony is directed to that purpose, it is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">When testimony is presented in conclusory form, as in <em>Woods, </em>couched simply in terms of whether a defendant did or did not commit a particular offense, it serves no educative function. Such testimony amounts to little more than vouching for the Commonwealth\u2019s position. When the evidence comes from the mouth of a police expert witness, and so bears an official imprimatur, the likelihood for prejudice is great.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Applying this form of analysis, we think that the mere use of the \u201cconsistent with\u201d formulation should not amount to a sure safe harbor for prosecutors. The better practice in drug cases, especially when an expert is a percipient witness, is to confine opinion testimony to the explanation of specific unusual or cryptic conduct, without stating, in any form, whether such conduct amounts to a criminal offense. Here, for example, Feeney could have simply explained that drug dealers often store their wares in their mouths and often hire confederates to hold large amounts of cash. There was no necessity for him to link these facts with his personal observations and conclude, in so many words, that the defendant was involved in illegal drug sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>This type of testimony \u2014 regardless of whether the \u201cconsistent with\u201d formulation is used \u2014 takes unfair advantage of the dual role of police officers in these circumstances. The testimony of a combined expert/percipient witness has unique persuasive value. Every effort should be made, therefore, to ensure that the Commonwealth does not press this advantage unfairly. In future cases, the government would be well advised to refrain from permitting police witnesses to state, in any form, whether conduct amounted to a drug sale. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cordero, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 924 (questions must be such as not to cause expert witness to comment on guilt or innocence). The expert\u2019s role is to explain; it is for the jury to reach the ultimate conclusions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">2. <em>Failure to disclose evidence. </em>Next, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth failed to comply with pretrial discovery orders by not disclosing the details of Feeney\u2019s observations of the drug sales \u2014 details that ultimately were included in the officer\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Without question, the two most damaging pieces of evidence against the defendant were her presence during the first, uncharged transfer, and Gomes\u2019s transfer of money to her after the Gilbert transaction. Neither event was documented in the police report that was turned over to the defendant in response to her discovery request. However, as noted, Feeney ultimately provided detailed testimony regarding those events at trial. The failure to disclose this information was improper, but we do not think a retrial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Although Feeney\u2019s testimony was an important part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant has not suggested that foreknowledge of the substance of Feeney\u2019s trial testimony would have caused her to alter her trial strategy in any way. Moreover, on cross-examination defense counsel was able to use the fact that Feeney\u2019s testimony varied from the police report to impeach his credibility. There is simply insufficient prejudice to warrant any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Although we have concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s omission did not harm the defendant\u2019s case here, we by no means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>condone the government\u2019s conduct. As we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 440 (1992), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pizzotti, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 382 (1989), a public prosecutor has a \u201ccontinuing duty \u2018to disclos[e] all material which is even possibly exculpatory, as a prophylactic against reversible error and in order to save court time arguing about it.\u2019 \u201d The Commonwealth here forgot this admonition and, as a result, very easily could have put the public to the needless expense of a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-16\">A count for conspiracy to distribute a class B controlled substance was dismissed with the consent of the defendant after she was convicted of the other two charges.

And you are to use it, if you wish, only for the purpose of indicating the surrounding circumstances.
