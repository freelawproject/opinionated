Her parents\u2019 home State is more than 1,000 miles away. The mother came to Massachusetts on October 6, 1993, gave birth, and returned to the parents\u2019 home State on October 20, 1993, a few hours after the Massachusetts Department of Social Services (DSS) obtained an emergency order granting DSS temporary custody of the five day old baby. So far as the record shows, the father has never been in Massachusetts. Astrid has lived with her preadoptive foster parents since July, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Neither parent has attended any of the proceedings in Massachusetts concerning custody of Astrid. After a four-day trial conducted over a five-month period, a District Court judge concluded that the parents are unfit to raise Astrid and that it is in the child\u2019s best interests to dispense with the parents\u2019 consent to adoption. The parents appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">The mother challenges the admission of a statement regard-ring the death of the couple\u2019s first daughter that she gave prosecutors in her home State under an immunity agreement. The father claims there was insufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s findings that the parents abandoned Astrid and that she would be harmed by removal from her preadoptive home. He also claims that the judge erred in considering out-of-State evidence concerning the parents\u2019 conduct toward their other children and evidence of the parents\u2019 threatening behavior toward officials in Massachusetts. Finally, he argues that the judge should not have allowed DSS to amend the custody petition to include a petition to dispense with parental consent to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Facts. </em>The judge made the following findings based on testimony at trial. Prior to the mother\u2019s arrival in Massachusetts, the father telephoned Adoptions with Love (adoption agency or agency), a private adoption agency in Newton, and discussed the parents\u2019 intention to surrender for adoption the baby they were expecting. The agency advertises nationally in telephone books and pays for all travel and medical expenses associated with a baby\u2019s birth, whether or not a birth mother ultimately decides to proceed with the adoption. After her arrival in Massachusetts, but before giving birth to Astrid, the mother told an agency social worker \u201csome vague details\u201d about the death of the parents\u2019 first child and the parents\u2019 loss of custody of their second child. The mother declined to authorize contact with officials in the parents\u2019 home State.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Astrid was bom with a heart problem. She was also clinically jaundiced and at extreme risk for anemia. Shortly after her birth, the mother expressed reservations about proceeding with the adoption as planned. Concerned about releasing the baby to return to the home State with the mother, given the baby\u2019s health and limited but disturbing information about the parents\u2019 history with their other children, the agency contacted DSS. DSS\u2019s contact with the home State officials prompted DSS to initiate emergency custody proceedings. On October 20, 1993, the court awarded temporary emergency custody to DSS. Although the mother agreed to remain in Massachusetts to attend the seventy-two hour custody hearing scheduled for October 22, 1993, she did not appear, having already returned to her husband. DSS was granted custody of Astrid at the seventy-two hour hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The parents\u2019 history with their two children bom in the home State, as introduced at trial primarily through the testimony of the independent court investigator and of Corporal Dwayne Isringhausen, a criminal investigator from the home State, was as follows. After taking their first daughter from the hospital against medical orders, the parents disappeared. Authorities could not locate them, because they had given numerous false addresses. A year after the birth of their first child, the couple had a second child, a son, who was taken into protective custody shortly after birth. The investigation and court proceedings resulting in termination of the parents\u2019 rights to consent to the adoption of the second child prompted authorities to resume their search for the first child. Isringhausen finally found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>parents\u2019 home: they were living in a pop-up camping trailer located in a wooded rural area on an unmarked road. When asked about the baby daughter, the father requested a written guarantee against prosecution before answering. Isringhausen refused. The father became irate and denied that the baby had ever existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Isringhausen obtained a search warrant and returned to the parents\u2019 property. Neither parent cooperated, and he arrested both, charging them with endangering the welfare of a child. Shortly thereafter, the mother agreed to reveal the location of the baby\u2019s body and consented to a second search. During that search, the mother led the investigator to an area within 200 feet of the camper. Isringhausen found the baby\u2019s remains in a shallow grave. The baby\u2019s body was too badly decomposed to determine the cause of her death. Ultimately, the father pled guilty to endangering the welfare of a child and served four months of a one-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The judge also found that the mother \u201ceffectively abandoned\u201d two older children in the home State, both born during her marriage to her previous husband. In his last finding of fact, the judge noted that neither parent appeared for trial, despite what he described as \u201cunprecedented, extraordinary efforts by their counsel,\u201d including the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement to pay the parents\u2019 airfare and hotel accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">1. <em>The immunity agreement. </em>The mother gave a statement to authorities in her home State in which she provided an account of the first baby\u2019s death. A cassette tape recording of the statement was admitted in evidence at trial, and Corporal Isringhausen, who was present when the mother gave her statement, testified as to its contents at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Briefly, the substance of the mother\u2019s statement was as follows. The night before the baby was found dead, the father forced the mother to put the baby, who was four months old at the time, in an inoperable van parked near the camper because he didn\u2019t want to hear the baby cry. The father then put pots and pans on a chair in front of the door to the camper to make noise in case the mother tried to get up to go to the baby. During the night, the mother heard the pots and pans being moved, felt cool air from the door, and heard the father walk out of the camper toward the van. When the mother went to the van the next morning, the baby was dead. The baby was wet with sweat (it was July and the van was hot), with her feet curled up under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>her. The area around the baby\u2019s nose and lips was blue or purple. There was a large blanket over the baby\u2019s head, which had not been there when they put her to bed. The father said the baby got what she deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">At trial, counsel for the mother objected to the investigator\u2019s testimony on the grounds of relevance and hearsay, as well as prejudice, which the judge properly overruled. On appeal, the mother presents a tangle of other grounds for excluding the statement, citing statutes and case law in the Commonwealth, as well as her home State, relating to the privilege against self-incrimination, immunity principles, and voluntariness to support her arguments. DSS argues that, by failing to object on these grounds, the mother has waived these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">A party may not raise an issue before the trial court on one ground, and then present that issue to an appellate court on a different ground. <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 107 (1956). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tyree, </em>387 Mass. 191, 213 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1175 (1983). See <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 133 (1996) (party not entitled to present an argument on appeal on an issue not presented in the court below absent exceptional cases or particular circumstances where injustice might otherwise result). The circumstances of this case illustrate the reasons for this rule. Not only does the mother ask that we reverse the trial judge on an evidentiary question on grounds the trial judge never had an opportunity to address, but in order to support her new argument, she seeks to add to the record the immunity agreement and an affidavit of the prosecuting attorney, neither of which was entered in evidence below.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The mother argues that her failure to identify the proper grounds for objection should be excused because issues regarding an immunity agreement are not likely to arise in child custody cases. However, her reliance on the clairvoyance exception in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10 (1986), to support this argument is misplaced. That exception applies when the constitutional principle at issue has not been sufficiently developed to expect counsel to make the objection and the principle is subsequently applied retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. Such is not the case here. Moreover, the parents had copies of the mother\u2019s statement prior to trial because it was produced as part of the attachment to the court investigator\u2019s report. The first few pages of the transcript include discussion of the \u201cAgreement of Immunity.\u201d We conclude that the parents did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>waive this objection. But even were we to excuse the mother\u2019s failure to recognize the issue, the statement was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Despite the fundamental rights at issue, \u201c[c]ustody proceedings are not criminal in nature and, accordingly, the full panoply of constitutional rights afforded criminal defendants does not apply in these cases.\u201d <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 616 (1986). \u201c[T]he State does not act to punish misbehaving parents but to protect children.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The cases have consistently \u201crejected . . . opportunities to rule that certain constitutional rights attaching in a criminal proceeding apply in custody cases,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 617, including Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barboza, </em>387 Mass. 105, 114, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1020 (1982) (privilege protects only disclosures that could be used in prosecution and does not prevent disclosures from being used in non-criminal commitment proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">As a matter of constitutional principle, an immunity agreement must be co-extensive with a witness\u2019s right against self-incrimination. <em>Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 453 (1972) (use immunity). <em>Patch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, </em>397 Mass. 454, 456 (1986) (transactional immunity). See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Colleton, </em>387 Mass. 790, 795-799 (1982). The mother cannot be prosecuted for any matter covered in the immunity agreement, see <em>State ex rel. Munn </em>v. <em>McKelvey, </em>733 S.W.2d 765, 770 (Mo. 1987) (doctrine of equitable immunity), even though at the time of the agreement, prosecuting attorneys in the home State had no authority to confer immunity on a witness because there was no statute granting them such power. See <em>id. </em>at 769. Massachusetts has also honored stipulations of immunity not based on statutory authority when a witness has relied upon the agreement by giving testimony \u201cto ensure that the public faith pledged [to the witness] is duly and fully kept.\u201d <em>Matter of DeSaulnier (No. 2), </em>360 Mass. 761, 764 (1971). This is all the Federal or State constitutions require. See <em>Matter of Pressman, </em>421 Mass. 514, 516 (1995). See also <em>Patch </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, supra </em>at 455-456 (public employer may compel employees, under threat of discharge for non-cooperation, to answer questions \u201creasonably related to the employee\u2019s ability and fitness to perform his official duties\u201d so long as answers cannot be used against them in criminal prosecution). We reject the mother\u2019s suggestion that she is entitled to the greater protections of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20G, prohibiting use of immunized testimony even in civil proceedings. As in <em>Matter of Pressman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>where a lawyer was disbarred based on testimony given under a grant of Federal immunity, <em>supra </em>at 517, the Supreme Judicial Court here had no opportunity to consider the mother\u2019s agreement or its terms, as G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 20A - 20G require.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Moreover, we doubt that the mother suffered any prejudice from the admission of the statement. The statement is factually different from, but not necessarily more inculpatory, than a statement she made to her cellmate which was properly admitted as part of the court investigator\u2019s report. The statement shows the pattern of conflicting stories the mother has told \u2014 to authorities, to her cellmate, and to the social worker \u2014 regarding the parents\u2019 role in the baby\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">2. <em>Abandonment. </em>The father argues that there is no evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the parents \u201ceffectively abandoned\u201d Astrid. Citing the definition of the term \u201cabandoned\u201d as set out in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3 (\u201cleft without any provision for support, and without any person responsible to maintain care, custody, and control because the whereabouts of the person responsible is unknown and reasonable efforts to locate such person have been unsuccessful\u201d), he asserts that the State took custody of the child and that the parents have \u201cvigorously contested\u201d DSS\u2019s efforts to maintain custody. While we agree that the statutory meaning of the word \u201cabandoned\u201d in this context does not entirely apply to the situation here, the judge\u2019s use of the word is not unwarranted on the particular facts of this case. The parents have done little to express interest in their child. Although the mother was in Massachusetts, she did not wait the seventy-two hours to attend the care and protection hearing. Neither parent attended the termination hearing even though the Commonwealth agreed to pay for airfare and lodging. Nor did they respond to any of the court investigator\u2019s attempts to interview them. The only evidence of their interest in the child and these proceedings included occasional communication with counsel; requests that counsel withdraw in the middle of trial; and a request for a photograph and a visit with the child on a day already scheduled for the termination hearing. (DSS denied the request for a visit as not being in the child\u2019s best interest, as well as because of concerns about safety and convenience.) In any case, the finding of abandonment was not central to the finding of unfitness. Cf. <em>Care and Protection of Leo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 243-244 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>3. <em>Removal from preadoptive home. </em>The judge found that Astrid has \u201ca strong, positive bond\u201d with her preadoptiv\u00e9 parents and that removal from their home \u201cwould likely cause her severe harm.\u201d The father claims that there was insufficient evidence to support this finding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judge heard testimony from the court appointed investigator and a DSS adoption social worker who visited Astrid in the preadoptive home every month. At the time of the judge\u2019s decision, Astrid had lived with the family for more than a year. The preadoptive mother is a nurse who is familiar with the pediatric cardiac care Astrid needs. The DSS social worker testified that the child has made a \u201cvery good adjustment\u201d and has a \u201cvery normal, appropriate, bonded relationship\u201d not only with her preadoptive parents but also with the extended family of grandparents and other relatives. The social worker described the child as \u201chappy.\u201d The judge\u2019s inference, that a child who has made a good adjustment with preadoptive parents who have the special skills necessary to monitor her cardiac condition would be harmed by removal from that home, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">4. <em>Out-of-State evidence. </em>Not surprisingly, given the parents\u2019 minimal connection with the Commonwealth and substantial documented history elsewhere, much of the information in the court investigator\u2019s report was from the home State. There was also information regarding the father\u2019s history in yet a third State: he had been abusive to a first wife and the five children of that marriage; his parental rights as to those children had been terminated; and he had a police record in that State. In addition to the report, the investigator submitted a lengthy addendum. The addendum contained the following items: hospital records relating to Astrid\u2019s birth in Massachusetts; medical records from the home State regarding the parents\u2019 two other children; police reports from the home State concerning the investigation of the first child\u2019s disappearance and death; other police reports from the home State; protective services and juvenile court records from the home State; police reports, protective services reports, and juvenile and probate court records from the third State; and assorted other documents. Although the parents objected to admission of the opinions, recommendations, and conclusions in the investigator\u2019s report, they particularly objected to the admission of the addendum on the grounds that many of these documents were not authenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>cated and that they included \u201ctotem pole hearsay.\u201d The judge admitted the report but withheld action on the addendum until the end of trial. The mother raised this evidentiary issue again in her closing argument, but the judge never formally ruled on it. The parties\u2019 briefs assume that the documents were admitted, and the judge\u2019s findings make clear that he relied on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">There was no reversible error in the admission of the investigator\u2019s report, even including her recommendations, because she testified and the report identified, for the most part, her sources. See <em>Adoption of George, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 274 (1989); <em>Custody of Michel, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 260, 263-264 (1990); <em>Adoption of Sean, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 263-264 (1994). The parents, therefore, had the opportunity to rebut any adverse or erroneous material. See <em>Custody of Michel, supra </em>at 266. Although the sources of information from the third State were not identified, the material regarding the third State was less than one-half page of a twenty-three page report and excluding that material would not change the result here. See <em>Care and Protection of Leo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The documents in the addendum are another matter. The parties\u2019 joint pretrial memorandum includes a proposed exhibit list. Among the documents listed are \u201ccertified copies\u201d of various medical, social service, and police records from the home State and the third State. Such documents may be admitted in custody proceedings. <em>See Adoption of Paula, </em>420 Mass. 716, 727 (1995) (police records admissible as business records); <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 552, 560-561 (1985) (hospital records); <em>Adoption of George, supra </em>at 271-272 (DSS records admissible as records of public agency under official records exception to the hearsay rule). See generally Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 8.11.1, at 490 (6th ed. 1994). However, in fact, none of the documents attached to the investigator\u2019s report in this case was \u201ccertified\u201d or otherwise authenticated. This lapse is of particular concern because so many of the documents are from out of State. At the very least, Isringhausen, the home State criminal investigator who testified, could have authenticated his own reports, but he was never requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">But even if it was error to admit the addendum, assuming the judge did admit it, there was no prejudice because the judge would have reached the same result whether or not he considered the information in the documents attached to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>court investigator\u2019s report. See <em>Care and Protection of Leo, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. at 238. As a general matter, however, we remind counsel that parties submitting records such as those at issue here, particularly when the records are from out of State, should adhere to the rules of evidence as to authentication and certification, or risk having the evidence excluded. See generally G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 21. See also G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 76, <em>79,19A, </em>79J.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">5. <em>Parents\u2019 threats and intimidation. </em>In his cross-examination, counsel for the father questioned the DSS social worker about the October 20, 1993, meeting at the hospital after DSS had obtained emergency custody of Astrid. Among other issues, he focused on the presence of police at the meeting. The judge interrupted with the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cBefore we go any further . . . there is a little bit of background that I assume you are all aware of, that there were a number of threats made on this [c]ourt and the hospital personnel concerning this child. I assume everybody is aware of that. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201c[T]here were a number of threats made that whoever the judge was was going to be killed in this matter [sic], and other people were going to be hurt. So, I assume you\u2019re aware of that. That might be one reason why the presence of a . . . detective ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cThere [were] a number of phone calls made to this court and to the hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">There was no objection to these comments, although counsel for the mother commented, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to respond to that.\u201d In his findings, the judge noted that rather than appearing at the trial, \u201c[t]he parents chose ... to proceed ... by engaging in threats and intimidation through letters to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">On appeal, the father claims there is no evidence to support this finding. He is correct; the judge\u2019s remarks were not evidence. See Greaney, Massachusetts Jury Instructions, Civil \u00a7 1.14(b) (1977) (\u201cThe evidence does not include . . . anything [the judge] might have said\u201d). Because there is no evidence to support the finding, it is clearly erroneous. See <em>Adoption of Harriet, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 111, 114 (1990); <em>Adoption of Ramon, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 713 (1996). Aside from the fact that there was no objection to the remarks at trial, see <em>Adoption </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 712 (1993), the single sentence on threats in one of the fifty-eight findings of fact had little impact on the ultimate findings of fitness and the best interests of the child required in an adoption proceeding. G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(c). The error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">6. <em>Bifurcation of the proceedings. </em>The father also complains of \u201ca mid-trial transformation of the case from a custody proceeding into a termination proceeding.\u201d He argues that \u201c[t]he confusion and uncertainty of the status of the proceedings coupled with the substantial reliance which the Court placed on the evidence initially received only in relation to the custody case in terminating the parental rights was fundamentally unfair.\u201d Although as trial counsel for DSS acknowledged, \u201cboth amending the petition and providing service on it from the beginning [were] marked by more unfortunate circumstances than a Thomas Hardy novel,\u201d the father\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The judge heard evidence over four days: February 15, March 2, May 10, and May 11, 1995. Apparently in June, 1994, DSS had filed a motion to amend the pending care and protection petition by adding a claim to dispense with the need for parental consent to adoption pursuant to G. L. c. 210, but it had not been docketed or served. The judge allowed the motion to amend on February 15 before beginning the trial. By agreement, the parents filed a \u201cmotion to bifurcate proceedings\u201d so that the court could begin to hear evidence on the care and protection petition. Although they continued to insist on proper service of the amended petition, both parents explicitly stated that they did not object to the amendment. They may not now complain about the \u201cbifurcation.\u201d See <em>Adoption of Kimberly, </em>414 Mass. 526, 534-535 (1993). In any case, consolidation of a care and protection petition with a termination proceeding is expressly authorized, <em>Care and Protection of Martha, </em>407 Mass. 319, 328 (1990), and may provide a mechanism for avoiding delay in the litigation of custody and adoption disputes, <em>id. </em>at 329, as was the case here. This is not a case in which findings from the care and protection proceeding are out of date, <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 5-6 (1989), or in which the parents\u2019 incentive to litigate changed in the course of trial. <em>Id. </em>There was no confusion or prejudice. As to the father\u2019s argument that service of the amended petition was improper, the judge determined to the contrary after an evidentiary hearing. We defer to the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>assessment of the credibility of the process server, see <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986), especially in light of the returns of service, which corroborate the process server\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>In sum, even excluding the findings regarding threats and the father\u2019s conduct in the third State, there was overwhelming evidence of the parents\u2019 unfitness: the death of their first child and the father\u2019s conviction for child endangerment in connection with her death; the mother\u2019s abandonment of the children of her first marriage; the parents\u2019 inability to nurture any of their children; and their utter failure to participate in any of the proceedings involving Astrid.
