Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>193 U.S. 197, 400 (1904) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Malcolm Hotchkiss\u2019s effort to overturn the State Racing Commission\u2019s decision to eject him from Suffolk Downs racetrack and, following a Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling in Hotchkiss\u2019s favor, the commission\u2019s determination to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>vindicate that ejection by its appeal to this court hardly seem the stuff of greatness, or even of overwhelming interest, in the course of legal events. They do, however, suggest a variation on Justice Holmes\u2019s observation: \u201cSympathetic cases make bad law\u201d; at least they do when, as here, a judicial effort to right a perceived wrong to a worthy individual is at odds with principles governing review of administrative agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><em>Factual and procedural background. </em>Hotchkiss, a Revere resident, was hired as a mutuel clerk in late 1995 by Suffolk Downs, a licensed thoroughbred pari-mutuel racetrack (see generally <em>Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 226 [1998]), located in Revere. Mutuel clerks are nonlicensed racetrack employees responsible for collecting cash from members of the public placing bets on the results of horse races held at the racetrack and for delivering tickets to bettors reflecting their wagers. Clerks such as Hotchkiss may handle tens of thousands of dollars each day, have access to the racetrack \u201cmoney room,\u201d and can accept or cancel wagers that can affect the odds and payoffs on races.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">On March 24, 1996, Hotchkiss reported to his supervisor that he had received a counterfeit twenty dollar bill. As a result of this incident, Hotchkiss came to the attention of Brian Mulhern, a Massachusetts State police sergeant assigned to the State Racing Commission and to Suffolk Downs. (See G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 8.) Mulhem recognized Hotchkiss\u2019s name from a prior State police investigation. After conducting a check of Hotchkiss\u2019s probation record, Mulhern discovered that Hotchkiss had a criminal record from the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s involving two convictions for drag possession and several charges of other offenses (including larceny, assault and battery, firearm possession, and insurance violations) that did not result in convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Mulhem\u2019s check also revealed that Hotchkiss was then under indictment in both Massachusetts and Federal courts for fencing or assisting in the operations of fences, conspiring to transport stolen goods in interstate commerce, and transporting stolen goods. Those indictments related to a large-scale theft operation with multiple defendants (many from Revere) operating throughout the northeastern United States, with Hotchkiss\u2019s role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>described as that of an intermediary or courier of stolen merchandise and cash.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Based upon Mulhern\u2019s investigation and findings, a State police official acting as representative of the commission on May 11, 1996, ordered Hotchkiss off the Suffolk Downs premises and denied him access to any other racing establishment in the State.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hotchkiss, claiming that he had informed the person who hired him at Suffolk Downs about his criminal record and the pending indictments, appealed his ejection to the full commission, which held an evidentiary hearing on May 27, 1996, as required by the ejection statute. Mulhern, other State police officers assigned to the commission, and Hotchkiss testified at that hearing. On May 30, 1996, the commission notified Hotchkiss that it had decided to uphold his ejection until his outstanding criminal matters had been resolved, after which he could petition the commission for such remedial action as then might appear appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">On July 10, 1996, the commission issued its formal findings, conclusions, and orders in Hotchkiss\u2019s case. In addition to confirming Mulhern\u2019s findings regarding Hotchkiss\u2019s earlier criminal record and all of the reported information regarding the pending theft and conspiracy indictments, the commission found that an identified agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had advised Mulhern that Hotchkiss \u201chas associations with organized crime members.\u201d It further found that in a prior investigation Mulhern had been told by a confidential informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>who was involved in bookmaking activities that \u201cthere was a large scale bookmaking office that took sports bets at two telephone numbers in Revere . . . both [of which, Mulhern discovered,] . . . were listed to Malcolm Hotchkiss.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those findings \u2014 most significantly, Hotchkiss\u2019s \u201calleged contacts and associations with organized crime figures\u201d and his charged involvement in massive thefts occurring in the virtual shadow of Suffolk Downs \u2014 were combined by the commission with (a) the fact of Hotchkiss\u2019s \u201cintegral\u201d position handling large amounts of money and (b) its own statutory \u201cresponsibility to the public to insure that all persons who participate in racing are honest and trustworthy\u201d to form the basis for the order affirming the propriety of the ejection action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201cAny commissioner or representative of the commission or any person licensed to conduct a . . . racing meeting. . . shall have the right to refuse admission to or eject from its premises any person whose presence on said premises is detrimental, in the sole judgment of the commissioner or representative of the commission or of said licensee, to the proper and orderly conduct of a racing meeting. ... Any person so excluded by any commissioner or representative of the commission or by a licensee shall have a right of appeal to the commission. The commission shall hold a hearing within ten days after any such person requests an appeal and may after such hearing by vote allow such person admission to such meeting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>The Superior Court review. </em>Hotchkiss challenged the commission\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and obtained a favorable forum in Suffolk Superior Court. There, the stated reasons for vacating the commission\u2019s ejection order barely concealed judicial displeasure with what appeared an injustice done Hotchkiss: \u201c[H]e reported to his employer, as he was supposed to, that he had received a counterfeit twenty dollar bill. The reward for this honesty was the loss of his job.\u201d The judge saw the ejection decision as unsupported by substantial evidence. Hotchkiss\u2019s past criminal record was \u201cancient history\u201d and \u201centirely unrelated to racing.\u201d Similarly irrelevant were his pending indictments, which \u201cdid not arise out of actions at the track\u201d and had not yet resulted in any actual convictions. Further detracting from the commission\u2019s conclusion that Hotchkiss\u2019s presence was detrimental to racing were three circumstances: (a) the praiseworthy motivation of the act that brought him to police attention \u2014 he \u201ctook steps to protect the integrity of the betting process\u201d; (b) the encomium his union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>gave him (in a letter its lawyer wrote to the commission) as \u201can exemplary employee and union member\u201d; and (c) his voluntary revelation of his criminal past and pending indictments to the person hiring him at Suffolk Downs. The judge also concluded, based on the same perceived lack of nexus between Hotchkiss\u2019s criminal conduct (both actual and alleged) and \u201cthe racing industry itself,\u201d that the commission\u2019s decision reflected unspecified \u201cerrors of law\u201d and an arbitrary and capricious action amounting to an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Our review of the record convinces us that the commission\u2019s decision to confirm the ejection of Hotchkiss was supported by substantial evidence, was within its unusually broad discretion, and reflected no error of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It merits affirmance on the basis of that evidence, in light of the peculiar features of the racing industry, the breadth of the commission\u2019s discretionary authority, the proper limits on judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u00a7 14, and the restrictive nature of the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test of c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e). Reversing the commission\u2019s determination would amount to substitution of judicial judgment for that of an expert agency which had made a rational, discretionary choice in implementing the statutory scheme it has been empowered by the Legislature to oversee \u2014 an outcome reviewing courts must especially eschew in our system of separation of powers. See <em>Barrington Fair Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1159, 1161 (1989); <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257-258 (1996), and cases cited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\"><em>The unique regulatory background. </em>Long celebrated as the sport of kings and a respectable diversion of the leisure class, horse racing had become by the second half of the twentieth century an extensive entertainment and gambling business sufficiently tarnished by roguish participants (at least in Massachusetts) to require \u201ca complete and integrated plan for the regulation and control of horse racing and legalized wagering thereon.\u201d <em>Landers </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Assn., Inc., </em>327 Mass. 32, 45 (1951). The chief reason for such enhanced regulation of racing was a \u201csubstantial public concern about the manner in which, and by whom, it is conducted.\u201d <em>Bay State Harness Horse Racing &amp; Breeding Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>342 Mass. 694, 700 (1961). Because of \u201call of the many perils, pitfalls, temptations and traps for the unwary . . . [and] the occasions for corruption for the participants, all of which are inherent in any gambling operation of such proportions,\u201d the Legislature gave the commission \u201cvery broad powers necessary\u201d to regulate the industry to prevent \u201cthese dangers.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>360 Mass. 152, 159 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Consistently with those \u201cfull power[s],\u201d conferred upon the commission in G. L. c. 128A \u201cin the broadest possible language\u201d because of the peculiar susceptibility of racing \u201cto fraud and corruption,\u201d <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 303, 305 (1978), the Legislature tightened the commission\u2019s grip on the industry in 1978 by enacting, among other reforms, the ejection statute, \u00a7 10A. That provision was part of a \u201csubstantially strengthening of] the [commission\u2019s power and ability to control horse racing in the public interest,\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 271 (1986), and was motivated in significant part by the Legislature\u2019s concern for restoring \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the sport\u201d (St. 1978, c. 494, \u00a7 1), which had fallen into a state of exceptional decline by the 1970\u2019s. See <em>Catrone </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 484, 490 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In effecting those reforms, the Legislature again utilized the \u201cbroadest possible language\u201d <em>(Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., supra </em>at 303) \u2014 \u201cthe sole judgment\u201d of the commissioner, the commission\u2019s representative, or the licensee being the determinant of the \u201cdetrimental\u201d nature of an ejected individual\u2019s \u201cpresence\u201d to the proper and orderly conduct of racing (G. L. c. 128, \u00a7 10A) \u2014 so that the commission could \u201ctake swift action against anyone whose presence imperils the normal operation of the track.\u201d <em>Solimeno </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>400 Mass. 397, 403 (1987). Among the reasons for investing the commission with such extraordinary discretion was the need to take swift action against unlicensed individuals detrimentally involved in racing operations, who were not subject to the commission\u2019s existing power to suspend or revoke licenses. Even that significant power had proved \u201cinsufficient to maintain order at horse . . . racing tracks.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\"><em>A preliminary appraisal. </em>Having thus set out the specifics of Hotchkiss\u2019s case, a profile of the applicable regulatory scheme, and an overview of the commission\u2019s authority thereunder, we are tempted to conclude our review. No extended analysis would seem required in order to uphold the challenged decision by an agency charged with taking swift action in order to suppress fraud and corruption and to preserve the integrity of and public confidence in racing. The commission\u2019s expulsion of an individual of Hotchkiss\u2019s reputed character \u2014 an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>who in the past had been involved in drug-related crimes<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and who, the commission had good reason to believe,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had long participated with numerous criminal associates in a massive, ongoing theft operation in Revere and elsewhere \u2014 from a position akin to that of a bank teller handling large sums of money would appear supported by common sense and experience, if nothing else. The expressly limited scope of the commission\u2019s action (excluding Hotchkiss only until such time as he had resolved his pending State and Federal criminal problems) stands as an exemplar of considered, balanced judgment, in decided contrast to an arbitrary or capricious act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Notwithstanding these considerations, a decent respect to the opinions of the parties and the legal community, as well as tradition, requires (at the risk of burdening the readers of these reports) that we declare the substance of our conclusions at somewhat greater length.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\"><em>The deferential standard of review. </em>Fundamental precepts of judicial review mandate judicial deference to any expert agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>charge, under both traditional principles of review, <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595-596 (1992); <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 302, 303, and the explicit provisions of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 11(5) and 14(7).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such deference is especially due in this very regulatory context, where the courts have emphasized that \u201c[i]t is not open to th[e] court to question the wisdom\u201d of the commission\u2019s exercise of its duly delegated power, <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>360 Mass. at 159, and that a \u201ccourt should be slow to decide that . . . [the commission] has acted unreasonably or arbitrarily and should search for some ground which reasonable [persons] would regard as a proper basis for the agency\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Such a search requires rejection of an interpretation of G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, that engrafts a precondition not contained in the statute or warranted by the underlying rationale of the relevant case law: i.e., that the ejected person\u2019s questionable conduct must, to be held \u201cdetrimental,\u201d take place in the racing industry itself (see <em>supra </em>at 687-688). The commission did not so construe \u00a7 10A, and \u201c[t]he commission\u2019s construction is entitled to weight.\u201d <em>Solimeno </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>400 Mass. at 403. That construction, allowing ejection for discreditable conduct wherever it may occur (see note 20, <em>infra), </em>was a reasonable one. When such a construction is, as it was here, grounded in substantial evidence (see <em>infra </em>at 695-700), it cannot be supplanted by reviewing courts. See <em>Massachusetts Med. Soc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 62 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\"><em>The commission\u2019s proactive powers. </em>Additionally supporting the commission\u2019s action against Hotchkiss is long-standing judicial recognition of the commission\u2019s right not to have to wait passively until someone has actually committed (or been judicially determined to have committed) a crime at the racetrack before it can take swift and decisive action to protect the industry against corruption. Rather, our courts, have acknowledged the commission\u2019s authority under c. 128A to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>forestall \u201creasonably foreseeable . . . danger,\u201d <em>Solimeno </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>400 Mass. at 405, posed by \u201canyone whose presence imperils the normal operation of the track,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 403, by taking anticipatory, preventive action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Thus, the commissioner or the commission\u2019s representative may exclude even licensed persons<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> who have not yet actually done anything illegal but are merely suspected of misconduct and have, in the commission\u2019s view, come \u201cdangerously near\u201d to committing detrimental acts; the commissioner or the commission\u2019s representative \u201ccould reasonably feel\u201d that such persons were \u201can avoidable potential source of future difficulty\u201d and accordingly take steps to exclude them before the potential harm eventuated. <em>Catrone </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 491.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, an individual who is himself personally innocent of anything illegal but should, in the commission\u2019s view, be held responsible for facilitating potential wrongdoing by others, may be excluded by the commission in order to maximize protection of the integrity of racing. <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 302, 305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>(upholding license suspension of a trainer because, inter alia, hypodermic needles and syringes were found in the room assigned to him, which a rule of the commission made him responsible for, although he himself was not shown to have known of their presence; \u201c[tjhe commission could reasonably have determined that prohibiting the mere presence of instruments which could be used to administer prohibited substances was the best way to prevent illicit use of those substances\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The exercise of its prophylactic authority has consistently been affirmed as in accord with legislative intent that the commission be able to act swiftly so as \u201cto avoid any possible involvement in evils of the type\u201d inherently associated with gambling-entwined horse racing. See <em>Catrone, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 492. It is a preemptive power that the courts have held to be essential in \u201ca sport \u2018where the greatest importance should attach to dissipating any cloud of association with the undesirable, and in which the appearance as well as the fact of complete integrity is of paramount consideration\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>Ibid. </em>The commission\u2019s exercise of such power deserves special deference, because \u201c[t]he importance of an administrative interpretation of a statute is \u2018never greater than where, as here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>an agency must interpret a legislative policy which is only broadly set out in the governing statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 850 (1977), quoting from <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>362 Mass. 417, 442 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In short, under the authorities, the commission\u2019s determination that Hotchkiss\u2019s presence was detrimental to racing reflected no legal error or arbitrary choice. It should have been accorded \u201call rational presumptions ... in favor of [its] validity\u201d and should have been upheld unless \u201cit \u2018cannot be supported upon any rational basis of fact that reasonably can be conceived to sustain it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 305, quoting from <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>360 Mass. at 156.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\"><em>The substantial evidence test. </em>Condemnation of the commission\u2019s otherwise lawful determination could, therefore, be affirmed only if the challenged action was unsupported by substantial evidence in the record. We are satisfied that the ejection decision was amply supported when measured by the substantial evidence standard, which imposes significant constraints on judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">\u201cJudicial \u2018review under the substantial evidence standard is circumscribed.\u2019 <em>Cherubino </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>403 Mass. 350, 354 (1988). It is a standard of review \u2018highly deferential to the agency\u2019, which requires (as G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14[7] mandates) ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>cording \u2018 \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d \u2019 <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">\u201cIn order to be supported by substantial evidence, an agency conclusion need not be based upon the \u2018clear weight\u2019 of the evidence ... or even a preponderance of the evidence, but rather only upon \u2018reasonable evidence,\u2019 <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assn. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 43, 54 (1985), i.e., \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u2019 after taking into consideration opposing evidence in the record.

If the agency has, in the discretionary exercise of its expertise, made a \u2018choice between two fairly conflicting views,\u2019 and its selection reflects reasonable evidence, \u2018[a] court may not displace [the agency\u2019s] choice . . . even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u2019 <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational Sch.

L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, and (c) the commission\u2019s preventive power to nip detrimental situations prefiguring corruption in the bud. The quantum and quality of the evidence leading to the decision to eject Hotchkiss compare more than favorably with what was held substantial in the cases previously cited (see <em>supra </em>at 691-695).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The undisputed evidence that the commission found of most concern consisted of Hotchkiss\u2019s well-publicized indictments for large-scale thievish activities and reputed associations with organized crime figures.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The commission concluded that those factors made his presence in an area of racing so integral and sensitive as collecting cash and paying off wagers inconsistent with its responsibility to insure that all participants in racing are in fact honest and trustworthy and with the need to preserve the appearance of complete integrity in racing operations. Had Suffolk Downs, as a licensee racetrack, determined to eject Hotchkiss as a detrimental presence (which G. L. c. 120A, \u00a7 10A, also authorizes, see note 2, <em>supra) </em>on the basis of such evidence, we have no doubt that it would be upheld as a \u201creasonable discretionary business judgment.\u201d See <em>Catrone </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 488-489.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The commission\u2019s ejection decision was no less reasonable, and the findings on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>which it was based comported with the practical underpinning of the substantial evidence standard: \u201c[W]hether experience permits the reasoning mind to make the finding; [i.e.,] whether the finding <em>could </em>have been made by reference to the logic of experience\u201d (emphasis original). <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. at 466, quoting from <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 92 (1968). Restated as the common sense precaution that foxes should be denied access to hen houses, the commission\u2019s exclusion of Hotchkiss was both evidentially and experientially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><em>Inappropriate judicial fact finding. </em>The most significant vulnerability of the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that the commission\u2019s evidence failed the substantial evidence test derived from judicial findings of fact and drawing of inferences inconsistent with those supporting the commission\u2019s decision. Such a venture is to be avoided in judicial review of agency action generally, see <em>Retirement Bd. of Brookline </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. at 480, and is contrary to explicit appellate admonitions regarding review of this commission\u2019s decisions in particular. See <em>Solimeno </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>400 Mass. at 406 (\u201c[T]he commission, not the [Superior Court] judge or this court, is the finder of fact. . .\u201d); <em>Fioravanti </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>6 Mass.

[t]he court may not displace the commission\u2019s choice between fairly conflicting views\u201d); <em>Catrone </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 486 (\u201cThe trial judge, in reviewing the commission\u2019s decision, purported to make findings as if the proceeding before him constituted a trial de novo.

[and] to weigh the credibility of witnesses . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The judge below considered the commission\u2019s ultimate finding that Hotchkiss\u2019s presence was detrimental to racing to be undermined by two sets of facts, found or inferred. The first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>related to Hotchkiss\u2019s supposed good character; the second concerned the relevance to racing of Hotchkiss\u2019s criminal involvement. As to the first set, the judge found that, prior to being hired, Hotchkiss had disclosed his criminal record and pending indictments to his new employer, Suffolk Downs; that he had brought the counterfeit money to the attention of his supervisor \u201cto protect the integrity of the betting process\u201d; and that his good work performance and honesty were illustrated by his union\u2019s praise. The commission made no express findings regarding any of these matters, but its decision to eject Hotchkiss reflects its rejection of them all as either lacking credibility or irrelevant to the issue of the potential detriment to racing that Hotchkiss\u2019s presence posed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The imputation to Hotchkiss of honesty and concern for the integrity of racing because of his disclosure of the counterfeit bill was based entirely upon Hotchkiss\u2019s self-serving testimony about his good intentions. Aside from the impropriety of such credibility determinations by a reviewing court, Hotchkiss\u2019s testimony did not ineluctably yield such an inference. Having initially shown the counterfeit bill to another mutuel clerk, Hotchkiss could as well have been motivated (the commission could reasonably infer) by a self-protective concern that any failure thereafter to disclose the bill to a supervisor might lead to an accusation against him by his coworker, which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>result in his termination or the uncovering of the full extent of his embroilment in the criminal law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The de novo finding that Hotchkiss\u2019s criminal record (including the pending indictments) was unrelated to racing and therefore irrelevant to the commission\u2019s purview was particularly inapt.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It squarely contradicted the ultimate finding of the commission \u2014 that it was necessary, in order to preserve the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>pearance of integrity in the racing industry arid to maintain public confidence in the trustworthiness of all involved in it, to remove a person strongly suspected of extensive dishonesty from a position that required honest handling of large sums of money. The faulty finding of lack of relationship led directly to the incorrect inference that larcenous acts, which two grand juries had found Hotchkiss probably guilty of engaging in, were not detrimental to the orderly conduct of racing.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">That questionable inference further suffered from a failure to take into consideration the information conveyed to the commission by the indictments and by State police witnesses (see <em>supra </em>at 686-687 and note 3) regarding Hotchkiss\u2019s reputed associations with organized crime figures, not only in the massive theft operations but in illegal gambling activities as well. See <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. at 466 (\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review involves consideration of the entire record, not merely selected portions thereof). The commission expressly determined such associations to be highly relevant, in conjunction with the serious indictments, to its conclusion that Hotchkiss\u2019s continued presence was detrimental to racing \u2014 an eminently reasonable determination on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The commission\u2019s decision upholding Hotchkiss\u2019s ejection, based upon its finding that his presence at Suffolk Downs was detrimental to racing, was within its statutory authority and grounded on substantial evidence, derived in large part from its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before it and the reasonable inferences it drew from that evidence. It was not the function of a reviewing court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, to displace the factual determinations of the agency experienced in the unique features and requirements of the racing industry or to exercise an independent assessment of the evidence. It was, rather, the court\u2019s obligation to accept them when, as here, they were supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole and reflected a reasoned choice between conflicting views of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered affirming the July 10, 1996, decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">\n<em>iSo ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\">We take judicial notice of the fact that by the time of oral argument, May 27, 1998, Hotchkiss had in fact been convicted of all of the charges in the State and Federal indictments and was incarcerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Hotchkiss\u2019s ejection was ordered pursuant to G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A (as appearing in St. 1978, c. 494, \u00a7 8), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Mulhern testified that the two numbers \u201cwere being call forwarded to a convicted bookmaker\u2019s residence in Winthrop.\u201d He conceded on cross-examination that a grand jury presented with the results of his investigation in 1988 handed down no indictments, which he attributed to the fact that \u201csome people took the Fifth and they refused to testify.\u201d Mulhern also introduced as an exhibit at the commission hearing an undated clipping from the Lynn Daily Evening Item entitled \u201cDozen locals nabbed in shoplifting scam,\u201d which listed Hotchkiss as one of a \u201cMafia-connected shoplifting ring\u201d based in Revere and Stoughton which \u201callegedly had the blessing of the Patriarca crime family\u201d and which had been \u201csmashed\u201d after netting twenty million dollars in stolen property. All of the statements in the articles were attributed to the indictments or to the United States Attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In reaching this conclusion, the judge made only passing reference to the exceptionally broad provision of G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, authorizing the ejection of \u201cany person whose presence ... is detrimental, <em>in the sole judgment of the commissioner </em>or representative of the commission . . . , to the proper and orderly conduct of a racing meeting\u201d (emphasis supplied). Our research has uncovered no other Massachusetts statute that uses the term \u201csole judgment\u201d in connection with an agency\u2019s power. In light of the essentially traditional grounds for our decision, as discussed below, we need not define with precision the full extent of the commission\u2019s broad discretion under that unique empowerment. Cf. <em>Catrone </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 484, 489 (1984).- The judge\u2019s reliance on <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 462 (1983), for the proposition that even the commission\u2019s \u201csole judgment\u201d cannot be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously was undoubtedly correct as an abstract proposition of law; but, as will appear, the commission\u2019s decision was far from arbitrary and capricious on this record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The judge did not identify the errors of law committed by the commission or in what way its action was arbitrary and capricious, other than by reference to the evidence that was deemed inadequate. Since the determination whether an agency\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the entire record is itself a question of law open to a reviewing court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), it may be that the judge founded the \u201cerrors of law\u201d on a view of the record evidence as insubstantial. And, since a decision that is supported by substantial evidence cannot be arbitrary and capricious, see <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>376 Mass. 294, 312 (1978), the judge may have simply relied on the inverse proposition in concluding that the commission\u2019s ejection order constituted an abuse of discretion. See <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 537 n.6 (1985) (without some factual support, an agency decision would ordinarily be viewed as arbitrary). Cf. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

The commission\u2019s ejection order was reversed by a Superior Court judge who had \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d that the trainer had knowingly participated in the boycott. On appeal the order was reinstated, because the evidence before the commission (that the trainer was aware of the boycott, had made no inquiry about the cancellation of races caused by it despite having dogs scheduled to race, and had previously signed a letter that threatened unspecified action if various grievances of the trainers were not addressed) was held substantial enough to support its decision.

In addition to disbelieving Hotchkiss generally, as it had a right to do (see note 7, <em>supra), the </em>commission could well have found that this assertion was inconsistent with Officer Mulhern\u2019s report and testimony regarding his discovery that Hotchkiss had turned over a counterfeit bill. Mulhern had obtained that information from the same Robert Fawcett, who nonetheless did not provide Mulhern with any details about Hotchkiss\u2019s criminal involvements; Mulhern had to research those involvements for himself. The commission also could discount the unverified letter endorsement from Hotchkiss\u2019s union (made by its lawyer rather than a shop steward or other union representative who had actually worked with Hotchkiss), which consisted of conclusory, third- and fourth-level hearsay about his allegedly meticulous work record. In light of the improbabilities in Hotchkiss\u2019s evidence and the substantiality of the evidence against him on which the commission relied, the commission had explicit and objectively adequate reasons to disbelieve Hotchkiss\u2019s evidence. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub.

Indeed, such evidence was essentially irrelevant in evaluating the validity of disciplinary action by a regulatory agency charged with suppressing whatever undermines public confidence in the integrity of the regulated activity. See <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>422 Mass. 338, 345 n.14 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The finding in this regard also constituted legal error (as discussed <em>supra </em>at 690-695 and note 12) because it supplanted the commission\u2019s expert construction of G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A. That construction, explicitly based upon its \u201cknowledge of the racing industry,\u201d reasonably determined that indictments of an individual for crimes implicating stealing and dishonesty, plus the reliably reported association of that individual with known criminals involved in illegal gambling and loansharking operations and large scale thefts, were sufficient to establish that the individual\u2019s continued presence was detrimental to racing, even if the actual criminal conduct occurred outside of racing. The error is partially attributable to failure to take into account case law cited by the commission supporting agency discipline in the interest of protecting the image and integrity of the regulated industry even when the criminal conduct at issue was claimed to be unrelated to the industry itself and not subject to agency regulation. See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration </em>&amp; <em>Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 526-528 (1979) (fraudulent financial operation of nursing homes by doctor); <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>387 Mass. 708, 711, 713 (1982) (illegal possession of weapons); <em>Alsabti </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>404 Mass. 547, 553-554 (1989) (acts of plagiarism); <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>422 Mass. 338, 342-343 (1996) (releasing confidential information relating to a contentious child custody litigation to the media; the court responded to the appellant\u2019s complaint that she had done nothing illegal by noting, at 343, that the agency had \u201cbroad authority to \u2018protect the image of the medical profession\u2019 and is not limited to disciplining conduct involving direct patient care, criminal activity, or deceit\u201d).
