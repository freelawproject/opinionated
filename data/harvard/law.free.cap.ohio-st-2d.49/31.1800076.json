J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6O\">Appellant presents 12 assignments of error (hereinafter referred to as \u201cpropositions of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">In his fourth proposition of law, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding that the state had presented sufficient evidence to show the commission of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>aggravated robbery prior to the admission of the appellant\u2019s confession to that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The relevant rule of law is found in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maranda </em>(1916), 94 Ohio St. 364, 114 N. E. 1038, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201c1. By the <em>corpus delicti </em>of a crime is meant the body or substance of the crime, included in which are usually two elements: 1. The act. 2. The criminal agency of the act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">\u201c2. It has long been established as a general rule in Ohio that there must be some evidence outside of a confession tending to establish the <em>corpus delicti, </em>before such confession is admissible. The <em>quantum </em>or weight of such outside or extraneous evidence is not of itself to be equal to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even enough to make it a <em>prima facie </em>case. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Under count two of the indictment, the material elements of aggravated robbery relevant herein include the following: (1) without the owner\u2019s consent, to obtain or exert control over the owner\u2019s property, (2) a purpose to deprive the owner of his property, and (3) the defendant in the commission of the act or in fleeing immediately thereafter, either to have on or about his person or under his control a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance as defined in R. C. 2923.11, or to inflict serious physical harm on another.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The defendant contends that \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence offered by the state that anything of value was ever taken from the decedent.\u201d If not, the argument continues, excluding Edward\u2019s confessions, \u201cthere was no evidence from which it can be said by clear and unequivocal proof that decedent was killed in the course of a robbery.\u201d The defendant concludes that there was insufficient evidence to prove that an aggravated robbery was committed, for the following reasons: (1) the fact that the defendant was found without a wallet, when no evidence was presented that he even carried a wallet, cannot be said to be circumstantial evidence he was robbed, especially when it was discovered that the decedent did have money on his per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>son, (2) the fact that a wallet was later found containing the decedent\u2019s identification cards does not show the wallet was owned by the decedent, and (3) the evidence was not clear whether defendant was seen in the vicinity of the wallet before or after the decedent was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In rebuttal, the state emphasizes paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>Maranda, supra. </em>In order to make Edwards\u2019 confession admissible, the state need only produce <em>some </em>evidence of the material elements listed above. \u201cThe <em>quantum </em>or weight of such outside or extraneous evidence is not of itself to be equal to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, nor even enough to make it a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d <em>Maranda, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In the instant case, a few days following decedent\u2019s \u2022death a wallet was found in the basement of an apartment complex. The billfold contained some credit cards, identification papers and miscellaneous papers of the decedent, but no money. Considering those facts, the state concludes that sufficient evidence existed to establish the <em>corpus \u2022delicti </em>of aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The necessity of independently proving the <em>corpus delicti </em>to render admissible an extrajudicial confession is a well-established rule of evidence. Its origin is explained by Judge Wanamaker in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maranda, supra, </em>at page 370, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201cThis doctrine touching <em>corpus delicti </em>is of ancient \u2022origin and was born out of great caution by the courts, in consideration of certain cases of homicide wherein it had turned out that by reason of a failure of the government to prove the death of the person charged as having been murdered it so happened that such person sometimes survived the person accused as his murderer. Therefore, the rule that there must be some evidence tending to prove the fact that death had actually ensued; which was later followed by an additional requirement of some evidence that that death was brought about by some criminal agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Considering the revolution in criminal law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>1960\u2019s and the vast number of procedural safeguards protecting the due-process rights of criminal defendants, the <em>corpus .delicti </em>rule is supported by few practical or social-policy considerations. This court sees little reason to apply the rule with a dogmatic vengeance.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In considering the minimal requirements of <em>Maranda </em>and in evaluating the evidence in light of the ordinary customs of our times, we conclude that the prosecution did produce <em>some </em>evidence tending to corroborate the material elements of aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">This proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Talcing the remaining propositions of law in. their numerical sequence, we find in proposition of law No. 1 the claim that the trial court erred in \u201callow [ing] the prosecutor to receive a copy of a psychiatric examination prior to the trial and conviction of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">After the defendant entered a not guilty plea, the trial court ordered a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant. During the examination, the defendant made several incriminating statements relating to his participation in the robbery and murder. A copy of this report was then given to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Although the record is not clear, the trial court apparently ordered the examination to determine whether the defendant was competent to stand trial. Under R. C. 2945.37, such an order was proper. However, the court erred, the defendant alleges, in allowing the prosecution to receive a copy of the report before the defendant was tried and convicted. The defendant claims the error to have been prejudicial. At trial, testimony was offered by the state from detective Cross that Edwards slept in a basement of Edgewood Home Apartments.- The testimony, the defendant claims, was critically important in proving that Edwards was known to sleep where the wallet was found. Defendant further insists that detective Cross obtained this information from the psychiatric report. Without such testimony, the defendant continues, there would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>insufficient evidence to render the defendant\u2019s confession admissible; And without the confession, he concludes,-there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.1</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The state, in rebuttal, argues that the psychiatric report contained no evidence that had not already been uncovered by the police. The officers were aware of Gary Hendon, the custodian who found the billfold. The report, moreover, was never referred to in the presence Of the jury or introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">' The issue is whether the disclosure of the psychiatric report to the prosecutor, prior to trial, violated the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination. Although this claim presents significant constitutional questions, it need not be addressed by this court. In light of the facts of the case, defendant\u2019s-argument is significant only if one assumes that without Cross\u2019 testimony the defendant\u2019s confession would be inadmissible.' Having arrived at the contrary conclusion in the analysis'of the'appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law, the court need not resolve this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">This proposition of law is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">In his second proposition of law, appellant complains that \u201c[t] he mere reading of the <em>Miranda </em>rights to the accused who purports to understand them and then purportedly waives his right to remain silent is not in compliance with the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">On January 9,1975, the defendant was arrested at 5:30 p. m. From approximately that time to 3:00 a. m. Oh January 10, 1975, the defendant was kept in interrogation room No. 9. During that period he was interrogated four times; three of the four interrogations were tape-recorded. The appellant challenges the admissibility of the confessions obtained during these interrogation periods. Since the original st\u00e1tement given to the police established his participation in the crime, only the circumstances of this confession are legally significant. If the confession was voluntarily made, then the legality of the later statements, obtained at 8:20 p. m. and 10:25 p. m., respectively, is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>important. If the subsequent confessions were legally obtained, then their admission relates to events already proven. If the subsequent confessions were- illegally acquired,. in light of the lawfulness of the origina t statement given to the police shortly after the appellant\u2019s arrest, then their admission constitutes harmless error. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969), 395 U. S. 250; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Having been in custody for about an hour following his arrest, on January 9, 1975, the defendant was interrogated by detective Cross. Before questioning the defendant, Cross read to the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. After having read each right aloud, Cross asked the defendant if he understood. The defendant said \u201cyes.\u201d After reading the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Cross told the defendant that he,could stop talking to either himself (Cross) or detective Goodwell any time he wished. At approximately 6:30 p. m., the defendant gave an oral, unrecorded confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U. S. 436, the Supreme Court held that the prosecution has the burden of proving the following facts in order for a statement made by an- accused at the time of custodial interrogation to be admitted in evidence: (1) the accused, prior to any interrogation,-was given the <em>Miranda- </em>warnings;. (2) .at the receipt of the warnings, or thereafter, the accused made \u201can express; statement\u201d that he desired to waive his <em>Miranda </em>constitutional rights; (3) the accused effected a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">There are no' presumptions to aid the prosecution in its attempt to prove a valid waiver of the right to counsel and the privilege of silence. At various points in the majority opinion in <em>Miranda, </em>the court seizes- upon specific factual criteria which it emphatically indicates will not support a presumption of waiver. These criteria are: (3) a waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after the warnings are given; (2) a waiver will not be presumed simply from the fact that a confession was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in fact eventually obtained; (3) a waiver will not be presumed if the individual answers some questions or gives some information on his own initiative prior to invoking his right to remain silent when interrogated; (4) a waiver will not be presumed if the accused fails to ask for the assistance of an attorney; and (5) a waiver will not be presumed from a silent record.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The defendant argues his confession is inadmissible for basically the following three reasons: (1) The <em>Miranda </em>warnings were inadequate in that Cross never explicitly asked the defendant whether he wanted an attorney; (2) the waiver was not intelligently made because defendant had a low IQ and could only read on a second-grade level; and (3) the waiver was not voluntarily made in that officer Groodwell \u201cinduced\u201d the defendant to confess by telling the defendant the court would be lenient on him, if the defendant told the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>Miranda </em>does not require a police officer to ask the defendant whether he wants an attorney. He need only inform the accused, as was done here, that the accused has a right to a retained or appointed attorney. Moreover, the defendant was 21 years old, a high school graduate, and able to understand the English language. In being asked whether he understood his rights, he responded affirmatively. He never asked for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The only significant issue is whether the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntary in light of Cross\u2019 \u201cinducement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\"><em>Miranda </em>specifically holds that \u201cany evidence\u201d showing that the accused was \u201ccajoled\u201d will render the waiver decision involuntary. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra </em>(384 U. S. 436), at page 476. \u201cCajolery,\u201d in this context, may be defined as the act of persuading or deceiving the accused, with false promises or information, into relinquishing his rights and responding to questions posed by law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In demanding that a confession be voluntary, <em>Miranda </em>was requiring nothing new. The Supreme Court of the Hnited States had established such to be the law in <em>Bram </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>v. <em>United States </em>(1897), 168 U. S. 532, 542, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agm\"><em>h\u00ed*** </em>[A] confession, in order to he admissible, must be free and voluntary; that is, must not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by <em>any direct or implied promises, however </em>slight, nor by exertion of any improper influence * * V \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Although the language of <em>Bram </em>is categorical, it is doubtful whether the courts today would interpret the <em>Miranda </em>requirements so that any promise, \u201chowever slight\u201d which induces a confession would render the confession involuntary and hence inadmissible. Thus in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferrara </em>(C. A. 2, 1967), 377 F. 2d 16, 17, certiorari denied, 389 U. S. 908, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201c* * * The <em>Bram </em>opinion cites with approval the statement in an English textbook that a confession is not voluntary if \u2018obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight.\u2019 That language has never been applied with the wooden literalness urged upon us by appellant. The Supreme Court has consistently made clear that the test of voluntariness is whether an examination of all the circumstances discloses that the conduct of \u2018law enforcement officials was such as to overbear [the defendant\u2019s] will to resist and bring about confessions not freely self-determined * * *.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201cThe \u2018wooden\u2019 application of <em>Bram </em>was also rejected in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>434 F. 2d 994 (5th Cir. 1970). In <em>Frazier, </em>an F. B. I. agent told defendant \u2018that if he cooperated with them his cooperation would be made known to the United States Attorney, that there might be some consideration given by the United States Attorney but that the agents could make no promises.\u2019 The court held such a promise, standing alone, insufficient to render the confession involuntary.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arcediano </em>(1974), 371 F. Supp. 457, 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">In deciding whether the defendant\u2019s confession in this case was involuntarily induced, the court should consider the <em>totality </em>of the circumstances, including the age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States </em>(C. A. 10, 1966), 356 F. 2d 230, 232. Under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d standard, the presence of promises does not, as a matter of law, render a confession involuntary. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stegmaier </em>(1975), 397 F. Supp. 611, an F. B. I. agent\u2019s promise that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccooperation\u201d would be considered in the disposition of the defendant\u2019s case did not render the subsequent confession involuntary. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barfield </em>(1975), 507 F. 2d 53, the court held that the fact that a 16-year-old defendant was told by an F. B. I. agent that it would be in \u201chis best interest\u201d to tell the \u201creal story,\u201d and that telling a lie might result in his being left \u201cholding the bag,\u201d did not foreclose, as a matter of law, the voluntariness of the confession. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>White </em>(C. A. 5, 1974), 493 F. 2d 3, the court held that in an otherwise noncoercive atmosphere, an isolated statement made to an accused that his confession would be \u201chelpful,\u201d did not, standing alone, invalidate an otherwise legal confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The trial court did not find officer Goodwell\u2019s statement to be of such a nature as to render involuntary the appellant\u2019s confession. We believe this to be correct. To promise that the court will be \u201clenient\u201d if one tells the truth is not unlike an admonition that it would be in- one\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d to tell the truth and not get caught \u201cholding the bag.\u201d <em>Barfield, supra. </em>The accused in the instant case had been, given his rights and was of majority age. The defendant, at the time of his first confession, had been in custody for approximately one hour. The atmosphere was non-coercive and the questioning had not been continuous. There was no physical deprivation or mistreatment. The record supports the finding that the defendant voluntarily waived his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Proposition of law No. 3 reads : \u201cCriminal Rule 16(B) [l](e) is a mandatory rule which requires strict compli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>anee. Rule 16(E)(3) applies only to the introduction of physical evidence. The trial court abuses its discretion if it permits a witness to testify whose name was not on the witness list by mere neglect.\u201d Appellant complains that the trial court erred in permitting a state\u2019s witness to testify when the state, in violation of an earlier court order, failed to furnish the name and address of the witness prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Crim. R. 16(E)(3) provides for the regulation of discovery, and it permits the trial court to exercise its discretion in selecting the proper and just procedure to be followed when a party fails to comply with a discovery order. Crim. R. 16(B)(1)(e) provides for the furnishing of the names and addresses of all witnesses the prosecution intends to call at trial. In the instant case, the prosecution called officer Ronald Davis whose name did not appear on the list of names furnished by the prosecution to the defendant pursuant to a motion filed by the defendant requesting the names and addresses of all witnesses. Over objection by the defendant, the court permitted Davis to testify as to the position in which he found the decedent and the location of a shell casing, and to identify state\u2019s exhibits numbered 4 through 10. The issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Because trial courts are given much latitude in supervising pretrial discovery, we conclude that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Davis to testify. From the record, it appears the prosecutor\u2019s mistake was inadvertent. Moreover, there is little reason to believe the appellant was ill-prepared and surprised by Davis\u2019 testimony. Although the witness list was incomplete, it did include the name of Mack Newberry, the partner of Ronald Davis, who accompanied him on his tour of duty. It was the intention of the state to call Newberry as its first witness, but a heart attack the night before trial precluded his appearance, and Davis was called in his stead. Moreover, much of Davis\u2019 testimony was identical to that of the coroner\u2019s investigator, Charles Elliot. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>although the trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection to Davis\u2019 testimony in its entirety, defense counsel could have, but did hot, move for a continuance in order to have sufficient time in which to prepare for cross-examination. In the absence of such a motion, the trial court properly concluded that defense counsel was prepared to go forward at that time. The trial court had, pursuant to Crim. R. 16(E)(3), the discretionary power to make such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">This proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In his fifth proposition of law, appellant suggests that the trial court erred in permitting in evidence the tape recording of the defendant\u2019s confession with reference to the killing of the decedent. Appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he total recorded confession by the defendant was a confession of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder and that the statement of both offenses could not be separated.\u201d As advanced by the appellant\u2019s fourth proposition of law, the statement with reference to the robbery should not have been permitted for the reason that the state failed to prove any facts, other than by the defendant\u2019s confession, that a robbery was committed. Hence, since the two statements could not be separated, both should be prohibited from being introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">In appraising this proposition, this court is of the opinion that the tape-recorded confessions were admissible in evidence for the reasons advanced in our ruling on proposition of law No. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The next proposition of law advanced by appellant, No. 6, proposes that the Criminal Rules do not preclude the defendant\u2019s counsel, in final argument, from commenting to the jury that the state failed to call certain witnesses, when the state was responsible for bringing their names to the attention of the jury, after the court allowed the state to introduce hearsay testimony over objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Throughout the testimony of detective Cross, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>introduced hearsay testimony of Haywood Manning and Butch DeBruce. The state brought the names of these people to the attention of the jury. The court, however, refused to allow defense counsel to mention the name Manning in final argument. In so doing, the appellant argues, the lower court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Aside from Edward\u2019s confession and the statements attributed to DeBruce, Manning\u2019s testimony and credibility were relevant in connecting Edwards with the murder weapon. Since Manning was never called to the stand, the defendant argues that he should have been able to mention such fact to the jury. Relying on Crim. R. 16(B)(4), the court made a limited ruling. It held that the defense could give any number of arguments, but could not impeach Manning\u2019s statements by mentioning the prosecutor\u2019s failure to call him as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Crim. R. 16(B)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cThe fact that a witness\u2019 name is on a list furnished under subsection (B)(1)(b) and (f), and that such witness is not called shall not be commented upon at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Considering the purpose of the rule and the availability of Manning as a witness throughout the trial, we believe the trial court was correct in ruling that the defense could not argue before the jury, \u201c[W]here is Mr. Manning?\u201d A party is not required to use every prospective witness it may have. Once the prosecution has established its case, it may rest at the point it chooses. The rule effectively precludes the defense raising doubt or innuendo, about an uncalled witness, and what he might say. The record shows, incidentally, that Manning was interviewed by defense counsel in the discovery stages of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">Proposition of law No. 7 reads: \u201cOhio Revised Code 2911.01 is unconstitutional for the reason that it is ambiguous, vague and does not specifically recite an offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The lower court properly held that R. C. 2911.01, when read in light of R. C. 2913.02, is not ambiguous or vague.</p>\n<p id=\"A30\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In proposition of law No. 8, applicant pleads error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">\u201cIt is prejudicial error to instruct the jury that the purpose to kill <em>must </em>be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEF\">While instructing the jury about the law, the trial court said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u201cIt must be established in this case that at the time in question there was present in the mind of the defendant a specific intent to kill Joseph Eshack, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">\u201cNow, purpose is the decision of the mind to do an, act with a conscious objective of producing a specific result. To do an act purposely is to do it intentionally and not accidentally. Purpose and intent mean the same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">\u201cThe purpose with which a person does an act is known only to himself unless he expresses it to another or indicates it by his conduct. The purpose with which a person does an act is determined from the manner in which it is done, the means and method and the weapon used, and all other facts and circumstances in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">\u201cIf a wound is inflicted upon a person with a deadly weapon <em>m a manner calculated to destroy life, </em>the purpose to kill <em>must </em>be inferred from the use of said weapon. Both an inference of malice may be inferred from the facts and circumstances of an unlawful killing where a deadly weapon is used.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The defendant argues that the use of a dangerous weapon is not <em>conclusive </em>proof of an intent to kill, and that the jury must be free to decide whether the actual intent was to wound or disable, or whether the killing was purely accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">In reading the court\u2019s instructions to the jury in their entirety, this court does not believe the above instruction to have constituted prejudicial error. Having made such a decision, the court does not need to consider the significance of the defendant\u2019s failure to object to the charge or request a correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>This proposition of law is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">As his proposition of law No. 9, appellant contends that \u201c [t]he Ohio statutes with reference to aggravated murder, a capital offense, and the related sections dealing with death in the electric chair are unconstitutional for the reason that the mitigating circumstances of mental deficiency has no definition in law, is vague, ambiguous and impossible to ascertain with any degree of uniformity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">This argument has already been considered and rejected by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Black </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 262, 358 N. E. 2d 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">X.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Proposition of law No. 10 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u201cThe Ohio statute with reference to aggravated murder and related sections dealing with death in the electric chair are unconstitutional for the reason that they do not assure the defendant the equal protection of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">This argument is without merit. <em>State </em>v. Bayless, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">As his proposition of law No. 11, appellant pleads error as follows: \u201cIt is reversible error to request a psychiatrist to make the ultimate legal conclusion as to whether the offense was primarily the product of the offender\u2019s mental deficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">In a letter to Dr. Elliot Migdal, contained in the record, the court instructed him that the legal definition of mental deficiency is \u201cwhether or not the offense was primarily the product of the offender\u2019s (Floyd Edwards) psychosis or mental deficiency, though such condition is insufficient to establish the defense of insanity.\u201d The letter merely repeated the statutory language regarding mitigation. The psychiatrist did not decide the ultimate legal issue of mitigation. He merely provided information in that regard. The trial court was not restricted by the doctor\u2019s testimony, nor was he constrained to accept it. The trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>not the psychiatrist, made the determination that ho mitigating circumstances existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">This proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In his final proposition of law, appellant pleads error \u2022as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\u201cWhen the medical testimony is that the defendant, because of his mentality, could not be expected to form the same good judgment as a normal person, especially under stress, a finding that the offense was not the product of the accused\u2019s mental deficiency is manifestly against the weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">There is evidence indicating that the defendant was below average in intelligence. However, expert testimony indicated that he was not mentally deficient or retarded. He was a graduate of one of the local high schools. Despite this fact, there is evidence that he was educationally deficient. However, educational deficiency does not equate with mental deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">In criminal appeals, this court will not retry issues of fact. In the circumstances at hand, we confine our consideration to a determination of whether there is sufficient substantial evidence to support the verdict rendered. From the evidence before it, the trial court had more than sufficient evidence to support its judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cliff </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St. 2d 31, 249 N. E. 2d 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">This proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-14\">Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebrezze, W.
