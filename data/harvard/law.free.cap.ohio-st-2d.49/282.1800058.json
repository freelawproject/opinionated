Delator states this mandatory duty is. imposed upon respondents by R. C. 1901.11 and 1925.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-17\">..'The. referee; hears default proceedings under Civ.

Chapter 1923, small claims proceedings under certain circumstances, and other matters designated by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Respondents contend that R. C. 1925.01(B) only requires them to pay two-fifths of the salary when the referee is actually engaged in small claims division work.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">R. C. 1925.01 provides that each municipal and county court shall establish a small claims division, which may be conducted by a referee who shall receive such annual compensation as the court prescribes \u201c* * <em>* </em>from the same sources and in the same manner as provided in\u201d R. C. 1901.11. That latter section establishes that three-fifths of the compensation of municipal judges shall be paid from the city treasury and two-fifths from the treasury of the county in which the city is located. Extension of the referee \u2019s duties by the Canton Municipal Court does not alter the legislative mandate that the city and county share the compensation expense of the referee as provided in R. C. 1901.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The writ prayed for is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-10\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, W. Brown, P.
