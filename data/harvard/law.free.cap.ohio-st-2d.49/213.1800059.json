Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbB\">The main issue raised by this cause is the effect to be given to two insurance policies covering the same risk and providing that their liability with regard to that risk shall be excess insurance over other valid, collectible insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Buckeye proposes two reasons why State Auto should be primarily liable for the damages arising out of the Harrell accident. The first is that, \u201cas a practical matter, the State Auto insured was responsible for the accident.\u201d The second is that neither policy qualifies \u201cby its terms\u201d as a policy of primary insurance, and, therefore, \u201cthe policy which specifically covers a vehicle and its driver\u201d provides \u201cthe primary coverage.\u201d Buckeye contends, in the alternative, that \u201cthe Court of Appeals did not err in the manner in which it prorated the loss between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Buckeye\u2019s first argument is without merit. In <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Banker\u2019s Indemnity Co. </em>(1935), 51 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>App. 323, the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County found it reasonable; between two insurers, to hold th\u00e9 insurer of the <em>party </em>involved in the accident primarily liable even though both policies attempted to avoid liability. However, we see no'reason to adopt that court\u2019s reasoning. The liability-limiting clauses in <em>Maryland </em>were not the same type as\u2019 those in the instant cause. One policy contained an excess cl\u00e1\u00fcse, and the other contained an escape clause. Moreover, .the primary tortfeasor theory espoused in <em>Maryland </em>has been criticized by later courts and commentators because-it \u201c * * <em>* </em>represents an attempt to arbitrarily impose primary liability on one of the insurers\u201d (Note, Concurrent Coverage in Automobile Liability Insurance [1965], 65 Colum. L. Rev. 319, 322). Even more important, the theory fails to reflect \u201c* * * the intent of each insurer to cover the tortfeasor whether he was expressly named in its policy or was an additional insured under its omnibus clause\u201d <em>(Cosmopolitan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>[1959], 28 N. J. 554, 560, 147 A. 2d 529). This last criticism is especially compelling because an analysis based on the intent of the parties had they anticipated the occurrence of. conflicting excess clauses is the best approach to such problems. (Concurrent Coverage, <em>supra, </em>at page 321.) We thus reject Buckeye\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Buckeye, also contends that, where neither policy is primary \u201cby its terms,\u201d because each includes coverage and excess clauses for the same risk, \u201cthe policy which specifically covers a vehicle and its driver.\u201d provides \u201cprimary coverage.\u201d Buckeye correctly asserts that; by definition, neither ' of two policies containing mutually repugnant excess clauses is primary. Indeed, it is because neither policy is primary where two policies contain. conflicting excess clauses that courts have,had to resort to judicial formulae, including the \u201cspecific versus general\u201d theory espoused by Buckeye, to apportion liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>not persuaded, however, by Buckeye\u2019s suggestion that we hold .State Auto primarily liable for the risk covered in the excess.clauses'on the ground that the rest of State Auto\u2019s policy is more specific than its own. Buckeye\u2019s argument is based on \u201ccircular reasoning.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>State Farm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Home Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d. 45, 47, this court pointed out. that before one policy \u201ccan ride as excess insurance, the mother policy must be made to\u2019 walk as primary insurance.\u201d Since there can be no primary insurance of the risk where there are conflicting excess clauses, -the .excess clauses <em>a fortiori </em>cannot be a valid means of establishing only \u201csecondary\u201d liability. (See, also, <em>Continental Cas. Co. v. Buckeye Union Cas. Co. </em>[1957], 75 Ohio Law Abs. 79, 91; <em>Cosmopolitan, supra, </em>at-page 562.) For us to look to other provisions within the insurance policies in order to find one insurer primarily liable and give effect to an excess clause which has been neutralized, as a matter of logic, by the conflicting excess clause of the other policy, is to apportion liability on the basis of criteria unrelated to the excess clauses themselves and to run the same hazards of arbitrariness and disregard for the insurer\u2019s intent that lead us to reject the primary tortfeasor doctrine. Therefore, we decline to accept Buckeye\u2019s second contention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals for Franklin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>County correetly concluded that \u201cit was error\u201d for the trial court to find that one party had \u201cprimar^\u201d and the other \u201csecondary, coverage in this case * *</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Having rejected the methods of determining liability suggested by Buckeye, we must now consider what method of apportioning coverage to adopt. The Court of Appeals ruled that the \u201crespective coverages\u201d of the policies at issue in the present cause be \u201cprorated.\u201d We agree that some method of prorating coverage between Buckeye and State Auto is necessary. Proration has been adopted by a majority of jurisdictions dealing with the problem of conflicting excess clauses. Annotation, 69 A. L. R. 2d 1122, 1123-1124. Furthermore, it is consistent with the concept of primary and excess liability expressed in <em>State Farm, supra, </em>and <em>Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>and does not conflict with any previous treatment of insurance policy clauses by this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, by prorating the coverage of insurers such as Buckeye and'State Auto, we can honor the expectations of policyholders that they receive protection, and we can still give at least partial effect to the insurer\u2019s intent to escape primary liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Court of Appeals held, and Buckeye asserts, that \u201cthe most equitable method of prorating is to divide the coverages equally to the limits of the lower limit policy.\u201d We disagree. Although the Court of Appeals may have been accurate in stating that \u201cinsureds do not pay proportionate premiums for upper limits,\u201d proration based on the cost to the policyholder has been criticized by commentators (Note, 1 Willamette L. J. 485, 490 [1961]; Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Notes, 11 Hastings L. J. 223, 226 [1959]) and seems irrelevant since the policyholder will receive protection under any method of proration. .......</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The majority rule is to prorate liability according to the amount of coverage provided by each- insurer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This method of proration \u201cassures indemnification for. the insured: up to the maximum amount of coverage afforded \u00a1by each policy,\u201d and it takes into consideration the- respective! liabilities that the two insurers would have incurred had there,not been other insurance. Concurrent Coverage, <em>supra </em>(65 Colum. L. Rev. 319), at page 330. W\u00e9 hold, therefore, that where two insurance policies cover the same risk and both provide that their liability with regard to that risk shall be exeess insurance over other valid, collectible insurance, the two insurers become liable-in. proportion to the . amount of insurance provided by their respective policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is modified, and, as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u25a0 <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b246-8\"><em>\u2022 </em>0Neill,' C.

Co., supra </em>(75 Ohio Law Abs. 79), at page 91, the only 'previous Ohio case dealing with two conflicting excess clauses. Starting with \u201cthe fact * * * that there can be no \u2018excess' insurance in the absence of a \u2018primary\u2019 insurance,\u2019\u2019 the <em>Continental </em>court rejected \u201cbeginning\u201d its \u201cmental approach with one policy and then going in circles\u201d and chose instead to reason as\u2019 follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c* * * As to- Continental, its policy cannot be \u2018excess\u2019 because there is,no.t.in- effect, any other policy of \u2018primary\u2019 insurance. The \u2018excess\u2019 provision being, .inoperative and the general coverage language applicable, it is potentially liable to the full amount of its coverage to the same extent .as . if its policy contained no excess feature. Having so concluded, we do.not. say that because of such conclusion we may now apply the! \u2018excess\u2019, features of Buckeye\u2019s policy. To do so would make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the result depend upon which policy we considered first. Instead, and ignoring our conclusion as to the Continental policy, we consider the policy of Buckeye in the same way.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> In <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp. </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 488, this court aifirmed the rule that the specific insurer is primarily liable. The <em>Trinity </em>case is inapposite, however, because it involved a contest between an excess clause and a prorata clause, and that distinction was equally as important to the court as was the general specific coverage theory. <em>Trinity, supra, </em>at page 491.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b246-9\"> See 69 A.
