Bbown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4Mv\">The issues raised by this cause are (1) whether, under R. C. Chapter 4906, the Power Siting Commission must normally defer to local judgment about power line tower designs, (2) whether the testimony of electrical engineers about the effect of electromagnetic fields on nearby animal and plant life constitutes competent expert witness testimony on which the commission may base its determination, and (3) what is the appropriate standard of review by this court of a Power Siting Commission determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Chester Township poses two basic arguments to this court. The first is that Ohio townships are \u201cvested with the primary responsibility for regulating the size and design of new structures * * * within their jurisdictions\u201d and, therefore, that the Power Siting Commission should defer to local judgment on tower designs unless the state can show that such deference \u201cwill conflict with an overriding state interest, place an unreasonable burden upon the applicant public utility or otherwise interfere with the ability of the public utility to carry out the project for which it seeks certification.\u201d The second basic argument is that \u201c[t]he testimony of expert witnesses\u201d about the effect of electro-magnetic fields on plant and animal life \u201cdoes not constitute substantial competent evidence upon which the commission may base its determination.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Appellant\u2019s first argument is without merit. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that R. C. 519.02 grants township trustees the power to \u201cregulate by resolution the location, height, bulk, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures * * * in the unincorporated territory of such township * * *.\u201d Appellant cannot, however, rely on R. C. Chapter 519 to argue that the Power Siting Commission must normally defer to local judgment, in view of the fact that R. C. 519.21 <em>exempts </em>from the local zoning control of R. C. 519.02 \u201cany buildings or structures of any public utility * * * or the use of land by any public utility * * * for the operation of its business.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>For similar reasons, the provisions of R. C. Chapter 4906 do not support the township\u2019s contention that the commission must normally defer to local judgment oh tower designs. Although R. C. Chapter 4906 predicates the grant of an application to construct public utility facilities upon a commission finding that \u201cthe facility will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity,\u201d and although it provides local governments with notice of the utility company\u2019s application and makes them parties to the certification hearing, the Revised Code Chapter does not make local judgment <em>control </em>the commission\u2019s choice of tower designs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the contrary, R. C. 4906.10(A) requires that the commission base its decision to grant or deny an application on \u201cthe record.\u201d Furthermore, R. C. 4906.13 and 4906.02(A) make it clear that approval of public utility construction plans, including the selection of tower designs, is a <em>state </em>matter. R. C. 4906.02(A) grants the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>statewide jurisdiction and requires that four of its five, members be drawn from existing state agencies. R. C. 4906.-13 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201cNo public agency or political subdivision of this state-may require any approval, consent, permit, certificate or other condition for the construction or initial operation of a major utility facility authorized by a certificate issued pursuant to Chapter 4906 of the Revised Code. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXV\">Given the fact that R. C. 4906.13 expressly prohibits, local governments from conditioning the construction or operation of R. C. Chapter 4906 public utility facilities on. local \u201capproval\u201d and given the fact that R. C. 4906.06(B) and 4906.08(A) (2) provide for investigating the claims and hearing the testimony of townships <em>and </em>applicants, we find appellant\u2019s argument that township preferences as to tower designs should normally control to be without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Chester Township argues further that the commission erred in basing its determination that the electro-magneticfields surrounding power lines would not be detrimental to the public on the testimony of two electrical engineers; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>because such opinion testimony was \u201coutside\u201d the engineers\u2019 \u201cfield, experience or discipline.\u201d We do not find this argument convincing. The finder of fact has the power to make reasonable rulings as to the competency, admissibility and scope of expert testimony and to determine the weight to be accorded that testimony. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Defiance </em>(1895), 52 Ohio St. 262, paragraph nine of the syllabus; McCormick On Evidence (2 Ed.) 29, Section 13; 21 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 425, Evidence, Section-416. This rule is especially applicable to an R. C. Chapter 4906 proceeding because the General Assembly has granted the commission discretion, in its fact-finding role, to require such information, conduct such studies and adopt such rules of evidence as it deems necessary. R. C. 4906.10, 4906.03, and 4906.09.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The engineers were called to testify in order to rebut the statements of another electrical engineer, and much of their testimony involved Comparing the electro-magnetic fields which would surround the proposed line with those which had surrounded the power lines studied in reports submitted as exhibits by appellant. Given the context in which the expert opinions concerning the danger of the electromagnetic fields were elicited, this court does not find that the commission abused its discretion in admitting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>weighing their testimony. Appellant\u2019s second argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Implicit in appellant\u2019s arguments concerning expert opinion testimony about electro-magnetic field effects and the deference to be given to local judgment about tower design, is a challenge to the commission\u2019s determination on the grounds that it is against the weight of the evidence. Pursuant to R. C. 4906.12, this court must apply the same standard of review to Power Siting Commission determinations as we apply to orders by the Public Utilities Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">R. C. 4906.12 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cSections 4903.02 to 4903.16 and Sections 4903.20 to 4903.23 of the Revised Code shall apply to any proceeding or order of the Power Siting Commission under Chapter 4906 of the Revised Code, in the same manner as if the commission were the Public Utilities Commission under such sections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">R. C. 4903.13 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201cA final order made by the Public Utilities Commission shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by the Supreme Court on appeal, if, upon consideration of the record, such court is of the opinion that such order was unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Under the \u201cunlawful or unreasonable\u201d standard of R. C. 4903.13, this court will not reverse or modify a determination unless it is manifestly against the weight of the evidence and so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty. <em>Delphos </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1940), 137 Ohio St. 422, 424; <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util.

Comm. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 58, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">The commission\u2019s findings that towers of lattice construction are preferable to those of pole construction chosen by the township trustees and that the electro-magnetic fields surrounding the towers will not be detrimental to nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>animal and plant life are not manifestly against the weight of the evidence. At the hearing, the commission was presented with substantial evidence that lattice towers are appropriate for the Chester Township area. Witnesses testified that the lattice design is well suited to the predominantly wooded landscape of Chester Township, that it is compatible with towers already built on the right of way which the proposed line will share, and that the lattice design costs 80 percent less than the tower design proposed by the trustees. The commission was also presented with sufficient information indicating that the electro-magnetic fields surrounding the proposed tower lines will not be detrimental. The secretary\u2019s report came to that conclusion. Witnesses at the hearing concurred with the secretary\u2019s report, and appellant\u2019s evidence to the contrary was placed in doubt by the testimony of experts as to the voltage of the proposed power lines. In light of the considerable evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s findings, we hold its determinations to be reasonable and lawful. The order of the Power Siting Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-5\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Celebrezze, P. Brown and Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> In the reply brief which it submitted before this court, Chester Township raises, in addition to the two issues cited above, the question of whether the \u201crecord evidence\u201d upon which the commission bases its decision, pursuant to R. C. Chapter 4906, is limited to evidence found only in the \u201ctranscript of the adjudicatory hearings conducted by the administrative law judge,\u201d or whether it includes information from the application and the secretary\u2019s staff report as well. Under R. C. 4906.12 most provisions of R. C. Chapter 4903 (including R. C. 4903.10) apply to proceedings conducted pursuant to R. C. Chapter 4906. R. C. 4903.10 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\u201cAfter any order has been made * * * any party who has entered an appearance in person or by counsel in the proceeding may apply for a rehearing in respect to any matters determined in said proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cSuch application shall be in writing and shall set forth specifically the ground or grounds on which the applicant considers said order to be unreasonable or unlawful. No party shall in any court urge or rely on any ground for reversal, vacation, or modification not so set forth in such application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Appellant\u2019s application for a rehearing was based on the argument that the expert witnesses relied on by the commission should not have been given credence because both were electrical engineers and, as such, they were \u201cincompetent to render an opinion on the health hazards posed by high voltage transmission lines.\u201d To support that contention appellant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201c* * * And, the commission cannot remedy the deficiency by standing upon the tentative, incomplete and unsupported statements contained in the application * * * or upon the untested data submitted by the staff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Appellant\u2019s passing reference to information in the application or secretary\u2019s report, made in support of an <em>evidentiary </em>argument, is insufficient to constitute grounds for a last-minute <em>statutory </em>challenge to the inclusion of that information in the record. In <em>Agin </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 97, 98, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201cThere is some similarity between parts of some of the grounds stated in appellants\u2019 application for rehearing before the commission and parts of some of the statements of law in appellants\u2019 brief on appeal in this court. Such a casual similarity does not, however, meet the requirements of Section 4903.10, Revised Code * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The same principle applies to the instant cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-13\"> R.

The fact is, however, that R. C. Chapter 4906 requires the commission to rule on the \u201cenvironmental impact\u201d of such proposed public utility constructions as power line towers. That the analysis, of the \u201cenvironmental impact\u201d of a tower necessarily involves a judgment as to its aesthetic appeal does not change the thrust of the statute. The question of aesthetics, like those of \u201cneed,\u201d consistency* with regional expansion plans and \u201cpublic interest, convenience and necessity\u201d must be resolved by the <em>commission </em>(R.

Today, it is evident that overhead high voltage transmission lines are a fact of life in a world in which the demands for electric power are constantly growing. Furthermore, it is presently accepted that there is no known way to produce, transmit and distribute electric energy without some effect on the environment; Indeed, it is ironic that, just at the time when a portion of our society has become concerned with the environment and aesthetic questions, this country is saddled with an insatiable appetite which consumes ever increasing amounts of electricity and all other; known forms of energy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>result is a conflict between the needs of a highly technological society and an increased awareness of environmental considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A realization of this conflict served as an impetus to the General Assembly\u2019s establishment of the Power Siting Commission (hereinafter \u201ccommission\u201d). In general, the commission is responsible for evaluating the effects on the environment of proposed and alternative sites for the location of power plants and transmission line routes. 43A Ohio Jurisprudence 2d, Pollution Control, Section 155. R. C. 4906.04 states that no person shall commence to construct a major utility facility in Ohio without first having obtained a certificate for the facility from the commission. Guidelines for the issuance of the certificate are established by R. C. 4906.10. In relevant part, they require the commission to find:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">(1) The basis for the need for the facility;</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">(2) the nature of probable environmental impact;</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">(3) that the facility represents the <em>minimum, adverse environmental impact, </em>considering the state of available technology and the nature and the economics of various alternatives, and <em>other pertinent </em>considerations; and</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">(4) that the facility will serve the <em>public interest, </em>convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Furthermore, R. C. 4906.13 prevents public agencies and political subdivisions from requiring approval, consent, permit, certificate or other condition for construction or initial operation of a major utility facility. Plainly speaking, the object of the statute is to prevent local authorities from placing \u201clocal\u201d considerations ahead of \u201cstatewide\u201d concerns. Clearly, the General Assembly created the commission to balance the presently competing interest of energy and environment, endowed it with the necessary power to prevent local concerns from interfering with statewide energy needs, and then formulated the guidelines within which the commission is to perform its task. To this court was given the duty of ascertaining the commission\u2019s adherence to these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Today\u2019s affirmance of the commission\u2019s order grants the approval of this court to a standard that, when applied, rejects, for apparently aesthetic reasons only, the judgment of the duly elected representatives of a community concerning the nature of transmission towers to be placed within their community and accepts the design proposed by the utility and its hired consultant, regardless of the failure to show that the design chosen by the community is unreasonable, conflicts with an overriding state interest, or impairs the ability of the utility to complete the project for which it seeks certification. While I concur with the majority\u2019s statement that this court must apply the same standard of review to the commission\u2019s determination as it applies to the orders of the Public Utilities Commission, I disagree with its conclusion that the commission\u2019s findings were supported by considerable evidence and the determinations based thereon were reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The facts reveal the commission\u2019s acceptance of the recommendation of the utility and its consultant to use horizontal lattice design transmission towers along that segment of the route passing through Chester Township, despite the fact that the Board of Trustees of Chester Township approved the \u201cH\u201d frame steel pole design as being compatible with the community and its future, development. In finding the commission\u2019s order reasonable and lawful, the majority points to the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">(1) the \u201clattice\u201d design is well suited to the predominantly wooded landscape of Chester Township;</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">(2) the \u201clattice\u201d design towers are compatible with the existing towers on the right-of-way; and -</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">(3) the \u201clattice\u201d design towers cost 80 percent less than the design approved by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In addressing the last point first, the record is inundated with comments by the representatives of the utility implying that cost was not a controlling factor in the selection of the \u201clattice\u201d type tower for use on the route through Chester Township. In fact, counsel for appellee reiterated the same proposition in oral argum\u00e9nt before .this , court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The utility presented various viable tower designs for use along the route from which Chester Township chose their design which incidentally was not the most expensive of the designs submitted. The commission made no finding of the exact total dollar increase that would result with the use of the \u201cH\u201d frame tower for that portion of the route traversing Chester Township. Nor did the commission relate this- increased cost as a percentage to the total cost of the project, or its ultimate relationship to utility rates. G-enerally, the cost problem presented by the variance in cost between transmission tower designs is minimal in relationship to the overall cost of the project.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, it appears unreasonable for the commission to base its decision on a factor which the utility has frequently admitted played no relevant part in its decision to use the \u201clattice\u201d type structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The argument that the \u201clattice\u201d design towers are compatible with the existing transmission towers is hardly more compelling. Evidence obtained during the hearings showed that the existing towers were constructed in the 1930\u2019s. Even if aesthetics were considered when these existing towers were constructed, it is reasonable to assume that their environs have changed during the past 45 years. The commission is thus basing its order on the proposition that what was good in 1930 must continue to be appropriate for 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Furthermore, evidence was presented and a finding made by the administrative law judge that transmission towers had a useful life of 75 years. In this regard, Chester Township expressed its desire that the existing towers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>would at the expiration of their useful life he replaced by a tower of a design more compatible with the community. The commission\u2019s order would merely perpetuate the use of a tower similar to existing towers for the mere sake of symmetry. Application of this tenet places a developing community in the position of forever being saddled with transmission towers similar to those already existing within the community. Thus, the community is left to place the blame on their nearsighted forefathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The only remaining evidence from which the commission could reasonably conclude the \u201clattice\u201d design tower is preferable to the \u201cH\u201d steel pole design was the testimony of the utility representatives as to the findings of their consultants that the lattice design is well suited to the predominantly wooded landscape of Chester Township. Thus, the decision of the commission appears to be based not on the energy needs of the state, economics, or technological considerations but upon aesthetics, beauty versus ugliness, or likes versus dislikes. The commission accepted the \u201ctaste\u201d of the utility and its consultants in spite of the request of the duly elected representatives of Chester Township to use a tower which they believe to be more compatible with their community and their plans for their future. It will not be the utility, its consultants, the commission or the vast majority of the populace of Ohio, but the residents of Chester Township who will awake each morning to find the \u201cerector-set\u201d images superimposed on their vision of the horizon. Beauty and ugliness or likes and dislikes are purely subjective. The requirement of probative evidence as to the effect on the residents and the community is both impractical and unrealistic. The residents of Chester Township will bear the imposition; it is only logical that, if this necessary intrusion could be . slightly lessened by taking a different form, fulfillment of a minimum adverse environinental impact should be the commission\u2019s objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Chester Township\u2019s choice of the \u201cH\u201d design tower instead of the \u201clattice\u201d design transmission tower in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>manner impedes or restricts the transmission of needed electricity. This is not the classic example of the conflict between energy and the environment. The transmission lines will traverse the township. The township\u2019s request only goes to the . nature of the beast, not to its existence. The township\u2019s request would present no technical obstructions to the completion of the project. R. C. 4906.10 requires the commission to determine the facilities that represent the minimum adverse impact. It is the opinion of the representatives of the community that the use of the \u201cH\u201d design tower would minimize the adversity of this necessary creature of our modern world. Thoughtful consideration of and due respect to an affected community\u2019s opinion expressed by its legal representatives by the commission is implied from the notice provision of R. C. 4906.06(B). However, thoughtful consideration and due respect are certainly not implied by the statement the commission used in disposing of the township\u2019s request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201cSimply stated, there is a lack of evidence to justify the use of steel pole, H-frame structures in Chester Township.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">I believe it is unreasonable to infer a legislative intent that the commission, in circumstances as these and where no matter of statewide concern is presented, is presumed to be able to tell the inhabitants of a community what they will like or dislike.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> \u2018The aesthetics issue has, however, on occasion arisen in another and more diffuse form when it is. contended, not that the transmission lines should be placed underground, but that they should be supported by some type of structure <em>different </em>from that proposed, allegedly more aesthetic.
