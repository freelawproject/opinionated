Apparently, this refund was to compensate Esther Holland, sole beneficiary of the estate, for lost interest that could have been earned upon investment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">(2) The $744.91 that relator alleged in Count II of its complaint as \u201cnot accounted for as of February 13, 1975\u201d was paid by respondent to Master Charge on an account of Mr. Ross. According to respondent\u2019s testimony before the board, Mrs. Ross had used this account to buy gifts for her boyfriend, and respondent was directed by Mr. Ross to make certain that the account was paid out of the $2,000 that he had previously given to respondent to be paid to Mrs. Ross in settlement. Further, in this matter, respondent had paid some court costs out of his own pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">(3) Respondent testified he was not the fiduciary in over 80 percent of the estates that relator alleged were neglected by respondent, and testified further that the fiduciaries of these estates and other \u201cvarious people\u201d were uncooperative or difficult to locate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">(4) Respondent was very cooperative with counsel for the relator and with the board.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
