J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsX\">The principal witness against the appellant was Parker, the triggerman. Defense counsel had previously interviewed Parker in jail. The interview was recorded, and Parker made an exculpatory statement about the participation of the appellant in the commission of the robbery and the murder. At trial, Parker gave a different account of the facts and incriminated the appellant. \u2018When defense counsel attempted to impeach Parker by playing the recording, the trial court, upon objection of the state, refused to permit its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Throughout the earlier stages of the case, the defense and prosecution had freely exchanged trial preparation materials under a Crim. R. 16 reciprocity agreement. The trial court held that the tape of the recorded interview should have been disclosed (as a \u201ctangible object\u201d under Crim. R. 16(C)(1)(a)) under these earlier exchanges. Since the appellant\u2019s counsel had failed to reveal the tape to the prosecutor at these appropriate times, the court excluded the tape as a disciplinary measure under Crim. R. 16(E) (3). After the conviction, the appellant asked for a re-examination of the court\u2019s ruling and, pursuant to Crim. R. 33(A)(5), moved for a new trial. The trial court, consistent with its earlier order, denied the motion. The issue is whether the trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">During the trial, the appellant argued that the tape was not discoverable under the discovery reciprocity agreement. Under Crim. R. 16(C)(1)(e), the appellant contended that only the names of witnesses need be disclosed. Although appellant objected to the court\u2019s ruling, he did not proffer the tape into the record. Later, in appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the court was asked to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>correctness of its earlier ruling. Appellant argued that the suppression of the tape-recorded statement of Parker was contrary to Crim. R. 16(C)(2). The tape recording and a transcript thereof was admitted in evidence. The motion for a new trial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In this case, the trial court made two separate rulings. In the first, the court excluded the tape and prevented the defense counsel from effectively cross-examining the state\u2019s chief witness, Parker. In the second, counsel moved for a new trial. The tape and <em>transcript </em>thereof were admitted in evidence at the hearing on the motion for a new trial. Therefore, only the second order is reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Differentiating the two court rulings is significant, for upon an examination of the record, it is not clear which trial court order the appellant\u2019s counsel was appealing. In the notice of appeal, filed June 11, 1975, it is clear that he was appealing the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. App. R. 3(C). However, in filing the assignment of errors in the Court of Appeals, it is equally clear that the defense attorney was assigning as error the trial court\u2019s earlier order. App. R. 9(B). It was this particular order that the appellate court considered in its opinion. Similarly, it is from the appellate court\u2019s ruling on this earlier order that the appellant has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Inasmuch as appellant specified in his notice of appeal that he was appealing the order denying his motion for a new trial, and because the question of law is identical in both the court\u2019s rulings, the record supports the conclusion that the appellant has preserved the right to assert in this court that the trial court erred in refusing to permit use of the tape at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In the motion for a new trial, the appellant argued that the trial court was in error because the tape was privileged under Crim. R. 16(C)(2). That rule provides, in part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cExcept as provided in subsections C(1)(b) and (d), this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>reports, memoranda, or other internal documents made by the defense attorney or his agents in connection with the investigation or defense of the ease, or of statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to the defense attorney or his agents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Appellant argues that this tape is privileged as a statement made by a witness to the defense attorney. Although the appellant admits that the interview was recorded, thus, embodying Parker\u2019s exculpatory remarks in a \u201ctangible-object,\u201d arguably discoverable under Crim. R. 16(C) (1) (a),, the act of recording should not have rendered that material discoverable. If such were the case, appellant concludes,, the work product exception as given in Crim. R. 16(C)(2) could be easily circumvented.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">This court finds the appellant\u2019s argument persuasive.. Regardless of the tape\u2019s status as a \u201ctangible object\u201d under the reciprocity agreement, the language in Crim. R. 16(C)(2) is clear and unambiguous: \u201c* * * this rule does, not authorize the discovery of * * * statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to the defense attorney or his agents.\u201d Parker was clearly a witness in this ease.. The impeaching statement was likewise one gathered by the* defense attorney. In refusing to permit use of the tape, the* trial court erred. Moreover, because the state\u2019s case rested, squarely on the shoulders and credibility of the co-defendant who turned state\u2019s evidence, the court\u2019s order was prejudicial to the appellant\u2019s rights. Appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is well taken. He is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Having reversed on this issue, this court need not consider the appellant\u2019s other propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and', the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-10\">Herbert, Stern, W.
