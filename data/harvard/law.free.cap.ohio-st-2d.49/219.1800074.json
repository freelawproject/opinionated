Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACqV\">The history of the dispute in this cause dates back at least to 1972, when the civil service board of the city of Dayton attempted to establish new eligibility lists for promotion in the police department as part of an affirmative aetion program to encourage minority members to enter the police force. Differences over this policy produced a tangle of litigation in both state and federal courts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the result that, according to the parties, there have been no promotions within the classified service. of. the police department to supervisory positions since 1972. The present litigation largely concerns an examination for promotion to sergeant held on December 14, 1975. The Court of Appeals held that the procedures involved in that test' violated the city charter and also intentionally violated the injunction issued by that court in <em>Spencer v. Dayton, supra </em>(44 Ohio App. 2d 236). The court thereupon prohibited the city from using the eligibility list compiled on the basis of that procedure and ordered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>city to draw up a new eligibility list based upon the December 14th examination but following scoring procedures agreed to by the parties after the decision of the court was announced. Other aspects of the court\u2019s decision and judgment entry are discussed below. The city of Dayton sets out eight propositions of law assigning error in the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Court of Appeals held the city in contempt on the grounds that, by intentionally violating its charter, the city had also violated the injunction in <em>Spencer. </em>(In its entry, the <em>Spencer </em>court had specifically enjoined \u201cpromotional examinations for the former positions of lieutenant and related plans <em>that violate the charter or rules of the civil service board.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]) The Court of Appeals also held that the city charter and the rules required that the factors of seniority and efficiency not be ignored or nullified, though it was possible to vary the degree of credit for those factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The procedure which the city sought to follow in the December 14, 1975, promotional examination was a special two-step test. Credits for seniority and efficiency which could total up to five percentage points were to be added to the raw score attained by each officer taking a job-related test. Everyone who scored 70 points or better, including those credits earned for seniority and efficiency, became eligible for a second, psychological test. The certified list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>was to be made up solely from the results of the psychological test, and the credits for seniority and efficiency were reflected in that list only to the extent that those credits might permit a police officer to pass the first test and therefore become eligible to take the second one.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The city defends this two-stage test as necessary in order to comply with federal EEOC guidelines. Whatever the force of this contention, it is clear the city never modified its own rules or charter to permit the proposed promotional scheme.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not necessary to reach the question of whether this scheme was valid under federal guidelines, or whether it might be valid under the Dayton Charter if properly adopted by rule. The scheme violated the rules governing promotions which the civil service board is by charter required to adopt and enforce. It was, accordingly, also a violation of the injunction in <em>Spencer, supra, </em>and it was not error for the court below to find the city in contempt. The city\u2019s first proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The city also contends that the injunction is so broadly and vaguely stated, and so fails to particularize the acts to be mandated or prohibited, that it cannot support a finding of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Civ. R. 65(D) provides that \u201c [e]very order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained * * This rule is identical to the federal rule; although we have not had occasion to consider this question, there are federal cases interpreting the rule. The essential holding of these cases is that the decree sought to be enforced must not be too vague to be understood.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In the present cause, the opinion'and entry of the <em>Spencer </em>court gave the city adequate notice that the charter provisions and rules cited by the court were to be followed in subsequent promotional examinations. By construing the relevant sections of the charter, the court made legal interpretation of the charter clear. Furthermore, the entry appears to be as specific as reasonably possible, given the fact that the city retained the right to amend the charter or its rules. Taken together, the opinion and entry are specific and detailed enough to give the city adequate notice of the requirements imposed on it and are not too vague to be understood. The city\u2019s second proposition of law is rejected.</p>\n<author id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Opinion, per W. Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">ni.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The city\u2019s third proposition of law is, basically, that the two-stage examination procedure does not violate the city charter. The Court of Appeals examined this issue at some length and concluded that \u201cthe complete elimination from final .scores of all job-related questions is both an abuse of discretion and a violation of law.\u201d It also permanently prohibited the civil service board from using threshold tests to determine eligibility to take promotional exams.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In our view, it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether the promotional procedure constitutes an abuse of discretion and a violation of law. Since the Dayton promotional scheme violates the city\u2019s rules, it is invalid regardless of whether it might also have so totally eliminated considerations of efficiency and seniority that it also violates the charter. The city\u2019s third proposition of law is thereby mooted by our decision upon the other aspects of this cause, and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We do feel compelled, however, to rule on the breadth of the court\u2019s order. Paragraph No. 6 of the entry states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cThe civil service board is permanently prohibited from using threshold tests to determine eligibility to take a promotional examination, from refusing to add the mandated credit for merit and seniority to the scores on the eligibility list and from eliminating the scores of job knowledge tests for placement upon the eligibility list.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">By its terms, the court\u2019s order would significantly limit the discretion of the city in adopting new rules for promotional examinations. Such an order is unnecessarily broad under the facts of this cause, since future threshold tests might be valid under the charter and properly enacted by rule, and yet nevertheless be barred by the court\u2019s order. Paragraph No. 6 of the court\u2019s judgment entry, is accordingly, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">No error is assigned concerning the court\u2019s orders directing the preparation of a new eligibility list based upon the December 14 examination, and that part of the court\u2019s judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The fourth proposition of law states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cUnder the charter of the city of Dayton, there is no requirement that, in order to he eligible for promotion within the classified service, a candidate must have served in the position or classification immediately below that to which promotion is sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">That proposition is correct as stated, but it fails to address the real issue raised by the Dayton practice of allowing police officers to bypass the rank of sergeant and \u201cjump rani?\u201d from officer to lieutenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Section 1 of Eule 17 of the Eules and Eegulations of the Civil Service Board of Dayton provides that no promotion to a higher position shall be made until after the person promoted has occupied the next lower position for at least six months. Section 3 of Eule 6 states that an applicant for the position of lieutenant must have from one to three years experience as a police officer; but it does not require that an applicant have served first as a sergeant. (It does require, however, that sergeants serve first as police officers and that captains serve first as lieutenants.) Eule 6 also states that \u201c [t]he procedures set forth in Eule 17 shall be followed' insofar as they are not inconsistent with Eule 6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">There is no inconsistency between the requirement of Eule 17 that a person must serve for at least six months in the next lower position before being promoted to any position and the provision of Eule 6 which is silent as to whether a candidate for lieutenant must first have served as a sergeant. Therefore, we find that Eule 17 applies, and that a candidate for lieutenant must first serve at least six months in the next lower rank of sergeant. We need not and do not reach the question of whether \u201cjumping rank\u201d would be valid under the charter if permitted by rule, and we also find no error in the entry of the Court of Appeals on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In its fifth and sixth propositions of law, the city contends, in effect, that the Court of Appeals erred in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>invalid the \u201crule-of-three\u201d promotional procedure and the provisions of Section 3 of Rule 12 providing for appeal from a \u201crule-of-three\u201d promotion decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The &lt;\u2018rule of three\u201d requires that the board list the top three highest-ranking persons eligible for a position and permits the appointing authority to approve one of the three to fill the position. A city -with a home-rule charter may' adopt a \u201crule of three\u201d as an exercise of a power of local-self-government, notwithstanding that the rule confliets' with a state statute. <em>State, ex rel. Canada, </em>v <em>Phillips </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 191. The Dayton Charter does not provide for such a rule, and the Court of Appeals held that the adoption of the \u201crule of three\u201d in Rule 12, Section 3, violates Section 97 of the charter which provides that the chief examiner shall be the employment officer and shall fill positions in the classified service from the eligibility lists.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court reasoned that, pursuant to the charter, only the chief examiner may fill positions in the classified service and that the transfer of this responsibility to others by rule would be an unlawful delegation of authority. This reasoning is correct. Since the charter provides that the chief examiner shall fill positions in the classified service, a rule may not reduce that authority to the designation of three candidates, nor expand the authority of some other official by permitting him to make the final appointment from among those candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The city contends further that the court misconstrued the authority of the city manager under Section 48 of the charter to appoint and remove employees in the civil service<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that Section 48 provides a sufficient basis for the enactment of the \u201crule of three.\u201d Both Sections .48 and 97 of the charter seem to grant authority to appoint employees in the civil service. :</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">- -The Court.of-Appeals concluded that, \u2018under Sections 48 and:97, the chief examiner makes the actual.appointment from the' list of those eligible, and the city . .manager does not have .authority over the chief examiner. -The court stated,.as follows: \u201cConstruing the charter provisions together ;it. is apparent that direction and consultation is imperative; before the chief examiner knows when, if and how -many vacancies are to be filled and the time when it is to be; . done. The requirement for requisition and consultation with the city manager cannot be stretched to include authority over the prescribed duties of the civil service board or over the conduct of the civil service board or over the conduct of the chief examiner in filling vacancies.\u201d ...</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">.We find the Court of Appeals\u2019 reading of the two sections to be more reasonable than the city\u2019s assertion that the :role of the chief examiner is limited to \u201cfilling vacancies\u2019\u2019-with appointees chosen by the city manager. We hold, therefore, that Rule 48 does not provide a sufficient basis for the enactment of the \u201crule of three\u201d and Section 3, Rule ,12, is invalid because it violates the city charter. Since the \u201crule of three\u201d is itself invalid, the issue of whether the provisions for appeal from the effects of its operation are also invalid is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">VL</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Although the city was prevented from promoting police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>officers as a result of the ongoing litigation, it had'a practice of malting emergency, temporary appoihtments and promotions, under which the \u201cplus-rated\u201d employees were' paid the salary and assigned the duties of their temporary ranks. The Court of Appeals held this'practice invalid insofar \u00e1s it increased the salaries of the plus-rated employees. Section 103 of the charter provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u201cThe treasurer or other public disbursing officer shall' not pay any salary or compensation for service to any person holding a position in the classified service unless the pay roll or account for such salary or compensation shall bear the certificate of the board, by its secretary, that the persons named therein have been appointed or employed and are performing service in accordance with the provisions of this charter and of the rules established thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The city argues necessity and emergency as a reason for the indefinite temporary salary increases. However, the increases plainly violate Section 103 and are not payable under the provision of the charter permitting increased salaries under specified emergency situations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The city\u2019s seventh proposition of law is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The city\u2019s eighth and last proposition of law is that attorney fees may not be taxed as part of costs in contempt proceedings in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">It is a well-established general rule in Ohio and elsewhere that \u201cin the absence of a statutory provision making attorney fees a part of the costs, such fees can not be so taxed.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Michaels, </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 599, 607; <em>State, ex rel. Grosser, </em>v. <em>Boy </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 184; <em>Sorin </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 177. However, it has been held almost universally in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>jurisdictions, as an exception to this rule, that a trial court has discretion to include reasonable attorney fees as a. part of costs taxable to a defendant found guiltyof civil contempt. <em>Toledo Scale Co. </em>v. <em>Computing Scale Co. </em>(1923), 261 U. S. 399, 426-428 (see, also, <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co. </em>[1967], 386 U. S. 714, 717-718); <em>Bata </em>v. <em>Central-Penn National Bank </em>(1972), 448 Pa. 355, 293 A. 2d 343; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lorenz </em>(1960), 144 Colo. 23, 354 P. 2d 1008; <em>Arvin, Inc., </em>v. <em>Sony Corp. of America </em>(1975), 215 Va. 704, 213 S. E. 2d 753; <em>Ramstead </em>v. <em>Hauge </em>(1968), 73 Wash. 2d 162, 437 P. 2d 402. See, generally, the cases cited in Annotation, 43 A. L. R. 3d 793.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">No abuse of discretion appears in the order of the trial court permitting the three attorneys fpr the F. O. P. and the B. P. A. to share in a fee equal to that paid by special counsel to the city, and the award of attorney fees is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The 'granting of a writ of prohibition is warranted only if the court or officer against whom it is sought is about to qxercise judicial or quasi-judicial power.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The only aspect' of this cause which could conceivably involve an exercise of quasi-judicial power is the issue of the validity of the pr.ovisions of Section 3, Rule 12, governing appeals by individuals who are passed over because of the \u201crule of three\u201d and removed from the eligibility list. Since that issue is mooted by our holding that the \u201crule of three\u201d, is itself invalid, no grounds remain which would support the granting of a writ of prohibition. The granting of the writ of prohibition is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Part 6 of the judgment entry of the Court of Appeals and the granting of a writ of prohibition are hereby reversed.

When it is founded upon a decree too vague to be understood, it can be a deadly one. Congress responded to that danger by requiring that a federal court frame its orders so that those who must obey them will know what the court intends to require and what it means to forbid. Because the decree of this District Court was not so framed, it cannot stand. And with it must fall .the District Court\u2019s decision holding the union in contempt. We do not deal here with a violation of a court order by one who fully understands its meaning but chooses to ignore its mandate.
