Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">The main issue presented by this cause is whether a police officer\u2019s affidavit in support, of a search warrant is sufficient to show probable cause when that affidavit contains only information received from the personal observations of an unnamed confidential informant and the officer\u2019s avowal that the informant is \u201creliable.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Appellant urges that such an affidavit does show probable cause because, in effect, (1) the affiant\u2019s <em>oath </em>is sufficient to establish, <em>\u201cper se, </em>the credibility of the affiant's source,\u201d and (2) under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1971), 403 U. S. 573, proof of the informant\u2019s credibility is not required when his \u201cpersonal observation of criminal activity\u201d supplies the factual basis of the informant\u2019s tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Appellant\u2019s first argument is not well taken. The Fourth Amendment requires that magistrates determine probable cause for themselves and that they not rely on the conclusions of the police. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1948), 333 U. S. 10, 14; <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1958), 357 U. S. 480, 486. Where a magistrate has only the sworn, but otherwise unsupported, assertion of a police officer that the informant is reliable, he has nothing upon which to base his determination of credibility but the officer\u2019s conclusion. Therefore, he cannot credit that unsupported assertion \u201cwithout abdicating his constitutional function.\u201d <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969), 393 U. S. 410, 416; <em>State </em>v. <em>Karr </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 163, 165. This court\u2019s-statement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Karr (supra, </em>at page 165), that \u201c[i]t is not sufficient that the affiant swear that his confidant was reliable, when no reason is offered the magistrate in support of that conclusion,\u201d applies to the instant cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Appellant\u2019s second argument is that, under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>a showing of the informant\u2019s credibility (where the affiant is not. the informant) is not required when his \u201cpersonal observation of criminal activity\u201d supplies the factual basis of the informant\u2019s tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Although affidavits for search warrants may be based on the hearsay testimony of a confidential unnamed informant, they must, in order to insure that magistrates determine probable cause for themselves, incorporate \u201ca substantial basis for crediting the hearsay.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1960), 362 U. S. 257, 269. Under <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 108, 114, that \u201csubstantial basis\u201d must include (1) information about the facts upon which the informant based his allegations of criminal activity, and (2) \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant * * * was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant urges, however, that under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>the informant\u2019s personal observations of criminal activity, which have usually satisfied the first part of the <em>Aguilar </em>test <em>(State </em>v. <em>Karr, supra, </em>at page 165), should also suffice to satisfy the second part of the <em>Aguilar </em>test for probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Appellant\u2019s interpretation of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Four Justices in the <em>Harris </em>case stated, at pages 579-580:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">\u201c* * * \"While a bare statement by an affiant that he believed the informant to be truthful would not, in itself, provide a <em>factual </em>basis for crediting the report of an unnamed informant, we conclude that the affidavit in the present case contains an ample factual basis for believing the informant which, <em>when coupled with affiant\u2019s own knowledge of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>respondent\u2019s background, </em>afforded a basis upon which a magistrate could reasonably issue a warrant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In the present cause the only allegation in support of the informant\u2019s credibility is the officer\u2019s statement that the <em>informant </em>had personally observed the suspect\u2019s criminal activities. Unlike the allegation in <em>Harris </em>that the <em>affiant </em>had personal knowledge of the suspect\u2019s activities or the allegation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Karr, supra, </em>that the informant had given reliable information <em>in the past, </em>the affidavit herein relies upon the <em>informant\u2019s </em>statement to corroborate the <em>informant\u2019s </em>credibility. By failing to provide independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s credibility, the affidavit does not lessen \u201cthe chances of a reckless or prevaricating tale\u201d <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>United States, supra, at page 271) </em>and does not give the magistrate an opportunity to make an independent determination of probable cause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.

A thorough reading of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1971), 403 U. S. 573, 577, reveals Chief Justice Burger\u2019s exhortation to heed the sound admonition of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca </em>(1965), 380 U. S. 102, 108, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">\u201c* * * [T]he Fourth Amendment\u2019s commands, like all constitutional requirements, are practical and not abstract. If the teachings of the court\u2019s eases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>rants, such as the one involved here, must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion. They are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation. Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Apparently, the majority has decided not to heed the \u00e1dmonition, but instead has applied a rigid, technical standard for the nonrigid standards of \u201creasonableness\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d formulated in the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The finding of the affidavit to be deficient was the result of the majority\u2019s applying the test developed in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 108. Reflective analysis of the opinion in <em>Aguilar </em>exposes that court\u2019s concern with a situation not presented in this cause. In <em>Aguilar, </em>the warrant was issued on an affidavit stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201c \u2018Affiants have received reliable information from a credible person and do believe that heroin, marijuana, barbiturates and other narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia are' being kept at the above described premises for the purpose of sale and use contrary to the provisions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>at page 109.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Therefore, the affidavit was a \u201cmere affirmation of suspicion and belief.\u201d <em>Nathanson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1933), 290 U. S. 41, 46. No allegation of \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of either the affiant or the unidentified source was contained in the affidavit. The affidavit merely gave the appearance that either the affiant or the unidentified informant, or both, merely suspected, believ\u00e9d or concluded that there were narcotics in petitioner\u2019s possession. The magistrate was thus forced to accept \u201c \u2018without question\u2019 the informant\u2019s \u2018suspicion,\u2019 \u2018belief\u2019 or \u2018mere conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aguilar, supra, </em>at page 114. The concern, in <em>Aguilar, </em>was that acceptance of this affidavit would cr\u00e9ate an easy circumvention, as illustrated in that court\u2019s footnote No. 4, at page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>114, relating to previous decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This concern is not presented by the facts of this cause. The present affidavit was not based on the \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cbelief,\u201d or \u201cmere conclusion\u201d of the unnamed informant, but on a recent personal observation of the drugs and instruments for administering the drugs on the premises of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The object of concern in <em>Aguilar, </em>a magistrate being forced to accept the informant\u2019s \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cbelief,\u201d or \u201cmere conclusion,\u201d is absent here. Therefore, to apply the rigid, technical test formulated in <em>Aguilar </em>not only appears to be using a sledgehammer to kill a fly, but is to retreat from accepted legal thought, as Justice Black so artfully satirized in his dissenting opinion in <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969), 393 U. S. 410, at page 434:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding the court\u2019s belief to the contrary, I think that in holding as it does, the court does:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c \u2018retreat from the established propositions that only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity is the standard of probable cause, <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U. S. 89, 96 (1964); that affidavits of probable cause are tested by much less rigorous standards than those governing the admissibility of evidence at trial, <em>McCray </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>386 U. S. 300, 311 (1967); that in judging probable cause issuing magistrates are not to be confined by niggardly limitations or by restrictions on the use of their common sense, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 108 (1965); and that their determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 270-271 (1960).\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 419.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Courts have long sought to strike a balance between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>two opposing poles \u2014 the security of citizens from .unreasonable invasion of their privacy and the granting \u2018of fair leeway for the enforcement of laws necessary to'protect our communities. \u201cProbable cause\u201d is the <em>practical, noii-. technical </em>conception that has served as an adequate conk promise.between these opposing interests. Th\u00e9 substitution of the technical and rigid formula espoused by the'majority will add additional perplexity to the present overAvhelming' burden shouldered by our law enforcement officers. Ironically, this hypertechnical and perplexing standard will handcuff the police and aids-the detected criminal-to remain unpunished.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">I believe that the substitution of technicality for practicality obstructs'the administration of justice. Therefore; I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-5\">Herbert and P. Brown, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinon.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> \u2018To approve this affidavit would open the door to easy circumvention of the rule announced in <em>Nathanson </em>and <em>Giordenello </em>[357 U.

But he could convey this conclusion to another police officer, who could then secure the warrant by swearing that he had \u2018received reliable information from a credible person\u2019 that the narcotics were in someone\u2019s possession.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
