Habeas corpus will lie to determine whether a person was afforded substantive and procedural due process in non-criminal involuntary civil commitment proceedings, undertaken pursuant to R. C. 5122.15, where habeas corpus relief is the only plain and adequate remedy available for the vindication of federal constitutional rights. <em>In re Fisher </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 71, 75; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Maxwell, Warden </em>(1965), 4 Ohio St. 2d 4. See R. C. 5122.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It is strongly argued that the petition should be dismissed on the ground that it is moot because the petitioner was discharged from the hospital. However, that fact<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> alone is no longer sufficient to moot a cause such as the one at bar. The issue concerning continuing collateral disability must still be determined. See <em>McDuffie </em>v. <em>Berzzarins </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 23; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 236; <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Reshetylo </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 35. The efficacy of the syllabus in <em>In re Popp </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 142, now appears doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-9\">Herbert, Celebrezze, W.
