Harris (defendant) was convicted in the Virginia Beach Circuit Court of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), second offense. He complains on appeal that this conviction was barred by an earlier, related conviction for reckless driving. We agree and reverse the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The relevant facts are uncontroverted. On May 6, 1992, at \u201caround one o\u2019clock-ish\u201d in the afternoon, defendant was operating a motor vehicle on Route 44 in the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Defendant encountered \u201ca lot\u201d of construction activity along the roadway, with attendant obstructions and traffic controls, and the side of his van struck a \u201cconcrete barrier\u201d when a \u201ctractor trailer or something\u201d passed him. As a result of the impact, defendant\u2019s vehicle was substantially damaged, and, \u201cdazed,\u201d \u201call [defendant] could think of was getting off the expressway as soon as [he] could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Without stopping, defendant exited the highway at the next interchange, located \u201cabout a mile\u201d from the accident. He stopped or slowed momentarily at an unmanned collection machine to pay a toll and immediately proceeded to a traffic signal, where a slight collision occurred between defendant\u2019s vehicle and another automobile. This second accident followed defendant\u2019s first within \u201cthree to five minutes\u201d and occurred only \u201c[a] mile and a half, two miles\u201d distant. Virginia Beach Police Officer J.L. Butler was dispatched to investigate, arriving at 1:32 p.m., and found defendant seated in his vehicle with the engine running. Butler determined that this accident had occurred at approximately 1:10 p.m. As a result of his investigation, Butler secured a warrant charging defendant with DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Meanwhile, Virginia State Trooper W. Raborg also arrived at the scene incidental to his investigation of defendant\u2019s earlier collision with the highway barrier. In response to Raborg\u2019s inquiries, defendant admitted his involvement in the previous accident, which also allegedly occurred at 1:10 p.m., and Raborg issued him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a related summons for \u201cReckless Driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On August 27, 1992, defendant was convicted in the Virginia Beach General District Court of the reckless driving offense. The following day, he was convicted in the same court on the DUI warrant. Defendant appealed the DUI conviction to the. trial court and, again, was found guilty, despite his plea in bar pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">[w]henever any person is charged with a violation of \u00a7 18.2-266 or any similar ordinances of any county, city, or town and reckless driving <em>growing out of the same act or acts </em>and is convicted of one of these charges, the court shall dismiss the remaining charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">(Emphasis added). Because this statute \u201crelates to matters of a penal nature . . ., it must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and favorably to the accused.\u201d <em>Padgett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 758, 760-61, 263 S.E.2d 388, 389 (1980). Moreover, \u201c[w]here the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by that plain statement of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>17 Va. App. 624, 626, 440 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In <em>Padgett, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the two offenses subject of Code \u00a7 19.2-294.1, DUI and reckless driving, are \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d violations. <em>Padgett, </em>220 Va. at 760, 263 S.E.2d at 389. Nevertheless, the Court reasoned that the legislature intended that a conviction of one offense would preclude conviction of the other, whenever both \u201cgrew\u201d from the same \u201ccontinuous, uninterrupted course of operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Padgett, </em>220 Va. at 760-61, 263 S.E.2d at 389-90. Thus, the statute is applicable \u201cwhere these two offenses grow \u2018out of the same act or acts\u2019 \u201d of driving. <em>Lash </em>v. <em>County of Henrico, </em>14 Va. App. 926, 930, 421 S.E.2d 851, 853-54 (1992) (en banc) (citations omitted); <em>accord Crawley v. Wilkerson, </em>283 F. Supp. 447, 449 (W.D. Va. 1968). It is the commonality of the underlying offending conduct, the continuous, uninterrupted operation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>motor vehicle, that invokes the preclusive effect of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Here, like the accused in <em>Padgett, </em>defendant was charged and convicted of both \u00a7 19.2-294.1 offenses, DUI and reckless driving. The evidence is undisputed that the alleged misconduct was intimately related in time and distance, arising from and connected by one continuous, uninterrupted operation of defendant\u2019s motor vehicle. Under such circumstances, the legislature clearly intended that a conviction of one offense result in a dismissal of the other. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s subsequent conviction for DUI is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3m\">Benton, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> There is no dispute that the offenses in issue constitute DUI and reckless driving contemplated by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
