App. 31, 441 S.E.2d 225 (1994). The Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted on April 25, 1994, and the mandate of the March 8, 1994 opinion was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">This appeal was reheard <em>en banc </em>on September 22, 1994. For the reasons stated in the original majority opinion, the Court reverses Shannon\u2019s conviction and orders the case remanded to the trial court for further proceedings if the Commonwealth be so advised. Therefore, the stay of the mandate of the March 8, 1994 opinion is lifted. The case is reversed and remanded in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>with that opinion and its adoption by this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The trial court shall allow court-appointed counsel for the appellant an additional $200 for services rendered the appellant on the rehearing portion of this appeal, in addition to counsel\u2019s costs and necessary direct out-of-pocket expenses.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
