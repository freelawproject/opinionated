We agree and reverse the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Because the assigned error relates solely to procedural aspects of the proceedings below, we recite only those facts pertinent to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">This cause was commenced upon husband\u2019s bill of complaint for divorce filed in the trial court on July 29, 1992. This pleading prayed for a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>spousal support, equitable distribution of the marital property, counsel fees and costs, and related relief, all based upon appropriate allegations. Subsequently, husband filed an \u201c[a]mended and [supplemental\u201d com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>plaint which repeated much of the original bill, with an added prayer for a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>and attendant allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Wife, by counsel, responded to husband\u2019s amended bill of complaint, denying any misconduct which would entitle husband to \u201cthe relief prayed for or to any relief whatsoever.\u201d Wife\u2019s pleading, styled an \u201cAnswer to Amended and Supplemental Bill of Complaint,\u201d also moved for \u201cdismissal of the Bill of Complaint,\u201d an award to her of costs and counsel fees expended incidental to the proceedings, and \u201csuch further relief as the nature of [her] cause may require.\u201d However, her response included no cross-bill or other independent complaint. <em>See </em>Rules 1:4 and 2:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The pleadings were followed by months of substantial discovery between the parties and a pretrial conference, scheduled on wife\u2019s motion. Coincidental with her conference motion, wife filed an \u201c[application,\u201d which stated simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Now comes the Respondent, by counsel, and prays for a divorce from the bonds of matrimony under Virginia Code Section 20-91(9) and for her grounds states that the parties hereto have intentionally lived separate and apart without interruption and without cohabitation for a period of one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Thereafter, but prior to trial, husband presented an \u201cOrder of Non-suit\u201d to the trial court which \u201cdismissed\u201d his bill of complaint, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d and the court engaged this issue with counsel at the inception of the trial proceedings. Husband asserted an \u201cabsolute right to . . . nonsuit\u201d his action pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-380. Wife, however, objected, arguing that she had traveled from Texas to be personally present, that significant resources had been expended in preparation for trial, and that her \u201cconsent\u201d to the nonsuit was required by Code \u00a7 8.01-380(C). Nevertheless, should a nonsuit be granted to husband, wife alternatively moved the court to permit her to \u201cgo forward\u201d on her earlier \u201capplication\u201d for a divorce pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-121.02.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Following extensive argument of counsel, the trial court sustained husband\u2019s motion for a nonsuit but allowed wife to proceed on her \u201capplication for a divorce.\u201d Despite husband\u2019s contention that wife\u2019s application did not constitute a proper \u201ccounterclaim,\u201d \u201ccrossclaim,\u201d \u201ccrossbill,\u201d or other pleading sufficient to maintain an independent cause for divorce, the court concluded that considerations of \u201cfairness\u201d to wife and \u201cthe circumstances of this case\u201d entitled her to \u201cproceed . . . under Section 20-121.02.\u201d Following presentation of wife\u2019s evidence, the trial court awarded her a divorce based \u201cupon her application,\u201d which decree is the object of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-380 assured husband the right to nonsuit his cause, \u201cnotwithstanding [wife\u2019s] loss of time and expense incurred in preparation\u201d for trial and \u201cany disruption which may result to the court\u2019s docket.\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Transp. Comm\u2019r, </em>241 Va. 69, 73, 400 S.E.2d 172, 174 (1991). However, in order to \u201cgive balance\u201d to the exercise of this \u201cpowerful tactical weapon,\u201d the statute imposes \u201cseveral conditions\u201d to the right. <em>Id. </em>Among these limitations is the necessity that the \u201cadverse party who has filed a counterclaim [or] cross-claim . . . which arises out of the same transaction or occurrence\u201d consent to the nonsuit, unless such claim \u201ccan remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-380(C). Thus, in such instances, the non-suit \u201c \u2018simply . . . put[s] an end\u2019 \u201d to the movant\u2019s action, <em>Thomas Cemmell, Inc. v. Svea Fire &amp; Life Ins. Co., </em>166 Va. 95, 97, 184 S.E. 457, 458 (1936) (citation omitted), without impairing the right of the adverse party to pursue its independent cause. Code \u00a7 8.01-380(C); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-233(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Accordingly, wife contends that the trial court correctly ruled that her application pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-121.02 constituted a claim separate from husband\u2019s cause, which survived his nonsuit and was amenable to independent adjudication. This argument ignores the plain language of the statute and the instant circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Code \u00a7 20-121.02 permits either party in \u201cany divorce suit wherein a bill of complaint or cross-bill prays for a divorce . . . under \u00a7 20-91 or ... \u00a7 20-95, at such time as there exists in either party\u2019s favor grounds for a divorce . . . under \u00a7 20-91(9),\u201d to \u201cmove the court wherein such divorce suit is pending for a divorce ... on the grounds set out in \u00a7 20-91(9) without amending the bill of complaint or cross-bill.\u201d The motion contemplated by the statute clearly does not itself constitute a bill of complaint or cross-bill but is dependent upon such pleading as the procedural vehicle upon which to append an added ground for divorce without the costs and inconvenience of amendment. <em>See, e.g., McCausey v. McCausey, </em>221 Va. 500, 502, 272 S.E.2d 36, 36-37 (1980); <em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>2 Va. App. 16, 18, 340 S.E.2d 578, 580 (1986); <em>Brawand </em>v. <em>Brawand, </em>1 Va. App. 305, 307, 338 S.E.2d 651, 652 (1986). \u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by that plain statement of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>17 Va. App. 624, 626, 440 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Although the trial court decided to \u201ctreat [wife\u2019s application] as a cross[-]bill,\u201d the pleading was clearly insufficient to satisfy the procedural requisites of a cross-bill. <em>See Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>218 Va. 790, 796, 240 S.E.2d 535, 538-39 (1978). It is fundamental that a cross-bill must allege facts which support the requested relief and \u201cgive notice to the opposing party of the nature and character of the claim,\u201d and \u201cno court can base its . . . decree upon a right [not] . . . pleaded and claimed.\u201d <em>Boyd, 2 </em>Va. App. at 18-19, 340 S.E.2d at 580. <em>See </em>Rules 1:4, 2:13 and 2:14. While a court, \u201cin order to do complete justice between the parties and avoid a multiplicity of suits, may in its discretion treat an answer as a cross-bill by appropriate order,\u201d such pleading must comport with Rules 2:13 and 2:14 governing cross-bills. <em>Shevel\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Southeastern Assocs., </em>228 Va. 175, 184, 320 S.E.2d 339, 344 (1984). Neither wife\u2019s original answer nor her application complied with these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Thus, once husband\u2019s action was successfully nonsuited, there was no bill of complaint or cross-bill before the court. In the absence of a pleading in which a claim for divorce was properly stated, wife\u2019s motion pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-121.02 had no vitality, and she was unable to independently prosecute a prayer for divorce. The trial court, therefore, erroneously awarded her a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>divorce upon insufficient pleadings, and the decree is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Baker, J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> Decree of divorce without amended bill or amended cross-bill. \u2014 In any divorce suit wherein a bill of complaint or cross-bill prays for a divorce from the bonds of matrimony under \u00a7 20-91 or prays for a divorce from bed and board under \u00a7 20-95, at such time as there exists in either party\u2019s favor grounds for a divorce from the bonds of matrimony under \u00a7 20-91(9), either party may move the court wherein such divorce suit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>pending for a divorce from the bonds of matrimony on the grounds set out in \u00a7 20-91(9) without amending the bill of complaint or cross-bill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\"> This statute applies to actions both in law and equity. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>218 Va. 790, 795, 240 S.E.2d 535, 538 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
