A final decree is one \u201c \u2018which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southwest Virginia Hosps. </em>v. <em>Lipps, </em>193 Va. 191, 193, 68 S.E.2d 82, 83-84 (1951) (quoting <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 367, 376 (1879)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">The bill of complaint filed in this case by Lucy Jane Erikson seeks a divorce from the bond of matrimony, spousal support, equitable distribution of property, and incidental relief. Based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law following a commissioner\u2019s hearing, the trial court entered a decree which held only that the marriage was valid. It did not grant or deny a divorce, spousal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>support, equitable distribution, or incidental relief. The decree, therefore, is not a final decree \u201cwhich disposes of the whole subject . . . and leaves nothing to be done by the court,\u201d nor is it an interlocutory decree granting an injunction. Thus, unless the decree holding that the marriage is valid is an interlocutory decree that \u201cadjudicates the principles of the cause,\u201d this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the interlocutory decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">For an interlocutory decree to adjudicate the principles of a cause, the decision must be such that \u201c \u2018the rules or methods by which the rights of the parties are to be finally worked out have been so far determined that it is only necessary to apply those rules or methods to the facts of the case in order to ascertain the relative rights of the parties, with regard to the subject matter of the suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pinkard </em>v. <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va. App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1991) (quoting <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>142 Va. 244, 252-53, 128 S.E. 524, 527 (1925)). An interlocutory order or decree that adjudicates the principles of a cause is one which must \u201cdetermine the rights of the parties\u201d and \u201cwould of necessity affect the final order in the case.\u201d <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va. App. at 851, 407 S.E.2d at 341. An interlocutory order that adjudicates the principles in a divorce case must \u201crespond to the chief object of the suit which was to secure a divorce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 407 S.E.2d at 341-42. \u201c \u2018[T]he mere possibility\u2019 that an interlocutory decree \u2018may affect the final decision in the trial does not necessitate an immediate appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Polumbo v. Polumbo, </em>13 Va. App. 306, 307, 411 S.E.2d 229, 229 (1991) (quoting <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va. App. at 853, 407 S.E.2d at 342).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The trial court\u2019s ruling that the parties are validly married does not \u201cadjudicate the principles of the cause.\u201d The determination that the marriage was valid does not determine whether a divorce will be granted or upon what terms. That ruling does not determine the rules or methods by which the ultimate decision in the divorce is to be adjudicated, thereby requiring only the application of those principles to the facts of the case to decide the issues. Although the factual finding and legal holding that the parties are validly married is an essential element of the complainant\u2019s cause of action, that ruling is not a legal determination of \u201cthe principles\u201d that are necessary to adjudicate the cause, and the ruling does not \u201crespond to the chief object of the suit , which was to secure a divorce.\u201d <em>See Webb </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>13 Va. App. 681, 682, 414 S.E.2d 612, 613 (1992); <em>Polumbo, </em>13 Va. App. at 307, 411 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>S.E.2d at 229; <em>Weizenbaum v. Weizenbaum, </em>12 Va. App. 899, 901-02, 407 S.E.2d 37, 39 (1991); <em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va. App. at 851, 407 S.E.2d at 341. The ruling and order appealed is interlocutory and does not adjudicate the principles of the cause. Accordingly, this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. We dismiss the appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b402-7\">Barrow, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The trial court\u2019s determination that the parties are married adjudicates the principles of this proceeding. Because of this ruling, this proceeding will result in the parties obtaining a divorce or remaining married. Had the trial court determined that they are not validly married, neither result would follow. The decree appealed from will \u201cof necessity affect the final order in the case\u201d; therefore, it adjudicates the principles of this cause. <em>Pinkard v. Pinkard, </em>12 Va. App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1991). For this reason, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
