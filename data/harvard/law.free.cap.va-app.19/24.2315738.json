In this appeal, Woodard alleges that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the victim\u2019s hearsay complaint of the rape made more than two months after the crime. In addition, Woodard asserts that, if the evidence of the hearsay complaint was properly admitted, the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the evidence was merely corroborative of the victim\u2019s testimony and not independent evidence of the crime. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Woodard\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">Under well established principles of appellate review, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and accord to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Traverso </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). When so viewed, the record reflects the following pertinent facts. On July 17, 1992, the female victim, thirteen years old and unmarried, along with her younger brother and another child went to visit Woodard, her mother\u2019s cousin, at his home. Woodard sent the other children on an errand and called the victim into his house. Upon entering the house, she discovered Woodard, naked from the waist down, in a bedroom. After a struggle, Woodard removed the victim\u2019s pants and \u201cput his penis inside [her] vagina.\u201d Thereafter the victim returned to her house, went to her bedroom, laid on her bed, and \u201ccried.\u201d When the victim\u2019s mother came home later that day, the victim did not tell her of the events that had occurred earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The victim testified that she told no one about the offense until school commenced after the summer recess. At that time, she told a school friend who had also been a rape victim. Several weeks later, on October 4, the victim told her aunt what had happened to her in July. The aunt testified that the victim told her that \u201c[Woodard] made [me] do things [I] didn\u2019t want to do. He made [me] have sex.\u201d Medical evidence from an examination in October showed that the victim\u2019s hymen had been traumatized.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Woodard testified in his defense and denied sexual contact with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Prior to trial, Woodard sought to suppress introduction of the victim\u2019s reports of the rape to her friend and aunt on the ground that these reports were not recent complaints and, thus, not admissible. The trial court ruled that the timeliness of the complaint was a matter for the jury to consider in weighing the evidence and overruled the motion. Woodard renewed his objection at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">At trial, Woodard submitted Instruction E, which read: \u201cEvidence that a person has made a complaint about being raped is admissible only for the purpose of corroborating that person\u2019s testimony, and not as independent evidence of the facts involved.\u201d The trial judge refused this instruction and refused Woodard\u2019s request that the trial court amend rather than refuse it. The jury convicted Woodard of rape and recommended a sentence of fifteen years of confinement. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">ADMISSION OF HEARSAY COMPLAINTS OF RAPE</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The admission of evidence concerning a rape victim\u2019s complaint as an exception to the hearsay rule has its origins in the now discredited \u201chue and cry\u201d rule. Under the \u201chue and cry\u201d rule, a prosecutrix was <em>required </em>to prove a timely complaint of an alleged rape in order to corroborate her claim that the assault was against her will. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>578 A.2d 370, 374 (N.J. 1990). Although the original rule is no longer operative, subsequent case law and recent legislation make admissible into evidence the victim\u2019s complaint of rape in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief under the \u201crecent complaint\u201d rule. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 296, 300, 321 S.E.2d 202, 204 (1984). However, only the fact of the complaint and not the details given therein may be admitted, but the scope of admission rests with the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Herron </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 326, 330, 157 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1967); see <em>also 2 </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-29 (4th ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Under the modern rule, it is understood that the \u201conly time requirement is that the complaint have been made without a delay <em>which is unexplained or is inconsistent with the occurrence of the </em>offense.\u201d Edward W. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 297 (3d ed. 1984) (emphasis added). <em>See also Harmony v. State, </em>594 A.2d 1182, 1189 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1991). The initial determination of timeliness under the recent complaint rule is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and thereafter, timeliness is a matter for the trier of fact to consider in weighing the evidence. <em>Herron, </em>208 Va. at 330, 157 S.E.2d at 198; <em>see also Willis &amp; Bell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 560, 563, 238 S.E.2d 811, 813 (1977); <em>Corvin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 296, 299, 411 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Woodard asserts on appeal that the trial judge erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence of the victim\u2019s complaint and in admitting that testimony over his objection. Both Woodard\u2019s suppression motion and his objection at trial were based on the claim that the victim\u2019s delay in reporting the rape took the report out of the recognized exception to the hearsay rule because the complaint was not recent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The victim\u2019s delay was not \u201cunexplained\u201d or \u201cinconsistent with the occurrence of the offense.\u201d To the contrary, her delay is explained by and completely consistent with the all too common circumstances surrounding sexual assault on minors\u2014fear of disbelief by others and threat of further harm from the assailant. The decision whether to admit or suppress evidence of the fact of the victim\u2019s complaint of Woodard\u2019s assault was a matter committed to the discretion of the trial judge, and upon its admission, the timeliness of the complaint became a matter for the jury to consider in weighing the evidence. We cannot say that the trial judge abused that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">FUNCTION OF RECENT COMPLAINT EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Woodard contends that, if the trial court properly admitted evidence of the victim\u2019s complaint, the court nonetheless erred in refusing to instruct the jury to consider the report of the complaint as \u201ccorroborating [the victim\u2019s] testimony, and not as independent evidence of the facts involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">We have recently clarified the application of the recent complaint rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\"><em>A rape victim\u2019s complaint corroborates more than his or her testimony, </em>it also corroborates the occurrence of the rape itself. No reason justifies limiting the rule to corroboration of a victim\u2019s testimony. We hold that <em>the rule is applicable to corroborate other independent evidence of the offense; however, the complaint alone does not constitute sufficient evidence of the offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-10\"><em>McManus v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 310, 312, 429 S.E.2d 475, 476 (1993) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The question of legal sufficiency is for the trial court rather than for the jury to resolve and was resolved by the trial court\u2019s overruling of Woodard\u2019s motion to strike. Thereafter, the function of the evidence of the victim\u2019s recent complaint was to add weight and credibility to the direct evidence of the crime, including, but not limited to, the victim\u2019s testimony. Thus, Woodard\u2019s instruction was not an accurate statement of the law; it too narrowly limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the scope of the function of recent complaint evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Woodard further contends that even if the proffered instruction was an incorrect statement of law, the trial judge should have honored his request to amend the instruction. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">It is a well established rule that under normal circumstances a trial court is under no obligation to amend or correct an instruction that contains a misstatement of law. However, <em>\u201cwhen the principle of law is materially vital to [the] defendant in a criminal case, </em>it is reversible error for the trial court to refuse a defective instruction instead of correcting it and giving it in the proper form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\"><em>Morse </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 627, 636, 440 S.E.2d 145, 151 (1994) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">A correct statement of law would have done no more than instruct the jury that the evidence of the victim\u2019s complaint could be considered \u201cto corroborate other independent evidence.\u201d In this instance, the independent evidence consisted of the victim\u2019s testimony and medical evidence suggesting a sexual trauma, which together are adequate to sustain the conviction. The proffered instruction was not an accurate statement of the law, and the trial judge was under no duty to amend the proffered, erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">For these reasons, Woodard\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Coleman, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-13\"> Woodard asserts that as <em>McManus </em>was decided after his conviction, his proffered instruction was a correct statement of law <em>at the time. </em>We disagree. In <em>McManus </em>we did not alter the recent complaint rule. Rather, we clarified an ambiguity as to the application of that rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
