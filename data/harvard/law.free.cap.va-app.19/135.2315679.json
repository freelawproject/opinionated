Accordingly, we order this case transferred to the Supreme Court of Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">On March 19, 1992, the Virginia Department of Taxation (the Department) dismissed Ms. Daughtry from employment because of a disciplinary violation. She lodged a grievance pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1. Ultimately, the matter was heard, pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1 (D)(4), before a grievance panel, which ordered her reinstatement. The Department reinstated her, but conditioned her reinstatement upon her transfer from the Hampton Roads area to Richmond and upon her undergoing a mental health evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1(F), Ms. Daughtry petitioned the trial court to implement the panel decision. The trial court ordered the Department to comply with the grievance panel\u2019s decision, without variation or condition, and ordered Ms. Daughtry\u2019s reinstatement without transfer or the requirement of a mental health evaluation. This appeal addresses that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">This is a Court of limited jurisdiction. Code \u00a7 17-116.05 authorizes this Court to entertain appeals from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">I. Any final decision of a circuit court on appeal from a decision of an administrative agency;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The jurisdictional issue in this case turns on whether the proceeding in the trial court was \u201con appeal from a decision of an administrative agency.\u201d We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">In <em>Department of Taxation </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>11 Va. App. 306, 397 S.E.2d 902 (1990), this Court accepted and ruled on the merits of a circuit court\u2019s judgment entered pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1(F). In <em>Zicca </em>v. <em>City of Hampton, </em>240 Va. 468, 397 S.E.2d 882 (1990), the Supreme Court entertained a similar appeal. Neither case addressed the issue of appellate jurisdiction. <em>See also Angle </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>235 Va. 103, 365 S.E.2d 758 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1(D)(4)(d) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The decision of the panel shall be final and binding and shall be consistent with provisions of law and written policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Code \u00a7 2.1-114.5:1 (F) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">Either party may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the locality in which the grievant is employed for an order requiring implementation of the panel decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The Department relies upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yeatts, </em>233 Va. 17, 353 S.E.2d 717 (1987). In <em>Yeatts, </em>a highway contractor claimed additional contractual compensation from the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation. Having pursued the administrative procedures required by Code \u00a7 33.1-386 without satisfaction, the contractor filed suit in the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 33.1-387. Holding that jurisdiction to review the circuit court\u2019s judgment lay in the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court noted that the circuit court proceeding, pursuant to Code \u00a7 33.1-387, was a substantive review of the administrative procedure required by Code \u00a7 33.1-386, and, thus, was an appeal from the decision of the administrative agency. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">Here, Yeatts had no alternative but to pursue the administrative procedures authorized by Code \u00a7 33.1-386, and the submission of its claim in the time and manner prescribed by that Code section was a condition precedent to the right to file a civil action under \u00a7 33.1-387. In other words, Yeatts\u2019 right to bring a civil action was dependent upon having first invoked administrative procedures. Hence, the action permitted by \u00a7 33.1-387 is dependent and not independent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 24, 353 S.E.2d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The grievance panel\u2019s decision in this case was \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d <em>See Angle, </em>235 Va. at 106, 365 S.E.2d at 759. Only its implementation could be granted or denied by the circuit court. The panel decision was not subject to substantive review or modification. It was a final judgment. The circuit court proceeding was not dependent upon the grievance procedure. It was collateral and independent. It was analogous to a proceeding to domesticate and enforce a foreign judgment. Therefore, it was not an appeal of the grievance panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that this Court lacks jurisdiction and we order this appeal transferred to the Supreme Court pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\n<em>Transferred.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Benton, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
