Appellant contends the trial court erred (1) in allowing the introduction of his uncounseled 1983 misdemeanor conviction in the sentencing phase; and (2) in finding that the evidence was sufficient to show that his 1985 conviction was counseled such that it was admissible during the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">On August 3, 1992, appellant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 after having previously been convicted of a like offense. Although the indictment listed two previous convictions, one rendered in 1983 and the other rendered in 1985, appellant objected to their use as predicate offenses on the ground that both were uncounseled misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The record shows that appellant\u2019s 1983 conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol resulted in the judge imposing a $200 fine (of which $100 was suspended), a thirty day jail sentence (of which all thirty days were suspended), and a suspended driver\u2019s license. The suspensions were predicated on appellant\u2019s attendance at an alcohol treatment program. After accepting evidence concerning the 1983 conviction, the trial court in the instant case found that the 1983 conviction was uncounseled. The court therefore barred its admission into evidence during the guilt phase of the trial but permitted its use in the sentencing phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The record also shows that appellant\u2019s 1985 conviction for the same offense resulted in the judge imposing an $800 fine (of which $600 was suspended), a 180 day jail sentence (of which 178 days were suspended), and a suspended driver\u2019s license. In contrast to the 1983 conviction, the trial court in the instant case found that the 1985 conviction was counseled and therefore allowed the Commonwealth to introduce evidence regarding that conviction in the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of the prior convictions. The Commonwealth asserts that this appeal should be dismissed because appellant failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>make the challenged conviction orders part of the record on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">As a preliminary matter, the Commonwealth asserts that the 1983 and 1985 conviction orders were not properly introduced in the trial court and therefore are not a part of the record on appeal. This Court granted appellant\u2019s motion to remand to the trial court for a determination of whether the conviction orders should have been included in the record transmitted for appeal. The trial court concluded that although the documents were never formally introduced into evidence, it considered them exhibits. Accordingly, the trial court ordered them marked as exhibits and forwarded to this Court. Despite the Commonwealth\u2019s protestations, we adhere to the principle that \u201cformal introduction [of documentary evidence] is waived where the court and the parties treat an instrument as in evidence, ... or where it is read without objection.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. Winston, 181 Va. 94, 105, 23 S.E.2d 873, 877, <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U.S. 766 (1943); <em>see also Mueller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 649, 652, 426 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1993). Consistent with the trial court\u2019s findings on remand, the record reveals that the trial court and the parties referred extensively to the orders and that they were critical to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the issue whether the prior convictions could properly be used as predicate offenses for a third offense charge of driving under the influence. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in directing them to be marked as exhibits and transmitted to this Court, and we properly may consider them a part of the appellate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting his uncounseled 1983 conviction in the sentencing phase of the trial. We agree and hold that because appellant\u2019s 1983 conviction was not only uncounseled, but also violated <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367 (1979), the trial court erred by allowing its introduction under Code \u00a7 46.2-943.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our decision is guided by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>United </em>States, _ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>U.S. _, 114 S. Ct. 1921 (1994), and this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>James </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 746, 446 S.E.2d 900 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The United States Supreme Court used <em>Nichols </em>to resolve the confusion that had been occasioned by its splintered decision fourteen years earlier in <em>Baldasar </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>446 U.S. 222 (1980). In <em>Nichols, </em>the Supreme Court overruled <em>Baldasar </em>and held that \u201cconsistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution, ... an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <em>Scott </em>because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\u201d Nichols, _ U.S. at _, 114 S. Ct. at 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In this Court\u2019s decision in <em>James, </em>we similarly held that where a defendant was represented by counsel or validly waived counsel in an earlier criminal proceeding, that conviction could be used in the sentencing phase of a subsequent trial. <em>Id. </em>at 752, 446 S.E.2d at 904. However, we also stated the Commonwealth cannot constitutionally introduce evidence of a prior conviction in a subsequent trial, where that prior conviction resulted in the imposition of a prison sentence, unless the defendant had been represented or validly waived representation. <em>Id. </em>at 751-52, 446 S.E.2d at 903. <em>See United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443 (1972) (holding that prisoner sentenced on basis of two prior unconstitutional convictions had to be resentenced); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>907 F.2d 456, 464 (4th Cir. 1990) (stating that a defendant shall not suffer an enhanced punishment predicated on a prior unconstitutional conviction), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 1029 (1991). This conclusion stems from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scott, </em>where that Court wrote that \u201cthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require . . . that no indigent criminal defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment unless the State has afforded him the right to assistance of appointed counsel in his defense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Scott, </em>440 U.S. at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>We interpret \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment\u201d to include a jail sentence imposed and conditionally suspended, as was done in this case. Appellant did not waive counsel nor was he represented on the 1983 charge. Consequently his sentence on that charge violated <em>Scott, </em>and the conviction cannot be used to enhance punishment. In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by decisions reached by other courts that have considered the same issue. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit recently held that a conditionally suspended sentence satisfies <em>Scotfs </em>\u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment\u201d requirement, such that the defendant is entitled to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reilley, </em>948 F.2d 648, 653-54 (10th Cir. 1991). <em>Accord United States </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>904 F.2d 20 (9th Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>608 F.2d 1290 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>529 F.2d 1390 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>633 A.2d 277 (Vt. 1993); <em>contra United States v. Nash, </em>703 F. Supp. 507 (W.D. La.), <em>aff'd </em>886 F.2d 1312 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Commonwealth affords trial courts broad discretion in revoking suspended sentences. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-306 (stating that the court can revoke a suspended sentence \u201cfor any cause deemed by it sufficient\u201d within the applicable statutory time limits); <em>Singleton v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 575, 400 S.E.2d 205 (1991) (holding that Code sections dealing with suspended sentences are to be liberally construed and that revocation of a suspended sentence lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion); <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 111 </em>Va. 325, 228 S.E.2d 555 (1976); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 217, 116 S.E.2d 270 (1960). The trial court\u2019s discretionary ability to revoke a suspended sentence subjects a defendant to a substantial risk of imprisonment at any time within the applicable statutory time limits. Thus, we believe that even in situations where a jail sentence is suspended, defendants must be afforded the \u201c \u2018guiding hand of counsel\u2019 so necessary where one\u2019s liberty is in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>440 U.S. at 370 (quoting <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 40 (1972)). Because appellant was sentenced to a suspended jail term without the benefit of counsel or a valid waiver thereof, appellant\u2019s 1983 conviction violated <em>Scott </em>and was improperly introduced in the sentencing phase of his 1991 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Appellant also contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that his 1985 conviction was counseled and that it was therefore improperly admitted in the guilt phase of the trial. We agree with appellant that the Commonwealth has the burden of going forward with evidence and always retains the burden of persuasion to prove that the predicate offenses relied upon were counseled. <em>See McGhee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 560, 562, 248 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1978); <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 143, 148, 360 S.E.2d 895, 898 (1987). The mere fact that the preprinted spaces on the warrant, which indicate the presence of defense counsel and prosecutor, were not clearly marked is not determinative of the issue as long as the Commonwealth produces other competent evidence of representation. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>926 F.2d 22 (1st Cir.) (court relying in part on presentence report which indicated that defendant was represented by counsel), <em>cert. denied, </em>501 U.S. 1211 (1991). In this case, however, the record fails to reveal sufficient competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The warrant itself contains the following information in the upper and lower right corners:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">HEARING DATE</p>\n<p id=\"ALW\">November 8, 1984</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">12-20-84 to hire S. Simon</p>\n<p id=\"AsZ\">1-28-85 A</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Attorney for the Accused:</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Nov 8 1984 \u2014 W. Dawson</p>\n<p id=\"AQT\">Dec 20 1984 S. Simon?</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The preprinted area on the lower right back corner of the warrant marked \u201cATTORNEY(S) PRESENT: \u25a1 COMMONWEALTH \u25a1 DEFENSE,\u201d contains illegible handwriting. Neither box has been checked. Finally, the warrant indicates that the accused pleaded guilty \u201cper p/a.\u201d The trial court interpreted this as \u201ca plea agreement. So he was represented.\u201d Although never expressly so stating, the judge, in effect, took judicial notice of the fact that the Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s Office would not have entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>a plea agreement with an unrepresented defendant. We. hold that this finding by the trial court was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The trial court may take judicial notice of facts which are <em>either </em>(a) common knowledge or (b) easily ascertainable by reference to reliable sources. <em>These are two separate and distinct grounds for judicial notice. </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 19-2 (4th ed. 1993). The trial court is required by statute to take judicial notice of (1) \u201cthe law, statutory or otherwise, of this Commonwealth ... or of any political subdivision or agency [thereof]\u201d or (2) of any official state or agency publication which is required by law to be published. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-386; 8.01-388; 19.2-265.2. In this case, however, the record contains no indication that any statute or regulation prohibits a prosecutor from entering into a plea agreement with an unrepresented defendant, nor are we aware of any such statute. Where the fact judicially noticed is not a fact \u201cuniversally regarded as established by common notoriety,\u201d <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Powell, </em>227 Va. 492, 497, 318 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1984) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>761 (5th ed. 1979)), it is irrelevant that the judge may have personal knowledge of such a practice. <em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 318 S.E.2d at 395; <em>Darnell v. Barker, </em>179 Va. 86, 93, 18 S.E.2d 271, 275 (1942); <em>see </em>Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19-2. Accordingly, the doctrine of judicial notice does not validate the judge\u2019s inference that appellant must have had counsel in order to have entered into a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Without the fact of which the trial court had taken judicial notice, the record contains insufficient evidence to support its conclusion that appellant\u2019s 1985 conviction was counseled. Thus, like appellant\u2019s 1983 conviction, his 1985 conviction was violative of <em>Scott, </em>as it resulted in the imposition of imprisonment. We hold that the 1985 conviction was improperly introduced in the guilt and sentencing phases of appellant\u2019s subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">For these reasons, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> Code \u00a7 46.2-943 permits the fact finder to consider the prior traffic record of a convicted traffic offender before imposing sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> In <em>Scott, </em>the defendant was convicted of shoplifting under a criminal statute which provided that the penalty for the offense should be a fine of not more than $500 and/or a term of not more than one year in jail. 440 U.S. at 368. The defendant was fined fifty dollars. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b494-10\">Koontz, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajg\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>I concur in parts I, II and IV of the majority opinion. I respectfully dissent from part III holding that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction resulting in a conditionally suspended jail sentence cannot be used in the penalty phase of a subsequent prosecution to enhance punishment under a statutory recidivist provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367 (1979), the United States Supreme Court held that <em>\u201cactual imprisonment </em>is a penalty different in kind from fines or <em>the mere threat of imprisonment . </em>. . warrant [ing the] adoption of <em>actual imprisonment </em>as the line defining the constitutional right to appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373 (emphasis added); <em>see also Nichols v. United </em>States, _ U.S _, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 1925-26 (1994). By equating \u201cactual imprisonment\u201d with \u201ca jail sentence imposed and conditionally suspended,\u201d the majority establishes a restriction on the use of the suspended sentence in uncounseled proceedings neither contemplated nor required by the holding in <em>Scott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In my view, the majority incorrectly reasons that the broad discretion vested in our trial courts by Code \u00a7 19.2-306 to revoke suspended sentences supports the conclusion that a suspended sentence is equivalent to actual imprisonment for the purposes of enhanced punishment in a subsequent prosecution. A suspended sentence is not merely a punishment applied solely for the purpose of obtaining the power of revocation but is also a tool to be used in facilitating the reform of the defendant. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Setzer, </em>242 S.E.2d 509, 511 (N.C. Ct. App.), <em>review denied, </em>245 S.E.2d 780 (N.C. 1978). At the very least, a suspended sentence may be used as a \u201cmere threat of imprisonment\u201d to impress upon the defendant the seriousness of his or her crime and the potential for actual imprisonment if the defendant commits subsequent criminal acts. Although the threat of imprisonment for noncompliance is an empty one if the underlying conviction was obtained without counsel or waiver thereof, the threat may nonetheless be potent in its import to the defendant that he or she has been spared imprisonment and is being offered an opportunity to reform. In any event, regardless of the success or failure of imposing a suspended sentence in terms of rehabilitation of the defendant, the trial court\u2019s discretion to revoke suspended sentences does not extend to those imposed where the defendant was convicted without counsel or a valid waiver of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Thus, while it would be improper to revoke a suspended sentence imposed following a conviction obtained without counsel or a valid waiver of counsel, the fact that a suspended jail sentence amounts to a threat of imprisonment to be imposed by revocation does not render the conviction invalid under <em>Scott. </em>So long as the defendant is not <em>actually imprisoned </em>as a result of the conviction, the conviction remains valid under <em>Scott </em>and may be used to enhance punishment for a subsequent conviction. <em>See </em>Nichols, _ U.S. at _, 114 S. Ct. at 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In short, nothing in <em>Scott </em>or <em>Nichols </em>alters the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25 (1972), that \u201cno person may be <em>imprisoned </em>for any offense . . . unless he was represented by counsel at his trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. Griswold was never imprisoned for his 1983 conviction, and, accordingly, that conviction is valid and could properly be used to enhance his sentence for the instant conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Because I agree that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of Griswold\u2019s 1985 conviction during the guilt determination phase of his trial, I would remand on the basis of that error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
