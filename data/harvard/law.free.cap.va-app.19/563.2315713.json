Brooks (defendant) was convicted of making a \u201cmaterially false statement on a consent form\u201d incidental to the purchase of a firearm, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2, and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Defendant now appeals, complaining that the statement in issue came in response to an inquiry not authorized by the statute and, therefore, not subject to its criminal sanctions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The record discloses no substantive dispute in the evidence. On October 2, 1992, defendant entered \u201cJim\u2019s Pawn Shop\u201d in Emporia, Virginia, intending to purchase a firearm. During the transaction, the owner of the store, Randy Capps, assisted defendant in the completion of a preprinted form, entitled \u201cDepartment of State Police Virginia Firearms Record\u201d (consent form), required by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2 as a condition to the purchase of a \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A portion of the consent form, designated \u201c8.a.\u201d under \u201cCERTIFICATION OF TRANSFEREE (Buyer),\u201d inquired, \u201cAre you under indictment for a felony or have you been charged with a felony in any court, or for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cNo,\u201d although at the time he had been charged, but not indicted, for malicious wounding and possession of cocaine. <em>See generally </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-216.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Acting in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2, Capps telephoned State Police and related the information provided by defendant on the consent form, thereby initiating the \u201ccriminal history record information check\u201d prescribed by the statute. <em>Id. </em>For reasons not disclosed in the record, State Police refused to approve defendant\u2019s firearm purchase. However, he was subsequently charged and convicted for the instant offense arising from the false statement regarding the cocaine and malicious wounding charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2 provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">[a]ny person purchasing from a dealer a firearm . . . shall consent in writing, on a form to be provided by the Department of State Police, to have the dealer obtain criminal history record information. Such form <em>shall </em>include <em>only, </em>in addition to the information required by subdivision B 1, the <em>identical information required to be included on the firearms transaction record required by regulations administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The \u201cinformation\u201d specified in \u201csubdivision B 1\u201d of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2 includes the purchaser\u2019s \u201cname, birth date, gender, race, and social security and/or any other identification number and the number of firearms ... to be sold . . . or transferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In pertinent part, the referenced federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201cfirearms transaction record,\u201d ATF Form 4473, asks: \u201cAre you under <em>indictment </em>or information[] in any court for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year?\u201d (emphasis added). A willful, intentional and materially false statement on the consent form \u201crequired\u201d by the statute constitutes a Class 5 felony, (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Well established \u201cprinciples of statutory construction require us to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Branch </em>v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by that plain statement . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>17 Va. App. 624, 626, 440 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1994). \u201c[W]ords and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). \u201cCriminal statutes are to be \u2018strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of [a] citizen\u2019s liberty.\u2019. . . A penal statute must be construed so as to proscribe only conduct which the legislature clearly intended to be within the statute\u2019s ambit.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 351, 354-55, 368 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(A) explicitly and unambiguously limits the inquiries of the consent form \u201conly<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ... to the information required by subdivision B 1 [of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2]\u201d and the federally mandated \u201cfirearms transaction record\u201d (emphasis added). Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(A). Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(B)(1) nor the referenced federal ATF Form 4473 and attendant regulations require information from a prospective firearms purchaser pertaining to criminal <em>charges. </em>Therefore, such information is not included in the \u201ccriminal history record\u201d contemplated by the statute, is not \u201crequired\u201d on the consent form, and is not subject to the criminal sanctions of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2(K).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conduct was not violative of the statute, and we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Atp\">Moon, C.J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-12\"> Because we reverse on this issue, we decline to address the remaining question raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> The word \u201conly\u201d is defined as \u201csolely, exclusively.\u201d <em>Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>825 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\"> This opinion addresses only Question 8(a) of the consent form.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
