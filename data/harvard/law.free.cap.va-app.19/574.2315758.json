At trial, in response to a question during cross-examination by defense counsel, a witness testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the victim had told the witness of tension between the defendant and himself. We hold that the testimony, objected to by the defendant, was inadmissible even though the witness was responding to the defendant\u2019s question. For this reason, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">At trial, the main issue was whether the defendant was the person who shot and killed the victim. The defendant, a half-brother of the victim, and two companions, Roberto and Fernando, drove to the victim\u2019s apartment building in the late afternoon the day of the shooting. The defendant and Roberto got out of the car, while Fernando remained in the automobile. An argument followed, involving the defendant, Roberto, and the victim. Someone shot and killed the victim. The testimony of the witnesses at trial conflicted over who shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The issue on appeal arises from the testimony of the victim\u2019s cousin. He testified that the defendant had on one occasion tried to run over the victim with his car; however, on cross-examination, he admitted that the defendant had followed the victim at walking speed and did not try to run over him. This witness also testified that the defendant had on another occasion shot at the victim\u2019s unoccupied car. During cross-examination, the witness admitted that he had never reported the shooting to the police, and defense counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">Q. You didn\u2019t call the police; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>THE WITNESS: I didn\u2019t call the police \u2014 I tried to call the police but I didn\u2019t know the address and the car wasn\u2019t mine and it wasn\u2019t my problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">Q. Okay. But it was your testimony, was it not, that you called [the victim] immediately; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">A. I called [the victim] at that time and asked him what he wanted to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">Q. But you yourself, you never reported this to the police or obtained a number for the police or filed a complaint; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">Q. Now when the defendant was charged, that\u2019s when you came forward with this story; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">A. I didn\u2019t call the police \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t have the number, but I consulted with [the victim] \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, hearsay \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, he cannot object to his own question \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">THE COURT: You can\u2019t object to your own question. What\u2019s the answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He was about to say what [the victim] said to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">THE WITNESS: I talked to [the victim] and he said there was a problem among the brothers and everything and I think he was afraid that he was going to kill him if he did anything about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">The witness\u2019s response to the question was, in part, hearsay, i.e., \u201che [the victim] said there was a problem among the brothers.\u201d The remainder of the response was opinion or speculation apparently based on the hearsay, i.e., \u201cI think he [the victim] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>afraid that he [the defendant] was going to kill him if he did anything about it.\u201d Generally, such testimony is inadmissible. <em>See Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 1068, 1070, 421 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1992) (\u201c[h]earsay evidence generally inadmissible\u201d); <em>Lafon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 411, 420, 438 S.E.2d 279, 285 (1993) (opinion testimony of lay witnesses generally inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Commonwealth asserts that the defendant cannot complain about the introduction of this testimony because his own question elicited it. In support of this position the Commonwealth refers us to <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 66, 68, 147 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1966), and <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors of Stafford County, </em>227 Va. 354, 363, 315 S.E.2d 856, 862 (1984). Neither of these cases supports the Commonwealth\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\"><em>Burns </em>deals with a party\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of evidence. In this case, the defendant objected before the witness responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\"><em>Robinson, </em>while seemingly closer in point, does not address the facts of this case. One sentence in the opinion in <em>Robinson </em>says that \u201cthe testimony was elicited . . . during cross-examination by the defendant and he, therefore, can have no ground for complaint.\u201d In the case before us, the defendant did not \u201celicit\u201d the witness\u2019s response. On the contrary, defense counsel\u2019s question was a precise, leading question which only asked the witness to confirm that he first reported the incident to the police when the defendant was charged with the victim\u2019s murder. The witness\u2019s answer was unresponsive and was not \u201celicited\u201d by the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The Commonwealth agrees that the witness\u2019s answer was unresponsive and contends that, therefore, the defendant\u2019s objection to hearsay was inappropriate, causing the issue to be procedurally barred on appeal. While a party may object to a non-responsive answer, such an answer is not excludable unless it is also inadmissible. 3 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 785(3) (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1970). Thus, the defendant objected correctly to the witness\u2019s apparent response on the ground that it was hearsay, and we are not barred from considering the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Next, the Commonwealth contends that the witness\u2019s response was not hearsay because it was offered, not to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>truth of what had been said, but to explain why the witness had delayed reporting the alleged incident to the police. Presumably, the witness did not report the incident because he did not want to exacerbate what he perceived as a conflict between the defendant and his half-brother. While the witness may have been entitled to explain his motivation for not reporting the incident, no necessity existed for him to use the victim\u2019s statement as a basis for this motivation. Only the witness\u2019s state of mind, not the victim\u2019s, was relevant. <em>See Hanson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 173, 188, 416 S.E.2d 14, 23 (1992). Furthermore, \u201c[w]hen evidence that might otherwise be hearsay is admitted for a limited, non-hearsay purpose, the trial court must instruct the jury that they are to consider the evidence for the specific limited purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 416 S.E.2d at 22. No such instruction was given in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Finally, the Commonwealth contends that admission of the statement, if error, was harmless. We disagree. The issue at trial was whether the defendant shot the victim. The evidence on this issue was conflicting. To convict the defendant, the jury had to believe the witnesses who described the defendant as the person who shot the victim and disbelieve those who described someone fitting Roberto\u2019s description as the person who shot the victim. The victim\u2019s statement to the witness that trouble existed between the brothers and the witness\u2019s speculation that the victim feared that the defendant would kill him supported the view that the defendant killed the victim. We cannot say from this record and the evidence presented at trial that this evidence did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the error was harmless. <em>See Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting the witness\u2019s hearsay response, and we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions. We also remand the matter for further proceedings should the Commonwealth elect to retry the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b588-9\">Coleman, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADC\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">I concur with the majority\u2019s holding that the defendant may object to inadmissible evidence, even though it is testimony given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>in response to a question asked by his own counsel of a witness on cross-examination. I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s holding that the witness\u2019s statement was hearsay. Therefore, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that the evidence was inadmissible and that the conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the witness concerning the fact that he had not called the police to report a prior incident between the victim and defendant. The exchange between defense counsel and the witness was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Q. But you yourself, you never reported this to the police or obtained a number for the police or filed a complaint; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Q. Now when the defendant was charged, that\u2019s when you came forward with this story; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">A. I didn\u2019t call the police \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t have the number, but I consulted with [the victim] \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the witness was allowed to answer the question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">THE WITNESS: I talked to [the victim] and he said there was a problem among the brothers and everything and I think he was afraid that he was going to kill him if he did anything about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>Tickel v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 558, 564, 400 S.E.2d 534, 538 (1991). A statement offered for any other purpose is not hearsay and is, therefore, governed by the other rules of admissibility. <em>See Eckhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">The clear import of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination suggested that because the witness had not reported the prior incident to the police, the witness may have fabricated its occurrence. The witness\u2019s response was not offered to prove the truth of what the victim had said, but only to explain why the witness had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>called the police.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">The hearsay rule does not operate to exclude evidence of a statement, request, or message offered for the mere purpose of explaining or throwing light on the conduct of the person to whom it was made. The evidence was admitted not for the purpose of showing the [truth or falsity of the statement] but for the purpose of showing the reason for the [witness\u2019s] action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\"><em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 724, 729, 113 S.E.2d 667, 670 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The purpose of the statement was to \u201cthrow [] light on the conduct of the [witness].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the evidence was not hearsay, in my opinion, and because it was relevant to explain the witness\u2019s conduct, the trial judge did not err and the ruling is not a basis for reversing the murder and firearms convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
