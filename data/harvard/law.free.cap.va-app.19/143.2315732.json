Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 218, 443 S.E.2d 183 (1994).

For the reasons stated in the original majority opinion, the Court affirms the judgment of the trial court. Therefore, the stay of the mandate of the April 19, 1994 opinion is lifted. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with that opinion and its adoption by this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Judges Benton and Barrow, for the reasons stated in Judge Benton\u2019s dissent from the original decision, <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.

This amount shall be added to the costs due the Commonwealth in the April 19, 1994 mandate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
