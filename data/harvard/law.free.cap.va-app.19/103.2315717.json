On appeal, he complains that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of a dog\u2019s response to currency discovered in defendant\u2019s motel room and challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. We find no error and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). The jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Id. </em>The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Similarly, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we consider the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable to . . . the prevailing party below,\u201d the Commonwealth in this instance, and the decision of the trial judge will be disturbed only if plainly wrong. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grimstead, </em>12 Va. App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). The record before us includes evidence adduced at both the trial and any suppression hearings. <em>DePriest </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.

To prevail on appeal, the defendant must \u201cshow . . . that the denial of [his] motion . . . constitute^] reversible error.\u201d <em>Motley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 439, 440-41, 437 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">While investigating illicit drug activity in the City of Virginia Beach, Detective Neal Thompson undertook surveillance of a local motel room. For several hours, no one was observed in or about the room, and Thompson, accompanied by Detective John Tosloskie and Thomas Sochor, an agent with the Immigration Service, decided to approach and knock at the door. In response, the closed curtains adjoining the door of the room \u201cparted,\u201d defendant \u201clooked out,\u201d and Thompson displayed his badge and identified himself as a police officer. \u201c[H]olding the curtain open,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>defendant moved his hand rapidly \u201cfrom the dead bolt to the handle . . . as if he was having a problem with the locks.\u201d Meanwhile, Thompson noticed two males \u201cinside the motel room just running back and forth\u201d and \u201caround . . . one of the beds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">After several minutes, defendant opened the door and admitted the officers. Defendant acknowledged that he had engaged the room and produced identification which indicated that he resided in a neighboring city. Detective Thompson advised the three occupants that he was conducting a narcotics investigation, and each agreed to a search of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">On the \u201cfirst bed,\u201d Thompson found a \u201cbright yellow\u201d AM/ FM cassette player with seven \u201cindividual little plastic bags\u201d and two \u201clarge chunks\u201d of crack cocaine and ten \u201cpackets\u201d of heroin hidden in its battery compartment. Without objection, Thompson, an \u201cexpert in the area of narcotics investigation distribution,\u201d testified that the cocaine was packaged in a manner and quantity indicative of distribution \u201con the street\u201d and opined that the \u201clarge chunks of crack cocaine\u201d were \u201cnot really something you\u2019d try to sell on the street. It\u2019s just too much.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thompson also noted that he had never seen anyone possess more than \u201c[o]ne or two\u201d packets of heroin \u201cfor themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">A suitcase was also resting on the bed and contained property belonging to all three men and a \u201cbundle\u201d of $2900. The money was separated into two $1,000 lots and one $900 lot and tightly bound with rubber bands. According to Thompson, this packaging was consistent with the \u201cusual\u201d practice of drug dealers. The suitcase also contained a \u201crazor knife[,] which drug dealers use to cut up big chunks [of cocaine] . . . into smaller little rocks for sale,\u201d and an A.C. \u201cadaptor\u201d compatible with the cassette player. In addition, a \u201cset of hand scales\u201d and three digital pagers, all items Thompson related to drug distribution, were discovered in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">During questioning by Thompson, defendant described the suitcase as \u201cmine,\u201d \u201ceverybody\u2019s,\u201d a \u201ccommunity type\u201d bag and claimed \u201csome property\u201d found in the case, including approximately $1500 of the cash which he attributed to \u201csavings.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Defendant also claimed one of the pagers but denied knowledge of the drugs, stating that the cassette player was owned by \u201ca guy[]\u201d \u201cnot in the room,\u201d although he was unable to recall the man\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Thompson retained possession of the cash and, upon arrival at police headquarters, arranged with Officer George Ball, a \u201cnarcotics dog handler,\u201d to provide a \u201cdrug dog ... to come up ... to run on the money.\u201d Detective Tosloskie agreed to assist in this procedure and Thompson passed him the \u201cbundle.\u201d Tosloskie, as instructed by Ball, obtained five new interdepartmental envelopes, \u201cstuffed paper towels in four envelopes,\u201d placed the money in the fifth, and \u201claid them [all] in the hallway.\u201d Ball then entered the hall with his dog, Doc, who, after walking past \u201cat least three of the envelopes[,] . . . immediately upon reaching the envelope with the money in it[,] . . . attacked it with his paws and . . . teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Prior to trial, defendant moved the court to suppress the evidence of Doc\u2019s reaction at the currency \u201clineup.\u201d During the attendant hearing, Ball, an officer in the police K-9 Unit for over 24 years, testified that Doc was a \u201cnarcotics dog,\u201d certified by the Virginia State Police following extensive joint training with Ball in 1988 and recertified annually thereafter in the detection of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and \u201cderivative\u201d odors. Additionally, Doc was trained monthly by Ball in the aromatic search of \u201cvarious items\u201d under .diverse circumstances, and the two had investigated \u201cover 447 cases\u201d together. Ball could recall only a single \u201cfalse alert\u201d in the dog\u2019s history, and Doc had established a detection accuracy of ninety-five to ninety-eight percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Ball estimated that the \u201cmajority\u201d of his actual investigations with Doc during recent years involved the examination of currency for suspect odors, or \u201ccurrency runs.\u201d In such instances, Ball, as here, instructs persons assisting in the \u201crun\u201d to fill \u201cat least four . . . envelopes\u201d with \u201canything\u201d to \u201cmake it look like it\u2019s U.S. currency\u201d and a fifth envelope with the \u201ccontaminated currency.\u201d The envelopes are then placed \u201cin the middle of the floor either in a line or a checkerboard pattern,\u201d and Doc is released in a \u201cfind mode.\u201d If he detects a targeted scent, Doc makes \u201ca hit\u201d and will \u201ctear at the package.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Ball and Doc have been recognized as \u201cexpert witness [es] in narcotics detection\u201d by both state and federal courts, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>courts of this Commonwealth. Without objection, Ball was offered and accepted by the trial court as an \u201cexpert in the area of dog handling and as a [sic] interpreter of his dog, Doc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">During argument in support of his motion to suppress, defendant complained that the reliability of the currency \u201clineup\u201d was compromised because the \u201ccontrol\u201d envelopes did not contain substances with odors like those commonly \u201cused in making ... cocaine\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that evidence of the dog\u2019s response would \u201cunduly prejudice\u201d him. The trial judge concluded, however, that these considerations \u201cgo[] to the weight of the evidence, not as to [its] admissibility,\u201d and overruled defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">THE DOG</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u201cIt is well settled in Virginia that the opinion of an expert witness is admissible \u2018where the jury, ... is confronted with issues\u2019 that \u2018cannot be determined intelligently merely from the deductions made and inferences drawn on the basis of ordinary knowledge, common sense, and practical experience ... .\u2019\u201d <em>Schooler v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 418, 420, 417 S.E.2d 110, 111 (1992) (quoting <em>Compton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 716, 726, 250 S.E.2d 749, 755-56 (1979)). The \u201cexpert\u2019s testimony is admissible not only when scientific knowledge is required, but when experience and observation in a special calling give the expert knowledge of a subject beyond . . . common intelligence and ordinary experience.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 250, 254, 403 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>243 Va. 1, 413 S.E.2d 875 (1992) (quoting <em>Neblett, Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>207 Va. 335, 339, 150 S.E.2d 115, 118 (1966)). Manifestly, a jury of lay persons required the assistance of an expert to properly interpret and give appropriate probative value to Doc\u2019s behavior in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">It is equally \u201cwell established that the admissibility of expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 1, 11, 348 S.E.2d 285, 291 (1986). <em>See also Toro </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>14 Va. App. 244, 252, 416 S.E.2d 29, 33 (1992). A challenge to an \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>pert\u2019s . . . methods and determinations . . . , even by other experts, does not render inadmissible expert opinion based on those . . . methods and computations\u201d but goes to the \u201cweight of the evidence,\u201d raising \u201cfactual questions to be determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>12 Va. App. at 255, 403 S.E.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A dog\u2019s response to particular stimuli and the interpretations of such response by an expert was approved by the Supreme Court as substantive evidence against an accused in <em>Epperly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 294 S.E.2d 882 (1982).. There, as here, the witness qualified before the court as an expert in the \u201chandling, and \u2018reading\u2019 \u201d of dogs trained in the identification and detection of specific odors. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 294 S.E.2d at 889. He testified that the dog was exposed to Epperly\u2019s scent and subsequently led investigators along a \u201ccircuitous route\u201d from the victim\u2019s abandoned vehicle to the door of Epperly\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 294 S.E.2d at 889. The Supreme Court reasoned that such</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">evidence is admissible in a criminal case after a proper foundation has been laid to show that the handler was qualified to work with the dog and to interpret its responses, that the dog was a sufficiently trained and proven tracker of human scent, that the dog was placed on the trail where circumstances indicated that the guilty party had been, and that the trail had not become so stale or contaminated as to be beyond the dog\u2019s tracking capabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he factors of staleness and contamination of the trail\u201d were proper considerations for the jury \u201cin connection with the weight to be given [the expert\u2019s] testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.\", see also Price </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 760, 764, 446 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Just as the dog\u2019s \u201calert\u201d on Epperly\u2019s scent and the related pursuit of it to his residence were admissible as substantive evidence in that prosecution, we hold that expert testimony with respect to a dog\u2019s reaction to the odor of narcotics is admissible when supported by a proper foundation. Such foundation must establish the appropriate training and reliability of the dog in the detection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>specific drugs by odor and the witness handler\u2019s expertise in interpreting the dog\u2019s behavior, together with circumstances conducive to a dependable scent identification by the animal and a credible evaluation of its related behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Here, Officer Ball was qualified, without objection, as an expert in handling Doc and interpretation of his reactions. Evidence regarding Doc\u2019s certification, recertification, training regime, and near-perfect past performance was clearly sufficient to demonstrate the dog\u2019s high degree of reliability. Tosloskie and Thompson, the only two officers to handle the money after its seizure and prior to the \u201clineup,\u201d testified that the currency in issue did not come into contact with narcotics prior to Doc\u2019s \u201calert,\u201d and the evidence was uncontroverted that the \u201ccurrency run\u201d was conducted in accordance with procedures proven to produce accurate responses from the dog. Under such circumstances, the trial judge correctly ruled that defendant\u2019s challenges to the protocols of the \u201clineup\u201d went \u201cto the weight of the evidence, not as to [its] admissibility,\u201d and were appropriate factual considerations for the jury. Therefore, evidence of Doc\u2019s reaction to the currency and Ball\u2019s related interpretation was properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">However, even if otherwise admissible, defendant argues that the prejudicial effect of such evidence outweighed its probative value. This contention is also without merit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Evidence that tends to establish a fact at issue is relevant and material and, therefore, admissible, if its probative value is not outweighed by any prejudicial effect. . . . Once evidence is determined to be relevant and material, \u201c[t]he responsibility for balancing . . . probative value and prejudice rests in the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d and its decision \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\"><em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 293, 297-98, 443 S.E.2d 440, 443 (1994) (en banc) (citations omitted). Evidence of Doc\u2019s reaction to the currency permitted an inference that the money, portions of which belonged to defendant, had been in contact with the offending drugs. It thus connected defendant to the contraband and tended to establish his constructive possession of it, a fundamental element of the crimes in issue. The proof was, therefore, relevant, material, and highly probative and properly admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ted into evidence by the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Lastly, defendant contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions. In order to convict defendant under the indictments, the prosecution was required to prove that he \u201c \u2018intentionally and consciously possessed\u2019 the drug[s], either actually or constructively, with knowledge of [their] nature and character, together with the intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>18 Va. App. at 298, 443 S.E.2d at 444 (citation omitted). \u201cConstructive possession may be shown by defendant\u2019s acts, declarations or conduct which support the inference that the contraband was \u2018subject to his dominion or control,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), and need not be exclusive. <em>Ritter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 732, 741, 173 S.E.2d 799, 806 (1970); <em>Wymer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 294, 300, 403 S.E.2d 702, 706 (1991). Defendant\u2019s intent to distribute the drugs may be \u201c \u2018shown by circumstantial evidence\u2019 which is \u2018consistent with guilt\u2019 and \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with and \u2018exclude [s] every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilkins, </em>18 Va. App. at 298, 443 S.E.2d at 444 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Here, defendant deliberately delayed admitting the police officers to the motel room while other occupants were scurrying about inside. The ensuing investigation disclosed that defendant, a local resident, had engaged the room. Narcotics were discovered secreted in an AM/FM cassette player, packaged, and in quantities consistent with distribution. Near the player, a single suitcase contained an adaptor for the cassette player and property claimed by defendant, including a large sum of cash, bundled as customary in the drug trade and emitting an odor of illicit drugs. Additionally, paraphernalia commonly utilized in drug distribution was found in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Although none of these circumstances, standing alone, would have sufficiently proved that defendant possessed the drugs, the facts combined to support the finding that the narcotics discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>were subject to defendant\u2019s informed \u201cdominion and control.\u201d <em>See Hardy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 677, 682-83, 440 S.E.2d 434, 437 (1994); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 150, 153, 402 S.E.2d 502, 504 (1991); <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 87, 100, 390 S.E.2d 491, 498 (1990) (en banc). Further, this evidence sufficiently established that defendant constructively possessed the narcotics with the intent to distribute them. <em>See Servis v. Commonwealth, 6 </em>Va. App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988); <em>Monroe v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 154, 156, 355 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1987); <em>Hambury </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 435, 438, 350 S.E.2d 524, 525 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Baker, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> Thompson valued the packaged cocaine at $50 for each of the numerous rocks in the seven bags and $1400 for the two \u201cchunks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> Additional circumstances suggesting unreliability of the Ball/Doc evidence discussed in the dissent were not argued by defendant at trial, on brief, or orally before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\"> Though apparently not an issue on appeal, there was also evidence in <em>Epperly </em>before the jury that the dog had identified the scent of the accused on one of six towels spread on the floor of an auditorium.

The majority concludes that the probative value of that identification outweighed its prejudicial value. I disagree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Evidence is not admissible if it is irrelevant or its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial value. <em>Boggs v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 478, 486, 100 S.E.2d 766, 772 (1957); <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 254, 259, 443 S.E.2d 428, 431 (1994). The Commonwealth has failed to establish that the testimony of a police dog\u2019s \u201calert\u201d to the odor of a narcotic or its derivative on the roll of currency had any tendency to prove the fact for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">The evidence proved that during Detective Thompson\u2019s search of the room, he opened the radio\u2019s battery compartment, where he discovered the bags of crack cocaine and heroin. After he closed the battery compartment, he continued to search and found a bundle of money in a suitcase. When the police were preparing to leave the room, Detective Thompson was assigned the task of delivering the radio and the money to police headquarters. For rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>sons that are unexplained on the record, he placed the money in his coat pocket. No evidence proved that Detective Thompson enclosed the money in a wrapper before inserting it in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The evidence proved that a police dog later \u201calerted\u201d to the money Detective Thompson seized from the room and placed in his pocket. The evidence did not prove whether the dog \u201calerted\u201d to cocaine, heroin, marijuana, or one of the other \u201cderivative\u201d odors which the dog was trained to identify. No evidence suggested that the dog alerted in a unique manner for each narcotic or that residue of a particular narcotic was discovered on the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In attempting to establish that Hetmeyer possessed the narcotics, Detective Thompson \u201cspeculate [d] [that] somebody handled the money after handling the drugs.\u201d However, Thompson\u2019s testimony established that he could have been the source of the transfer of a narcotic to the money. His search progressed from the narcotics to the money. Moreover, Thompson did not place the money in a bag or other container before he placed it in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The evidence also failed to prove that the money which the dog identified as having the odor of narcotics was in fact Hetmeyer\u2019s money. Hetmeyer claimed only $1500 of the $2900 discovered in the suitcase and later exposed to the dog. One of the other men claimed some of the money. Although the third man did not claim that any of the money belonged to him, he, as did Hetmeyer and the second man, claimed ownership of some of the clothing in the suitcase where the money was found. Simply put, no evidence proved that Hetmeyer was the only person who touched the money and was the source of the contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Significantly, no testimony proved what quantity of narcotic was required in order to be detectable by the dog or whether the presence of detectable quantities of narcotic on currency was a common or uncommon occurrence. The dog\u2019s handler acknowledged, however, that in order to train the dog to distinguish between \u201cclean\u201d and drug-tainted currency, he taught the dog to distinguish between uncirculated currency obtained from a bank and currency known to have been near narcotics. Because of the widespread exposure of much of U.S. currency to narcotics, a dog\u2019s successful identification of \u201ctainted\u201d currency is of little, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>any, evidentiary significance. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Fifty-three Thousand Eighty-two Dollars in United States Currency, </em>985 F.2d 245, 250 n.5 (6th Cir. 1993) (noting that evidentiary value of drug detecting dog\u2019s alert has been called into question in light of large amount of currency tainted with drugs); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States Drug Enforcement Administration, </em>819 F. Supp. 698, 720 (M.D. Tenn. 1993) (noting that DEA chemist found that one-third of bills in randomly selected sample were contaminated with detectable cocaine and that Federal Reserve Bank money sorting belts were also contaminated).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In order for the dog\u2019s alert to the money to have been probative of any fact in this case, the jury must necessarily have speculated that the odor detected by the dog was either cocaine or heroin, that the odor was not marijuana, that money with such an odor is uncommon, that Hetmeyer\u2019s money was the money that contained the odor of narcotic, and that Hetmeyer\u2019s money came to have such an odor by virtue of Hetmeyer\u2019s possession of narcotics. That speculation is unwarranted by the evidence and is too attenuated to be of any probative value. Furthermore, these circumstances manifestly establish that the prejudice that flows from allowing proof of the dog\u2019s identification of the odor of narcotics on the money outweighs its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In relying on <em>Epperly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 294 S.E.2d 882 (1982), for the proposition that the dog\u2019s identification was properly admitted, the majority misinterprets the import of that case. In <em>Epperly, </em>a dog was used to follow the scent of a human.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">We hold that dog-tracking evidence is admissible in a criminal case after a proper foundation has been laid to show that the handler was qualified to work with the dog and to interpret its responses, that the dog was a sufficiently trained and proven tracker of human scent, <em>that the dog was placed on the trail where circumstances indicated that the guilty party had been, and that the trail had not become so stale or contaminated as to be beyond the dog\u2019s tracking capabilities.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">224 Va. at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>In <em>Epperly, </em>the dog followed a scent it had first detected from an article of clothing known to belong to Epperly. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 294 S.E.2d at 889. In this case, although there was proof that Hetmeyer had been standing near the suitcase that contained his currency, no evidence proved that the narcotic scent the dog detected was related to Hetmeyer and not someone else. Given the nature of the scent that the dog in this case was tracking (i.e., marijuana, heroin, cocaine, or a derivative odor), it cannot be said as was the case in <em>Epperly, </em>that \u201c[i]n the actual event [] the dog unerringly followed the trail ... to the defendant\u2019s front door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 294 S.E.2d at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">For all of these reasons, evidence of the dog\u2019s identification of Hetmeyer\u2019s currency should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The majority also concludes that the circumstances of Hetmeyer\u2019s presence in a hotel room were sufficient to prove that he exercised dominion and control over narcotics found in the hotel room. I also disagree that the evidence was sufficient to prove that Hetmeyer possessed either the heroin or cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Because no evidence proved that Hetmeyer was ever in actual possession of either drug, the sole question is whether Hetmeyer constructively possessed heroin or cocaine. His proximity to those items, even in a hotel room that he rented, is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed them. <em>See Clodfelter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 619, 623, 238 S.E.2d 820, 822 (1977). In order to prove that Hetmeyer constructively possessed contraband, the Commonwealth was required to prove facts and circumstances that indicated that Hetmeyer was aware of its presence and exercised dominion and control over the contraband. <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 471, 473, 338 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1986). Moreover, in order for circumstantial evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it must be wholly consistent with guilt and wholly inconsistent with innocence. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The police found bags of heroin and cocaine in the battery compartment of a radio on a bed in the hotel room which Hetmeyer rented. Two other men were also present in the hotel room. No evidence proved that Hetmeyer was aware of the drugs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>radio. Although the police dog may have \u201calerted\u201d to a roll of money, some of which Hetmeyer admitted was his, no evidence proved that Hetmeyer\u2019s money was connected with the contraband found in the radio or that the odor the dog detected was in fact that of heroin or cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The majority also states that Hetmeyer delayed in admitting the investigating police officers into the hotel room. The detective who initially approached Hetmeyer\u2019s hotel room testified, however, that after he knocked at the hotel room door Hetmeyer came to the door and \u201c[sjtarted to go from the dead bolt to the handle like this [indicated]; . . . and . . . was going up and down as if he was having a problem with the locks. . . . [H]e kept doing this [indicating] for a while just back and forth, back and forth up to the dead bolt and down, and finally he opened the door.\u201d Nothing in the detective\u2019s testimony proved that Hetmeyer was not having trouble with the locks. The detective also testified that the delay was \u201c[o]ne or two minutes. Wasn\u2019t very long.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Moreover, Hetmeyer was under no obligation to admit the detective who came to the door without a warrant and who admitted that during his hour-long surveillance of the room from the outside he saw nothing suspicious. Neither the Commonwealth nor the majority cite any authority for the proposition that such a delay as was present here is evidence of consciousness of guilt or any other inculpatory circumstance. <em>Cf. Clodfelter, </em>218 Va. at 623, 238 S.E.2d at 822 (reversing conviction notwithstanding fact that defendant gave false identity to police who searched hotel room with valid search warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Although the radio containing the narcotics was found near a suitcase that contained some personal property of Hetmeyer\u2019s, no evidence proved that Hetmeyer owned the radio. Indeed, Hetmeyer told the police that he did not own the radio and that the radio was owned by a fourth person. Even if the jury believed that Hetmeyer lied to the police, a finding the jury could not have made based on Hetmeyer\u2019s lack of credibility since he did not testify, Hetmeyer\u2019s lying about ownership of the radio does not permit the attenuated inference that Hetmeyer knew of the drugs in the radio and intended to possess them. Hetmeyer, for example, may have lied to protect his two companions or because he believed the radio to be stolen or because he suspected that it might, in some way, implicate one of his companions. Any inference that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Hetmeyer lied to conceal his guilt, as opposed to some other inference consistent with innocence, is necessarily speculative. <em>See, e.g., Bishop, </em>227 Va. at 170, 313 S.E.2d at 393 (characterizing defendant\u2019s deceit as \u201csuspicious conduct which does not constitute evidence sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Stover v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 618, 624, 283 S.E.2d 194, 196-97 (1981) (defendant\u2019s possible perjury regarding a suspicious circumstance was insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 950, 955, 234 S.E.2d 74, 78 (1977) (\u201csuspicious inferences\u201d may be drawn from defendant\u2019s deceptive conduct, but these are insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt). Of course, Hetmeyer\u2019s silence at trial is not a factor upon which the jury could choose to credit a particular inference. <em>See Durant v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 454, 458, 375 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Similarly, evidence that a scale, razor knife, and an AC adaptor for the radio were found in the suitcase does not prove that Hetmeyer possessed drugs. Each of those items was lawfully possessed. No evidence established that narcotics or narcotics residue were found on those items. Furthermore, the items were in a suitcase which contained property claimed by Hetmeyer and one of the other men. None of those items was in plain view inside the room. Hetmeyer told Detective Thompson that the suitcase \u201cwas a community type suitcase, that everybody had some property that was in the suitcase.\u201d Indeed, when Detective Thompson spoke to the other occupants of the room, they all claimed some property in the suitcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Detective Thompson stated that the knife found in Hetmeyer\u2019s suitcase was the sort used to cut crack cocaine. No evidence proved that the knife contained cocaine or its residue or that a person might not have such a knife for an alternative reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The presence of digital pagers in the room as well as Hetmeyer\u2019s possession of a large sum of cash do not prove that Hetmeyer possessed the narcotics. The detective testified that the manner in which Hetmeyer carried his money was consistent with the method used by drug dealers. The money was not found on Hetmeyer\u2019s person, however. Although the manner in which the money was rolled may be consistent with the method of drug dealers, no evidence proved that only drug dealers are known to carry their money tightly rolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Because the evidence in this case was wholly circumstantial and because it did not exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence, the evidence was insufficient to prove Hetmeyer\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
