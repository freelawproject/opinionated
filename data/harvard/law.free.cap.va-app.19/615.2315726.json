We hold that the defendant was not in custody, and therefore, could not be convicted of escape. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Two uniformed police officers went to the defendant\u2019s home to arrest him on a warrant for grand larceny. The defendant\u2019s mother answered the door and went to get the defendant. He appeared in approximately one minute and stood about three feet from the officers. One officer asked him identifying questions and told the defendant that he had a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. The defendant asked why the warrant had been issued. The officer approached the defendant, reaching for his handcuffs with his left hand and reaching to grab the defendant\u2019s arm with his right hand. He was within an inch of the defendant when the defendant turned and ran. The defendant was found and arrested some time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence the defendant moved to strike, claiming that the Commonwealth had not proved that he was in custody before he ran. The defendant and his mother then testified, and once again the defendant moved to strike on the same grounds. The jury convicted the defendant, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">\u201cIf any person . . . lawfully in the custody ... of any law-enforcement officer on a charge or conviction of a felony escapes\u201d without using force or violence, he or she is guilty of a class 6 felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-479. A prerequisite for escape is \u201clawful custody.\u201d In this case, the defendant was lawfully in custody only if the officer arrested him. \u201cAn arrest requires <em>either </em>physical force <em>... or, </em>where that is absent, <em>submission </em>to the assertion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>authority.\u201d <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626 (1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In this case, although the defendant may have fled or resisted arrest, he was never \u201clawfully in the custody\u201d of the officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the officer exerted no actual physical force on the defendant and the defendant did not submit, he was never in custody, thus, cannot be guilty of escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Therefore, the judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Koontz, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\"> In general, courts have required actual physical touching of the person, words or actions which subject the person to the officer\u2019s actual control, or submission by the person to be arrested. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>838 P.2d 1351, 1352 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1992) (interpreting statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>404 S.E.2d 112, 113 (Ga. 1991); <em>Whiting v. State, </em>755 S.W.2d 936, 939 (Tex. Ct. App. 1988), <em>rev'd on other grounds, </em>797 S.W.2d 45 (Tex. 1990); <em>State v. Sanders, </em>245 S.E.2d 674, 684 (N.C. 1978) (interpreting statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Byer, </em>224 S.E.2d 726, 732 (W. Va. 1976); <em>Bouldin </em>v. <em>State, </em>350 A.2d 130, 132 (Md. 1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>116 S.E.2d 858, 860 (S.C. 1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-13\"> The Commonwealth urges us to conduct an analysis of custody similar to that used in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), and its progeny. Such analysis would be inappropriate in this instance because <em>Miranda </em>concerns the coercive effect of custody on interrogation. <em>Id. </em>This concern is not at issue in the construction of our escape statute. Furthermore, our reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-479 is consistent with Code \u00a7 19.2-77, which provides for police pursuit \u201c[wjhenever a person in the custody of an officer shall escape or whenever a person <em>shall flee from an officer attempting to arrest him.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b627-9\">Fitzpatrick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Av1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">I respectfully disagree with the holding of the majority that appellant was never \u201clawfully in custody\u201d because he was not physically restrained by the officers and did not submit to their authority. The majority relies upon the rationale of <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 625 (1991), which I find inapplicable to this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">While this issue has not yet been specifically addressed in the Commonwealth, several federal cases provide guidance. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Keller, </em>912 F.2d 1058, 1060 (9th Cir. 1990) (holding that a defendant who failed to report to his place of confinement at the appointed time escaped from custody), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1095 (1991); <em>United States v. Peterson, </em>592 F.2d 1035, 1037 (9th Cir. 1979) (holding that a defendant who failed to report to the United States Marshal immediately after sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ing escaped from custody); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>481 F.2d 57, 60-61 (8th Cir. 1973) (holding that a prisoner in jail escaped from custody even though he was not in the actual physical custody of the arresting officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In <em>Tennant </em>v. <em>United States, </em>407 F.2d 52 (9th Cir. 1969), a customs inspector told the driver of a car suspected of carrying drugs that he was under arrest. The driver fled and was later convicted of escape from the custody of a federal officer. In upholding that conviction, the Ninth Circuit held that \u201c[i]f appellant heard and understood the oral communication that he was \u2018under arrest,\u2019 the authorized detention became \u2018custody\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">It is clear that custody is not limited only to direct physical restraint. Custody can be effectuated either by an actual touching or by circumstances in which a person of ordinary intelligence would know that he was not free to leave. When a police officer in uniform tells a suspect that he has a warrant for the suspect\u2019s arrest and reaches for his handcuffs with one hand and for the suspect with the other, a person of ordinary intelligence would know he is \u201clawfully in custody\u201d and not free to leave. Appellant heard and understood the oral communication that he was under arrest and was at that time in \u201clawful custody\u201d and subject to prosecution for escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
