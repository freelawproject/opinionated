Jackson, Commissioner (appellant), appeals a decision of the Fairfax County Circuit Court that ordered the Department of Social Services (DSS) to enter a finding of \u201cUnfounded\u201d in a sexual abuse complaint against Jerry Marshall (appellee). Appellant argues that the trial court erred in: (1) finding that former Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(7)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> required a final disposition of only \u201cFounded\u201d or \u201cUnfounded\u201d and did not provide for a final finding of \u201cReason to Suspect,\u201d and (2) failing to dismiss the appeal as moot. Finding no error, we aifirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The Child Protective Services unit of the Fairfax County Department of Human Development (the department) received a complaint on March 18, 1992 that appellee, an employee of Franconia ADS Youth Services, had abused a student enrolled there. After an initial investigation, the department determined that the allegation of child abuse was \u201cFounded-Sexual Abuse.\u201d On July 13, 1992, after an informal conference pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6:1(A), the department refused to amend the disposition. Appellee appealed that decision to DSS. On April 12, 1993, a DSS hearing commissioner found insufficient evidence to support a \u201cFounded\u201d determination and amended the disposition of the case to \u201cReason to Suspect-Sexual Abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.1-248.6:1 and 9-6.14:16, appellee filed for review with the circuit court, asserted that Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(7) allowed only a final disposition of either \u201cFounded\u201d or \u201cUnfounded,\u201d and requested that a disposition of \u201cUnfounded\u201d be entered. DSS moved to dismiss the appeal as moot because the department and DSS had already destroyed all case records pursuant to DSS regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 15, 1993, the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>denied DSS\u2019s motion to dismiss and found that \u201cCode [\u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(7)] does not authorize a finding of \u2018Reason to Suspect\u2019 and that the Virginia Department of Social Services is required to enter a finding of either \u2018Founded\u2019 or \u2018Unfounded\u2019.\u201d The court ordered DSS to enter a finding of \u201cUnfounded\u201d because all parties stipulated that insufficient evidence existed to support a final disposition of \u201cFounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">REASON TO SUSPECT DESIGNATION</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Code \u00a7 63.1-248.1 sets forth the purpose of the Child Abuse and Neglect Act (the Act):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">The General Assembly declares that it is the policy of this Commonwealth to require reports of suspected child abuse and neglect for the purpose of identifying children who are being abused or neglected, of assuring that protective services will be made available to an abused or neglected child in order to protect such a child and his siblings and to prevent further abuse or neglect, and of preserving the family life of the parents and children, where possible, by enhancing parental capacity for adequate child care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-8\"><em>Jackson v.

App. at 399, 419 S.E.2d at 389 (holding that the \u201cCommissioner\u2019s adoption of guidelines interpreting the statute was within his statutory authority\u201d under Code \u00a7 63.1-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">\u201cOn review, \u2018the interpretation which an administrative agency gives its [law] must be accorded great deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jack</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>son, </em>14 Va. App. at 400-01, 419 S.E.2d at 390 (quoting <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, 9 </em>Va. App. 152, 159, 384 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1989), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>398 S.E.2d 78 (1990)). However, \u201c[c]ourts must \u2018construe and determine compliance with the statutes governing adoption of administrative regulation irrespective of the agency\u2019s construction,\u2019 and not \u2018merely rubber-stamp an agency determination.\u2019 Agency action, even when \u2018supported by substantial evidence,\u2019 must be set aside if judicial review reveals a failure \u2018. . . to comply with statutory authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Virginia State Water Control Bd., </em>15 Va. App. 271, 278, 422 S.E.2d 608, 612 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must look first to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Services v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D) clearly authorizes DSS to enter only one of two final disposition alternatives, \u201cFounded\u201d or \u201cUnfounded,\u201d in a child protective services case. DSS\u2019s regulations and guidelines expanding this statutory grant are inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory framework for the investigation and appeals process.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The statute sets up a step-by-step process for the investigation of cases of abuse and neglect. DSS\u2019s primary function is to immediately investigate complaints of child abuse and to take prompt action when necessary to protect the child. Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(1), (3)-(5). If the department makes an <em>initial </em>determination that abuse is suspected or has occurred, the department is required to file a report to this effect with the central registry. Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(2). Within fourteen days, the department must send a second, follow-up report to the central registry. Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(6). Then, within forty-five days, the department is required to enter a final disposition of \u201cFounded\u201d or \u201cUnfounded\u201d and send a third report to the central registry. Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(7). The plain meaning of the language in Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D) indicates that these are ascending steps in the investigative process and that the statute requires a final disposition of \u201cFounded\u201d or \u201cUnfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">This process is analogous to a criminal proceeding, in which only probable cause need be established at the preliminary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ing but the standard at trial is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In child abuse cases, it is often necessary to take quick action to protect the child, and the initial determination of \u201ccause to suspect\u201d allows DSS to take such action. Before a final disposition of \u201cFounded\u201d may be entered, however, the evidence must be clear and convincing in order to protect not only the interests of the child but also the rights of the person accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We hold that the circuit court did not err in construing Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(7) to require a final disposition of \u201cFounded\u201d or \u201cUnfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Appellant next argues that even if appellee\u2019s statutory interpretation is correct, the case was rendered moot when the records were destroyed prior to the final hearing date. When DSS amended the disposition of appellee\u2019s case from \u201cFounded\u201d to \u201cReason to Suspect,\u201d DSS and the department destroyed internal records and reports in the central registry pursuant to their guidelines and procedures. <em>See supra </em>note 2. Appellant contends that, because this information has been deleted, there are no records to be changed to reflect the correct finding of \u201cUnfounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">\u201c \u2018The duty of this court as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 225, 181 S.E. 521, 533 (1935). Dismissal is the proper remedy if \u201can event occurs which renders it impossible for [a] court, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever.\u201d <em>Hankins </em>v. <em>Town of Virginia Beach, </em>182 Va. 642, 644, 29 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1944). We disagree with appellant\u2019s argument that the destruction of the case records was an event rendering the case moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">\u201c \u2018[I]n today\u2019s society there is no more deplorable badge of infamy a person can wear than that of being a child abuser.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, </em>14 Va. App. at 408, 419 S.E.2d at 395. From the time the department entered its initial disposition of \u201cFounded-Sexual Abuse,\u201d which was later amended to \u201cReason to Suspect,\u201d until the deletion of the case records one year after the initial complaint, the central registry contained reports designating appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>as either a person found to have committed abuse or a person suspected of abuse. This information was available to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6(D)(5) and to appellee\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Additionally, DSS\u2019s own guidelines recognize the possibility of harm to a person wrongly accused of child abuse because in \u201cUnfounded\u201d cases, DSS <em>must </em>retain the report of the disposition in the central registry for up to two years if the individual involved so requests. The obvious purpose is to allow an accused abuser to prove to others that the charge was without merit. Although DSS\u2019s guidelines provide for retention of \u201cUnfounded\u201d dispositions for up to two years, in this case, appellee never had the benefit of having an \u201cUnfounded\u201d disposition entered in the central registry. Thus, the destruction of the case records did not render the case moot because an \u201cUnfounded\u201d disposition entered in the central registry would have provided appellee with \u201ceffectual relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Barrow, J., and Koontz, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> Code \u00a7 63.1-248.6 was amended in 1993, and subsection (D) was redesignated as subsection (E).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\"> Va.
