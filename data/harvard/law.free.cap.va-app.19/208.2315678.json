The Public Defender who represented Anderson moved the trial judge to grant her a free transcript of Anderson\u2019s first trial. The Commonwealth joined in Anderson\u2019s motion, but the trial court denied the motion. Anderson was convicted of burglary and petit larceny at the second trial. He contends on this appeal that the trial judge violated his rights to equal protection and due process of law by denying him a transcript of the first trial. We reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">At the first trial, Ronald McWilliams testified that he arrived at his home at 9:45 p.m. and discovered a man inside. When McWilliams yelled, the man ran through the house and out a rear door. McWilliams testified that when he entered his house he was about six feet away from the man. He testified that he saw the man for a couple of seconds and that \u201cit looked like it was . . . the defendant.\u201d He further testified that he did not see whether the man had anything in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On the floor by the door, McWilliams saw his radio, his video recorder, and an identification card belonging to Anderson. McWilliams testified that the picture on Anderson\u2019s identification card was that of the man who was in his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Anderson testified that at the time of the burglary he was at home watching a football game on television. He also testified that he lost his wallet four days before the incident and that he had not seen his identification card since he lost his wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">In her closing argument, Anderson\u2019s attorney focused upon the weaknesses in McWilliams\u2019s identification of Anderson as the intruder. She noted that Anderson had a crossed eye, that Anderson\u2019s eye condition was an obvious physical characteristic, and that McWilliams did not describe it to the police. She also argued that the police did not attempt to get fingerprints from the identification card. When the jury was unable to agree on a verdict, the trial judge declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">After the trial, Anderson\u2019s attorney moved the judge to provide Anderson a free copy of a transcript of his first trial. She informed the trial judge that the victim might change his testimony because he had heard closing argument concerning his failure to notice Anderson\u2019s obvious physical trait and his testimony concerning the robber\u2019s hands. Stating that \u201cit would help to insure justice in this case,\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney joined in the motion. The trial judge denied Anderson\u2019s motion for a transcript. When Anderson\u2019s attorney informed the judge that Anderson was indigent and was entitled under the law to have a transcript prepared by the Commonwealth, the trial judge responded that \u201c[t]he Public Defender\u2019s Office has a budget just like everybody else does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Prior to the second trial, Anderson\u2019s attorney renewed the motion for a transcript. The trial judge again denied the motion and remarked that it was unnecessary because the same court reporter was transcribing the testimony. At trial, McWilliams testified that he was five feet from the intruder and that the intruder was carrying his VCR with both hands as he fled. He also testified that \u201c[tjhere is no doubt in [his] mind\u201d that Anderson was the intruder and that \u201c[s]ometimes ... I can lay down and I can see him in my mind asleep. ... If I put my life on the line I knew that was the man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Anderson again testified in his defense. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney had a transcript from the first trial and used it in the cross-examination of Anderson. Despite Anderson\u2019s insistence that he was testifying exactly as he had done in the first trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney used his transcript in an attempt to show a discrepancy between Anderson\u2019s testimony in the first trial and his testimony in the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The Supreme Court of the United States has invoked the \u201cconstitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection\u201d in holding that indigent defendants are entitled to the basic tools necessary to prepare an adequate defense or appeal when those tools are available to others for a price. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 17 (1956). Following <em>Griffin, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia held that refusing an indigent defendant a free transcript of the trial court record in order to perfect an appeal constituted a denial of fundamental constitutional rights. <em>Cabaniss </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>206 Va. 330, 334-35, 143 S.E.2d 911, 914 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In a later decision, the Supreme Court of the United States extended the principle announced in <em>Griffin </em>and held that, following a mistrial, \u201cthe State must provide an indigent defendant with a transcript of prior proceedings when that transcript is needed for an effective defense or appeal.\u201d <em>Britt </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. 226, 227 (1971); <em>accord Young </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 885, 886-87, 241 S.E.2d 797, 798 (1978). In determining whether a defendant needs a free transcript, two factors are relevant: \u201c(1) the value of the transcript to the defendant in connection with the appeal or trial for which it is sought, and (2) the availability of alternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as a tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>script.\u201d <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The value of the transcript to Anderson is evident considering the events of the two trials. Because there were no other witnesses, this case rested on McWilliams\u2019s identification of Anderson as the intruder. The results of the first trial demonstrated the success of impeaching McWilliams\u2019s recollection of the events. Counsel\u2019s use of the transcript would have been a highly effective, if not the best, way to present Anderson\u2019s defense in the second trial. \u201cIn cases whose outcome turns on witness credibility, the potential value of a transcript for impeachment purposes is obvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Devlin, </em>13 F.3d 1361, 1365 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The record reflects that Anderson\u2019s counsel informed the trial judge that McWilliams had returned to the courtroom during final arguments and had heard the arguments concerning his testimony. Indeed, McWilliams\u2019s testimony concerning his recollection of the events was stronger in the second trial. He expressed greater certainty of the identification of Anderson, and he even remembered seeing Anderson with the VCR in his hands. Thus, Anderson carried his burden of proving the obvious value that a transcript would have been to his defense. <em>See id. </em>(holding that district court committed constitutional error in refusing to provide free transcript of prior hearing to indigent defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Moreover, by joining in Anderson\u2019s motion for a transcript, the Commonwealth evidenced its belief in the value of the transcript to these proceedings. Indeed, the Commonwealth acquired a copy of the transcript and used it to cast doubt on Anderson\u2019s credibility at the second trial. Nevertheless, it is unnecessary to look at this case in hindsight. The value of a transcript of a prior mistrial \u201ccan ordinarily be assumed\u201d because it can be used as a discovery device, for trial preparation, or for impeachment purposes at the new trial. <em>Britt, </em>404 U.S. at 228. The transcript was \u00e1 valuable tool that was available for any person who had the funds to purchase it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The Commonwealth contends that an adequate alternative existed because the court reporter could have related the events of the first trial from her notes. The record, however, does not establish that this alternative was adequate. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that \u201c[a] defendant who claims the right to a free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>transcript does not . . . bear the burden of proving inadequate such alternatives as may be suggested by the State or conjured up by a Court in hindsight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230. In <em>Britt, </em>the Supreme Court noted the concession made by Britt\u2019s counsel at oral argument that such an alternative would have been adequate in his case, 404 U.S. at 229, and affirmed the conviction \u201cin the narrow circumstances of [that] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. In addressing the ordinary case, however, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">Moreover, we doubt that it would suffice to provide the defendant with limited access to the court reporter during the course of the second trial. That approach was aptly rejected as \u201ctoo little and too late\u201d in <em>United States ex rel. Wilson </em>v. <em>McMann, </em>408 F.2d 896, 897 (CA2 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The alternative the Commonwealth suggests is \u201ca breeder of delay and confusion [and] [w]orst of all . . . such a ruling is apt to lead the defendant into a trap and gravely prejudice his defense.\u201d <em>McMann, </em>408 F.2d at 897.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">In sum, the alternative [of] . . . reference to the notes of the court reporter at the first trial when a possible conflict in testimony arose during the second trial, was not the substantial equivalent of a transcript. The alternative . . . [would not have] assisted counsel in his preparation for the second trial, nor could it be effectively used as a tool for the impeachment of a witness at the second trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\"><em>Turner </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>613 F.2d 264, 267 (10th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">For the reasons stated, we reverse Anderson\u2019s convictions and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">Willis, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
