On appeal, appellants contend that the tires stored and hauled in the victim\u2019s trailer were not \u201cshipments of freight or express or other property\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Thus, the defendants argue the only crimes for which they could be charged were attempted grand larceny of the tires and trespass, not burglary, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-147.1. We disagree and affirm appellants\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">James Branscomb, owner of Jimmy\u2019s Cycle Sales, parked on the lot of his business a trailer containing tires. Branscomb used the trailer for the storage and the transportation of tires. The trailer had a \u201cgoose-neck\u201d attachment which Branscomb connected to his pickup truck to transport the tires to flea markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Shortly after midnight on November 21, 1992, appellants broke into and entered the trailer. Branscomb apprehended the men and held them at gunpoint until the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Appellants do not dispute that the trailer was a \u201cvehicle,\u201d but argue whether the tires inside the trailer were \u201cshipments of freight or express or other property\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-147.1. Appellants assert that the tires could not be \u201cfreight\u201d because the word refers only to goods which are shipped by one party for another for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">This case is controlled by <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 298, 295 S.E.2d 890 (1982), in which the Court stated as follows: \u201cFrom its very tenor the statute is directed to cargo theft. The particular vehicle ... is required to contain, according to the crucial clause, \u2018shipments of freight or express or other property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 295 S.E.2d at 892 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-147.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In addition to being \u201c[t]he compensation paid for the transportation of goods,\u201d as appellants urge, freight is also defined as \u201csomething that is loaded for transportation: cargo.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>908 (1981). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1377 (6th ed. 1990) defines \u201cshipment\u201d as \u201cthe [transportation of goods; . . . [a] Iso, the property which is the subject of transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In analyzing the statute, the Court in <em>Martin </em>also noted the need for \u201ca vehicle in commerce.\u201d 224 Va. at 301, 295 S.E.2d at 892. While the court held the meaning of \u201cother property\u201d does not encompass \u201carticles of personal property\u201d kept in private vehicles, \u201cother property\u201d does equate to \u201c \u2018shipments\u2019 of things <em>analogous </em>to \u2018freight\u2019 or \u2018express.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 295 S.E.2d at 893. Thus, <em>Martin </em>makes clear that the statute not only covers items of property moved as \u201cfreight\u201d for compensation, but any cargo which is transported in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Branscomb stored tires in the trailer. He also transported the tires in the trailer for sale at flea markets. Therefore, the tires were \u201cproperty which [was] the subject of transportation\u201d in \u201ca vehicle in commerce.\u201d Furthermore, the tires were cargo, chattels, or goods transported by Branscomb and were \u201canalogous to \u2018freight.\u2019 \u201d Thus, appellants broke into and entered a vehicle \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>taining shipments of freight ... or other property\u201d with the intent to commit larceny within the meaning of \u00a7 18.2-147.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We disagree with appellants\u2019 more narrow construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-147.1 because it contradicts the holding of <em>Martin </em>that \u201cthe statutory term \u2018other property\u2019 \u201d means \u201c \u2018shipments\u2019 of things <em>analogous </em>to \u2018freight\u2019 or \u2018express.\u2019 \u201d 224 Va. 298, 302, 295 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1982). To accept appellants\u2019 construction would lead to incongruous results, providing defendants with readily available defenses in cases where the victim of the theft happened to be transporting his own goods in commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Coleman, J., and Hodges, S.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-13\"> Appellants were also convicted of attempted grand larceny and possession of burglarious tools. However, appeal of those convictions was denied in an unpublished order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
