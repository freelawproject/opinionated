On appeal, he contends that the trial court denied him an impartial jury by refusing to strike for cause three prospective jurors. We hold that the trial court erred by refusing to strike for cause prospective juror Horvath. Because we reverse on that ground, we do not consider the contentions regarding the other two jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">An accused is guaranteed the right to a trial by \u201can impartial jury.\u201d U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV; Va. Const. art. I \u00a7 8. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-347, -348; Rule 3A:14(b); <em>Breeden </em>v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 297, 297, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976). Trial courts, as the guardians of this fundamental right, have the duty to procure an impartial jury. <em>Salina v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 92, 93, 225 S.E.2d 199, 200 (1976). A prospective juror who is biased, prejudiced, or who \u201cpersists in a misapprehension of law that will render him incapable of abiding the court\u2019s instructions and applying the law, must be excluded for cause\u201d because such a juror cannot be impartial. <em>Sizemore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 208, 211, 397 S.E.2d 408, 410 (1990); <em>see also Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 971, 976, 266 S.E.2d 87, 90 (1980). A trial court that forces a defendant to use one of his peremptory strikes to exclude a prospective juror who is biased, prejudiced, or suifers from a misapprehension of the law commits prejudicial error. <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300, 227 S.E.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Trial courts primarily determine whether a venireperson is free from partiality and prejudice through meaningful <em>voir dire. See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-358. During <em>voir dire, </em>the trial judge must probe the conscience and mental attitude of the prospective jurors to ensure impartiality. <em>Bausell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 669, 682-83, 181 S.E. 453, 458 (1935); <em>Rust v. Reid, </em>124 Va. 1, 17, 97 S.E. 324, 328 (1918). It is not uncommon to discover during <em>voir dire </em>that prospective jurors have preconceived notions, opinions, or misconceptions about the criminal justice system, criminal' trials and procedure, or about the particular case. Even though a prospective juror may hold preconceived views, opinions, or misconceptions, the test of impartiality is whether the venireperson can lay aside the preconceived views and render a verdict based solely on the law and evidence presented at trial. <em>See Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 243, 248, 257 S.E.2d 797, 801 (1979), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). Trial courts should not, however, accept a venireperson\u2019s bare declaration of impartiality without providing the means to assure that the expression reflects the person\u2019s true state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On appeal, a trial judge\u2019s decision to seat a juror is entitled to great deference, and the decision will not be overturned unless the error is manifest. <em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 237, 241, 391 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1990). During <em>voir dire </em>of prospective juror Horvath, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">MR. LEVAY: Has that [police work] experience led you to make any presumptions of wrongdoing with defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">MR. HORVATH: Well, I believe everyone is entitled to a trial, and whatever comes out of that trial is whatever comes out. If he\u2019s proven to be innocent, then he\u2019s proven to be innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">Because I know the defense has the \u2014 the burden of proof is upon the defense to prove their case. And I know that from my work as an insurance adjuster, you have to show that there is something there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">MR. LEVAY: So Mr. Griffin would have to prove his innocence to a certain extent for you to acquit him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">MR. HORVATH: I would think \u2014 I would think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">After prospective juror Horvath had expressed his view that the defendant would be required to prove his innocence, the trial judge intervened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-15\">THE COURT: Let me explain to you what the law is in the case. Then I\u2019ll ask you if you can abide by what the law is. The Defendant is presumed to be innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">Right. MR. HORVATH:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>THE COURT: That presumption of innocence remains with him throughout the trial. And that presumption is enough for you to find the Defendant not guilty unless and until the Commonwealth proves each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">Now, the Defendant may stand moot and produce no evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">In any event, there is no burden on the Defendant to produce any evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">Can you abide by that instruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">MR. HORVATH: I think I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A47\">THE COURT: I need a commitment from you; because there is no thinking about whether you\u2019re going to abide by the law of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">MR. HORVATH: I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHF\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHl\">MR. LEV AY: Your pre-disposition, though, is that the defendants have done something wrong and they need to prove their case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">MR. HORVATH: I believe I misspoke. I meant the prosecuting \u2014 prosecutors have to prove that there was some wrongdoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">MR. LEV AY: And what did you mean by the defendant would have to prove his innocence earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">MR. HORVATH: What I meant was the prosecuting \u2014 not the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiJ\">MR. LEV AY: That the prosecutor would have to prove the Defendant innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>MR. HORVATH: Right. I believe that people are proven \u2014 have to be proven guilty, not that they are guilty when they are charged. <em>I think that\u2019s the answer to your question, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">MR. LEV AY: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">THE COURT: Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">(Thereupon, Mr. Horvath resumed his seat in the jury box.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">MR. LEV AY: Your Honor, I don\u2019t believe he was rehabilitated. I believe his answers speak volumes, and I\u2019d move to strike him for cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">THE COURT: Your motion is denied. I\u2019ll note your exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">Prospective juror Horvath initially made several unequivocal statements, not in response to suggestive or leading questions from counsel, but based upon his familiarity with the criminal justice system through police training and from experience as an insurance adjuster, stating that he knew \u201cthe burden of proof\u2019 is upon the defense to prove their case ... [i]f he\u2019s proven to be innocent, then he\u2019s proven to be innocent.\u201d Horvath\u2019s explanation and repeated expression that the accused had the burden to prove his innocence belies his later claim that he simply \u201cmisspoke.\u201d His statement exposed a preconceived misconception about a basic and fundamental concept of criminal law that is critical for a juror to apply in every criminal case and is essential to be able to apply in order to serve fairly as a juror. If Horvath were to apply the law as his initial responses would indicate, he not only would relieve the Commonwealth of its heavy burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but he would entirely shift the burden of proof and improperly impose upon the accused the burden to prove his innocence, thereby also depriving the accused of his presumption of innocence and seriously impinging upon his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">After Horvath\u2019s initial response, the trial judge quite properly attempted to rehabilitate Horvath by explaining the basic legal principles that he would be required to apply. The trial judge did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>not, however, ask questions that would enable Horvath to explain independently or in his own words that his misconceptions would not interfere with his ability to apply the law to the case as given to him by the judge. Instead, after explaining to Horvath the applicable law and his duty to apply the law, the judge asked the very leading question, \u201cCan you abide by that instruction?\u201d to which Horvath replied, \u201cI think I could.\u201d Whether Horvath\u2019s response, \u201cI think I could,\u201d was equivocal or certain depends on his intonation and the emphasis that he placed on the word, \u201cthink.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Generally, we would be required to give deference to the trial judge, who had the opportunity to hear and observe Horvath, in deciding the significance and meaning of his response. <em>See Weeks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 460, 475, 450 S.E.2d 379, 389 (1994). However, the record makes clear that the judge considered Horvath\u2019s emphasis on \u201cthink\u201d an equivocal response because the judge proceeded, \u201cI need a commitment from you; because there is no thinking about whether you\u2019re going to abide by the law of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201cUsing or permitting the use of leading questions, those which suggest a desired answer, in the <em>voir dire </em>of a prospective juror may taint the reliability of the juror\u2019s responses. Merely giving \u2018expected answers to leading questions\u2019 does not rehabilitate a prospective juror.\u201d <em>McGill, </em>10 Va. App. at 242, 391 S.E.2d at 600 (citations omitted). \u201cA [prospective] juror\u2019s subsequent statement that he can give the defendant a fair and impartial trial ... is not dispositive when preceded by positive, unequivocal testimony of bias.\u201d <em>Gosling </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 642, 646, 376 S.E.2d 541, 544 (1984). Mere assent to a trial judge\u2019s questions or statements, or to counsel\u2019s leading inquiry, is not enough to rehabilitate a prospective juror who has initially demonstrated a prejudice or partial predisposition. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 149, 159-60, 379 S.E.2d 915, 921, <em>aff'd en banc, 9 </em>Va. App. 175, 384 S.E.2d 813 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Horvath did not provide a statement, independent of the trial judge\u2019s leading and suggestive response, from which the judge could determine Horvath\u2019s state of mind and whether Horvath knew and could apply the correct legal principles and disregard his misconceptions \u201cuninfluenced by persuasion or coercion by any one, least of all by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Bausell, </em>165 Va. at 683, 181 S.E. at 458. Horvath\u2019s subsequent response to counsel that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201cmisspoke\u201d and that he understood that the Commonwealth had the burden to prove the accused guilty did not rehabilitate him. He continued to say that the Commonwealth would have to prove the accused \u201cinnocent,\u201d reaffirming his misconception that he presumes the accused to be guilty until his innocence is proven. Furthermore, by saying, \u201cI think that\u2019s the answer to your question,\u201d Horvath was simply repeating the answer that he felt the judge and counsel wanted, rather than explaining how he would apply the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Sufficient doubt exists whether Horvath could lay aside his firm misconception as to the law and as to his ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. \u201cBy ancient rule, any reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 298, 227 S.E.2d at 735. Venireperson Horvath should have been removed for cause because he was not shown to have been free from exception. The trial court, by forcing the appellant to use one of his peremptory strikes to remove Horvath, committed prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b636-9\">Willis, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">I agree with the majority\u2019s exposition of the principles governing jury selection. However, I disagree with its application of those principles to the facts of this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">Jurors are not required to be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case on which they sit. Nor are we concerned with a possible misapprehension of law. Jurors are not expected to be learned in legal maxims. We are concerned with [their] state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-12\"><em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1976) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">Upon appellate review, we must give deference to the trial court\u2019s decision whether to exclude or retain a prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>juror because the trial court \u201csees and hears the juror;\u201d accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision will be disturbed only upon a showing of manifest error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\"><em>Weeks v. </em>Commonwealth, 248 Va. 460, 475, 450 S.E.2d 379, 389 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Horvath, undergoing interrogation in the open courtroom, was plainly confused as to legal issues and terminology. As he put it, he \u201cmisspoke.\u201d After explaining the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof, the trial court asked Horvath whether he could judge the case according to those principles. Horvath replied, \u201cI think I could.\u201d In <em>Weeks, </em>the Supreme Court held such an undertaking to be sufficient. 248 Va. at 475, 450 S.E.2d at 389. However, the trial court did not stop at that. It pressed Horvath for a specific commitment as to whether he would \u201cabide by the law of the case.\u201d Horvath replied, \u201cI would.\u201d Nothing could be more unequivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The trial court heard more than Horvath\u2019s literal answers, as reported in the written record. It also heard his inflection and observed his demeanor, factors unavailable for our consideration. It found Horvath to be impartial and competent to serve. I perceive no manifest error in that determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
