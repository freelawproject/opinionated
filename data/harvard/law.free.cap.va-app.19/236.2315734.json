Pharo (husband) appeals an order which fixed his monthly child support obligation, payable to Diane Greger Pharo (wife), the custodial parent, at $1205. He complains that the trial court departed from the shared custody statutory guidelines and failed to provide sufficient written justification for the deviation. We agree and reverse the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. In proceedings arising from wife\u2019s bill of complaint for divorce, the trial court was required to determine the parties\u2019 obligations to support the child born to their marriage. Each presented evidence of income, expenses, custody and visitation, and other circumstances material to the issue. The court then computed monthly child support due from husband to wife of $1205, using the sole custody statutory guidelines of Code \u00a7 20-108.2, and $715 applying the statute\u2019s shared custody formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The trial court \u201cdetermined that [husband] had sufficient visitation to qualify for shared custody support guidelines\u201d but concluded that \u201cuse of . . . [such] guidelines would seriously impair [wife\u2019s] ability to maintain minimal adequate housing and provide other basic necessities for the child.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.2(G). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Without further written findings or explanation, the court then deviated from the shared custody guideline amount and fixed husband\u2019s support obligation at $1205, an award consistent with the sole custody child support \u201cguideline tables.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.2(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Code \u00a7 20-108.2(A) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[t]here shall be a rebuttable presumption in any judicial or administrative proceeding for child support . . . , <em>including cases involving . . . shared custody, </em>that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines set forth in this section is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. In order to rebut the presumption, the court shall make written findings in the order as set out in \u00a7 20-108.1, . . . that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case as determined by relevant evidence pertaining to the factors set out in \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.2 and 20-108.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">(Emphasis added). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B). \u201cThe finding that rebuts the guidelines shall state the amount of support that would have been required under the guidelines\u201d and \u201cshall give a justification of why the order varies from the guidelines,\u201d based upon the statutory considerations. Code \u00a7 20-108.1 (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In reviewing awards which applied the guideline support statute to sole custody cases, we have instructed that the \u201cstarting point for a trial court in determining the monthly child support obligation of a party is the amount as computed\u201d pursuant to the statutory schedule. <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>12 Va. App. 18, 21, 401 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1991). Once this presumptively correct statutory sum is ascertained, the trial court may then \u201cadjust the amount based on the factors found in Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107.2 and 20-108.1,\u201d but such deviation \u201cmust be supported by written findings which state why the application of the guidelines . . . would be unjust or inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B). The order \u201cmust identify the factors that justified deviation . . . and explain why and to what extent the factors justified the adjustment\u201d in \u201cenough detail and exactness to allow for effective appellate review of the findings.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>12 Va. App. at 22, 401 S.E.2d at 897. \u201c[A] trial court may not avoid the statutory mandate by simply concluding . . . that circumstances\u201d warrant a guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>departure. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>14 Va. App. 960, 964, 420 S.E.2d 246, 249 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In reaching the statutory guideline figure in cases involving shared custody,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> subsection (G)(3) of Code \u00a7 20-108.2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires the trial court to apply a formula more complex than a sole custody analysis, but, like that determination, the resulting award enjoys a rebuttable presumption of correctness. Code \u00a7 20-108.2(A). Code \u00a7 20-108.2(A) also permits deviation from the shared custody guidelines, if accompanied by \u201cwritten findings in the order . . . that [their] application . . . would be unjust or inappropriate ... as determined by relevant evidence pertaining to the [statutory] factors.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.2(A). Additionally, no shared custody \u201ccalculation . . . shall. . . create or reduce a support obligation to an amount which seriously impairs the custodial parent\u2019s ability to maintain adequate housing and provide other basic necessities for the child.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.2(G)(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Here, we acknowledge the trial court\u2019s written finding that application of the statutory \u201cshared custody calculations would seriously impair the [wife\u2019s] ability to maintain minimal adequate housing and provide other basic necessities for the child.\u201d However, this justification for guideline departure, standing alone, was conclusory and lacked sufficient detail to satisfy Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>108.1(B) and 108.2(A) and the attendant case law. The statutory considerations which supported the deviation, and their effect on the court\u2019s decision are neither identified nor explained. Thus, the order provided insufficient written support for the result and precluded a meaningful appellate review of the findings and related award.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Benton, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> Code \u00a7 20-108.2(G)(3)(c) specifies those custodial circumstances which require application of the \u201cshared custody rules.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ane\"> [T]he amount of child support to be paid is the difference between the amounts owed by each parent to the other parent, with the parent owing the larger amount paying the difference to the other parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">To compute the monthly amount to be paid by one parent to the other parent, the following calculations shall be made:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">(a) The \u201cbasic child support obligation\u201d of each parent shall be the \u201ctotal shared support\u201d multiplied by the other parent\u2019s \u201ccustody share.\u201d The \u201ctotal shared support\u201d of both parties equals statutory guideline amount determined pursuant to subsection B for the combined income of the parties and the number of shared children multiplied by 1.25. A parent\u2019s \u201ccustody share\u201d equals the number of days that parent has physical custody of a shared child per year divided by the number of days in the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">(b) To each parent\u2019s \u201cbasic child support obligation\u201d shall be added the other parent\u2019s costs of health care coverage, to the extent allowable by subsection E, and the other parent\u2019s work-related child care costs to the extent allowable by subsection F.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">(c) The obligation of each parent to the other shall be then computed by multiplying each parent\u2019s percentage of the parents\u2019 monthly combined gross income by the support obligation obtained in subdivision G 3 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
