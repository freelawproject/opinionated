Cummins</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">By order dated February 22, 1994, the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke denied a permit for Deane L. Cummins to carry a concealed weapon, and Cummins filed a \u201cPetition for Review and Petition for Appeal\u201d with this Court on May 19, 1994. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the petition was not timely filed, and therefore, the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308 prescribes the procedure for obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Subsection D of that statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">Any person denied a permit to carry a concealed weapon under the provisions of this subsection may, within <em>thirty days </em>of the final decision, present a petition for review to the Court of Appeals or any judge thereof. The petition shall be accompanied by a copy of the original papers filed in the circuit court, including a copy of the order of the circuit court denying the permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308(D) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Code \u00a7 17-116.05:1(A) provides that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved party may present a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals from . . . (ii) any final decision of a circuit court on an application for a concealed weapons permit <em>pursuant to subsection D of Code \u00a7 </em>18.2-308.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). However, Rule SAi^a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> directs that a \u201cpetition for appeal\u201d must be filed with this Court \u201cnot more than <em>forty </em>days after the filing of the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>phasis added). Therefore, the appellate procedures prescribed in Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.05:1(A) and 18.2-308(D) appear to conflict with Rule 5A: 12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In the instant case, the trial court rendered the final decision on February 22, 1994, and the record and petition were filed on April 19, 1994 and May 19, 1994, respectively. Thus, if the petition is considered a review pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-308(D), the filing was more than thirty days after the decision and untimely, but, if treated as a \u201cpetition for appeal,\u201d the filing followed the record within forty days and was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Code \u00a7 17-116.05:1(A) identifies those cases over which this Court has jurisdiction through \u201ca petition for appeal,\u201d including circuit court decisions pertaining to concealed weapons permits \u201cpursuant to subsection D of \u00a7 18.2-308.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-308(D) specifically provides for \u201creview\u201d of such decisions by petition filed with this Court within thirty days of final action by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by that plain statement of legislative intent,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meadows, </em>17 Va. App. 624, 626, 440 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1994); and the \u201cgeneral law\u201d of the Commonwealth prevails over the conflicting Rules of the Supreme Court. Va. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 5. Therefore, the petition before the Court was not timely filed in accordance with Code \u00a7 18.2-308(D) and is procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">This issue arises with such regularity that members of the bar may benefit from the publication hereof, and the clerk is so directed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-14\"> Code \u00a7 17-116.05:3 governs the filing of a petition for appeal \u201cin a criminal case\u201d and is not applicable to these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
