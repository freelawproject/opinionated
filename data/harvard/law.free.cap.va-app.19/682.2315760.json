This finding was based, in part, on a certified abstract from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles showing that Honaker had two Virginia convictions and one West Virginia conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court\u2019s finding was also based on a certified abstract of Honaker\u2019s West Virginia DUI conviction which showed that he pled guilty to \u201cdriv[ing] and operating] a motor vehicle upon a public highway of [West Virginia] while under the influence of alcohol, to wit: Rt. 83/9 in the State Line Ridge area of McDowell County in violation of the West Virginia Code, Chapter 17C, Article 5, Section 2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The sole issue in this case is whether the West Virginia DUI law under which appellant was convicted, W. Va. Code \u00a7 17C-5-2, \u201csubstantially conforms\u201d to Virginia\u2019s DUI law, Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-351(3). Honaker cites <em>Commonwealth v. Ayers, </em>17 Va. App. 401, 437 S.E.2d 580 (1993), as authority for his contention that his conviction under the aforementioned section of the West Virginia Code cannot be used as a predicate offense for his habitual offender adjudication. However, <em>Ayers </em>dealt with a conclusive presumption of intoxication under the North Carolina DUI law, which is not a part of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, and merely interpreted <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 328, 411 S.E.2d 444 (1991). We believe <em>Cox </em>is more on point and controls the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In <em>Cox, </em>we held that the trial court erred in finding that a Lewisburg, West Virginia city ordinance substantially conformed to provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because \u201cit permitted] convictions for acts which could not be the basis for convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 411 S.E.2d at 445. We concluded that \u201c[i]f a conviction in another state is based on conduct which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>is not a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266, then to consider it under Code \u00a7 46.2-351 would, without authority, expand the scope of the convictions which could be considered beyond that which the General Assembly specifically authorized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">However, we further explained that our holding did \u201cnot mean that [the other] state\u2019s law . . . must substantially conform in every respect to Code \u00a7 18.2-266.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, in order to adjudicate a defendant an habitual offender based upon a conviction from another state, \u201c[o]nly that prohibition of the other state\u2019s law under <em>which the person was convicted </em>must substantially conform [to Code \u00a7 18.2-266].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>Cox, </em>we were compelled to examine the entire Lewisburg ordinance to see if it permitted convictions not permitted under Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because the record of appellant\u2019s convictions in West Virginia indicated only that he was convicted under a state statute and a city ordinance. The description of appellant\u2019s convictions permitted us to conclude only that the appellant committed the offense while operating a motor vehicle. Consequently, because the Lewisburg city ordinance included several prohibitions against conduct which would not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-266, we were \u201cunable to say that the conduct upon which the appellant\u2019s convictions were based was that which [was] not included within the prohibitions of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>This case is unlike <em>Cox, </em>in that here the record discloses the specific prohibition of the West Virginia law \u2014 driving and operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway in West Virginia while under the influence of alcohol \u2014 under which Honaker was convicted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By finding Honaker guilty of \u201cdriving] and operating] a motor vehicle . . . while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d the offense was necessarily in violation of West Virginia Code \u00a7 17C-5-2(A), rather than (B), (C), (D), or (E). The trial judge, in reviewing West Virginia Code \u00a7 17C-5-2, correctly limited his examination to the applicable provision of that section under which Honaker was convicted. From this examination, he could have concluded that the \u201cconviction in [West Virginia was] based on conduct which is [also] a violation of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-266, . . . [and thus] to consider it under Code \u00a7 46.2-351 would [not] . . . expand the scope of the convictions which could be considered\u201d in making his ruling. <em>Cox, </em>13 Va. App. at 331, 411 S.E.2d at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Upon review of West Virginia Code \u00a7 17C-5-2, we hold that the trial judge did not err in finding that the section under which Honaker was convicted substantially conformed to Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that there are substantial differences between West Virginia Code \u00a7 17C-5-2 and Code \u00a7 18.2-266, we hold that because the prohibition of West Virginia law under which Honaker was convicted substantially conformed to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, it could be used as a predicate offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Honaker\u2019s adjudication as an habitual offender pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-351, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Coleman, J., and Hodges, S.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> The convictions only revealed that appellant \u201cdid unlawfully operate\u201d an automobile \u201cupon a public street or highway . . . and . . . committed] . . . D.U.I. 1st.\u201d It was impossible to say, therefore, which one of the various types of D.U.I. prohibitions appellant violated under Code \u00a7 18-85 of the Lewisburg City Code.
