The trial judge\u2019s rulings unduly restricted the defendant\u2019s ability to present relevant and material evidence in his own defense. Because Oliva proffered evidence that directly pointed to another person as the rapist, and offered other circumstantial evidence that tended to corroborate his more direct proof, we cannot say that the excluded evidence would not have raised a reasonable doubt about the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant as her assailant. Consequently, the error was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse the conviction and remand the case for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">On September 29, 1991, as \u201cit was getting dark,\u201d two men assaulted a woman in a shopping center parking lot in the Reston area of Fairfax County. We will refer to the victim as Jane. One man held Jane on the hood of her car while the other man pulled down her shorts and underpants and raped her. After the incident, the two men fled into a nearby wooded area.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Jane described the man who raped her as Hispanic, <em>51\" </em>tall, medium build, brown hair and eyes, curly hair, wearing a grey or light blue oxford shirt, at least partly unbuttoned, with the sleeves rolled up. With her assistance, a police artist drew a composite sketch of the rapist. The police circulated the drawing at a nearby apartment complex, which was located in the direction that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>rapist had fled and near the rape scene. The maintenance supervisor at the apartments told the police that the composite resembled Leonel Oliva, an occupant of the apartments. A police investigator obtained a photograph of Oliva and on October 4, presented it as part of a photo array to the victim. She immediately identified Oliva\u2019s photograph as being that of the person who had raped her. She had little or no recollection of the other man who had held her because her attention was directed toward the rapist. At trial, she testified and identified the defendant, Leonel Oliva, as the person who had raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On October 4, the police investigator also showed the photographic display to Charles Fields. Fields, who had been working at a service station near the rape scene, had seen a man at the time the rape occurred run from a wooded area toward the same apartment complex where Oliva lived. He could not identify anyone in the photographic array as the person he had seen running. He testified, however, that he would be unable to recognize or identify the man he saw run by the service station. Nevertheless, Fields testified that Leonel Oliva was not the person he had seen running on the night of the rape. Significantly, Fields also testified that the man he saw running was \u201cyoung looking\u201d with short black curly hair, \u201cwearing baggy clothes\u2014a baggy shirt that was buttoned about halfway up,\u201d \u201ca button-up shirt\u201d with \u201crolled-up sleeves.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In his defense, Oliva presented four alibi witnesses who testified that on September 29, 1991, they had been with Oliva at a soccer game in Manassas. They testified that after the game, .they had returned to the Herndon area at \u201calmost\u201d 8:00 p.m., approximately forty-five minutes after the rape had occurred. In addition to the alibi evidence, Oliva subpoenaed Francisco Escobar, another young Hispanic man who also resided in the same apartments. His purpose in doing so was to show that Escobar resembled him, that Escobar also resembled the representation depicted in the composite drawing, that he too lived in the vicinity where the rape had occurred, and that following the rape Escobar had altered his appearance by changing his hair color. Oliva sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>introduce the evidence about Escobar in order to raise a doubt as to whether the victim mistakenly identified Oliva as her assailant. Escobar could not be found and was not present at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">At trial, Oliva proffered into evidence a photograph of Escobar to prove the resemblance between Escobar and himself. The trial judge refused to admit Escobar\u2019s photo. In addition, Oliva proffered testimony from Wilfredo Argumedo, Escobar\u2019s roommate, who would have testified that Escobar had \u201cfrosted\u201d his hair or changed his hair color to blond after September 29, 1991. Oliva also vouched that a person in the management of the apartment complex would testify that he or she had confused Escobar with Leonel Oliva on an earlier occasion. The judge rejected the photograph of Escobar and the related testimony because the photograph had not been \u201ctied to the composite drawing as a foundation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Additional testimony from Charles Fields was proffered and refused by the trial judge. Fields would have testified that the proffered photograph of Escobar \u201clooks similar to the [man] I saw running, because he has the kind of hair that the other guy had. His [referring to Escobar\u2019s] face is slimmer and he\u2019s slimmer than the guy that\u2019s here [referring to the defendant].\u201d The trial judge rejected this testimony, also, because it was not \u201ctied to the composite\u201d drawing and was tied to the photograph, which had not been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The right \u201cto call for evidence in [one\u2019s] favor\u201d is guaranteed by the Virginia Constitution. <em>See </em>Art. I \u00a7 8, Virginia Constitution. <em>See generally Massey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 436, 442, 337 S.E.2d 754, 757-58 (1985); <em>see Cremeans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>104 Va. 860, 52 S.E. 362 (1905). \u201cIn Virginia, evidence that a crime was actually committed by someone other than the accused is admissible for the purpose of generating a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Weller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 886, 890, 434 S.E.2d 330, 333 (1993) (quoting Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia, </em>\u00a7 150 (3d ed. 1988)). Evidence tending to show that someone other than the defendant committed the crime generally raises a factual question for the jury. <em>Rees v. Commonwealth, </em>203 Va. 850, 869, 127 S.E.2d 406, 419 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 964 (1963). A de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>fendant is entitled to present his version of the facts along with that of the prosecution so the jury may decide where the truth lies. <em>Massey, </em>230 Va. at 442, 337 S.E.2d at 757-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The right to present evidence in one\u2019s defense does not, however, permit a defendant to introduce evidence that merely suggests or insinuates that because a third party resembles the accused, the third party <em>may </em>have some connection to the crime. Such evidence is irrelevant; it tends to confuse and mislead a jury unless \u201cevidence [has been] introduced . . . [that] point [s] directly to guilt of a third party.\u201d <em>Weller, </em>16 Va. App. at 890, 434 S.E.2d at 333. Thus, only \u201cwhere there is a trend of facts and circumstances tending clearly to point out some other person as the guilty party, the [defendant] may introduce any legal evidence which is available tending to prove that another person committed the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>Karnes v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 766, 99 S.E. 562, 565 (1919). Therefore, the admissibility of circumstantial evidence tending to prove that a third party committed the crime is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The question before us is not whether Oliva\u2019s proffered evidence was sufficient to prove that a third person committed the rape. Rather, the question is whether \u201cfacts and circumstances tend[ed] clearly to point out some other person as the guilty party,\u201d thereby raising a question for the jury whether reasonable doubt existed of Oliva\u2019s guilt. If the evidence Oliva presented and proffered clearly or directly pointed to Escobar or to another person as the guilty party, the trial judge was required to admit that evidence which was relevant and material, provided that it was otherwise admissible. Thereafter, other \u201ccircumstantial evidence tending to prove the guilt of a third party is to be liberally received.\u201d <em>Weller, </em>16 Va. App. at 890, 434 S.E.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The proffered testimony of Charles Fields is central to whether Oliva presented evidence that pointed \u201cclearly\u201d or \u201cdirectly\u201d to a third party as the person who committed the rape. Jane had described her assailant as having brown curly hair, wearing a grey or light blue oxford shirt, partly unbuttoned and with the sleeves rolled up, and who ran into the woods after assaulting her. At the same time and location, Charles Fields had seen a young man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>with short curly black hair, who ran from the woods, wearing a partly unbuttoned shirt with rolled-up sleeves. Jane\u2019s description of her assailant and Fields\u2019 description of the person he saw running are sufficiently similar that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Fields had seen Jane\u2019s assailant. Although Fields did not see the fleeing person in sufficient detail to be able to identify him, he did sufficiently observe the person\u2019s general characteristics so that when he saw Francisco Escobar\u2019s photo, he responded, \u201c[he] looks similar to the [man] I saw running.\u201d Fields went on to explain that the person in the photo, who was Escobar, had the same type hair as did the person he saw running, \u201chis face is slimmer and he\u2019s slimmer than the guy that\u2019s here,\u201d indicating that the person he saw running was slimmer than Oliva, who more closely resembled the size and appearance of the person depicted in the photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">If the person who Fields saw was the rapist rather than his accomplice, which the jury could have concluded from the similarity in his description and Jane\u2019s description of her rapist, then Fields\u2019 testimony clearly pointed directly to a person other than Oliva as the person who may have committed the rape. Not only did Fields testify that Oliva was not the person he saw running, Fields\u2019 proffered testimony was that the photograph of Francisco Escobar \u201clooks similar\u201d to the person he saw running from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Although the jury heard Charles Fields testify that Oliva was not the person he saw running, Oliva was entitled to have the jury also consider that the person Fields had seen running bore a resemblance in general physical appearance and was dressed almost identically to the person Jane described as her assailant. The jury was entitled to consider Fields\u2019 proffered testimony that the person he saw \u201clooks similar\u201d to the person in the photograph identified as Francisco Escobar. That evidence directly pointed to a third person as the person who may have been the rapist. The proffered photograph of Escobar and the other circumstantial evidence which tended to corroborate Oliva\u2019s claim that another person, perhaps Escobar, committed the crime was also relevant and admissible, provided that it was not inadmissible on other grounds. Accordingly, the trial judge erred by not admitting the evidence from Charles Fields which tended to show that a person other than the defendant committed the crime and that Escobar \u201clooks similar\u201d to the person he saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>In support of that evidence, Oliva was also entitled to show that Francisco Escobar resided in the same apartment complex near where the rape occurred, that based on a properly authenticated photograph of Escobar he \u201clooks similar\u201d to the person Fields saw running, that Escobar altered his appearance on a date after the incident, and that a similarity existed in the appearance between Escobar and Oliva.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Oliva\u2019s conviction and remand the case to the trial court for retrial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Barrow, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> Oliva told police after he had been arrested that on September 29, 1991, he had worn a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up. More importantly, Fields\u2019 description of the person he saw running was strikingly similar to the victim\u2019s description of the clothing worn by the person who raped her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
