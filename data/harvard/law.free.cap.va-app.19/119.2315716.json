Carbaugh contends that because the period of probation had expired when he committed the infraction, the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to revoke the suspended sentence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The record establishes that on June 19, 1981, Carbaugh pleaded guilty to several offenses and was sentenced in the circuit court as follows: (1) one year in prison for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, Code \u00a7 18.2-102, (2) two years in prison for breaking and entering, Code \u00a7 18.2-91, (3) two years in prison for grand larceny, Code \u00a7 18.2-95, and (4) four years in prison for arson, Code \u00a7 18.2-80. The sentencing judge suspended all of the larceny sentence and two years of the arson sentence and sentenced Carbaugh to consecutive terms of imprisonment totalling five years. The sentencing judge also ordered Carbaugh to serve six years probation upon release from prison. The order did not prescribe a period of suspension for either suspended sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>On May 19, 1983, Carbaugh was released from incarceration and began his probation. He was convicted of another grand larceny on October 29, 1985. As a result of that conviction, a judge found that Carbaugh violated his probation conditions and ordered the following on July 31, 1986:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">. . . revokes one (1) year of probation and orders that he serve one (1) additional year of the sentences previously suspended. The court continues the suspension of the remaining three (3) years and nine (9) months sentences for a period of seven (7) years, on the original conditions imposed by this Court on June 16, 1981, and on the additional condition that any criminal offense by the Defendant involving alcohol will be a violation of probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Following his release from incarceration, Carbaugh was arrested in 1992 for driving under the influence of alcohol. On March 15, 1993, the trial judge found that Carbaugh violated the conditions of the previous order and revoked nine months of the sentence previously suspended in the 1981 conviction for grand larceny. In addition, the trial judge continued Carbaugh\u2019s probation upon release from incarceration. Carbaugh appeals from this last revocation order and contends that the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to revoke the suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">After a defendant is convicted, the sentencing judge is given by statute the discretion to \u201csuspend imposition of sentence or suspend the sentence in whole or in part and in addition may place the accused on probation under such conditions as the [judge] shall determine.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303. In addition, another statute provides that \u201c[i]n any case where a [judge] suspends the imposition or execution of a sentence, [the judge] may fix the period of suspension for a reasonable time.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303.1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Furthermore, under Virginia law once a defendant receives a suspended sentence, a judge\u2019s power to revoke the suspension of sentence and probation is governed by statute. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982); <em>Dyke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 478, 479, 69 S.E.2d 483, 484 (1952). Suspension of sentence means \u201ceither delay in the imposition of a sentence for a crime or the staying of execution of the s\u00e9ntence imposed.\u201d <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 802, 808, 109 S.E. 460, 461 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The decision in this case is determined by our interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.2-306, the statute that authorizes revocation of suspension of sentence and revocation of probation, and by our application of that statute to the sentencing and revocation orders in this case. The statute\u2019s first sentence is unwieldy and contains the following one hundred sixty-two words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">The court may, for any cause deemed by it sufficient which occurred at any time within the probation period, or if none, within the period of suspension fixed by the court, or if neither, within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned, revoke the suspension of sentence and any probation, if the defendant be on probation, and cause the defendant to be arrested and brought before the court at any time within one year after the probation period, or if no probation period has been prescribed then within one year after the period of suspension fixed by the court, or if neither a probation period nor a period of suspension has been prescribed then within one year after the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned, whereupon, in case the imposition of sentence has been suspended, the court may pronounce whatever sentence might have been originally imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The language of Code \u00a7 19.2-306 specifies the periods in which the events amounting to cause for revocation must occur in order for a judge to revoke a suspended sentence. The portion of the statute at issue states that \u201c[t]he court may [revoke the suspension of sentence], for any cause deemed by it sufficient which occurred at any time within the probation period, <em>or if none, </em>within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the period of suspension fixed by the court, <em>or if neither, </em>within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Carbaugh reads the words \u201cif none\u201d to refer solely to the term \u201cprobation period\u201d and, by logical extension, the words \u201cif neither\u201d as necessarily referring to both the terms \u201cprobation period\u201d and \u201cperiod of suspension fixed by the court.\u201d Based upon that reading of the statute, Carbaugh argues that the trial judge could have looked to misconduct that occurred during the \u201cperiod of suspension\u201d only if no probation period was specified in the sentencing order. In Carbaugh\u2019s case, the 1981 sentencing order specified a probation period but the acts of misconduct for which the trial judge revoked part of Carbaugh\u2019s suspended sentence did not occur within the probation period. Thus, Carbaugh argues that because his misconduct did not occur during his probation period, the trial judge had no authority to revoke the suspension of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, the courts have a duty to give full force and effect to every word thereof.\u201d <em>Foote v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 61, 65, 396 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1990). \u201cA construction which would . . . enervate, impede and paralyze the administration of the criminal laws of the State should not be adopted unless the legislative intent to produce such a result is clearly indicated.\u201d <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 757, 761, 105 S.E. 531, 532 (1921). Clearly, the legislature intended to grant broad discretion to judges to revoke suspensions of sentences for cause. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 325, 326, 228 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1976). Thus, the statutes \u201cshould be liberally construed to provide trial courts a valuable tool for rehabilitation of criminals.\u201d <em>Grant, </em>223 Va. at 684, 292 S.E.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">An example of a fairly common sentencing scheme demonstrates that Carbaugh\u2019s construction of the statute would produce an absurd result. In a typical case following a conviction, the sentencing judge might suspend part of a sentence, order probation for a specified period, and also specify a period of suspension longer than the period of probation. In that event, if Carbaugh\u2019s interpretation were accepted, a convicted person could engage in misconduct without fear of revocation of the suspended sentence after the period of probation, but before the end of the period of suspension. Carbaugh\u2019s interpretation would not permit a judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>revoke the suspended sentence for misconduct that occurred within the period of suspension because the words, \u201cif none,\u201d in the statute would act as a bar because a period of probation had been prescribed and the misconduct did not occur within that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">No grammatical rule, however, requires that the words, \u201cif none,\u201d in the statute be limited in reference to the term, \u201cprobation period.\u201d Indeed, in order to give effect to the legislative purpose, the words, \u201cif none,\u201d cannot sensibly refer solely to \u201cperiod of probation.\u201d The words, \u201cif none,\u201d may, however, reasonably be read to refer to the clause, \u201cfor any <em>cause </em>deemed by [the judge] sufficient which occurred at any time within the period of probation.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306 (emphasis added). This interpretation is grammatically sound and consistent with the legislative intent to grant judges broad powers to revoke suspended sentences. \u201c \u2018Although penal laws are to be construed strictly, they \u201cought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Willis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (quoting <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-306 empowers a judge to \u201crevoke the suspension of sentence and any probation, if the defendant be on probation\u201d in successively disjunctive situations. The statute expressly states that the judge may revoke suspension of sentence and probation for any sufficient cause that \u201coccurred at any time within the probation period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As stated above, the words, \u201cif none,\u201d relate to the entire clause that precedes them and must be read to refer to <em>\u201ccause . . . </em>which occurred . . . within the probation period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Thus, if no cause arose during the probation period, the judge may also revoke the suspended sentence and probation for any <em>\u201ccause . . . </em>which occurred . . . within the period of suspension fixed by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The words, \u201cif neither,\u201d must then be read to refer both to \u201ccause . . . which occurred . . . within the probation period\u201d and \u201ccause . . . which occurred . . . within the period of suspension fixed by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the express wording of the statute does not explicitly address a judge\u2019s power to revoke suspension and probation when no period of suspension was fixed, that power is implicit because, if the cause arose during a time that was neither within the probation period nor within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>period of suspension (i.e., no period of suspension was expressly prescribed), the judge could revoke the suspended sentence and probation \u201cwithin the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned.\u201d <em>Id. See Grant, </em>223 Va. at 684-86, 292 S.E.2d at 350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">An apparent ambiguity arises in the statute because if literally read, the statute appears to allow a judge to revoke a suspension of sentence if cause arises after the expiration of a prescribed period of suspension if the period of suspension is shorter than the maximum possible sentence. It is apodictic, however, that if the sentencing judge suspends a portion of a sentence and prescribes a period of suspension, once that period of suspension expires the defendant is no longer subject to having the suspension revoked. <em>See id. </em>at 686, 292 S.E.2d at 351. It is also apodictic that a suspension of sentence is effective immediately upon entry of the conviction order that suspends the sentence. <em>See Coffey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 760, 763, 167 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Another apparent ambiguity arises because the portion of the first sentence of Code \u00a7 19.2-306 which limits the time within which the defendant may \u201cbe arrested and brought before the court\u201d addresses successively disjunctive situations in language slightly different than the initial disjunction. Obviously, to effect the legislative intent both disjunctive situations must be read consistently so as to allow the arrest of a defendant within one year after the period of suspension fixed by the court in those cases where both a period of probation and a period of suspension have been prescribed and where the period of probation has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">This detailed analysis of Code \u00a7 19.2-306 is necessary because the first sentence in Code \u00a7 19.2-306 is lengthy and difficult to follow. Although the statute at first glance appears to contain ambiguities, that impression occurs because of the awkwardness of the statute\u2019s first sentence. Upon analysis, the statutory scheme is rational and produces a result that is permissible. In drafting conviction orders, however, sentencing judges must be cognizant that probation and suspension of sentence are separate and distinct concepts and that they may be fixed at different intervals to accomplish different goals. <em>See Grant, </em>223 Va. at 685, 292 S.E.2d at 351. Sentencing orders frequently fail to clarify whether a period of suspension of sentence and a period of probation are fixed for the same or different periods of time, particularly where sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ing orders denominate probation as \u201cunsupervised.\u201d Sentencing judges who intend that a sentence shall be suspended for a fixed period, even where the period of suspension is to expire at the same time as the period of probation, should clearly state the respective period of suspension and period of probation in the sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In summary, the record in this case establishes that when Carbaugh was released from prison in 1983, he began his six year probation period. In addition, because no period of suspension of sentences was fixed, he was subject to having his two year suspended sentence on the grand larceny charge revoked for cause at any time prior to 2001, the twenty year maximum period for which he might have originally been sentenced on the grand larceny charge. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-95. He was also subject to having his two year suspended sentence on the arson charge revoked for cause at any time prior to 1991, the ten year maximum period for which he might have originally been sentenced on the arson charge. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">When Carbaugh was arrested in 1992 for driving under the influence of alcohol, he was still within the maximum period for which he might have been sentenced on the grand larceny charge. Thus, the trial judge did not exceed his authority when, in 1993, he revoked an additional nine months of the suspended sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Baker, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-11\"> The sentencing order states in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">[T]he Court hereby finds [Carbaugh] guilty of each offense and sentences him as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">. . . Unauthorized Use of a motor vehicle - one (1) year in the State Penitentiary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-14\">. . . Statutory Burglary - two (2) years in the State Penitentiary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-15\">. . . Grand Larceny - two (2) years in the State Penitentiary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-16\">. . . Arson - four (4) years in the State Penitentiary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">The Court further orders [Carbaugh] to pay the costs of each prosecution and orders each said sentence to run consecutively to and not concurrently with each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>other. For good cause shown, the entire sentence imposed [for grand larceny] and two (2) years of the sentence imposed [for arson] are suspended and [Carbaugh] is placed on probation for a period of six (6) years from the date he is released from service of that portion of the sentences not suspended, on the conditions that [Carbaugh] violate no criminal laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other jurisdiction, maintain gainful employment, support legal dependents, if any, make payment of Court costs imposed and restitution to each victim in an amount to be fixed at a later date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
