Goldin, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a personal injury case involving a motor vehicle accident. The alleged tortfeasor died subsequent to the injury-causing accident. The plaintiffs were unaware of the decedent's death and commenced this suit naming him as a defendant. Some months later, after learning of the decedent's death, the plaintiffs sought the appointment of an administrator ad litem in the Probate Court and amended their complaint naming the administrator ad litem as a party as required by the survival statute. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the plaintiffs' complaint was not properly filed until after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The trial court agreed and granted the defendant's motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs timely appealed. Having concluded that the plaintiffs did not properly commence their lawsuit within the time afforded by the applicable statute of limitations, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal arises from the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss, based upon its conclusion that the one-year statute of limitations in this personal injury case expired before the suit was properly commenced against the decedent/alleged tortfeasor's personal representative. The underlying facts are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 2, 2015, Julia Putnam and Bryane Litsinberger were involved in a motor vehicle accident, allegedly caused by the negligence of Mr. Litsinberger. On January 4, 2016, Mr. Litsinberger died. On February 2, 2016, unaware of Mr. Litsinberger's\n   death, Ms. Putnam and her husband Charles Putnam (together, \"Appellants\") filed a Complaint against Mr. Litsinberger in connection with the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Several months after filing their original Complaint, Appellants became aware that Mr. Litsinberger had died prior to the date of the filing of the Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After learning of the death and that no estate had been opened for Mr. Litsinberger, Appellants petitioned the probate court to appoint an administrator ad litem to receive process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 21, 2016, the probate court appointed attorney John W. Leach as administrator ad litem for the estate of Mr. Litsinberger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 31, 2016, the Appellants filed an \"Amended Complaint\" naming John W. Leach, administrator ad litem of the estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger (\"Appellee,\" or \"Defendant\") as the defendant. On December 13, 2016, the \"Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\" was filed by the Estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 12.02(6), averring that the action was not properly commenced within the applicable statute of limitations period. On February 7, 2017, Appellants filed their response opposing Appellee's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a hearing, by order of March 10, 2017, the trial court granted the Appellee's motion to dismiss. The trial court explained its reasoning as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he Court finds that Bryane R. Litsinberger died prior to Plaintiffs filing suit, and the Plaintiffs failed to file suit against the Administrator Ad Litem of The Estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger within the time prescribed by Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7\u00a7 28-1-110 and 20-5-103. The Court found that pursuant to [Tennessee Code Annotated] \u00a7 28-1-110, the one-year statute of limitations applicable to this suit was tolled for a period of six months following the death of Bryane R. Litsinberger. Following the six month tolling period, the statute of limitations recommenced, and Plaintiffs failed to file suit against the Administrator Ad Litem of The Estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellants raise the following issues for our review, which we restate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

A trial court should grant a motion to dismiss only when it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief. The determination of whether the facts, as set forth in the complaint, constitute a cause of action presents a question of law, and, accordingly, our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   with no presumption of correctness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318918\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/353/734/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7318918\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/353/734/\">\n    at 736-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether or not the trial court properly applied Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 20-5-103, commonly referred to as the survival statute, in conjunction with the one-year statute of limitations applicable in this personal injury case, and Tennessee Code Annotated Section 28-1-110, in concluding that Appellants failed to timely commence this suit against the deceased tortfeasor's personal representative. Appellants argue that the one-year statute of limitations period did not begin to run until Appellants had actual notice of Mr. Litsinberger's death on July 18, 2016, when they reviewed the note on the returned summons. Appellants rely on the discovery rule to support their position. As discussed in detail below, we conclude that Appellants' application of the discovery rule and understanding of the survival statute are in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For clarity purposes, we will begin with a brief background discussion of the \"discovery rule,\" and its inapplicability to the facts of this case. We follow with an analysis of the survival statute as it applies in conjunction with the statute of limitations and Tennessee Code Annotated Section 28-1-110 in this case. Ultimately, we agree with the trial court that Appellants failed to timely commence this action and dismiss this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I. DISCOVERY RULE AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellants commenced this action for personal injuries allegedly caused by the negligence of Mr. Litsinberger as a result of a motor vehicle accident, which occurred on February 2, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants argue\n   that the trial court erred in dismissing their suit based upon the statute of limitations. Specifically, Appellants contend, based on their interpretation of the \"discovery rule,\" that the one-year statute of limitations period for personal injury did not commence until Appellants had actual notice of Mr. Litsinberger's death; although, the accident that allegedly caused Ms. Putnam's injuries undisputedly occurred on February 2, 2015. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In Tennessee, the statute of limitations requires a plaintiff to file a claim for personal injuries within one year of the accrual of the cause of action.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-3-104\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the so-called \"discovery rule\" acts to protect a plaintiff suffering from latent injuries by delaying the commencement of the statute of limitations period until the plaintiff knows, or reasonably should know, enough information concerning his or her injuries to bring a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teeters v. Currey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10129663\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/518/512/#p517\">\n    518 S.W.2d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (Tenn. 1974).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, under the discovery rule, an action does not \"accrue,\" thereby commencing the running of the statutory period for filing a claim, until \"the injury occurs or is discovered, or when in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, it should have been discovered.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mills v. Booth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320042\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/344/922/#p927\">\n    344 S.W.3d 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 927 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2010). The Tennessee Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A cause of action in tort does not accrue until a judicial remedy is available. A judicial remedy is available when (1) a breach of a legally recognized duty owed to plaintiff by defendant (2) causes plaintiff legally cognizable damage. A breach of a legally cognizable duty occurs when plaintiff discovers or 'reasonably should have discovered, (1) the occasion, the manner and means by which a breach of duty occurred that produced ... the injury; and (2) the identity of the defendant who breached the duty.' ... It is not required that the plaintiff actually know that the injury constitutes a breach of the appropriate legal standard in order to discover that he has a right of action;\n   <strong>\n    the plaintiff is deemed to have discovered the right of action if he is aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

In October 1975, a dentist with serum hepatitis infected his patient by negligently allowing his blood to intermingle with the patient's blood during a dental procedure.\n   <em>\n    Foster v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9935668\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/304/#p304\">\n    633 S.W.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (Tenn. 1982). In January 1976, the patient was diagnosed with serum hepatitis, but was unaware of the source of the infection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9935668\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/304/#p304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In July 1976, the patient returned to his dentist's office and was informed that his dentist was likely the source of the infection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9935668\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/304/#p304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The complaint was filed on February 11, 1977, but the trial court dismissed the complaint having concluded that the statute of limitations began when the patient became infected during the dental procedure in October 1975.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9935668\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/304/#p304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tennessee Supreme Court applied the discovery rule in concluding that the injury \"accrued,\" thus commencing the statute of limitations, in July 1976. The Court stated its reasoning as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, neither the injury nor the tortfeasor who perpetrated the injury were discovered until July 21, 1976. All that plaintiff discovered in January was the name of the disease. That discovery did not reveal that he contracted it through a negligent act or who the tortfeasor might be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9935668\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/633/304/#p304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Foster v. Harris\n   </em>\n   , Appellants in this case were fully aware of the nature and cause of Ms. Putnam's injuries on the date of the accident. All of the facts relevant to the commencement of the running of the statute of limitations were known on February 2, 2015. These known facts, among other things, include that there was an accident involving Ms. Putnam and Mr. Litsinberger on Austin Peay Highway in Memphis when Mr. Litsinberger crossed the center line and struck Ms. Putnam's vehicle. In the Complaint, Appellants aver that Ms. Putnam was injured because of the accident, and Mr. Litsinberger violated several traffic laws in causing the accident. Appellants were aware of the necessary facts to file a complaint against Mr. Litsinberger on the date of the accident. Because Appellants were aware of facts sufficient to put them on notice that Ms. Putnam suffered an injury as a result of Mr. Litsinberger's conduct, the statute of limitations commenced on February 2, 2015. The discovery rule is not applicable to the facts of this case to delay the commencement of the statute of limitations until July 18, 2016, when Appellants determined Mr. Litsinberger had passed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE SURVIVAL STATUTE, TENNESSEE CODE ANNOTATED SECTION 28-1-110, AND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellants filed their Complaint against Mr. Litsinberger on February 2, 2016, within one year of the date of the motor vehicle accident that gave rise to Appellants' claims. However, Mr. Litsinberger died on January 4, 2016. We now turn briefly to explain the survival statute and its application in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under the common law, when a tortfeasor died before suit was instituted against him or her, the cause of action abated, and an injured plaintiff was unable to recover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-5-103\">\n    Tenn.

However, the survival statute, also referred to as the anti-abatement statute, now provides a remedy and specific steps to be followed by an injured plaintiff to pursue a claim against a deceased tortfeasor.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-5-103\">\n    Tenn.

Ct. App. Oct. 14, 1997). Under the common law, Appellants' causes of action against Mr. Litsinberger would have abated with his death, leaving Appellants with no remedy for injuries the decedent may have caused in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-5-103\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-5-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because of the survival statute, Appellants' claims did not abate with Mr. Litsinberger's death; however, the survival statute provided the exclusive means by which Appellants could pursue their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-5-103\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 20-5-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When Mr. Litsinberger died on January 4, 2016, the survival statute in conjunction with Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 28-1-110 paused the statute of limitations period twenty-nine days before the period would have expired had Mr. Litsinberger not passed away. However, the statutes did not pause the statute of limitations indefinitely on the date of Mr. Litsinberger's death, i.e., January 4, 2016. The statutes tolled the statute of limitations only until either (1) a personal representative was appointed for Mr. Litsinberger or (2) six months passed from the date of Mr. Litsinberger's death (i.e. January 4, 2016).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-1-110\">\n    Tenn.

Because no personal representative was appointed during the six month period following Mr. Litsinberger's death, on July 4, 2016, the statute of limitations recommenced. On July 4, 2016, twenty-nine days remained within the statutory period for Appellants to commence their suit in compliance with the survival statute before the statute of limitations expired. On August 2, 2016, this period ran before Appellants commenced this action against the personal representative of the deceased tortfeasor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Appellants' claims are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellants have put forth various legal theories in an attempt to convince the Court that their claims are not barred. Appellants have acknowledged that on February 26, 2016, Appellants' attorney's process server returned the original summons with a note stating that Mr. Litsinberger was deceased. However, Appellants\n   argue that the note was not drawn to the attention of Appellants' attorney until July 18, 2016, when Ms. Putnam contacted her attorney's office to inquire about the status of her case. Although on July 18, 2016, fifteen days remained for Appellants to timely commence their suit in compliance with the survival statute, Appellants failed to do so. Instead, Appellants waited until October 21, 2016, to petition the probate court to appoint an administrator ad litem, and did not file the \"Amended Complaint\" until October 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Appellants argue that the statute of limitations did not expire on August 2, 2016, because they did not \"discover\" Mr. Litsinberger's death until July 18, 2016. Therefore, they argue that \"the discovery rule tolled both the one-year period provided in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 28-3-104 and the six-month period set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 28-1-110 until Plaintiffs discovered that Bryane R. Litsinberger had died.\" Appellants' application of the discovery rule in this way is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As discussed above, the discovery rule protects plaintiffs who suffer latent injuries by preventing the statute of limitations from commencing until the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that he or she has suffered an injury caused by the negligence of another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11806380\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/979/583/\">\n    979 S.W.2d at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he plaintiff is deemed to have discovered the right of action if he is aware of facts sufficient to put a reasonable person on notice that he has suffered an injury as a result of wrongful conduct.\"). The alleged injuries caused by Mr. Litsinberger undisputedly occurred on February 2, 2015. Appellants were fully aware of Mr. Litsinberger's identity and possible negligence. Thus, the statute of limitations period for claims arising out of his negligence commenced on February 2, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The survival statute does not create a new cause of action-it merely prevents an injured plaintiff's claim from abating by providing a remedy and means to pursue a claim against a tortfeasor who dies before the plaintiff has filed suit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Liput v. Grinder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092936\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/405/664/#p672\">\n    405 S.W.3d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2013) (\"Operation of the [s]urvival [s]tatute, however, does not create a new and independent cause of action, but merely preserves the cause of action that belonged to the person before the one who caused the injury died.\") No new cause of action \"arose\" on July 18, 2016, extending the statutory period for filing Appellants' claim simply because Appellants failed to realize Mr. Litsinberger had died until that date. We agree with the trial court that Appellants' failure to comply with the survival statute by appropriately commencing this case until after the expiration of the statute of limitations bars their recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Appellants additionally argue that the motion to dismiss should not have been granted because Appellee does not have standing due to Appellee's attorney styling the motion to dismiss in the name of \"The Estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger\" rather than in the name of \"John W. Leach administrator ad litem of the Estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger.\" As a general matter, an \"Estate\" is not a legal entity.\n   <em>\n    McLean v. Chanabery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8509860\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tenn-app/5/276/\">\n    5 Tenn. App. 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1926). Accordingly, the motion to dismiss should have been styled in the name of \"John W. Leach administrator ad litem of the Estate of Bryane R. Litsinberger.\" However, this technical deficiency will not save Appellants from the consequences of failing to commence this suit within the applicable statute of limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The judgment of the trial court dismissing this case is affirmed.

On February 2, 2015, Ms. Putnam and Mr. Litsinberger had a motor vehicle accident allegedly caused by Mr. Litsinberger's negligence. On January 4, 2016, Mr. Litsinberger died. On February 2, 2016, Appellants filed their complaint and issued a summons naming Mr. Litsinberger as a party. On February 26, 2016, the summons was returned to Appellants' attorney with a note from Appellants' process server stating that Mr. Litsinberger had died. On July 18, 2016, Ms. Putnam contacted her attorney's office, prompting her attorney's paralegal to discover that the summons had been returned with the above note stating that Mr. Litsinberger had passed away. On October 21, 2016, Appellants petitioned the probate court to appoint a personal representative for Mr. Litsinberger's estate. On October 31, 2016, Appellants filed an amended complaint naming the personal representative as the defendant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In 1974, in\n    <em>\n     Teeters v.

The accident occurred on February 2, 2015. A plaintiff bringing a personal injury claim must bring said claim within one year from the date when the injury accrued. Therefore, the one year within which the Appellants were required to file their complaint ended at the end of the same day of the following year, i.e., February 2, 2016.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Coleman v.

When Mr. Litsinberger died, 336 days had passed since the accident; therefore, twenty-nine (29) days remained before the one-year statute of limitations would have expired on February 2, 2016. Six months after January 4, 2016, the statute of limitations began to run again. So on July 4, 2016, the statutory period began to run again, leaving Appellants twenty-nine (29) days to timely commence their suit against the personal representative of Mr. Litsinberger. Twenty-nine (29) days from July 4, 2016 was Tuesday, August 2, 2016. Therefore, the statute of limitation expired on August 2, 2016.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
