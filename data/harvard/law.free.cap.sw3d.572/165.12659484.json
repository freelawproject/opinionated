He brings three points on appeal, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, the circuit court's denial of his request for a mistrial based on prosecutorial comments during closing argument, and the court's limitation on\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questions. For reasons fully explained in a Memorandum provided to the parties, we find no error and affirm the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED. Rule 30.25(b)\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
