App. LEXIS 8586 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Oct. 18, 2018, orig. proceeding) (Order) (per curiam), we withdraw our opinion and judgment of August 10, 2018, and substitute the following in its place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On July 25, 2018, relator Christopher Dennis, District Attorney for the 286th Judicial District of Hockley County, filed a petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN . \u00a7 22.221 (West Supp. 2018); TEX. R. APP. P. 52. By his petition, Dennis asks this Court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the Honorable Pat Phelan, presiding judge of the 286th District Court of Hockley County, to withdraw his July 2 and August 15 orders disqualifying the District Attorney's Office from prosecuting thirteen causes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a writ of prohibition preventing\n   the trial court from disqualifying the District Attorney's Office in the future absent good cause shown. We conditionally grant Dennis's petition for writ of mandamus and deny Dennis's petition for writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dennis and the attorney for the real parties in interest, Christina Woods Duffy, engaged in an apparently contentious exchange relating to Duffy's motion to exclude expert witnesses in an unrelated case in which Dennis represented the State and Duffy represented the defendant. On June 4, 2018, Dennis sent Duffy a text message withdrawing any existing plea offers on all pending cases for which she was the attorney of record. By letters of the same date, Dennis notified Duffy that \"[t]here will be no offer at this time\" apparently as to two of her pending cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Duffy subsequently filed a motion to disqualify the 286th District Attorney's Office in each of the cases in which the plea offers were potentially withdrawn. Shortly after holding a hearing on Duffy's motion to disqualify, Judge Phelan issued an order declaring the District Attorney's Office disqualified and appointing a special prosecutor in seven of the cases. Judge Phelan did not rule on the motions to disqualify filed in six other cases. On August 15, Judge Phelan heard argument in these remaining cases and, after hearing arguments, granted these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to these disqualification orders, Dennis filed his petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition. On August 10, this Court issued our opinion denying Dennis's petition on the basis that he failed to meet his burden to show that he was entitled to relief because he did not comply with the documentation requirements identified in Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 52.3 and 52.7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tex.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-18-00265-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203827285\">\n    2018 WL 3827285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2018 Tex. App. LEXIS 6315 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Aug. 10, 2018, orig. proceeding). On August 25, Dennis filed the instant motion for rehearing, which, when coupled with the petition, complies with the requirements applicable to Dennis's requests for mandamus and prohibition relief. We requested a response from Duffy, which she filed on September 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Law and Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In criminal cases, \"mandamus relief is appropriate only when a relator establishes (1) that he has no adequate remedy at law to redress his alleged harm, and (2) that what he seeks to compel is a ministerial act, not a discretionary or judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6861822\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/462/47/#p49\">\n    462 S.W.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (Tex.

Thus, appellant fails to show any conflict which this Court has previously found as grounds for disqualification.\").

He also made like statements under oath and in open court. Further, no assertion has been raised that Dennis has a financial stake in the prosecution of any of the defendants, is a material fact witness in any of the cases for which disqualification is being sought,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or is the victim of any of the crimes alleged in these cases. As such, we cannot conclude that a conflict of interest exists between Dennis and any of the defendants for whom disqualification has been sought.

Duffy has not presented evidence that any of the defendants had pending plea offers that were withdrawn by Dennis's June 4 text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, evidence was presented that Dennis never intended any\n   withdrawal of plea offers to be permanent. In fact, his intent was proven by his making of a plea offer to one of Duffy's clients on July 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We cannot conclude that the temporary withdrawal of plea bargain offers, even if the withdrawal is based on the identity of the attorney, constitutes a conflict of interest that rises to the level of a due process violation. Certainly, our conclusion might be different had Duffy proven that Dennis had taken action consistent with the permanent withdrawal of plea bargain offers to all of her clients. But, such is not what is shown by the evidence in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   What Duffy invites us to do is to conclude that the temporary withdrawal of plea bargain offers coupled with some alleged ill-will between the district attorney and defense counsel constitutes a conflict of interest that rises to the level of a due process violation.

Soon after this Court issued its denial of Dennis's petition, the trial court issued its August 15 order disqualifying the District Attorney's Office from those remaining six cases. By his motion for rehearing, Dennis prays that this Court issue writ of mandamus ordering the trial court to withdraw its July 2 and August 15 orders disqualifying the District Attorney's Office from prosecuting all thirteen causes, and a writ of prohibition preventing the trial court from disqualifying the District Attorney's Office in the future absent good cause shown. Because Dennis's petition addressed the possibility that the trial court would disqualify the District Attorney's Office in the six cases that were then pending and because Dennis's motion for rehearing requests mandamus relief as to orders in all thirteen cases, we will deem the petition to request mandamus relief as to all thirteen cases addressed in the petition in which Dennis and the District Attorney's Office have been disqualified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    We do note that district attorneys are statutorily disqualified from representation that is adverse to the State and where the district attorney is the subject of a criminal investigation by a law enforcement agency that is based on credible evidence of criminal misconduct that is within the attorney's authority to prosecute.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.

The State argues that the authority is limited to situations involving prior representation by the prosecutor. No doubt, precedent has held that a district attorney may be disqualified for engaging in a conflict of\n   interest. The conflicts alluded to normally encompass those arising when the prosecutor previously represented the accused in the same matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landers v.

App. 2008). Prior representation of the accused in a different matter may also be a conflict of interest warranting disqualification if the circumstance denies the accused due process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8213977\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/295/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8213977\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/295/#p303\">\n    at 304-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But, the Court of Criminal Appeals left open the likelihood of disqualification in at least one other scenario.

The record at bar contains evidence upon\n   which the trial court could have found that pivotal \"axe to grind.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court disqualified the prosecutor, Christopher Dennis and the 286th District Attorney's office, from prosecuting the actions wherein Christina Woods Duffy represented the accused upon finding that Dennis had a conflict of interest that rose to the level of a due process violation. The conflict was personal and found its genesis, according to the trial court, when Duffy successfully urged a motion to exclude a State's expert witness on behalf of one of her clients. That led the district attorney to text Duffy via cell phone that \"any pending cases\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     you\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   have with offers outstanding ... those offers are revoked, expired, and null. Effective immediately.\" (Emphasis added). The prosecutor followed this announcement with at least two other writings wherein he again told Duffy that \"there would be no offer at this time.\" When asked by the trial court whether he was retaliating against Duffy because she succeeded in having an expert excluded, the district attorney described his decision \"as a strategy.\" He also told the trial court that what he did \"as a matter of strategy,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     as a reaction to something that another counsel does\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , is well within, not just my right as prosecutor, but is within my responsibility as prosecutor.\" (Emphasis added). He continued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   If I have 20 lawyers opposing me, and 19 of them behave in a certain fashion, and we get along in a certain way, and things go swimmingly, shall we say, and I treat them one way; but, one acts differently and things go differently, and things work differently, it is not prosecutorial [vindictiveness] for me to change my strategy in dealing with the one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on Duffy successfully urging a motion to exclude on behalf of her client, the prosecutor thought a change of strategy was needed. So, he \"appraised what happened in that hearing, and ... decided that the best thing for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     my office\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to do at that moment was to halt proceedings in those cases,\" \"those cases\" being \"every case that [he] had with [Duffy].\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district attorney also informed the trial court that he had used this strategy with two other defense attorneys. Subsequent evidence obtained via affidavit and hearings led the trial court to conclude that Dennis's utterance about using the strategy before was a \"misrepresentation.\" So too did it deem the prosecutor's action to be a violation of the constitutional right to equal protection enjoyed by both Duffy and her clients, which violation arose from Duffy \"exercising protected legal rights of\" her clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This is not a plea bargain case or one purporting to recognize a right to a plea bargain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A defendant has no right to demand that the State offer him such an agreement.\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

She could 1) withdraw with the hope that Dennis then would deign to treat her ex-clients in the same manner he treated defendants in general, 2) remain counsel with the understanding that the district attorney intended to treat her clients differently because she represented them, or 3) remain counsel and opt to give her clients a level of representation deemed acceptable to the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As the district attorney said, \"If I have 20 lawyers opposing me, and 19 of them behave in a certain fashion, and we get along in a certain way, and things go swimmingly ... and I treat them one way; but, one acts differently and things go differently, and things work differently.\" This comment suggests a general mode of practice focused not necessarily on justice and the purportedly criminal acts of the accused and their impact on the victims and society. Rather, it connotes a focus on the identities of defense counsel, the manner in which defense counsel chose to fulfill their duties to their clients, and their relationships with the prosecutor. If the prosecutor finds the relationships acceptable, their clients receive one measure of treatment, such as a plea offer. If the prosecutor dislikes the relationships with other counsel, their clients receive different treatment, such as no plea offer. This runs contrary to the prosecutor's obligation to do justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 2.01 (West 2005) (stating, among other things, that \"[i]t shall be the primary duty of all prosecuting attorneys, including any special prosecutors, not to convict, but to see that justice is done\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Indeed, implicit in the presumption that prosecutors undertake a criminal prosecution in good faith and in a non-discriminatory fashion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gawlik v.

App. LEXIS 10338 (Tex. App.-Austin Oct. 7, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication). And, while it may be that a prosecutor has great discretion in deciding to whom to offer a plea bargain, I found no authority permitting that discretion to be exercised based upon defense\n   counsel's desire to effectively represent his or her clients as mandated by the United States Constitution. Nor did the State cite me to any such authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Nor did the State cite me to authority insinuating that the extension of plea bargains may lawfully be founded upon whether the prosecutor deems personally acceptable an opposing counsel's successful advocacy of a legal position on behalf of her client. Again, the dispute between the district attorney and Duffy arose from the latter's winning effort to exclude the testimony of a State's expert witness. He simply found her successful advocacy for her client's interests unpalatable. So, an obviously intentional decision was made to strike at her through all her clients by withdrawing all plea offers previously extended to them. This evinces a mode of discriminatory prosecution dictated by personal grudge. It illustrates nothing short of retaliation based upon the defendant obtaining a favorable legal ruling, and authority certainly tells us that due process forbids the State from retaliating for a defendant's exercise of a constitutional right, such as the right to reasonably effective counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

He ground that axe in a retaliatory way which transgressed due process, in my opinion. The circumstances remind me of a tenet learned years ago and involving this State's concept of employment at will: an employer can generally terminate an employee with reason or for no reason, but he cannot do so for an impermissible reason. The district attorney was free to extend and withdraw plea bargains at his discretion, but he must be prohibited from doing so for impermissible reasons. So, the trial court correctly determined that the district attorney at bar operated under a conflict of interest implicating due process when it came to withdrawing plea offers from Duffy's clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Yet, I am left concerned by the evidence, or lack thereof, indicating prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Reposa\n   </em>\n   and its predecessors link due process and prejudice together. As the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Reposa\n   </em>\n   court said, the party seeking to disqualify the prosecutor \"must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest existed\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     which prejudiced\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [the applicant] in such a manner as to rise to the level of a due-process violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reposa\n   </em>\n   , 2009 Tex. Crim. App. Unpub. LEXIS 725, at *32. Maybe the court is saying that, without prejudice, there is no due process violation. Maybe it is saying that the due process violation (e.g., prosecutorial retaliation for exercising constitutional rights) must be prejudicial. Yet, under either interpretation, the existence of prejudice is necessary. If the defendant is not prejudiced by the circumstances, then the prosecutor cannot be disqualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, evidence illustrates that the district attorney withdrew outstanding plea offers to all of Duffy's clients. And, though there exists evidence that there may have been more than one offer outstanding at the time, the record fails to show to whom they were extended or how many defendants were extended an offer. Nor does it show that the defendant being prosecuted in the case that instigated the row between Dennis and Duffy had been offered a plea bargain. To that I add evidence illustrating the prosecutor quickly changed the tone of his prior text message about plea offers. He did that through a letter sent on the\n   same day wherein he told Duffy that offers would not be forthcoming \"at this time.\" So too did he later extend an offer to at least one of her clients. Whether there were more, we do not know. Whether that offer was extended to a defendant who had previously been extended an offer, we do not know. Nevertheless, evidence filling those gaps was undoubtedly available to Duffy since the offer or offers were undoubtedly extended to her clients through her, and it was her burden, as representative of her clients, to proffer it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Simply put, the evidentiary scenario brings to mind the adage \"actions speak louder than words.\" Dennis intended to retaliate when initially texting Duffy about withdrawing plea offers. Nonetheless, his actions illustrate backpedaling from that intent. He apparently opened the door to plea negotiations and even extended an offer to a client of Duffy. This uncontradicted evidence leads me to conclude that the prejudice needed to allow disqualification presents itself as a possibility as opposed to an actuality. So, to the extent precedent requires evidence of actual prejudice, I cannot say Duffy satisfied the burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Consequently, I concur with Justice Pirtle to the extent he concluded there existed a conflict of interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I concur with Justice Parker to the extent she concluded the evidence of actual prejudice was deficient. Thus, I would reverse the trial court's order disqualifying Christopher Dennis from prosecuting the proceedings listed in the opening paragraph of this opinion. Yet, I do so with the caveat that anger and impulse runs among us all; to control them is not easy but necessary to effectively serve the elected office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION ON REHEARING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Patrick A.

GOV'T CODE ANN . \u00a7 22.221 (West Supp. 2018); TEX. R. APP. P. 52. By that petition, Dennis asked this court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the Honorable Pat Phelan, presiding judge of the 286th District Court of Hockley County, to withdraw his July 2 and August 15 orders disqualifying the Hockley County District Attorney's Office from prosecuting thirteen cases,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a writ of prohibition preventing the trial court from disqualifying that office in the future absent good cause shown. Because I would deny Dennis's petition seeking mandamus relief, as well as his petition for writ of prohibition, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dennis and the attorney for the real parties in interest, Christina Woods Duffy, engaged in an apparently contentious exchange relating to Duffy's motion to exclude expert witnesses in an unrelated case in which Dennis represented the State and Duffy represented the defendant. After the trial court ruled in favor of Duffy's client, thereby excluding Dennis's expert witnesses, on June 4, 2018, Dennis sent Duffy a text message withdrawing any existing plea offers on all pending cases for which she was the attorney of record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By letters of the same date, Dennis further notified Duffy that \"[t]here will be no offer at this time\" apparently as to each of her pending cases, regardless of whether there had been a prior plea bargain offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Duffy subsequently filed a motion to disqualify Dennis in those cases in which she was attorney of record. As a basis for the requested disqualification, Duffy alleged the policy adopted by Dennis violated her client's federal and Texas constitutional rights of due process, effective assistance of counsel, and equal protection. She further alleged that the policy amounted to prosecutorial vindictiveness as to any person represented by her. By her prayer, Duffy sought dismissal of the prosecution or, in the alternative, the disqualification of the 286th District Attorney's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Shortly after holding a hearing on Duffy's motion to disqualify, on July 2, 2018, Judge Phelan issued an order declaring the District Attorney's Office disqualified and appointing a special prosecutor in the original seven cases. Judge Phelan did not rule on the remaining motions to disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In response to the seven original disqualification orders, Dennis filed his petition seeking the issuance of writs of mandamus and prohibition. On August 10, this court issued our opinion denying Dennis's petition on the basis that he failed to meet his burden of showing that he was entitled to relief because he did not comply with the documentation requirements identified in Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure 52.3 and 52.7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tex.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-18-00265-CV, 2018 Tex. App. LEXIS 6315 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Aug. 10, 2018, orig. proceeding). On August 15, Judge Phelan heard argument in the remaining six cases and, thereafter, granted those motions. On August 25, Dennis filed the instant motion for rehearing, which, when coupled with the original petition, complies with the procedural requirements applicable to his requests for mandamus and prohibition relief. At that time, we requested a response from Duffy, which she filed on September 6. We also requested oral arguments to flesh out the respective positions of the parties. Duffy appeared in person and presented her arguments. Dennis sent an assistant district attorney to present his position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   LEGAL STANDARDS AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In criminal cases, \"mandamus relief is appropriate only when a relator establishes (1) that he has no adequate remedy at law to redress his alleged harm and (2) that what he seeks to compel is a ministerial act, not a discretionary or judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6861822\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/462/47/#p49\">\n    462 S.W.3d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (Tex.

In that regard, a personal interest that is inconsistent with that duty to see that justice is done is a conflict that could potentially violate a defendant's fundamental due process rights. In the context\n   of the criminal cases impacted by Dennis's mandate, it is not the deprivation of a plea bargain that is of constitutional dimension-for a defendant has no constitutional right to a plea bargain. Instead, it is the systematic and intentional discrimination against a particular attorney that effectively deprives an accused person represented by that particular attorney of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the cases at issue, it is clear that Dennis has a \"conflict of interest\"-and it is personal. Dennis has unequivocally established that he has a personal vendetta against Duffy and his dislike of her is going to be taken out against her clients. Because Duffy stands\n   <em>\n    in pari locus\n   </em>\n   to her client and because she is for all intents and purposes the stand-in or representative of the defendant, vindictive acts directed at Duffy are acts directed at her clients. By striking at Duffy, Dennis was simultaneously striking at her clients and I find that conflict of interest rises to the level of a due process violation because it effectively denies each of Duffy's clients the right to effective assistance of counsel and due process of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Ligon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092044\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/408/888/#p896\">\n    408 S.W.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a \"due process violation occurs where the prosecutor's personal interest generates a structural conflict that presents a potential for misconduct deemed intolerable\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Guerra,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8367664\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/235/392/#p415\">\n    235 S.W.3d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415 (Tex.

Justice Parker holds the trial court had but \"one rational decision\" and that decision was to allow Dennis to continue his vindictive ways. I passionately disagree. Chief Justice Quinn, while condemning Dennis's conduct, nevertheless concludes that the trial court erred in granting Duffy's motion to disqualify because she failed to meet her burden of showing that her clients were actually prejudiced by his actions. In response, I can only say that Duffy did establish an abridgement of her clients' constitutional due process rights and that is enough. Proof of harm-proof of how that abridgement actually affected the ultimate outcome of any individual case is something akin to the thought experiment known as \"Schrodinger's cat,\" where the result of an experiment cannot be known until the experiment itself has been conducted-an unfortunate result that might be too late if one is the object of that experiment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As such, I would conclude that (1) a conflict of interest exists between Dennis and the defendants seeking his disqualification, (2) which conflict rises to the level of a due process violation, and that (3) it is the very existence of that conflict which prejudices those defendants. Consequently, I would find that Judge Phelan's order of disqualification does not violate well-settled legal principles, and Dennis has not shown a clear right to mandamus relief. Accordingly, the relief requested should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    I am aware of the directive that unpublished opinions of the Court of Criminal Appeals should not be cited as precedent.

Truly, just as one may not know if the box hides a living or dead cat until the box is opened (assuming of course it is not shaken first), one cannot know if he has encountered harm until that harm is experienced. Nonetheless, our jurisprudence seems to have little use for Schrodinger or his cat given that prejudice and harm are elemental to many legal concepts. For instance, without prejudice, counsel's ineffectiveness is irrelevant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Prine v.

Working in the past tense may not be the most effective or efficient way to work, but our body of law tends to require as much from us. And, that leaves me to question whether we should normally wait until the end to correct the wrong. Sadly, the answer comes not from me but from minds higher up the judicial ladder.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Tex.\n    </em>\n    , No. 07-18-00265-CV,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203827285\">\n     2018 WL 3827285\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 2018 Tex. App. LEXIS 6315 (Tex. App.-Amarillo Aug. 10, 2018, orig. proceeding).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In his original petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition, Dennis sought mandamus relief relating to the seven cases on which the trial court disqualified the District Attorney's Office by its July 2 order, and prohibition to prevent the trial court from disqualifying the District Attorney's Office from the six cases that remained pending. Soon after this court issued its denial of Dennis's petition, the trial court issued its August 15 order disqualifying the District Attorney's Office from those remaining six cases. By his motion for rehearing, Dennis prays that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the trial court to withdraw its July 2 and August 15 orders disqualifying the District Attorney's Office from prosecuting all thirteen cases, and a writ of prohibition preventing the trial court from disqualifying the District Attorney's Office in the future absent good cause shown. Because Dennis's petition addressed the possibility that the trial court would disqualify the District Attorney's Office in the six cases that were then pending and because Dennis's motion for rehearing requests mandamus relief as to orders in all thirteen cases, we will deem the petition to request mandamus relief as to all thirteen cases addressed in the petition in which Dennis and the District Attorney's Office have been disqualified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The text read, \"[a]ny pending cases you have with offers outstanding ... those offers are revoked, expired, and null.
