Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2015, the Texas Legislature passed a comprehensive school funding bill designated as SB-1. In one of SB-1's provisions, the Legislature prohibited school districts from repealing or reducing the amount of any Local Option Homestead Exemption (LOHE)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that they had previously adopted. The Governor signed SB-1 on June 15, 2015. Apparently believing that a question existed about whether it had the authority to pass such a prohibition, the Legislature also passed a joint resolution, SJR-1, proposing an amendment to the Texas Constitution granting it the authority to \"prohibit the governing body of a political subdivision that adopts a [LOHE] from reducing the amount of or repealing the exemption.\" Tex. S.J. Res. 3, 84th Leg., R.S., \u00a7 1, sec. 1-b(e),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205412\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen.

VIII, \u00a7 1-b (c), (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Legislature passed both SB-1 and SJR-1 on the same day. The Legislature conditioned SB-1's effectiveness on the voter's approval of SJR-1, but it also stated that, in the event SJR-1 was approved, SB-1 would become effective on the date that SJR-1's proposed constitutional amendments took effect. SJR-1 stated that the proposed amendments \"take effect for the tax year beginning January 1, 2015.\" Tex. S.J. Res. 3, 84th Leg., R.S., \u00a7 3(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205412\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen. Laws 5412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5414. The Texas voters approved SJR-1 in the November 2015 election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Two weeks after SB-1 was passed and signed by the Governor-but before the Texas citizens approved SJR-1-the Kilgore Independent School District (the District) repealed its LOHE. After SJR-1 was approved, the Texas Attorney General and the Texas Education Commissioner made written demand on the District to restore the LOHE. The District refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The individual taxpayers, Darlene Axberg, John Claude Axberg, and Sheila Anderson (collectively the Axbergs) then filed suit against the District seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. They also sought reimbursements of their excessive tax payments. The Texas Attorney General filed a petition in intervention requesting similar declaratory relief and requested that the trial court issue a writ of mandamus directing the District to comply with SB-1 and SJR-1. The District answered and asserted affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, the Axbergs and the State filed joint motions for summary judgment. The District filed an opposing motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied the District's motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted declaratory relief, injunctive relief, mandamus relief, and restitution of the additional taxes paid by the individual plaintiffs. The District appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the State and the Axbergs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We agree that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Axbergs, and we will reverse the summary judgment in favor of the Axbergs. However, we agree with the trial court that SB-1 and SJR-1 were intended to prohibit the District's repeal of its LOHE and rendered the District's repeal of no effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Accordingly, to this extent, we will affirm the summary judgment in favor of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Applicable Homestead Exemptions and the Effect of SB-1 and SJR-1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Texas law grants several types of homestead exemptions which exempt from taxation certain portions of the appraised or assessed value of an adult's residence homestead.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX. CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.13 (West Supp. 2018).

Also, under Section 11.13(n), a local taxing unit may, at its option, grant an additional exemption of a percentage of the appraised value of a residence homestead, which cannot exceed twenty percent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   TEX.

SJR-1 Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On the same day that the Legislature passed SB-1, it passed a joint resolution, SJR-1, which proposed amendments to Article VIII of the Texas Constitution that increased the amount of the State Homestead Exemption to $25,000.00, and provided that the Legislature \"may prohibit the governing body of a political subdivision that adopts [a LOHE] from reducing the amount of or repealing the exemption.\" Tex.

The District's Subsequent Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 29, 2015, the District's Board of Trustees repealed its LOHE, effective for the 2015 tax year. On June 15, 2016, the Attorney General of Texas and the Texas Education Commissioner sent a joint letter to the District, alleging that the District's repeal of its LOHE violated SB-1's repeal prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In September 2016, the Axbergs brought suit against the District\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which they alleged that the District violated SB-1's repeal prohibition by repealing the LOHE. As relevant to this appeal, the petition sought a declaratory judgment that (1) the repeal prohibition is constitutional; (2) the repeal prohibition and SJR-1, prohibit school districts from repealing or reducing a LOHE at any time between January 2015 and December 31, 2019; and (3) any repeal of or reduction in the amount of a LOHE by a school district is void as a matter of law. The petition also sought (1) a permanent injunction mandating that the District reinstate the LOHE for application in the 2015 through 2019 tax years and stop the collection of taxes subject to the LOHE, (2) a refund of the \"illegally collected taxes\" that the Axbergs claim to have paid under duress, and (3) attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State of Texas filed (1) an amended plea in intervention seeking a declaratory judgment that the District's repeal of its LOHE was in violation of SB-1 and SJR-1 and (2) a writ of mandamus ordering the District to comply with SB-1 and SJR-1. The District filed its first amended answer and asserted a general denial, a special denial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   affirmative defenses, and a counterclaim alleging that the Axbergs' suit was frivolous. Among its affirmative defenses, the District pleaded that applying SB-1 before November 3, 2015, would be unconstitutional under the Texas Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Parties' Competing Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 29, 2017, the Axbergs and the State (jointly Appellees) filed a joint motion\n   for traditional summary judgment in which they sought judgment (1) that SB-1 prohibited school districts from reducing or repealing the LOHE before SB-1 became law on November 3, 2015, and (2) that SB-1's repeal prohibition was not unconstitutionally retroactive. The Appellees argued that, by its terms, SB-1's repeal prohibition applied to the 2015 tax year and would take effect on the date the constitutional amendments took effect and that SJR-1 provided that the constitutional amendments therein \"take effect for the tax year beginning January 1, 2015.\" Consequently, according to the Appellees, SB-1's repeal prohibition was retroactive to January 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellees also argued that it was constitutionally retroactive under the analysis set forth in\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319864\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/335/126/#p145\">\n    335 S.W.3d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (Tex. 2010). In addition, the Appellees asked for summary judgment on the District's counterclaim. In their motion for summary judgment, the Appellees did not ask for judgment on their damages, for injunctive or mandamus relief, or for a refund of excess taxes paid. Attached to the motion were copies of SB-1 and SJR-1, but no other summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A hearing on the Appellees' motion was set for April 27, 2017. On April 18, 2017, the District filed its response to the motion for summary judgment. As relevant to this appeal, the District argued (1) that SB-1's repeal prohibition only applied prospectively, (2) that summary judgment was improper because the State had failed to comply with its discovery requests and the trial court had not ruled on the District's pending motions related to discovery, and (3) that there were genuine issues of material fact as to (a) whether each of the Axbergs was a taxpayer, (b) whether the Axbergs were denied a LOHE, and (c) whether the Axbergs were under duress when they paid their taxes. On April 24, 2017, the District filed its motion to compel the Axbergs to respond to its interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 25, 2017, the Axbergs filed the affidavits of John and Darlene Axberg and Sheila Anderson. Each of the affiants averred that they have a residence homestead located in the Kilgore Independent School District, that the District had assessed and collected taxes for the 2015 and 2016 tax years that would have been subject to the LOHE, and that they had paid those taxes under duress in order to avoid incurring penalties and interest under the Texas Tax Code. Each of the affidavits also had copies of tax receipts attached that evidenced each affiant's payment of taxes for the 2015 and 2016 tax years. The Axbergs did not seek leave of court to file the affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At the April 27, 2017, hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the District pointed out that the Axbergs had not filed their affidavits twenty-one days before the hearing. It argued that, because they failed to timely file their affidavits, there was no evidence that they lived in the District, that they owned property, that they paid taxes, or that the District collected taxes. Although the trial court asked the Axbergs to address these issues, they did not request leave to file the affidavits, and the trial court did not indicate that it would allow the affidavits as summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Trial Court's Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A decision on the motion for summary judgment was apparently put on hold while the District, its trustees, and its superintendent pursued an interlocutory appeal of the denial of their plea to the jurisdiction. After we issued our opinion in the interlocutory appeal, but before our\n   mandate issued, the trial court sent a letter ruling announcing that it would grant the summary judgment. After the trial court received our mandate, it entered its amended final judgment on February 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its amended final judgment, the trial court recited that, after considering and hearing the joint motion for summary judgment, the response, its file, and the arguments of counsel, it issued a separate order on December 7, 2017, by which it granted the joint motion for summary judgment and denied the District's counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judgment further declared, \"[c]onsistent with that [letter],\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1. that [SB-1's repeal prohibition] is constitutional as a matter of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2. that [SB-1's repeal prohibition] prohibits school districts from repealing or reducing the amount of a local option homestead exemption, at any time between January 1, 2015[,] through December 31, 2019, that was adopted for the 2014 tax year; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3. that the acts of the Defendants complained of by Plaintiffs and Intervenor are in violation of S.B. 1 and S.J.R. 1. Therefore, the repeal and any reduction by Defendant Kilgore Independent School District of the local option homestead exemption that it adopted for the 2014 tax year violates [SB-1's repeal prohibition] and, therefore, has no effect and is void as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition, the judgment ordered the District to \"stop assessing and collecting property taxes through December 31, 2019 that are subject to the local option homestead exemption that it adopted for the 2014 tax year,\" and to \"disgorge and refund to Plaintiffs those property taxes that it has collected for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 that are subject to the local option homestead exemption that it adopted for the 2014 tax year.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On appeal, the District complains that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Axbergs and the State because (1) the plain language of SB-1 and SJR-1 and established rules of statutory interpretation require that they be read prospectively; (2) the Axbergs' untimely filed evidence could not be considered in support of their motion for summary judgment; (3) the trial court denied discovery to the District; and (4) the trial court improperly granted damages to the Axbergs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Trial Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment for the Axbergs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In its third issue, the District complains that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Axbergs because there was no competent summary judgment evidence showing (1) that the Axbergs were taxpayers living within the school district, (2) that they had paid taxes, or (3) that they were assessed and paid taxes that did not include the LOHE. Without such evidence, the District argues, the Axbergs did not establish that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The District acknowledges that the Axbergs filed affidavits regarding these matters, but argues that, since they were filed two days before the summary judgment hearing without leave of court, they cannot be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the Axbergs concede that whether they lost their LOHE as a result of the District's repeal and whether they paid their taxes are relevant fact questions, they contend that these questions were conclusively established by their affidavits filed two days before the summary judgment hearing. They did not file their affidavits with their summary judgment motion, they explain, because they thought these issues were not in dispute because the District did not file a plea to the jurisdiction. They state that they did not request leave of court to file the affidavits for the same reason. The Axbergs then argue that the trial court either agreed that the affidavits were unnecessary or that it granted\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   leave of court and considered the evidence in granting the summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As discussed above, the Axbergs filed a traditional motion for summary judgment seeking a declaratory judgment that the prohibition against repealing the LOHE was retroactive and that it was not unconstitutional. To be entitled to a declaratory judgment, there must be a justiciable controversy \"as to the rights and status of the parties and the controversy will be resolved by the declaration sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonham State Bank v.

R. CIV. P. 166a(c). In their original petition, the Axbergs alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that they were taxpayers whose homesteads were within the boundaries of the school district, that the District illegally repealed its LOHE, that the District assessed and collected taxes that were subject to the LOHE, and that the Axbergs were forced, under duress, to pay taxes that were subject to the LOHE. The District filed a general denial, which placed these allegations in issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 92 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shell Chem. Co. v.

Because the Axbergs' allegations establishing that there was a real and substantial controversy (i.e., that as taxpayers residing in the school district they had been assessed taxes by, and paid taxes to, the District that were subject to the repealed LOHE) were placed in issue by the District's general denial, the Axbergs were required to bring forth summary judgment proof establishing that there was a real and substantial controversy in order to establish their entitlement to a declaratory judgment. In other words, they were required to bring forth summary judgment proof establishing that they were taxpayers residing in the school district and that they had been assessed taxes by, and paid taxes to, the District that were subject to the LOHE. In the absence of such proof, they could not establish that there was a real and substantial controversy, and they would not be entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It is uncontested that the only evidence of these facts was contained in the Axbergs' affidavits filed two days before the summary judgment hearing, without leave of court.

There is no order or other indication in the record that the trial court accepted or considered the late-filed affidavits. Consequently, there was no evidence that the Axbergs were taxpayers residing in the school district, or that they had been assessed taxes by, and paid taxes to, the District that were subject to the LOHE. Therefore, there was no evidence that there was a real and substantial controversy that entitled the Axbergs to the declaratory judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Likewise, without the Axbergs' affidavits, there was no evidence that the District assessed and collected property taxes subject to the LOHE, or that the District collected property taxes for the tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 from the Axbergs. Consequently, the Axbergs failed to establish, as a matter of law, that they were entitled to injunctive relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a refund of property taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for the Axbergs. We sustain the District's third issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Trial Court Correctly Granted Summary Judgment for the State\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The trial court also granted summary judgment for the State. The parties do not dispute that the State is a proper party in this case and that it could ask for the declaratory relief granted by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 37.006(b) (West 2015) (providing that, when declaratory relief is sought and a statute is alleged to be unconstitutional, \"the attorney general of the state must also be served with a copy of the proceeding and is entitled to be heard\"). Therefore, we must determine whether the trial court erred in its determination that SB-1's repeal prohibition prohibits school districts from repealing or reducing the amount of a LOHE between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019, and whether the District's repeal and any reduction of its LOHE has no effect and is void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In its first issue, the District contends that the trial court erred in granting the declaratory relief because SB-1 and SJR-1 are prospective. The District argues that, since the general presumption is that a statute is prospective, and since SB-1 and SJR-1 can be read prospectively, then we should hold that the statute and constitutional amendment are prospective. Essentially, the District argues that SB-1's repeal prohibition became effective on November 3, 2015, when SJR-1 was approved by the Texas citizens and, therefore, could only prohibit the repeal of any LOHE after that date. Because it repealed its LOHE some five months prior to that date, the District argues that SB-1's repeal prohibition does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On the other hand, SJR-1 states that the proposed amendments therein \"take effect for the tax year beginning January 1, 2015.\" Tex. S.J. Res. 3, 84th Leg., R.S., \u00a7 3(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205412\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen. Laws 5412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5414. And Section 27 of SB-1 states that the provisions in question in this case \"take[ ] effect on the date on which the constitutional amendment proposed by SJR-1 ... takes effect....\" Act of May 29, 2015, 84th Leg. R.S., ch. 465, \u00a7 27(a)(1), (2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%201779\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen. Laws 1779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1786. In addition, Section 26 of SB-1 states that SB-1 \"applies beginning with the 2015 tax year.\" Act of May 29, 2015, 84th Leg. R.S., ch. 465, \u00a7 27(a)(1), (2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%201779\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen. Laws 1779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1786. Thus, SJR-1 can be read as holding that it applies prospectively from the date it became effective, and because SJR-1 became effective January 1, 2015, SB-1's repeal prohibition applied prospectively from January 1, 2015, rather than November 3, 2014.

The Purpose and Legislative History Behind SJR-1 Supports the Conclusion that the Constitutional Amendments Therein Were Intended to Apply Retroactively\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We next turn to the purpose behind SJR-1. As noted, SJR-1 proposed two constitutional amendments to Article VIII, Section 1-b, of the Texas Constitution that are relevant to our analysis. First, it proposed to increase the State Homestead Exemption for public school purposes from $15,000.00 to $25,000.00. Tex. S.J. Res. 3, 84th Leg., R.S., \u00a7 1, secs. 1-b (c),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205412\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen. Laws 5412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5412-13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   TEX. CONST. art. VIII, \u00a7 1-b (c). It is apparent from the face of this amendment that its purpose was to provide a reduction in the property taxes paid by Texas taxpayers. SJR-1 also proposed authorizing the Legislature to prohibit a political subdivision that adopted a LOHE from reducing the amount of or repealing the exemption. Tex. S.J. Res. 3, 84th Leg., R.S., \u00a7 1, secs. 1-b (e),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20Tex.%20Gen.%20Laws%205412\">\n    2015 Tex. Gen.

Since allowing a political subdivision to reduce or repeal its LOHE could lessen, or possibly eliminate, the benefit of the tax reduction resulting from the increase in the State Homestead Exemption, it follows that the purpose of this amendment was to provide a mechanism by which the Legislature could ensure that all Texas taxpayers received the full benefit of the increase in the State Homestead Exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This brings us to the circumstances of SJR-1's enactment. At the time that SB-1 was passed, it appears the Legislature did not believe it had the constitutional authority to raise the State Homestead Amendment to $25,000.00 and to prohibit school districts that had adopted a LOHE from reducing the amount of or repealing the exemption before December 31, 2019, both of which were included in SB-1 that was passed by the Legislature on May 29, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. TAX CODE ANN. \u00a7 11.13(b), (n-1). While we are not asked to decide whether the Legislature had such authority, even if the Legislature did not have the authority to take those actions on May 29, 2015, an invalid statute may be cured by the approval of a constitutional amendment that \"impliedly validate[s] a statute that was originally beyond the legislature's\n   power to enact if it does not impair the obligation of a contract or impair vested rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9988520\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/814/745/#p748\">\n    814 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   747 (citing W.

The temporary provision in SJR-1 that specified that the amendments took effect for the tax year beginning January 1, 2015, specifically listed the amendments raising the State Homestead Exemption and authorizing the Legislature to prohibit a political subdivision that had adopted a LOHE from reducing the amount of or repealing the exemption. In view of the presumption that the Legislature knew of existing law, these circumstances indicate that the amendments were intended to apply retroactively in order to validate the prior actions of the Legislature in raising the homestead exemption and in prohibiting the repeal of a previously-adopted LOHE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316793\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/366/696/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316793\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/366/696/\">\n    at 748-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Based on the language of the amendments, their purpose, and the circumstances of their enactment, we conclude that the amendments operate retroactively and apply to the entire 2015 tax year, beginning January 1, 2015, and that they were intended to impliedly validate SB-1's provisions increasing the State Homestead Exemption and prohibiting the repeal of any previously-adopted LOHE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316793\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/366/696/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Thus, for the increase in the State Homestead Exemption and SB-1's repeal prohibition to become fully operational, the approval of SJR-1 by the voters was required. When the voters approved SJR-1, these sections became fully operational and, under the plain language of SB-1, took effect on the same date as the constitutional amendments, which we have determined to be January 1, 2015. Thus, the plain language of SB-1 shows that the Legislature intended the increase in the State Homestead Exemption and SB-1's repeal prohibition to apply to the 2015 tax year and that they took effect beginning January 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This interpretation also furthers the purposes of these statutes and the constitutional amendments by ensuring that all Texas taxpayers benefit from the increased State Homestead Exemption.

As with the constitutional provisions, the purpose of these enactments was to provide a reduction in property taxes for Texas taxpayers and to provide a mechanism that would ensure that all Texas taxpayers would benefit fully from the increased State Homestead Exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The District focuses on the Legislature's use of \"may not\" in SB-1's repeal prohibition and of \"may\" in SB-1's homestead exemption increase and argues that the use of these verb tenses indicates that SB-1 and SJR-1 were meant to operate prospectively and only after the approval of the constitutional amendments by the voters. Under its theory, the only provisions in SB-1 and SJR-1 that would apply beginning January 1, 2015, were those that increased the State Homestead Exemption. The District argues that, since SB-1's repeal prohibition was conditioned on the approval by the voters, it only applies to repeals taking place after November 3, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the District argues, the Legislature left a window for school districts to repeal their LOHE until November 3, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The District's interpretation ignores the plain language of those provisions of SB-1 and SJR-1 regarding when the constitutional and statutory amendments therein take effect. Although it concedes that the increase in the State Homestead Exemption took effect on January 1, 2015, it ignores the language in the temporary provision of SJR-1 that specifically provides that both SB-1's increase in the State\n   Homestead Exemption and SB-1's repeal prohibition took \"effect for the tax year beginning January 1, 2015.\" It also ignores language from SB-1 providing that those sections took effect on the same date as the constitutional amendments. Finally, the District's interpretation would deny its taxpayers all or part of the benefit of the increased State Homestead Exemption, thus defeating one of the primary purposes of the constitutional amendments and SB-1. We should not interpret a statute in such a way that its primary purpose is defeated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, this interpretation promotes the purposes of the constitutional amendments and SB-l that all Texas taxpayers would fully benefit from the increase in the State Homestead Exemption. Consequently, we agree with the trial court's determinations that SB-1's repeal prohibition prohibits school districts that had adopted a LOHE for the 2014 tax year from repealing or reducing the amount of the LOHE at any time between January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2019, and that SB-1's repeal prohibition is constitutional, as requested by the State in its joint motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

In this case, SB-1 was passed by the Legislature on May 29, 2015, and it was signed by the governor on June 15, 2015. The District did not repeal its LOHE until June 29, 2015. Since SB-1 was enacted before the District's repeal, any consequences SB-1's repeal prohibition has on a District's LOHE repeal would be prospective, not retroactive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The District also argues that the Legislature's failure to make SB-1's repeal prohibition effective immediately, as it did some other provisions of SB-1, also indicates that it intended that prohibition to only affect repeals occurring after the approval of the constitutional amendments. We believe there is another reasonable explanation for the Legislature's action. As we have pointed out, the purpose of SB-1's repeal prohibition was to provide a mechanism whereby all Texas taxpayers would receive the full benefit of the proposed increase in the State Homestead Exemption. If the voters failed to approve this increase, then that prohibition would not be necessary. However, if the proposed increase was approved by the voters, SB-1's repeal prohibition would become fully operational, including its effective date, in order to achieve its purpose.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    As we have previously held, the trial court erred in granting the injunctive relief to the Axbergs since there was no evidence that the District had assessed and collected taxes subject to its LOHE, so they failed to establish that they were entitled to this relief. To the extent that this injunctive relief was also granted to the State, the trial court erred for the same reason.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
