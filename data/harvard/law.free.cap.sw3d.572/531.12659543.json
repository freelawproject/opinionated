Chapman, Judge\n   John Newton (Newton) appeals summary judgment by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Trial Court), denying his petition for declaratory judgment and granting judgment in favor of the Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC). In his declaratory judgment action Newton claimed that the DOC miscalculated the beginning date of his 120-day period of confinement in which to complete the Institutional Treatment Center (ITC program) provided for under \u00a7 559.115.3; that this miscalculation prevented him from successfully completing the ITC program; and that he was therefore entitled to statutory discharge to probation or an order directing the Sentencing Court to have a hearing to determine whether he should be granted probation. Because there was no presently existing justiciable controversy which entitled Newton to declaratory relief, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 14, 2014, the Vernon County Circuit Court revoked Newton's probation: sentenced him to three years in the DOC; and, pursuant to \u00a7 559.115.3, ordered that he participate in a DOC 120-day ITC program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newton was delivered\n   to the DOC on the Vernon County charge on December 2, 2014. Newton initiated a request for disposition of his pending Christian County offenses; was transferred by writ to the Christian County Sheriff's custody; and, as a result, did not complete the diagnostic process necessary to be placed in the ITC program ordered in the Vernon County case. Newton did not therefore complete the ITC program ordered in the Vernon County case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 22, 2015, Newton appeared before the Circuit Court of Christian County (Sentencing Court) and pleaded guilty to felony stealing and was sentenced to seven years in the DOC; pleaded guilty to felony harassment of a person under age 17 by a person over age 21 and was sentenced to seven years in the DOC; and also pleaded guilty to one count of misdemeanor child molestation and one count of misdemeanor assault. All of the Christian County sentences were ordered to run concurrent to each other, and consecutive to the 3-year Vernon County sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Christian County Sentencing Court also ordered that Newton participate in an ITC program as provided for under \u00a7 559.115.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 4, 2015, Newton was returned to the DOC; and on March 1, 2015, began participating in the ITC program ordered in the Christian County case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 19, 2015, even though Newton had not completed the ITC program, the Vernon County Circuit Court entered an order placing him on probation, subject to his release on the Christian County charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 15, 2015, the DOC issued a Court Report Investigation (\"report\") to the Christian County Sentencing Court, advising it of Newton's participation in the 120-day ITC program. In its report the DOC indicated that, because Newton had\n   already been in its custody for the Vernon County charges, it had started the 120-day period on January 22, 2015 (the date he was sentenced in Christian County) and not on February 4, 2015 (the date Newton physically returned to the DOC). The report alerted the Sentencing Court that \"Newton is expected to complete the [ITC] program on 5-26-15. His 120th day is 5-22-15. He will be unable to complete the program through no fault of his own and is therefore ineligible for a statutory discharge.\" The DOC report provided that Newton was \"doing satisfactory [sic] in all areas of the [ITC] program\"; but went on to recommend that probation be denied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   This officer has serious concerns with Newton being released to community supervision. His prior performance on probation was poor. He incurred multiple violations and citations, including several laws violations, including the present offenses, the Child Molestation offenses, and Damage to Jail Property. He tested positive on five occasions for alcohol and two times amphetamines, and eventually absconded from supervision. He continued to be with the victim of his Domestic Violence offense, despite directives that he was to have no contact with her. Newton's victimization of a juvenile is particularly troubling, especially as he took no accountability for his actions and denied that he had ever engaged in sexually offending behavior. Should Newton return to the community, this officer fears for his victim's safety, as well as the safety of other potential victims. Therefore, it is this officer's respectful recommendation that Newton be denied probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 24, 2015, the Christian County Sentencing Court entered its order denying Newton's release on probation. On June 1, 2015 (48 days after the report was issued, and 38 days after the court denied probation), Newton responded with a motion requesting that the Christian County Sentencing Court reconsider its order denying probation, claiming that his inability to complete the program was due to the DOC's improperly calculating his delivery date (the beginning date of his 120-day period). On June 3, 2015, after hearing argument, the Sentencing Court overruled Newton's motion because he had failed to complete the ITC program by May 22, 2015 (and by implication adopted the DOC's position that delivery occurred on sentencing). Additionally, the Sentencing Court found that it was \"without jurisdiction to hear the motion pursuant to Section 559.115, because the 120-day time period has run.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 29, 2015, Newton sought mandamus relief from the Missouri Court of Appeals to compel the Christian County Sentencing Court to award him probation.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Noting that it was undisputed that Newton had failed to complete the ITC program and that the decision to grant probation was, pursuant to \u00a7 559.115.3, within the Sentencing Court's discretion, the Southern District Court of Appeals denied issuance of a permanent writ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774882\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6774882\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/496/516/\">\n    at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 3, 2016, Newton filed (in the instant action) a petition for declaratory judgment against the DOC in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Trial Court). Newton complained that, but for the DOC's alleged miscalculation of the beginning date of his 120-day period, he would have been released on probation. Newton petitioned the Trial Court to enter a judgment \"declaring that [he] be granted statutory release on probation\"; and in his prayer asked the Trial Court to grant him \"Declaratory Judgment with directions to the [Sentencing Court] to either grant him\n   probation or, in the alternative, schedule a hearing within 30 days of this [Trial] Court's order becoming final, to determine whether probation is appropriate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both Newton and the DOC filed motions for summary judgment. The Trial Court granted the DOC's motion for summary judgment, and found that Newton's claim was not properly the subject of a declaratory judgment action; was past the statute of limitations for an action against the DOC; and that the DOC did not miscalculate Newton's 120-day period.

In relevant part, \u00a7 559.115.3 provides that the period in which the sentencing court retains authority is calculated \"from the date the offender was\n    <em>\n     delivered\n    </em>\n    to the department of corrections.\" (emphasis added). \"Delivered\" is not a defined term in the statute. When a term is not defined the application of \"the plain and ordinary meaning of a statute's words\" is the \"north star\" of statutory interpretation.\n    <em>\n     State v.

App. W.D. 2004). Here, the DOC does not dispute that \"delivery\" means physical delivery. However, the DOC contends, without citation, that until an offender is released, they can only be delivered to the DOC one time. Consequently, because Newton had already been delivered to the DOC pursuant to the Vernon County sentences, he was only on \"outcount\" when he was physically in the Christian County jail. According to the DOC, because Newton was still in their constructive custody, he was \"delivered\" to the DOC for the Christian County sentences on the date that he was sentenced. Under this interpretation, the 120-day term during which \u00a7 559.115.3 granted the Sentencing Court authority over Newton's probation began when he was sentenced on January 22, 2015, not when he physically was returned to their facility on February 4, 2015.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The DOC's interpretation of the statute is contrary to Missouri law and principles of statutory interpretation.

However, in this instance, any interest that might have been conferred to Newton pursuant to \u00a7 559.115.3 (particularly a statutory discharge) was contingent upon conditions that were not met. The authority to conduct a hearing to consider (or to ultimately grant) probation was not in the control of the DOC. Newton did not therefore present a justiciable issue in his declaratory judgment action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    It is undisputed that Newton failed to complete the program in the 120-day period. Newton was withdrawn from the ITC program on April 24, 2015, when the Sentencing Court entered its order denying probation and ordering continued execution of his sentence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Newton waited over a month (until June 1, 2015) to file his motion challenging this determination and asking the Sentencing Court for reconsideration of its ruling. As a consequence, by the time his motion came before the Sentencing Court (June 3, 2015), the 120-day period in which the Sentencing Court had authority to grant probation under \u00a7 559.115 had expired according to the calculation of the DOC and had just one day remaining before the June 4, 2015, date that Newton had correctly argued.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Even were the Sentencing Court to have agreed with Newton as to his delivery date, there would have been no meaningful opportunity for Newton to complete the ITC program.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Even though the DOC erred in calculating the start date of his 120-day term for the Christian County sentences, Newton's only possible \"legally protected interest\" under \u00a7 559.115.3 was his loss of the\n    <em>\n     opportunity\n    </em>\n    to complete the ITC program, and, even more remote, his opportunity to receive probation. The assertion that Newton would have successfully completed the remaining thirty-two days of the program is mere speculation that does not entitle him to the relief he requests (declaration of his entitlement to a statutory discharge to probation or entitlement to a hearing to determine whether he is entitled to probation). \u00a7 559.115.3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Moreover, Newton's request for a hearing to determine his entitlement to probation would require that we compel the Circuit Court of Christian County (not a party) to undertake an action (a hearing to consider whether to grant probation after the 120-day period has expired) which it does not have authority to do.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The DOC report, which calculated the wrong start date and indicated that Newton would not be able to complete the program \"through no fault of his own\" also indicated, in very clear terms, that Newton should be denied probation. The DOC report highlighted that his past performance on probation was \"poor,\" citing criminal violations, contact with a victim of domestic violence (when prohibited from such contact), and absconding from supervision. The DOC report noted \"Newton's victimization of a juvenile is particularly troubling, especially as he took no accountability for his actions and denied that he had ever engaged in sexually offending behavior.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Despite the positive accounting of Newton's participation in the ITC program, the Sentencing Court followed the DOC recommendation and denied probation. Even had the DOC correctly calculated Newton's 120-day period and had then also determined Newton was entitled to statutory discharge to probation, the Sentencing Court still would have had an opportunity to conduct a hearing 90 to 120 days from February 4, 2015 (May 5 to June 4, 2015), to have determined whether to deny probation. In addition to speculating whether Newton would have completed the ITC program to the DOC's satisfaction, granting him the statutory discharge to probation he now seeks would also require speculating whether the Sentencing Court would have allowed the statutory release to probation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     County Court of Washington County v.
