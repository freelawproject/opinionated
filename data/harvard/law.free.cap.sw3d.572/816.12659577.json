Taylor appeals his DWI conviction. He challenges (1) the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction under the corpus delicti rule, (2) the trial court's admission of evidence involving a fatality accident at the scene, and (3) the enhancement of appellant's conviction to a class A misdemeanor without a prior DWI conviction. We conclude that (1) appellant's conviction is supported by legally sufficient evidence, (2) appellant did not preserve error on his evidentiary challenge, and (3) the trial court properly instructed the jury that it could find appellant guilty of a class A misdemeanor if it found appellant's blood alcohol concentration was .15 or more. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant's car, a Volkswagen, stalled out on the Southwest Freeway in Houston, Texas when appellant ran out of gas around 1:00 a.m. Shortly thereafter, appellant was observed standing on a main lane of the freeway next to the front door of the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another driver subsequently rear ended the Volkswagen. A wrecker truck arrived, and its driver had parked near the two vehicles when the driver of a pickup truck struck the wrecker. The pickup truck rolled over, the driver was ejected, and he died on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Ciers assessed appellant for intoxication. He spoke with appellant and observed \"a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath\" and \"slow, deliberate speech,\" which led Ciers to conclude that it was necessary to conduct field sobriety tests on appellant. Ciers wore a body camera during his encounter with appellant on the scene, which was admitted at trial without objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The body camera recorded the accident scene, in addition to onsite field sobriety testing and statements made by appellant. Appellant stated that he was alone in his Volkswagen driving when he ran out of gas. He admitted that he drank \"about three\" beers before getting behind the wheel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ciers conducted the horizontal gaze nystagmus test on appellant and observed six of six clues of intoxication. He then took\n   appellant to the police station for additional sobriety testing. At the station, appellant again admitted to driving the Volkswagen. He also stated that he began drinking around 9:30 p.m. and stopped around 12:30 a.m. Ciers conducted the walk and turn and one leg stand tests. He did not observe any signs of intoxication during those tests, but he again conducted the HGN test on appellant and observed all six clues. Appellant agreed to a breath test. Two tests were given at 3:53 and 3:56 a.m., and they showed blood alcohol concentrations of .169 and .170.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant challenges (1) the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction under the corpus delicti rule; (2) the trial court's admission of evidence involving the truck accident and death of the driver; and (3) the trial court's submission of a jury charge instruction allowing the jury to find appellant guilty of a class A misdemeanor without a prior DWI conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Evidence of Driving While Intoxicated Legally Sufficient\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant argues in his second issue that his DWI conviction is not supported by legally sufficient evidence under the corpus delicti rule. He contends his extrajudicial statements to police amount to the only evidence that he was driving the Volkswagen while intoxicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The corpus delicti rule applies when there is an extrajudicial confession to involvement in a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

No other person was on the scene who could have operated the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Ciers arrived, he smelled alcohol on appellant's breath. That and appellant's \"slow, deliberate speech\" led Ciers to conclude that it was necessary to conduct field sobriety tests. Appellant twice failed HGN sobriety tests and blew .169 and .170 on his breath tests approximately three hours after his car stalled. We conclude, setting aside appellant's extrajudicial statements, there is corroborating evidence that appellant was operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, and thus the corpus delicti rule was satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802390\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/244/#p249\">\n    487 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   249 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6849508\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/11/#p20\">\n    467 S.W.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding there was corroborating evidence outside of defendant's extrajudicial confession that he was operating motorcycle at time of crash supporting defendant's felony murder conviction).

Challenge to Admission of Evidence Not Preserved\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Appellant contends in his first issue that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence involving the truck accident and the driver's death. According to appellant, the trial court should have excluded this evidence as not relevant under Rule of Evidence 401 and more prejudicial than probative under Rule 403. Tex. R. Evid. 401, 403. We conclude that appellant has failed to preserve error as to these complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Appellant filed a motion in limine requesting that the State be required to refrain from mentioning the accident until a ruling could be obtained outside the presence of the jury. The trial court overruled the motion. The purpose of a motion in limine is to obtain an order requiring an initial offer of objectionable evidence outside the jury's presence.\n   <em>\n    Geuder v.
