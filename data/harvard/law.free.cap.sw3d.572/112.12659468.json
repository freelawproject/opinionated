Doolin claims that his guilty plea to sexual misconduct in the first degree was induced by plea counsel's assurance that he would never be required to register as a sex offender. He argues that this advice was erroneous and resulted in manifest injustice. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Doolin was charged with the class C felony of possession of a controlled substance (Xanax) and the class B misdemeanor of sexual misconduct in the first degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doolin entered open guilty pleas to both offenses on September 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the plea hearing, Doolin admitted that while trying on clothes at a Goodwill store, he began disrobing and exposed his genitals to a store employee. Doolin was ejected from the store and went across the street to a shopping mall where he was subsequently arrested. A search of his backpack incident to his arrest revealed Xanax pills, for which Doolin did not have a prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A discussion ensued over whether his plea to sexual misconduct in the first degree would require registration as a sex offender:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Doolin:] This is not a registerable offense; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [The Court:] I do not believe it is.... [Assistant Prosecutor], you're probably more of an expert on it than I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Assistant Prosecutor:] It's not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [The Court:] That's what I thought, but I just- ... I assume that's what [plea counsel] has advised?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Doolin:] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [The Court:] That's my understanding, too.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court accepted Doolin's guilty pleas. On November 10, 2014, a sentencing hearing was held. At the hearing, Doolin's plea counsel identified to the court two errors in the sentencing assessment report (SAR). First, the SAR incorrectly stated that the sexual misconduct charge to which Doolin pleaded guilty was a class D felony when, in fact, it was a class B misdemeanor. The SAR also stated that Doolin \"shall comply with the state sex offender registration laws[.]\" Plea counsel explained to the court that no registration was required, and the court made the change to the SAR:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [PLEA COUNSEL:] It is our understanding and it's been our understanding through the entire pendency of this case that the Class B misdemeanor that he's charged with is not a registrable offense. Our paralegal researched it. [Doolin's former attorney] researched it. I researched it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   And we all came to the same conclusion that this did not have any sexual acts or anything like that so that he would not have to register on this offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Well, I haven't looked at the statute. I'll just take your word for it and we'll ... mark it as such.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Doolin then sought clarification that he would not have to register as a sex offender:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I just want that to be 100 percent that-you know, if the statute is that; otherwise-I mean, I would hate to be, you know-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [PLEA COUNSEL:] He wanted to be assured before he pled guilty that that was true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Well, it sounds like your counsel assured you. I don't give legal opinions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [PLEA COUNSEL:] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: I decide legal disputes and issues, but ... that's not a matter unless I enter an order with regards to something about you registering on the-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [PLEA COUNSEL:] As I told him, Your Honor-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Oh, so you would have to order that? I apologize.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: No, I wouldn't have to order it. If you're required to register under the law, you'll be required to register independent of me doing that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [PLEA COUNSEL:] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: The only time it would require-the statutes do require that I direct you to register if I place you on probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   But if I sentence you to a jail term or prison term, it's your obligation to register\n   and to know the law. You've gotten legal advice from your counsel that you do not have to register. So if you want to get a second opinion, you can do that. But I don't give legal opinions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Okay? Understand, Mr. Doolin?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PLEA COUNSEL:] Do you understand?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: All right. So I'm not giving you any position one way or the other with regards to it. I have not researched the issue and it's not a matter for me to make a decision in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Following this exchange, Doolin did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea or make any objection to continuing with his sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court sentenced Doolin to two years in the Department of Corrections for possession of a controlled substance, to run consecutive to other sentences that Doolin was then serving. The court also sentenced Doolin to six months in the Buchanan County jail for sexual misconduct in the first degree, to run concurrent to the sentence for possession of a controlled substance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nearly two years later, on September 20, 2016, Doolin filed a motion pursuant to Rule 29.07(d) to withdraw the guilty plea he entered to the sexual misconduct charge. In the motion, Doolin alleged that his guilty plea \"resulted in manifest injustice because it was based on erroneous assurances from his plea attorney and the prosecutor that if he pled guilty to that charge he would not ever be required to register as a sex offender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was held at which the court received testimony from Doolin\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his plea counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Doolin testified that he specifically asked plea counsel whether registration would be required if he pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the first degree and was told that the registration requirements would not apply to him. Doolin further stated that while plea counsel did not explain how changes to the sex offender registration law would apply to individuals who had previously pleaded guilty, he believed plea counsel told him that he would never have to register and he \"took that as to be forever.\" Doolin claimed that, had plea counsel told him that he might have to register as a sex offender in the future, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have gone to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plea counsel acknowledged that Doolin asked whether he would be required to register if he pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the first degree. Plea counsel testified that, in response to the inquiry, research was conducted into the registration requirement for the offense of sexual misconduct in the first degree under the Missouri sex offender registration law and the federal sex offender registration law (SORNA). Plea counsel concluded, with the aid of a colleague and a paralegal, that neither the Missouri sex offender registration law nor SORNA required Doolin to register as a sex offender at the time of the plea. Plea counsel memorialized this conclusion in a letter sent to Doolin prior\n   to the guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plea counsel testified that he did not inform Doolin that the sex offender registration law would never change or that Doolin would never have to register if he pleaded guilty. Instead, plea counsel explained to Doolin the state of the law at the time of the guilty plea, which did not require registration. Plea counsel also indicated that he apprised Doolin that he \"had no control over the Missouri state legislature, [and] that [he] had no control over what may happen in the future[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The motion court denied Doolin's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, finding that plea counsel provided Doolin accurate legal advice concerning the registration requirements and there existed no manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Doolin appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We first address the State's claim that this appeal should be dismissed because this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the denial of Doolin's Rule 29.07(d) motion. Rule 29.07(d) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty may be made only before sentence is imposed or when imposition of sentence is suspended; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The State directs us to\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   , however, no final conviction was entered because the trial court had suspended imposition of sentence. Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   court underscored this point, noting that the pre-sentencing Rule 29.07(d) motion was \"part and parcel of the ongoing criminal case,\" and that in the underlying criminal case, \"[n]o sentence [was] entered and there is no final judgment and the trial court retains jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408581\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/79/891/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Missouri Supreme Court has subsequently described\n   <em>\n    Larson's\n   </em>\n   holding as limited to cases in which no final judgment of conviction has been entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

However, Doolin failed to establish the foundational predicate to his claim-that his plea counsel advised that he would never have to register as a sex offender if he pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct in the first degree. Plea counsel testified that he made no assurances to Doolin that he would never have to register as a sex offender and had instead explained \"that [plea counsel] had no control\n   over what may happen in the future[.]\" Plea counsel's testimony that no promises were made regarding future registration requirements is consistent with the letter he sent Doolin prior to the plea hearing stating that according to \"the existing statutes and laws, at this time\" the offense of sexual misconduct in the first degree did not require registration. The only evidence offered to rebut plea counsel's testimony came from Doolin, and \"[t]he motion court [was] free to believe or disbelieve any portion of the testimony[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The State has consistently agreed with this analysis throughout these proceedings as evidenced by its consent to the removal of the registration requirement from the original judgment and sentence and we have not been directed to or independently found any Missouri authority that, in our view, undermines the accuracy of plea counsel's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Doolin nevertheless argues that the absence of conclusive precedent rendered the law unsettled and plea counsel's assertion erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Doolin's speculative musings\n   do not alter the accuracy of the information provided by plea counsel. Doolin was informed that entering a plea of guilty to sexual misconduct in the first degree would not require him to register as a sex offender under the laws in effect at the time of his plea and that plea counsel \"had no control over the Missouri state legislature, [and] that [he] had no control over what may happen in the future[.]\" That information was accurate and fairly apprised Doolin of the consequences of pleading guilty.
