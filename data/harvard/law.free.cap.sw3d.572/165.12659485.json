Hayes contends that\n   the circuit court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence upon which the jury could have believed a deadly weapon was used during the commissions of the robberies. For reasons explained more fully in a memorandum provided to the parties, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
