Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 5, 2016, just before 8:00 p.m., Texas D.P.S. Trooper A. Huayamave was on routine patrol on highway FM 529 in Harris County, Texas. The sky was clear, and traffic was heavy. Huayamave testified that he believed visibility was not less than 1,000 feet. As shown by State's Exhibit 1, the video from Huayamave's on-board dash camera,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   almost all the other cars on the roadway had their head lamps illuminated. The street lamps along the roadway were illuminated. Businesses located on the roadway were illuminated by private light poles. Although it was clear, the sky was not brightly lit. The dash camera continuously adjusted to the lighting conditions to accommodate for the decreasing amount of light in the sky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The camera began recording around 7:56 p.m., as Huayamave turned onto the roadway; appellant's car was visible in the distance and her headlights were off. Huayamave passed appellant on the roadway while traveling in the same direction as appellant. The headlights and taillights of appellant's car were not illuminated. After passing appellant's vehicle, Huayamave drove ahead, then stopped in the middle of the road in a turn lane. As pointed out on direct examination, only one other car did not have its headlamps illuminated, and passed Huayamave, while he was in the middle lane. Huayamave testified that he may have missed another car traveling past him without lights on because at this point, he was focused on appellant's vehicle. While stopped in the middle lane, Huayamave watched appellant's car to see if she was going to activate her lights. Appellant passed Huayamave's patrol vehicle and did not have her headlights illuminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At 7:56 p.m., Huayamave pulled behind Appellant's car and activated his emergency lights. Appellant immediately began to pull over. Once appellant came to a stop in an adjacent parking lot, Huayamave began his investigation. At 7:58 p.m., Huayamave informed appellant that her front headlamps were not illuminated. Appellant responded in confusion about whether her headlamps were actually activated or not. Appellant never indicated a belief that she was not required to have her headlamps illuminated. Appellant asked Huayamave \"so they're, like, completely off?\" Huayamave indicated the possibility that the headlamps were \"burnt.\" Huayamave's investigation quickly dispelled this possibility, though, when he reached into appellant's vehicle and manually activated the headlights. At 7:58, Huayamave asked appellant whether she's \"doing okay.\" At 7:59, Huayamave relayed to appellant that he observed her \"driving kind of slowly, too.\" The sky had noticeably darkened since the beginning of the video. Thereafter, the video shows Huayamave administering a series of field sobriety tests and placing appellant under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 05, 2016, appellant was charged by information with the misdemeanor offense of Class B driving while intoxicated. On June 20, 2017, the State amended the information to reflect a blood alcohol concentration level of at least .15, increasing the offense level to a Class A misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 23, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the appellant's motions to suppress. The trial court denied appellant's motions to suppress at the end of that hearing, and appellant pled guilty to the offense of Driving While Intoxicated. Appellant was sentenced to three days in Harris County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant's motion to suppress and motion to find Sections 541.401(5) and 547.302(a)(1) of the Transportation Code unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In her first issue, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion to suppress, on the grounds that Huayamave made a traffic stop for an offense that was not being committed, namely an alleged traffic law violation of driving without headlights at nighttime (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 30 minutes after sunset) or when visibility is less than 1,000 feet. According to appellant, sunset occurred at 7:37 pm, thus, the earliest time that Huayamave could have pulled appellant over under Section 547.302 of the Texas Transportation Code is 8:07 p.m. Appellant contends that the \"arrest was made 7 minutes before the law mandated that appellant\n   turn on her headlights. The stop certainly occurred earlier.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State concedes the entire thirty-minute time period had not actually expired at the time Huayamave initiated the stop; however, the State argues that Huayamave had a reasonable, albeit mistaken, suspicion that appellant was committing the crime of failing to display her lights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, we apply an abuse of discretion standard: we overturn the trial court's ruling only if it is outside the zone of reasonable disagreement.\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Reasonable suspicion to stop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this case, it is undisputed that sunset occurred at 7:37 p.m. It is also undisputed that Huayamave testified that he arrested appellant around 8:00 p.m. According to appellant, the arrest was made 7 minutes before the law mandated that appellant turn on her headlights, and the stop occurred even earlier. Thus, appellant argues \"the stop was illegal as it occurred before the time necessary for displaying headlights.\" The State contends Huayamave reasonably believed it to be nighttime, thus justifying the stop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The Fourth Amendment tolerates only reasonable mistakes, and those mistakes-whether of fact or of law-must be objectively reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Heien,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/#p532\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   539 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Huayamave's testimony is corroborated by the dash camera video. The trial court commented during the hearing that \"it's totally unreasonable to expect [Huayamave] to get on his radio and call headquarters [sic] what time does the sun set tonight\" when the trooper is in the middle lane on a five lane road with moderate to heavy traffic traveling in both directions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree and conclude that it was objectively reasonable for an officer in Huayamave's position to believe both that thirty minutes had elapsed after sunset, and that appellant's failure to turn on her headlights was a violation of Texas law. Because Huayamave's mistaken belief of the timing of sunset (approximately eleven minutes) was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining Huayamave had reasonable suspicion to stop appellant's car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cortez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656055\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/198/#p204\">\n    543 S.W.3d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, appellant argues that Section 541.401(5) is unconstitutionally vague because neither \"sunset\" nor \"sunrise\" are defined in the Texas Transportation Code. Thus, appellant contends that \"it would be impossible for a person to know at what point they must display their headlights\" without \"looking up the exact time that sunset or sunrise occurs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The State disagrees, maintaining that the term \"sunset\" is common throughout the law and common law, and accepted in almost every jurisdiction in this country.
