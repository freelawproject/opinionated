For reversal, Farris argues that the Commission's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.

He sustained injuries to his head, neck, and left shoulder. Appellee Express Services, Inc., a temporary employment agency that employed Farris, paid benefits for his injury claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farris received medical treatment from Dr. Ron Schechter until he was released to full duty on April 28, 2015. Express Services paid the fee associated with the April 28 visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 5, 2016, approximately two years after he was injured, Farris submitted a Form AR-C for additional benefits. On the form, he incorrectly named Great Dane Trailers as his employer. Express Services had assigned Farris to a Great Dane location, but he worked for the temporary agency. Farris later realized his mistake, and on May 13, he filed an amended Form AR-C, dated May 12, and correctly named Express Services as his employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ALJ conducted a hearing on Farris's entitlement to additional workers'-compensation benefits and found that his claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The Commission affirmed and adopted the ALJ's findings. Farris appealed to the Arkansas Court of Appeals. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Dillard v.

In\n    <em>\n     Dillard\n    </em>\n    , the claimant sought additional benefit for permanent total disability, rehabilitation, attorney fees, and medical expenses. On the claim form, Dillard's attorney checked the boxes located under the initial-benefits section instead of checking the boxes under the additional-benefits section. After failing to timely request a hearing, Dillard's employer moved for a dismissal. The ALJ granted the dismissal, and the Commission accepted the ALJ's findings. The court of appeals reversed and remanded and held that a mistake-incorrect checkmarks-on the Form AR-C should not time-bar a timely claim. The court of appeals stated that \"Dillard's failure to technically comply with the 'call' of the form\" should not be fatal to his claim.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141716\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/87/379/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141716\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/87/379/\">\n     at 384-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141716\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/87/379/\">\n     192 S.W.3d at 291\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court of appeals concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the Commission's finding that Dillard's claim had been properly dismissed, stating that to hold otherwise \"[was] a classic example of [putting] form over substance.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141716\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/87/379/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141716\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/87/379/\">\n     at 384\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141716\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/87/379/\">\n     192 S.W.3d at 291\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <em>\n     Dillard\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable from the present case. In\n    <em>\n     Dillard\n    </em>\n    , the claimant filed one timely claim form, but he mistakenly checked the wrong boxes. Here, Farris filed two claim forms. On his May 5 form, Farris did not merely check the wrong box but appeared to have sought additional benefits from Great Dane. On his May 13 form, he corrected his error by adding Express Services as his employer, but he filed it after the two-year period set forth in section 11-9-702(b)(1). Thus, Farris failed to meet his burden of timely filing his additional-benefits claim within the statutory time frame. We hold that the Commission did not err in finding that Farris's claim for additional benefits was barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we affirm the Commission's decision and vacate the court of appeals opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Affirmed; court of appeals opinion vacated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Hart, J., dissents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Josephine Linker Hart, Justice, dissenting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    I dissent. The majority vacates the Court of Appeals' decision without affording its analysis appropriate consideration, simply ignores this court's long-established \"relates back\" doctrine, and purports to distinguish this matter from existing caselaw that is actually directly on point. This decision amounts to a plain windfall for Appellees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    It is not unusual for this court to simply \"vacate the opinion of the court of appeals\" when it decides a case after having granted a petition for review of a Court of Appeals' decision, but in the context of a workers' compensation case, this practice cuts against our state constitution and statutory law. True, the Arkansas Constitution provides that the Supreme Court of Arkansas has \"statewide appellate jurisdiction\" and \"general superintending control over all courts of the state[,]\" and \"shall prescribe the rules of pleading, practice, and procedure for all courts[.]\" Ark. Const. Amend. 80 \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, 3. However, Farris has not appealed the decision of a \"court,\" but that of a commission,\n    specifically the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission (AWCC).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    This matters, as our Constitution treats workers' compensation claims differently from traditional claims that are brought and decided entirely in a court of law, i.e., within the context of the judicial branch of State government. Instead, the Constitution specifically excepts workers' compensation claims from the general sort and places them within the purview of the legislature. \"The General Assembly shall have power to enact laws prescribing the amount of compensation to be paid by employers for injuries to or death of employees, and to whom said payment shall be made. It shall have power to provide the\n    <em>\n     means, methods, and forum\n    </em>\n    for adjudicating claims arising under said laws, and for securing payment of same.\" Ark. Const. Art. 5 \u00a7 32 (emphasis added). Significantly, the laws enacted by the legislature pursuant to Art. 5 \u00a7 32 now provide that the Arkansas Court of Appeals shall be the forum for an appeal of an AWCC decision.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-9-711\">\n     Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-9-711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In other words, the authority for judicial review of most workers' compensation claims comes not directly from our constitution (from which this court gleans its authority to prescribe rules, including the rules governing petitions for review of decisions by the Court of Appeals), but from the laws enacted by the General Assembly. Those laws say a workers' compensation appeal goes to the Court of Appeals. Moreover, no law enacted by the General Assembly provides for this court to supplant a decision by the Court of Appeals in a workers' compensation case. For these reasons, it is not even apparent that we have jurisdiction over the present matter, which does not feature any constitutional issue or other significant circumstance that might independently invoke this court's jurisdiction. Perhaps support for this court's review of the Court of Appeals' decision can be found within the \"superintending control\" conferred by Amendment 80 \u00a7 4, but any such review must comport with a constitutionally acceptable procedure and standard of review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In short, I have definite reservations about simply casting the Court of Appeals' decision aside without greater consideration and deference. However, regardless of what the standard of review should be in the present matter, it is plain that the Court of Appeals got this case right, and the majority here is getting it wrong.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    To be clear, Farris\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    file his claim for additional benefits with the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission (AWCC) within the two-year window prescribed by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-9-702\">\n     Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-9-702\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1) (Repl. 2012). Two years from the date of Farris's injury was May 12, 2016, and Farris filed his AR-C form for additional benefits a week beforehand on May 5, 2016. This was, of course,\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    Appellees had already received notice that Farris's injury had occurred, acknowledged that Farris's injury was compensable, and even paid Farris initial benefits for that injury. The record is replete with contemporaneous documentation of these facts, including documentation that Appellees generated themselves and filed with AWCC long before Farris filed his AR-C form. Even so, the majority opines that, because Farris mistakenly listed Great Dane Trailers as his employer when he filed his AR-C form, and because that mistake was not corrected until May 13, 2016 (one day after the two-year limitation would have expired), Farris's claim for additional benefits is barred by the statute of limitations. The majority is incorrect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The May 13 amendment to Farris's AR-C form relates back to the May 5 filing date, and the majority's decision to the contrary entirely disregards decades'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    worth of this court's jurisprudence. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Blastech, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , this court observed,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    When an amendment changes the party against whom the claim is asserted or adds a party after the statute of limitations has run, it may relate back to the time of filing of the original complaint.
