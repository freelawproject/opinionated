Two of the three investors in the project sued the third investor alleging that the shopping center's failure is attributable to tortious conduct by the third investor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   All of the project's investors pursued business and professional activities in Houston after coming to the city from South Korea. One of the investors was Mr. Patrick Hiy Chang Lee, a CPA. His wife is Veronica Young Lee, who is referred to as \"Veronica\" Lee in this litigation. She took over her husband's participation and interest in the project after his health began to decline in 2005; he died in 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other investors are Kun Sik Kim and Jang Won Cho, a businessman with experience in the construction industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The investors created two entities to accomplish this project. One entity is \"Pandel, Inc.,\" which was incorporated in 2000. Kim, Lee, and Cho each own one third of the corporation. Cho signed the corporation's bylaws as a director and \"secretary of Pandel, Inc.\" with an effective date of November 20, 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The other entity is a limited partnership called \"Pandel Holdings, L.P.\" The limited partnership's general partner is Pandel, Inc., which has a one percent interest in the limited partnership; Kim, Lee, and Cho are limited partners, each with a 33 percent interest in the limited partnership. The parties planned to transfer ownership of Pandel Plaza from the corporation to the limited partnership, but the transfer did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The three investors contributed capital to buy the land in 2001, followed by construction of a 9,000-square-foot building. Pandel, Inc. borrowed $500,000 from American First National Bank in 2004 as a construction loan. The investors also made subsequent individual capital contributions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The project generated revenue from rent paid by tenants. Additional revenue resulted from selling an easement covering a portion of the land to the City of Houston; however, the city later constructed a ramp that impeded access to the shopping center and hid it from view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The shopping center's occupancy and rent revenue dwindled over time, and relations between the three investors became strained to the point where Kim and Lee sued Cho, the limited partnership, and the corporation in 2009. In July 2012, all parties filed a Rule 11 agreement under which they agreed to file a joint motion to dismiss the 2009 suit without prejudice. The dismissal order was signed on August 30, 2012, but acrimony among the investors continued unabated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties offer sharply different explanations for the shopping center's demise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to appellant Cho, appellees Kim and Lee refused to contribute any funds to the business after 2008; refused to participate in managing the property or addressing its problems; and thereby put the burden entirely on Cho to manage the property and make further contributions from his personal funds to keep the business afloat as he struggled to reverse the shopping center's sagging fortunes. Acting\n   as Pandel, Inc.'s president, Cho took out a short term loan in October 2012 for $161,071.88 from Apex Star Properties, Inc. at an 18 percent annual interest rate. Cho contends Pandel, Inc. needed to borrow this sum to keep the property out of foreclosure because Kim and Lee refused to contribute additional capital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In contrast, Kim and Lee contend that Cho \"abused their trust and confidence by secretly gaining personal benefits at their expense and driving the business off of a financial cliff.\" According to Kim and Lee, Cho did so by\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 refusing \"to contribute his fair share of capital, opting instead to freeride on the resources others supplied;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 awarding Pandel Plaza's construction contract to a company he owned;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 promising \"that building construction costs would amount to no more than $423,000,\" which equates to $47 per square foot multiplied by the shopping center's 9,000 square foot capacity, and then charging $67 per square foot for a total construction cost of $629,630;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 constructing the shopping center badly, which made finding and keeping tenants more difficult;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 entering a subsequent construction contract without their knowledge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 paying excessive monthly management fees to a company owned by Cho;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 refusing to \"disclose critical financial information about what the business was doing and why;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 failing to explain why Kim and Lee needed to make capital contributions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 failing to notify Kim and Lee of the easement sale to the City of Houston, or to obtain their approval; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 using the shopping center's accounts to pay for his own attorney's fees incurred in the ongoing legal disputes with Kim and Lee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Kim and Lee contend that Cho's mismanagement and self-dealing caused the shopping center to lose tenants, fall into disrepair, and become \"unmarketable at present.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Kim and Lee sued Cho again in February 2013; among other things, they asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and conversion. Kim and Lee removed Cho as an officer and director of Pandel, Inc. in 2015, after which the shopping center \"became vacant, fell to ruin, and has been subjected to fines from the City of Houston.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The case proceeded to trial in 2016. The trial court submitted the claims against Cho to the jury, which answered a series of charge questions in favor of Kim and Lee.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"No\" in response to Question 1, which asked: \"Did Jang Won Cho comply with his fiduciary duty to Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee?\" Question 1 identified five requirements for the jury to consider in deciding whether Cho complied with his fiduciary duty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"Yes\" in response to Question 4, which asked: \"Did Jang Won Cho fail to comply with the agreement to create a partnership owned equally by Jang Won Cho, Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee for the purpose of holding the real estate located at 8213 Homestead Road, Houston, Texas 77028?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"Yes\" in response to Question 7, which asked: \"Did Jang Won Cho commit fraud against Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee?\" This question was accompanied\n   by instructions defining fraud in two ways - once as the making of an affirmative \"material misrepresentation,\" and then as a \"failure to disclose a material fact.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"Yes\" to Question 10, which asked: \"Did Jang Won Cho make a negligent misrepresentation on which Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee justifiably relied?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"Yes\" to Question 13, which asked: \"Did Jang Won Cho convert property belonging to Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"Yes\" to Question 16, which asked: \"Do you find by clear and convincing evidence that the harm to Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee resulted from malice, fraud, or gross negligence?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 The jury answered \"Yes\" to Question 18, which asked: \"Do you find by clear and convincing evidence that Jang Won Cho knowingly or intentionally misapplied fiduciary property?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The jury awarded damages in answers to a series of identical questions predicated on the \"Yes\" answers to Questions 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. Based on its liability findings with respect to breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and conversion, the jury awarded identical dollar amounts for each of the following elements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 \"Construction Costs\" totaling $129,630;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 \"Misapplication of initial investment\" totaling $352,600;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 \"Management Fees\" totaling $120,110;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 \"Interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc.\" totaling $86,978;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 \"Attorney's fees for Mr. Cho's defense\" totaling $44,195; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 \"Undistributed profits\" totaling $394,770.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The jury also awarded exemplary damages totaling $6,769,698 predicated on the unanimous \"Yes\" answer to Question 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court signed a final judgment against Cho, and in favor of Kim and Lee, awarding $1,128,283 as actual damages for the \"fraud and fiduciary duty claims;\" $6,769,698 as exemplary damages; and $354,713.63 as prejudgment interest. Cho timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Cho challenges the trial court's final judgment in eight issues and asserts as follows.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   1. Kim and Lee cannot \"recover for breach of fiduciary duty where no fiduciary duty was owed as a matter of law....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   2. The evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that Cho committed fraud, and that Kim and Lee suffered damages caused by fraud.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   3. Kim and Lee must \"elect between recovering out-of-pocket reliance damages and benefit-of-the-bargain expectancy damages for fraud....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   4. The evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury's finding that Kim's and Lee's conduct caused damages in the amounts found by the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   5. A new trial should be granted based upon cumulative error because \"the trial court repeatedly commented on the weight of the evidence and [Cho's] ... credibility, and ... the record contains numerous translation errors that undermined the reliability of the record....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   6. Exemplary damages are not available in the absence of legally and factually sufficient evidence of fraud, malice, or gross negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   7. The exemplary damages awarded in the judgment are unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   8. The trial court erred in computing prejudgment interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We address these issues in turn, but not in the order in which they are raised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Liability and Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Based on the jury's answers and the trial court's final judgment, Kim and Lee have two legal routes to a recovery against Cho in connection with their failed shopping center project. One route is based on breach of fiduciary duty; the other is based on fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatfield v. Solomon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321734\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/316/50/#p59\">\n    316 S.W.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (\"[I]f a party receives favorable findings on two or more theories of recovery that are consistent with each other and result in the same damages, then the trial court may render judgment awarding a single recovery of these damages and this judgment may be based on all of these theories.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Kim and Lee contend that both the breach of fiduciary duty and fraud routes to recovery are legally viable on this record and support the final judgment. They do not argue that other alternative bases exist for the judgment, and they do not rely on the additional findings regarding breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, or conversion to support the judgment. Like the parties, we too focus our liability analysis on breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Cho's first issue challenges the submission of Question 1 to the jury asking whether he complied with his fiduciary duties. Cho contends that he owed no fiduciary duties to Kim and Lee as a matter of law because (1) \"the parties entered into formalized business relationships that do not give rise to such duties;\" and (2) informal fiduciary duties cannot arise from \"assertions of trust and confidence that did not precede the formal, written duties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Cho's appellate arguments challenge only the existence of a fiduciary duty; Cho does not attack the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the jury's \"No\" answer to Question 1 asking whether he complied with the elevated standards of conduct imposed on a fiduciary. According to Cho, no informal fiduciary relationship existed here because \"the parties did not have a previous fiduciary relationship ... before the transaction made the basis of this suit.\" Cho asserts as follows: \"These were experienced businessmen, but they had no fiduciary relationship prior to and apart from the agreement made the basis of this suit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Kim and Lee contend that both a formal and an informal fiduciary relationship were established on this record. Kim and Lee argue that a formal fiduciary relationship existed among Kim, Lee, and Cho \"because they were partners.\" Kim and Lee argue further that an informal fiduciary relationship existed among Kim, Lee, and Cho based on a relationship of trust and confidence. They also argue that Cho's counsel conceded the existence of a relationship of trust and confidence in an exchange with the trial court during the hearing on motions for directed verdict at the close of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Informal fiduciary relationship\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Cho contends that, as a matter of law, he owed no fiduciary duties to Kim and Lee pursuant to an informal fiduciary relationship \"because there was no prior fiduciary relationship that existed before the parties entered into this written, formalized real-estate enterprise.\" According to Cho, \"The parties did not have a previous fiduciary relationship - or, more correctly, Kim and the Lees never relied on Cho for business advice - before the transaction made the basis of this suit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Kim and Lee urge this court to \"reject Mr. Cho's denial of fiduciary duties because Mr. Cho conceded that fiduciary duties existed and conceded that the Plaintiffs were entitled to a directed verdict on this issue.\" They base this contention on an exchange that occurred during a hearing on motions for directed verdict after both sides rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Kim's and Lee's counsel moved for a directed verdict in their favor on \"the issue of whether or not there's an existence of a fiduciary relationship between Mr. Cho and the plaintiffs.\" Their counsel argued that this relationship existed as a matter of law. Accordingly, Kim's and Lee's counsel asserted there was no need for a threshold jury question asking whether such a relationship existed; instead, their counsel contended that the jury should be instructed that the fiduciary relationship existed and asked directly whether Cho complied with his fiduciary duty arising from an informal\n   fiduciary relationship. The trial court then engaged in this exchange with Cho's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   THE COURT: Are you going to argue against that? As I look at you with....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [CHO'S COUNSEL]: Is that his only motion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   [COUNSEL FOR KIM AND LEE]: That would be the only motion, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [CHO'S COUNSEL]: It existed, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   THE COURT: Yeah, exactly. So, see, you're a nice, honest guy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Based on this exchange, the trial court announced its intention to remove the threshold jury question from the charge asking whether a relationship of trust and confidence existed. Question 1 as submitted to the jury placed the burden of proof on Cho and asked, \"Did Jang Won Cho comply with his fiduciary duty to Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee?\" The jury was instructed as follows in Question 1: \"Because a relationship of trust and confidence existed between them, Jang Won Cho owed Kun Sik Kim and Veronica Young Lee a fiduciary duty.\" The jury answered \"No\" to Question 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   According to Kim's and Lee's briefing, \"By yielding to a directed verdict 'on the issue of whether or not there's an existence of a fiduciary relationship between Mr. Cho and the plaintiffs,' ... Mr. Cho bound himself to the position that\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   proved all of a fiduciary duty's legal prerequisite\" (original emphasis). They conclude as follows: \"Since Mr. Cho's trial counsel had already agreed to the directed verdict during charge formation, the district court was not obliged to grant any post-judgment relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Kim's and Lee's briefing does not identify the exact legal basis - whether it be waiver, judicial admission, invited error, or another doctrine - for a contention that \"Mr. Cho bound himself\" irrevocably to an admission that the evidence establishes a relationship of trust and confidence existing before and apart from the parties' shopping center transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Cho did not waive his immateriality challenge predicated on a no evidence complaint by failing to object at trial to Question 1 on this basis. This is so because a no evidence objection also can be raised after trial in a timely filed Rule 301 motion to disregard - as Cho did by moving to disregard the jury's answer to Question 1 - even without a charge objection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    T.O.

Therefore, we will examine whether the evidence supports the jury's finding under either a fraud by misrepresentation theory or fraud by nondisclosure theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Fraud by nondisclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   We begin by analyzing whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of fraud by nondisclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The briefing does not identify any specific fraudulent nondisclosure attributed by Kim and Lee to Cho. As submitted in the jury charge, Kim and Lee had to prove that (1) Cho intended to induce them to \"take some action by failing to disclose the fact[s],\" and (2) they suffered injury \"as a result of acting without knowledge of the undisclosed fact[s].\" To the extent the contention is that Cho failed to disclose management fees incurred, interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc., attorney's fees paid, and undistributed profits, Kim and Lee acknowledge in their brief (and the record confirms) that they took no action related to management fees, interest, attorney's fees, and profits based on Cho's asserted failure to disclose facts pertaining to these amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Although a fraud by nondisclosure theory may include a claim that the defendant intended to induce inaction by the plaintiff, Question 7 required an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   by Kim and Lee; Question 7 did not give the jury an avenue to find that Cho intended to induce Kim and Lee to\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     refrain\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   from acting because of a fraudulent nondisclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adiuku\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20778487\">\n    2015 WL 778487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 ;\n   <em>\n    Horizon Shipbuilding, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7323997\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/324/840/#p850\">\n    324 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   850 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Comm. on Pattern Jury Charges, State Bar of Tex.,\n   <em>\n    Texas Pattern Jury Charges: Business, Consumer, Insurance &amp; Employment\n   </em>\n   PJC 105.4 cmt.

It follows that Kim and Lee cannot recover based on asserted inaction induced by Cho's nondisclosure because inaction was omitted from the charge without objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Therefore, Kim and Lee cannot prevail on a fraud by nondisclosure theory and recover asserted damages for management fees, interest, attorney's fees, and profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Fraud by misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   We next consider whether the evidence supports the jury's fraud finding under a fraud by misrepresentation theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Management fees, interest, attorney's fees, and profits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Cho argues there is no evidence in the record that he made any representations to Kim or Lee about management fees incurred, interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc., attorney's fees paid, and profits. We agree. Kim and Lee identify no such representations; instead, they portray these damage elements as part of a recovery for breach of fiduciary duty. As discussed above, there is no legally viable\n   basis for the existence of a formal or informal fiduciary duty on this record. And in the absence of misrepresentations, Kim and Lee cannot prevail on a fraud by misrepresentation theory in connection with alleged damages relating to management fees, interest, attorney's fees, and profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Construction costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Cho asserts that Kim and Lee cannot establish fraud by misrepresentation with respect to construction costs because \"Kim could not justifiably rely on\" Cho's oral representation that the construction price for Pandel Plaza would be $47 per square foot when the express terms of the construction contract reflect the cost to be $69 per square foot. Cho asserts that Kim and Lee must establish\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     justifiable\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   reliance by Kim in order to recover for fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   We reject this contention because Question 7 as submitted did not require that reliance on a fraudulent misrepresentation be justifiable. Question 7's wording stands in contrast to Question 10, which required justifiable reliance in submitting the claim for negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   With respect to fraud as submitted in Question 7, \"[N]o party, either by objection or requested question, definition, or instruction, complained of the charge's failure to require justifiable reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Ghosh v.

Question 7 required only reliance, and we examine the record in light of that less stringent requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Cho relies heavily on the construction contract's $69-per-square-foot cost. Kim testified that Cho told him the construction price would be $47 per square foot, which Kim believed would be $423,000 for the 9,000-square-foot building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Kim testified that Cho stated Pandel Plaza \"would cost to other people $57 per square foot to build\" but \"on this particular project it would cost ... $47 per square foot because this is partially my own building. So, the construction cost of $500,000 from the bank loan will do the job; and there will be some remainder.\" Kim also testified he talked to \"friends and third parties\" to verify that $47 was indeed a good construction price; Kim was told it was a good price because the market price at the time was $57 per square foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The January 17, 2004 construction contract signed by Kim and Mr. Lee specified a $629,630 construction price, which arguably indicates a price of approximately $69 per square foot. Kim testified as follows regarding the contract: \"That's my signature, but I haven't ever seen this document before. ... This is the first time I see this document. I have never seen and done [sic] my signature on it.\" Kim testified that he did not remember the construction price in the contract he signed but stated that he would not have signed a contract with a $629,630 construction price. Kim also testified that the $500,000 construction loan Pandel, Inc. obtained from the bank was \"based on 47-dollar per square foot calculation; and, therefore, total sum of five - half a million dollars would be sufficient enough.\" Based on this record, there is legally and factually sufficient evidence of reliance on Cho's representation that the construction price for Pandel Plaza would be $47 per square foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Because there is legally and factually sufficient evidence of reliance on a stated construction price of $47 per square foot, and Question 7 did not require that the reliance be justifiable, we reject Cho's contention that a lack of justifiable reliance means there is no \"viable fraud claim based on the construction price.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Contribution and ownership\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Cho contends the jury's fraud finding is not supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence because (1) Cho contributed at least an investment amount equal to Kim and Lee, so there is no evidence that he misrepresented to Kim and Lee that he would invest an equal share in the business; and (2) \"[a]t all relevant times, the parties each have owned a one-third interest in the real property,\" so there is no evidence that Cho misrepresented to Kim and Lee they would each own one third of the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Cho's argument does not correspond to any of the damages awarded by the jury in Question 9 as a result of finding Cho liable for fraud in Question 7. The jury awarded Kim and Lee damages for \"Construction Costs;\" \"Misapplication of initial investment;\" \"Management Fees;\" \"Interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc.;\" \"Attorney's fees for Mr. Cho's defense;\" and \"Undistributed profits.\" There is no evidence that any alleged misrepresentation relating to Cho's contribution or to Kim's and Lee's ownership in the business caused these damages submitted and awarded by the jury in Question 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Conclusion: Sufficient evidence supports the jury's \"Yes\" answer to Question 7\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The jury answered \"Yes\" to Question 7 in a single answer blank that encompasses both fraud by misrepresentation and fraud by nondisclosure. At a minimum, legally and factually sufficient evidence exists in this record to support a single \"Yes\" answer based on an affirmative misrepresentation and reliance in connection with the shopping center's construction cost. Therefore, we overrule Cho's second issue insofar as he challenges the jury's affirmative finding that he committed fraud. Based on our disposition of Cho's second issue, Kim and Lee cannot recover damages for management fees, interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc., attorney's fees for Cho's defense, and undistributed profits awarded in Question 9 predicated on the jury's fraud finding in response to Question 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Damages for misrepresentation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Cho asserts the trial court's actual damages award (1) constitutes an impermissible double recovery; and (2) is not supported by legally and factually sufficient evidence. We address these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Double recovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Predicated on the jury's affirmative answer to Question 7, Question 9 asked the jury to respond with a sum of money that \"would fairly and reasonably compensate [Kim and Lee] for their damages, if any, that resulted from such fraud[.]\" Question 9 listed six elements of damages, each followed by a blank for the jury's response. The jury responded with dollar amounts for each of the six elements, for a total of $1,128,283. The trial court's final judgment awarded this amount to Kim and Lee as actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As discussed above, four of the six damages elements submitted to the jury in Question 9 do not present viable bases for a fraud recovery on this record because there is no evidence of misrepresentations pertaining to these elements; these four are \"Management Fees,\" \"Interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc.,\" \"Attorneys\n   fees for Mr. Cho's defense,\" and \"Undistributed profits.\" The two remaining damages elements submitted in Question 9 are \"Misapplication of initial investment\" and \"Construction Costs.\" The jury answered \"$352,600\" for \"Misapplication of initial investment\" and \"$129,630\" for \"Construction Costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Cho asserts as an initial matter that, by permitting Kim and Lee to recover damages for both \"Misapplication of initial investment\" and \"Construction Costs,\" the trial court's final judgment impermissibly grants Kim and Lee a double recovery. Kim and Lee contend that Cho waived any error with respect to this contention. We reject their waiver argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   To preserve error for appellate review, the complaining party must (1) make a timely objection to the trial court that \"state[s] the grounds for the ruling that the complaining party [seeks] from the trial court with sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of the complaint, unless the specific grounds were apparent from the context;\" and (2) obtain a ruling.

Cho asserts that Kim and Lee \"still own an interest\" in Pandel Plaza and argues that the jury's $352,600 finding fails to account for the Plaza's \"established market value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Cho supports his argument with reference to the following: (1) a 2010 easement granted by Pandel, Inc. to the City of\n   Houston; (2) a real estate appraisal completed prior to the granting of the easement; and (3) a 2016 agreement to sell Pandel Plaza to Michael Kanaan Development Inc. for $675,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The City of Houston paid $324,206 for the 2010 easement, which applied to a strip of land along the east side of Pandel Plaza. Before the easement was granted, Alan L. Dominy appraised Pandel Plaza and valued the property as of April 22, 2009. Dominy opined in his appraisal report that the entire Pandel Plaza parcel was worth $826,060 before the easement; after the easement, Dominy appraised the parcel's value at $501,854. In 2016, Pandel, Inc. agreed to sell Pandel Plaza to Michael Kanaan Development Inc. for $675,000. According to Kim's testimony, the transaction did not close and the sale ultimately fell through.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The record also contains significant evidence at the other end of the valuation spectrum and, as a whole, does not warrant disturbing jury's $352,600 finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Discussing Pandel Plaza, Kim acknowledged that the property was encumbered by a $70,000 tax lien, a $160,000 loan lien, and $55,000 in property taxes. Kim testified that the company holding the $160,000 note was looking to foreclose on the property. Kim testified that he did not \"have any hope of recovering [his] investment\" in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   During her testimony, Lee also acknowledged the property's monetary encumbrances. Discussing the property's current condition, Lee testified that the building had \"electricity problems;\" that a water pipe had exploded; and that the \"construction was done very poorly.\" Lee testified that a potential tenant interested in leasing commercial space at the property had to be turned away \"because of the building problem.\" As a result of the 2010 easement granted to the City of Houston, a ramp was constructed in front of the property; the ramp interfered with access to the property and hid it from view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   With respect to the March 2016 sale of Pandel Plaza for $675,000, Lee testified that the sale \"didn't go through\" and that additional attempts to sell the property were unsuccessful. Lee testified that the investment in Pandel Plaza was worth \"zero\" and lost \"completely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Turning to Cho's legal sufficiency challenge, reasonable jurors could credit evidence favorable to the $352,600 finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943104\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/802/#p827\">\n    168 S.W.3d at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So, the construction cost of $500,000 from the bank loan will do the job; and there will be some remainder.\" Kim also testified that he verified the $47-per-square-foot cost by talking to \"friends and third parties;\" Kim was told that it was a good price because the market price at the time of construction was $57 per square foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The January 17, 2004 construction contract signed by Kim and Mr. Lee specified a $629,630 construction price, which indicates a price of approximately $69 per square foot. With respect to the contract, Kim testified: \"That's my signature, but I haven't ever seen this document before.... This is the first time I see this document. I have never seen and done [sic] my signature on it.\" Kim stated that he would not have signed a contract with a $629,630 construction price. Kim also testified that the $500,000 loan Pandel, Inc. received from the bank was \"based on 47-dollar per square foot calculation; and, therefore, total sum of five - half a million dollars would be sufficient enough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   Cho contends that the fraud evidence cannot survive review under the clear and convincing evidentiary standard applicable to Question 16 because the fraud evidence cannot survive review under the lower preponderance of the evidence standard applicable to Question 7. Cho's attack on the fraud finding in response to Question 7 focused on his contention that insufficient evidence supports a \"Yes\" answer because there was no justifiable reliance with respect to representations regarding construction costs. We rejected that contention above because, in contrast to the negligent misrepresentation submission in Question 10, the fraud submission in Question 7 requires only reliance - not justifiable reliance. Question 16 is predicated on the \"Yes\" answer to Question 7 and does not define fraud independently of Question 7. Therefore, on this record, Cho cannot establish a basis for overturning the jury's finding in response to Question 16 on grounds that the jury's fraud finding in response to Question 7 should be overturned.

Reversing the trial court's calculation, we stated: \"[E]ven assuming the March 11, 2016 email provided written notice to [the defendant] of that portion of [the plaintiff's] contract claim ..., it would not support accrual of prejudgment interest on [the plaintiff's] entire contract claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658788\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/566/801/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12658788\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/566/801/\">\n    at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Here, we conclude that Kim's and Lee's 2009 original petition constituted \"written notice of a claim\" within the meaning of section 304.102.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20304.102\">\n    Tex.

The \"Factual Background\" of Kim's and Lee's original petition stated that (1) a loan was obtained to construct a commercial building; and (2) the parties invested capital for the construction of the building. Kim and Lee alleged that Cho \"secreted the facts and circumstances of the purchase, development, construction, leasing, and business dealings of the property from Kim and Lee.\" The 2009 original petition asserted a claim for common-law fraud, incorporating the petition's \"Factual Background\" section and asserting that Cho \"made material\n   representations to Kim and Lee that were false[.]\" Unlike the \"notices\" we examined in\n   <em>\n    I-10 Colony, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Texas Black Iron, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Kim's and Lee's 2009 original petition specifically asserted a fraud claim and alleged facts underlying the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I-10 Colony, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094663\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/393/467/#p479\">\n    393 S.W.3d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479-80 ;\n   <em>\n    Tex.

The 2009 original petition was sufficient to provide Cho with written notice of Kim's and Lee's fraud claim, which is the same claim at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20304.102\">\n    Tex.

This conclusion is not changed by a circumstance in which Kim and Lee dismissed their initial suit in August 2012 and promptly refiled it in February 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   We reject Cho's eighth issue insofar as he challenges the date on which prejudgment interest began accruing.

Conduct of Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   In his fifth issue, Cho contends that a new trial should be granted based on cumulative error because (1) the trial court impermissibly commented on the weight of the evidence by orally announcing a running tally of how many times Cho was admonished for providing non-responsive answers; and (2) translation problems arose during trial as questions posed in English were translated for the Korean-speaking witnesses, and these witnesses' answers in Korean were translated into English. We conclude that these asserted errors are not incurable and provide no basis for reversal because Cho did not raise objections on these grounds and seek relief in the trial court through an instruction or otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paul v.

We render a take-nothing judgment against Kim and Lee on their fiduciary duty claim. We affirm the trial court's judgment as it relates to liability for fraud. We reverse the trial court's judgment insofar as it awards fraud damages to Kim and Lee with respect to management fees, interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc., attorney's fees for Cho's defense, and undistributed profits. We render a take-nothing judgment with respect to fraud damages for management fees, interest paid to Apex Star Properties, Inc., attorney's fees for Cho's defense, and undistributed profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   In light of Kim's and Lee's failure to elect between fraud damages for construction costs and fraud damages for misapplication of initial investment, the trial court should have rendered judgment awarding Kim and Lee recovery of actual damages only on the $352,600 award of fraud damages for misapplication of initial investment as found in response to Question 9(2) because that finding yields the greater recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   In light of this reduction in the amount of actual damages for fraud, the award of exemplary damages as found by the jury is excessive. We suggested a remittitur of the amount of exemplary damages from $6,769,698 to $1,057,800.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. R. Civ. P. 46.3. Kim and Lee timely accepted the suggested remittitur. We therefore modify the trial court's judgment to reduce the amount of exemplary damages to $1,057,800, and affirm the judgment as modified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201438672\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   We reverse and remand to the trial court for recalculation of prejudgment interest in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    Unless otherwise specified, all references to \"Lee\" in this opinion refer to Veronica Lee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-265\">\n    In light of this disposition, we do not address Cho's contention that Kim and Lee lacked standing to recover damages for construction costs that, according to Cho, were paid by the Pandel entities rather than Kim and Lee individually.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
