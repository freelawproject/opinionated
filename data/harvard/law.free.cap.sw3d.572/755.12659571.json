He asserts that officers lacked probable cause to support a warrantless arrest and unduly prolonged his detention, making it illegal. The court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At approximately 8:45 p.m. on June 7, 2016, Sergeant Kevin O'Brien of the Houston Police Department (\"HPD\") saw appellant motor through an intersection without heeding a stop sign. Appellant was driving well-above the legal speed limit of 30 miles per hour. Then, appellant failed to stop for a red light before making a turn. Having witnessed these traffic violations from his patrol car, Officer O'Brien pursued appellant to conduct a traffic stop. Officer O'Brien activated the patrol car's lights and then the sirens. Though appellant slowed down, he did not stop. Appellant then accelerated to a speed of about 50 miles per hour and drove through a residential area with cars parked on either side of the street before stopping at an abandoned service station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Officer O'Brien approached the driver's side of the car and asked appellant to produce his driver's license and proof of financial responsibility. Appellant was slow to respond to the request. Officer O'Brien smelled the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from appellant's breath and noticed that appellant's eyes were glassy, and appellant was slurring his speech. Officer O'Brien asked appellant to step out of the car because he \"wanted to observe [appellant's] balance out of the vehicle\" and he wanted to ask \"standard questions when you suspect that someone may have been drinking - have you been drinking, how much have you been drinking,\n   are you taking any medication, do you have any medical issues - those type[s] of questions.\" As Officer O'Brien asked appellant questions, he noticed that appellant was swaying. Officer O'Brien did not necessarily know that appellant was intoxicated, but he suspected that appellant had been drinking both because of the traffic violations and because appellant kept driving for a mile despite lights and sirens calling him to pull over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officer O'Brien wanted to determine whether appellant was impaired and tried to see if a DWI officer could come to the scene. Officer O'Brien learned that a DWI unit was not available, so he would need to take appellant to \"central intox\" where appellant would be evaluated. Officer O'Brien's patrol car did not have a \"dash cam\" to record his interactions with appellant because supervisor vehicles are not equipped with dashboard cameras. Officer O'Brien explained that if he had conducted the DWI investigation on the scene, there would not have been a video for the jury to view. Taking appellant to the \"central intox\" facility was the \"quickest means to have [appellant] tested with video proof.\" Officer O'Brien did not investigate where appellant had been, where he was going, or whether he had been drinking. Instead, he placed appellant in handcuffs and put appellant in the back seat of the patrol car. According to Officer O'Brien, appellant was not free to leave. Following an inventory search of appellant's car, it was towed. Officer O'Brien transported appellant to \"central intox\" in the patrol car. According to Officer O'Brien, appellant was not under arrest while being transported to the police station but was being detained for further investigation. Officer O'Brien testified that he had probable cause to take appellant to \"central intox.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Tiara Smith of the Houston Police Department DWI Task Force first saw appellant when Officer O'Brien brought him to \"central intox.\" Officer Smith thought appellant was intoxicated because he had slurred speech, glassy eyes, and a strong odor of alcohol and he was swaying while he was standing. Appellant refused to answer any questions. Officer Smith administered the standard field-sobriety tests at the police station. Appellant exhibited. signs of intoxication during the field-sobriety tests. Believing appellant to be intoxicated, Officer Smith read appellant a statutory warning known as a \"DIC-24,\" informing him that the police were requesting a sample of appellant's breath or blood. Appellant consented to providing a breath sample. The results of the breath tests showed that appellant's blood-alcohol content was .126 and .127, above the legal limit of .08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Officer O'Brien testified at trial, appellant made an oral motion to suppress, arguing police arrested him without probable cause. Appellant asserted that Officer O'Brien, who testified that appellant was not free to leave, only observed traffic violations, but did not ask appellant investigative questions, such as where appellant had been, where he was going, or what beverages he had consumed. Appellant pointed out that he never refused to answer any questions, Officer O'Brien conducted no field sobriety tests, and appellant never refused to perform any field sobriety tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellant also argued that the episode amounted to an illegal detention. Appellant pointed out that Officer O'Brien took appellant's license, appellant was not free to leave, he was locked in a jail cell, his car was towed, and Officer O'Brien did not conduct an investigation regarding a possible DWI offense. Appellant asserted that, although the traffic stop occurred at 8:45 p.m., the DWI investigation did not begin until 10:45 p.m., two hours later. The State\n   responded that an officer reasonably may detain an individual to complete a DWI investigation and the record evidence shows reasonable suspicion to detain appellant because Officer O'Brien had sufficient articulable facts to suspect that appellant was intoxicated, requiring further investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court stated that it was not going to grant the motion to suppress at that time because it \"want[ed] to see what the next step is.\" The trial resumed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Officer Smith testified on direct examination, appellant re-urged his motion to suppress. Appellant's attorney stated that appellant was not waiving his argument that there was no probable cause for appellant's arrest. Appellant's attorney argued that the investigative detention lasted longer than reasonably necessary because the police detained appellant for two hours before beginning the investigation. The trial court denied the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury found appellant guilty of driving while intoxicated. The trial court assessed a $500 fine and sentenced appellant to confinement in county jail for 180 days but suspended the sentence and placed appellant on probation for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In two issues, appellant claims on appeal that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to grant his motion to suppress because (1) Officer O'Brien arrested appellant without probable cause; and (2) the police subjected appellant to an unlawful detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellate courts review a trial a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard.\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Tamayo v.

When, as in this case, the trial court does not make formal findings of fact, this court will uphold the trial court's ruling on any theory of law applicable to the case and presume the court made implicit findings in support of its ruling if the record supports those findings.\n   <em>\n    Cheek v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his first issue, appellant argues that, although Officer O'Brien detained him lawfully at the outset of the traffic stop, Officer O'Brien lacked probable cause to make a warrantless arrest for driving while intoxicated. The State argues that Officer O'Brien had probable cause to arrest appellant after witnessing him commit two traffic offenses for which an officer may properly make an arrest. Alternatively, the State asserts that Officer O'Brien had probable cause to arrest appellant based on appellant's driving while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Officer O'Brien arrested appellant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, both appellant and the State say Officer O'Brien arrested appellant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An \"arrest\" under the Fourth Amendment is a greater restraint upon\n   one's freedom to leave or move than is a temporary detention, which also restrains one's freedom.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2008). Article 15.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, entitled \"When a person is arrested,\" provides that \"[a] person is arrested when he has been actually placed under restraint or taken into custody.\" Tex. Code Crim. Pro. Ann art. 15.22 (West, Westlaw through 2017 R.S.). As Professor Dix has noted, this statute is \"of no help\" in determining whether that person has been subjected to a Fourth Amendment arrest or an investigatory detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n    271 S.W.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts have dubbed the statute \"legislatively obsolete\" because it does not distinguish between custodial arrests and temporary detentions.\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n    271 S.W.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although the law provides no \"bright line\" rule to distinguish the two, Texas courts generally characterize the seizure of a person as an \"arrest\" or \"detention\" depending upon several factors, including the amount of force displayed, the duration of the detention, the efficiency of the investigative process and whether it was conducted at the original location or the person was transported to another location, the officer's expressed intent-that is, whether the officer told the detainee that the detainee was under arrest or was being detained only for a temporary investigation, and any other relevant factors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n    at 290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the degree of incapacitation appears more than necessary to safeguard the officers and assure the suspect's presence during a period of investigation, these facts suggest the detention is an arrest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n    at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A seizure is an investigative detention rather than an arrest, if, given the totality of the circumstances, \"a reasonable person would believe the seizure was to be sufficiently nonintrusive as to be only an 'investigative detention.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n    at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting DIX AND DAWSON , \u00a7 7.34, at 466). An officer's subjective intent as to whether the officer is arresting a suspect is simply not relevant unless the officer communicates that intent to the suspect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013486\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/932/502/#p505\">\n    932 S.W.2d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 505 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). Thus, when evaluating whether an arrest occurred, the court must focus on objective criteria, not the officer's subjective view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The record shows that Officer O'Brien handcuffed appellant and put appellant in the back of the patrol car. An inventory search was performed on appellant's car and it was towed. Appellant was not free to leave. Officer O'Brien transported appellant to \"central intox,\" six to seven miles away. No evidence showed that Officer O'Brien told appellant that appellant was under arrest or that he told appellant that he was being detained only for a temporary investigation. Officer O'Brien opined that while he was transporting appellant to \"central intox,\" appellant was not under arrest and was only being detained for further investigation. Crucially, this testimony as to Officer O'Brien's subjective belief that appellant was not under arrest is not relevant to deciding whether appellant was under arrest because no evidence shows that anyone communicated Officer O'Brien's subjective intent to appellant on the night Officer O'Brien seized appellant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10013486\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/932/502/#p505\">\n    932 S.W.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Given the totality of the circumstances reflected by the record before the trial court at the time of its ruling, a reasonable person in appellant's position would not have believed that the seizure was sufficiently nonintrusive as to be only an investigative detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162732\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/281/#p290\">\n    271 S.W.3d at 290-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There are gaps in the plurality's analysis. I would add the following two points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, under our statutory law, an officer has only two options when a misdemeanor traffic arrest is made: (1) release the person if he signs a written promise to appear in court, or (2) immediately bring the person before a magistrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Instead, appellant was transported to \"central intox,\" and his vehicle was inventoried and towed away. The evidence accordingly established that the traffic investigation was over, and that appellant was then taken into custody for driving while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The plurality only considers whether the officer had probable cause to arrest appellant for the traffic violation. Although I agree with the plurality's conclusion with regards to that question (and even despite the officer's testimony that he did not complete an arrest), this court should also consider whether the officer had probable cause to arrest appellant for driving while intoxicated, even before appellant was transported to central intox. As to that question, I believe that the answer is clearly \"yes,\" and that the officer did so arrest appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Before transporting appellant to central intox, the officer was aware of the following facts: (1) appellant committed three traffic violations; (2) appellant continued to drive for almost a mile before stopping, even though the officer had activated his emergency lights and siren; (3) appellant was slow to respond to a request for his driver's license and proof of financial responsibility; (4) appellant smelled of alcohol; (5) appellant's eyes were glassy; (6) appellant slurred his speech; and (7) appellant swayed on his feet when he stepped out of his vehicle.

To establish that Officer O'Brien had probable cause to arrest appellant for DWI, the State had to show that appellant lacked the normal use of his mental or physical faculties by reason of intoxication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Furthermore, although Officer O'Brien admitted that he could be considered an expert in DWI investigation, he did not ask appellant a single investigatory question regarding where he had come from, where he was going, or if he had consumed any alcohol that evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Officer O'Brien did not perform a single standard field sobriety test. Instead, he handcuffed appellant, placed him in the back of the patrol car, had appellant's car towed, and transported appellant to central intox where he waited over two hours before any investigation or sobriety testing was performed. In fact, Officer O'Brien testified that when he placed appellant in the back of the patrol car, O'Brien did not know that appellant was intoxicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386153\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/525/316/#p321\">\n    525 S.W.3d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting testimony of police officer that individual is intoxicated is probative evidence of intoxication).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The concurrence cites several cases for the proposition that standard field sobriety tests are not necessary for a finding of probable cause-it is not my contention that every finding of probable cause requires standard field sobriety tests. However, I am troubled by the proposition that such scant evidence, absent any investigation at all, can support probable cause for a warrantless arrest. In every case cited by the concurrence, there was some investigation performed, the defendant himself admitted to drinking alcohol, there was a motor vehicle collision, or some combination of these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Officer O'Brien conducted no investigation. By his own admission, at the time he placed appellant under arrest, he did not know whether appellant had lost the normal use of his mental or physical faculties due to intoxication. Based on the facts presented, I would find that Officer O'Brien did not have probable cause to arrest appellant for DWI before transporting him to central intox.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The State asserts that appellant was arrested at 8:58 p.m. and that Officer O'Brien \"lawfully arrested appellant.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Sections 543.002 and 543.003 give an officer who arrests a person for a traffic violation two options only: to bring the person before a magistrate immediately or release the person if he signs a written promise to appear in court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.
