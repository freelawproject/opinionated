After the first appeal, this Court remanded the case to the trial court for the purpose of entering an order confirming the award in favor of Regions Bank (the Bank) \"as to the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust.\" The trial court subsequently entered an order confirming the award against \"the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust\" and \"Rafia N. Khan as Trustee of the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust.\" Over twenty months later, Rafia Khan filed an independent action in equity asking the trial court to set aside its judgment confirming the award. Pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6), the Bank filed a motion to dismiss and raised the affirmative defense of res judicata. The trial court granted the Bank's motion to dismiss on the basis of res judicata. We vacate the trial court's findings with respect to res judicata. Nevertheless, we affirm the court's dismissal of the case because Ms. Khan's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We explained the facts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   underlying the parties' arbitration dispute in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan v.

On October 16, 2015, before ruling on the Bank's motion, the trial court entered a self-styled \"Final Judgment\" confirming the arbitration award \"as to the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust and to Rafia N. Khan as Trustee of the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust.\" A few days later, the Bank filed certified copies of that order with the Knox County Register of Deeds in order\n   to establish and maintain a judgment lien against the residential property. The Bank has never sought to levy the property and has never filed a motion with the court to foreclose on its lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 14, 2017, Ms. Khan filed a third complaint (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan III\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ) asking the trial court to set aside its judgment confirming the arbitration award in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . On August 4, 2017, Ms. Khan filed an amended complaint, which is now the operative complaint in this appeal. The amended complaint recited most of the aforementioned facts and alleged that the trial court's October 16, 2015 order is void for two reasons. First, Ms. Khan alleged that the court lacked personal jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award against the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust, which she claimed was never a party in the case. Second, Ms. Khan alleged that the court's order is void under federal bankruptcy law to the extent that it imposes personal liability on Ms. Khan \"as Trustee of the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust.\" The Bank filed a Rule 12.02(6) motion to dismiss and raised the affirmative defense of res judicata. After a hearing on the matter, the trial court granted the Bank's motion and dismissed the case on the basis of res judicata. Ms. Khan appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Khan raises the issue of whether the trial court erred in granting the Bank's motion to dismiss. Resolution of that ultimate issue requires us to address two subsidiary questions, as framed by us:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Whether the trial court erred in dismissing the case on the basis of res judicata; and, if the court did so err,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Whether the court's order of dismissal can be affirmed on an alternate basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Bank further raises the issue of whether this appeal is frivolous and deserving of sanctions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-1-122\">\n    Tenn.

R. Civ. P. 12.02 (providing that a Rule 12.02(6) motion to dismiss shall be treated as a motion for summary judgment when \"matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In this case, the trial court stated that it considered \"the motions, the memoranda filed in support thereof and in opposition thereto, the argument of counsel, the mandate from the Tennessee Court of Appeals in [\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ], the Final Judgment in [\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ], and the entire record....\" The record included several exhibits of documents associated with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Both parties agreed that the court could take judicial notice of most of those documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ultimately, the trial court granted the Bank's \"motion to dismiss\" without converting that motion into a motion for summary judgment. We do not reach the issue of whether the trial court erred by failing to do so. As we explain later in this opinion, we have determined that dismissal is appropriate based solely on the allegations in Ms. Khan's complaint now before us on this appeal. We therefore find it unnecessary to decide whether all the documents presented to the trial court were the proper subject of judicial notice and, thus, whether the motion to dismiss should have been converted into a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We first consider whether the trial court erred by granting the Bank's motion to dismiss on the basis of res judicata. \"A trial court's decision that a claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion involves a question of law which will be reviewed de novo on appeal without a presumption of correctness.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jackson v.

Thus, to successfully assert the defense of res judicata in a Rule 12.02(6) motion, the defendant must show that the plaintiff's own allegations \"clearly and unequivocally\" establish the following elements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) that the underlying judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) that the same parties or their privies were involved in both suits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) that the same claim or cause of action was asserted in both suits; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (4) that the underlying judgment was final and on the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9417558\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/75/383/#p404\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (citing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lien v.

According to paragraph 23 of the complaint, the trial court entered its October 16, 2015 order before ruling on the Bank's motion for additional attorney's fees. Our Supreme Court has held that a judgment is not \"final\" within the meaning of Tenn. R. Civ.

First, Ms. Khan alleged that the court lacked personal jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award against the \"Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust.\" Second, Ms. Khan alleged that the court's order is void under federal bankruptcy law to the extent that it imposes personal liability on Ms. Khan. Both of those assertions are legal conclusions that are not entitled to a presumption of correctness under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6). Nevertheless, we will probe the complaint for facts purporting to support those legal conclusions and then we will make an independent judgment as to whether those conclusions are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ms. Khan attempts to prove that the trial court lacked of personal jurisdiction over the trust by alleging that none of the pleadings in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Khan I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   identified the \"Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust\" as a party. We accept as a matter of fact that none of the previous pleadings identify \"the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust\" as a party. That fact, however, is insufficient as a matter of law to prove that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over the trust. \"In most jurisdictions, a trust ... cannot sue or be sued in its own name, and therefore, the trustee, rather than the trust, is the real party in interest in litigation involving trust property.\" 76 Am. Jur. 2d Trusts \u00a7 601 (West 2018). In Tennessee, for example,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [a] claim based on a contract entered into by a trustee in the trustee's fiduciary capacity, on an obligation arising from ownership or control of trust property, or on a tort committed in the course of administering a trust, may be asserted in a judicial proceeding\n   <em>\n    against the trustee in the trustee's fiduciary capacity\n   </em>\n   , whether or not the trustee is personally liable for the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-15-1010\">\n    Tenn.

(Third) of Trusts \u00a7 105 (West 2012) (listing Tennessee as one of the many states which have adopted this \"now-prevalent doctrine\"). Here, Ms. Khan's complaint specifically alleges that all prior pleadings were filed in the name of Rafia N. Khan, individually, and \"as trustee of the Rafia N. Khan Irrevocable Trust.\" Thus, the complaint alleges the very fact needed to assert jurisdiction over the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, a judgment against an individual \"as trustee\" only imposes personal liability when \"the trustee is personally at fault on account of the trustee's own willful misconduct proven by clear and convincing evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-15-1010\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-15-1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2015). That statute further provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (a) Except as otherwise provided in the contract,\n   <em>\n    a trustee is not personally liable\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    on a contract properly entered into in the trustee's fiduciary capacity\n   </em>\n   in the course of administering the trust if the trustee in the contract disclosed the fiduciary capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (a) or (c), the debts, obligations and liabilities incurred by a trustee by reason of the ownership, management or control of trust property in the trustee's fiduciary capacity,\n   <em>\n    shall be enforceable solely against the trust and its property, without any obligation or liability personally being borne by any trustee of such trust.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2035-15-1010\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 35-15-1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) (2015) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, Ms. Khan argues that the trial court's order confirming the arbitration award against her \"as trustee\" imposes personal liability in violation of federal bankruptcy law. However, the complaint contains no factual allegations that would support that legal conclusion. This is not a case where the trustee was sued for a breach of trust; nor does the complaint allege that the trustee lacked the contractual capacity to bind the trust in her dealings with the Bank. The statute cited above clearly precludes personal liability under the circumstances alleged in Ms. Khan's complaint. Accordingly, Ms. Khan failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because we conclude that Ms. Khan's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we affirm the trial court's order dismissing the case under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(6). It is now unnecessary for us to consider the applicability of the prior suit pending doctrine, and we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Bank urges this Court to deem Ms. Khan's appeal as frivolous and worthy of sanctions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-1-122\">\n    Tenn.
