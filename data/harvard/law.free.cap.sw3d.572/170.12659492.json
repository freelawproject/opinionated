Therefore, we answer the district court's question in the negative: The insurer may not withhold a portion of repair labor as depreciation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2017, Petitioners\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gregory J.

The district court certified the question to this Court on December 22, 2017.

They filed a claim with Auto-Owners, who informed them that the claim would be settled on an actual cash basis. Using a replacement-cost-less-depreciation method, Auto-Owners calculated that it would cost $ 12,146.55 to repair and replace the damage with new materials. After subtracting $ 2,160.19 in depreciation, Auto-Owners informed the Lammerts that the actual cash value of their property was $ 9,986.36. After the Lammerts inquired about the depreciation, Auto-Owners confirmed that both labor and materials had been depreciated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Reasons' home is located in Jackson, Tennessee, and the Reasons insured their house and related structures through Auto-Owners under a \"Homeowners Insurance Policy.\" The property was damaged twice, once by hail in November 2016 and again by wind in March 2017. They filed claims for each loss, which Auto-Owners accepted. When Auto-Owners calculated its obligation to the Reasons, it used the replacement-cost-less-depreciation method and deducted depreciation for both labor and materials when calculating the actual cash value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties disagree on the interpretation of the insurance policies, with the homeowners arguing that Auto-Owners should not have depreciated the cost of the labor to repair and replace the damaged property when calculating the actual cash value of the respective properties.

The two policies in this case contain different language. The Lammerts' policy defines actual cash value as \"the cost to replace damaged property with new property of similar quality and features reduced by the amount of depreciation applicable to the damaged property immediately prior to the loss,\" while the Reasons' policy does not define actual cash value but states that actual cash value includes a deduction for depreciation. The parties agree that under both policies, the method used to calculate the actual cash value is replacement cost less depreciation. Importantly, neither policy specifically mentions labor costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The homeowners contend that the language in the Lammerts' policy unambiguously limits depreciation to the cost of the replacement materials by use of the terms \"damaged property\" and \"prior to the loss.\" According to them, \"damaged property\" eliminates labor costs because labor is intangible, and \"prior to the loss\" likewise eliminates labor costs because the labor costs at issue are post-loss costs. The homeowners also point to the definition of depreciation in the policy-\"a decrease in value because of age, wear, obsolescence or market value\"-to show that labor cannot be depreciated because it does not age, wear out, become obsolete, or (generally speaking) decrease in market value.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The homeowners further argue that the language in the Reasons' policy is ambiguous and should be construed in their favor because labor is not depreciable. Auto-Owners maintains that neither policy is ambiguous and that depreciation of a property is taken from the total replacement cost, which includes both labor and materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Central to the discussion in this opinion are the concepts of indemnity, actual cash value, and depreciation. This Court in\n   <em>\n    Braddock v. Memphis Fire Insurance Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10124295\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/493/453/#p459\">\n    493 S.W.2d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459-60 (Tenn. 1973), explained that insurance contracts are contracts of indemnity, meaning that the purpose of the insurance contract \"is to reimburse the insured; to restore him as nearly as possible to the position he was in\n   before the loss.\" Accordingly, if an insured were to make a profit on a loss by recovering the cost of a new roof for a damaged roof that was fifteen years old, then \"[t]he ends of indemnity would not have been served.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10124295\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/493/453/#p459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10124295\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/493/453/#p459\">\n    at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, if an insured were able to replace a loss \"with a substitute identical in kind and quality\" then \"complete indemnity\" would be accomplished.\n   <em>\n    McAnarney v.

Because such a substitution is not generally possible when the damaged article is, for example, a fifteen-year-old roof, indemnity is instead accomplished through recovery of the actual cash value of a damaged property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The generally accepted definition of \"actual cash value\" is \"actual value expressed in terms of money.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Third Nat'l Bank v.

The New Jersey Supreme Court provided an excellent analysis of each method in\n   <em>\n    Elberon\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Market value is generally defined as the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller, at a fair and [b]ona fide sale by private contract, neither being under any compulsion.... But there is a problem in that a building ordinarily has no recognized market value independent of the parcel of property in entirety, land and building together....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Replacement cost less depreciation has the advantage of relative definiteness. It is also easily ascertained. However, it is inflexible, and this characteristic often results in excessive recovery.

What they disagree on is whether depreciation applies only to the materials or to both materials and labor. The homeowners claim that applying depreciation to both materials and labor defeats the indemnity purpose of insurance by not making the homeowners whole, while Auto-Owners counters that applying depreciation only to materials results in a windfall to the homeowners, thus also defeating the purpose of indemnity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following hypothetical illustrates the dilemma. Suppose that laminate flooring with half of its useful life remaining is damaged by a sewer backup and that the homeowner has an insurance policy providing that the insurance company will cover the actual cash value of damaged property, calculated by deducting depreciation from the replacement cost. Further suppose that it would cost $ 10,000 to replace the floor, with $ 5,000 in labor costs and $ 5,000 in material costs. If depreciation is deducted from material costs alone, then the actual cash value for the floor is $ 7,500. If depreciation is deducted from the total replacement cost, then the actual cash value of the floor is $ 5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This discussion about the depreciation of labor costs is not occurring in a vacuum. Both sides have presented many cases supporting their divergent positions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will highlight a few of the more noteworthy opinions, beginning with the Oklahoma Supreme Court case\n   <em>\n    Redcorn v.

First, we note that this Court has never adopted the broad evidence rule. In\n   <em>\n    Braddock\n   </em>\n   , this Court merely acknowledged that the broad evidence rule and the replacement-cost-less-depreciation method both accomplished indemnity.\n   <em>\n    Braddock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10124295\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/493/453/#p459\">\n    493 S.W.2d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, whether Tennessee is a broad evidence state is not at issue because in this case, as the homeowners point out, the parties agreed that the actual cash value was to be calculated based on the replacement cost method.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the end, this case turns on our standard for interpreting insurance contracts because both parties have presented plausible interpretations of the policies, neither of which explicitly states whether labor expenses are depreciable when calculating the actual cash value. On the one hand, the homeowners' position that labor is not depreciable is well-taken. \"Depreciation in insurance law is not the type that is charged off the books of a business establishment, but rather it is the actual deterioration of a structure by reason of age, and physical wear and tear, computed at the time of the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Redcorn,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11361739\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/55/1017/#p1020\">\n    55 P.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With this understanding, it is reasonable that a homeowner would understand that depreciation would only be applicable to material goods that can age and experience wear and tear. It is also reasonable that a homeowner, knowing that replacement costs include both labor and materials to rebuild a roof, would believe that the insurance company would only apply depreciation to the physical materials, those things that actually deteriorated. Auto-Owners argues that the homeowners' interpretation is not reasonable because depreciation is a numerical factor to be applied to the replacement cost to calculate the actual cash value and is not reflective of literal deterioration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In reaching our conclusion, we must keep in mind that \"the terms of a contract of insurance are to be construed\n   according to their plain, ordinary, popular sense unless they have acquired a technical sense in commercial usage.\"\n   <em>\n    Swindler v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

However, the technical sense must be clearly conveyed in the policy itself:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   In our view, an insured should not have to consult a long line of case law or law review articles and treatises to determine the coverage he or she is purchasing under an insurance policy. Policy language should be given its plain meaning, unless a technical meaning is clearly provided in the insurance policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Harrell v. Minn. Mut.

Moreover, when language is ambiguous, it is to be \"construed against the insurance company and in favor of the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319987\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/937/809/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, Auto-Owners argues for a technical definition of depreciation that is not evident on the face of either policy. Taking the term in its ordinary sense, it applies to physical deterioration, which is the meaning attributed to it by the homeowners. As this Court has previously stated, \"if the disputed provision is susceptible to more than one plausible meaning, the meaning favorable to the insured controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7127989\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/377/659/#p664\">\n    377 S.W.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, construing the policy language in favor of the insured, depreciation can only be applied to the cost of materials, not to labor costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Auto-Owners also contends that if the homeowners' interpretation is correct, then indemnity is not accomplished because instead of receiving the actual value of their property in terms of money, the insured would never receive less than the cost of the labor, even if the labor was worth more than the actual property prior to the loss. The homeowners, however, argue that depreciating labor costs would underindemnify the insureds because they would bear the out-of-pocket costs of reinstalling the damaged asset. They would agree with Oklahoma's Justice Summers, who wrote in his dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Redcorn\n   </em>\n   that Redcorn was \"contractually entitled to have on his house sixteen-year-old shingles, or their value in money. He should not bear any of the cost of installing them because that would deprive him of that for which he contracted-being made whole as if the damage had not occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Redcorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11361739\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/55/1017/#p1020\">\n    55 P.3d at 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Summers, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ultimately, it is not necessary for this Court to reach the decision of whether labor can logically depreciate or whether indemnity is accomplished. It is enough that we find the contracts ambiguous and that under our standard of review, the interpretation of the insured must prevail. We conclude that the answer to the district court's certified question is no, the insurance company cannot withhold a portion of the labor costs as depreciation under either policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We conclude that the language regarding depreciation in the policies in question is ambiguous. Under Tennessee law, ambiguities in insurance contracts are strictly construed against the insurance companies and in favor of the insured. Therefore, with the insured's interpretation controlling, labor may not be depreciated when the insurance company calculates the actual cash value of a property using the replacement cost less depreciation method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Clerk is directed to transmit a copy of this opinion to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee in accordance with\n   Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 23, section 8.
