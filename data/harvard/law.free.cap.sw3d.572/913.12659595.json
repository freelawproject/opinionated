After careful review of the record, briefs, and applicable law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 17, 2011, Prescott was found guilty following a six-day trial by jury of one count first-degree possession of a controlled substance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   three counts first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and being a persistent felony offender in the first degree (\"PFO I\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury recommended Prescott be sentenced to three years' imprisonment for the possession charge and ten years' imprisonment for each trafficking charge, said sentences\n   to run concurrently. Sentencing was deferred until after a hearing on January 17, 2012. Subsequently, the trial court imposed the jury's recommended sentence against Prescott. On February 6, 2012, an amended order of judgment and order imposing sentence was entered by the trial court. Prescott appealed. On February 28, 2014, in an unpublished opinion, another panel of our court affirmed the trial court's order in part, vacating only the portion of the order imposing court costs on Prescott without ascertaining whether he is a poor person or his ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 8, 2015, Prescott moved the court to recuse, to vacate its order pursuant to RCr 11.42 based on collateral claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, and for an evidentiary hearing. On April 28, 2016, the trial court entered its order denying these motions. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal is, at least in part, an attempt to recycle arguments that have previously failed. As such, we quote the basic facts and summary of issues previously reviewed by the prior panel of our court in\n   <em>\n    Prescott v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , No. 2012-CA-000190-MR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20813109\">\n    2014 WL 813109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Ky. App. Feb. 28, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2010, Army investigators of the Civil Investigation Command (CID) learned that Private Stephen Percival had been purchasing cocaine and firearms in Radcliffe, Kentucky. They contacted Detective Rex Allaman of the Hardin County Sheriff's Department and began a coordinated investigation. The two investigative units set up controlled buys using Percival as a confidential informant. They equipped Percival with an audio and video recording device. On three occasions in 2010, he entered the apartment of a drug dealer he knew as Six and purchased a quantity of powder cocaine. During the last transaction, Percival and Six also discussed the possibility that Six would sell firearms to Percival or others, but the sale was never executed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Six was later identified as the defendant, Kit Prescott. Prescott denies that he is Six or that he is guilty of the offenses for which he was convicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On the basis of the controlled buys, Detective Allaman sought and was granted a no-knock warrant to search Six's apartment. Detective Allaman's affidavit in support of the warrant request was purportedly placed in the record, but it is now missing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The warrant was executed while the apartment was unoccupied. Police uncovered significant quantities of drugs and evidence of trafficking, in addition to two firearms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Prescott was indicted on a number of offenses and appointed representation by the Department of Public Advocacy (DPA). On several occasions, he filed pretrial motions by which he sought to represent himself, but on each occasion he decided to maintain his appointed counsel after consulting the circuit judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Trial was conducted in November 2012. At the close of his case, Prescott requested permission to make his own closing statement to the jury. The circuit judge conducted a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   hearing and granted his request.\n   <em>\n    Faretta v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    422 U.S. 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the following charges: first-degree possession of a controlled substance; first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance, first offense, less than four grams of cocaine; two counts of first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance, first offense, more than four grams of cocaine; and first-degree PFO. Prescott was sentenced\n   to a total of ten years' imprisonment and ordered to pay $190 in court costs and fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, Prescott asserts the judgment should be reversed on four grounds. He first claims the warrant was invalid because Detective Allaman's affidavit failed to establish probable cause. On that basis, he believes the evidence discovered in the search of the apartment should have been suppressed. Prescott also protests that the circuit court permitted the jury to hear evidence concerning the prospective sale of firearms. He next claims he should not have been permitted to make his own closing statement. Finally, Prescott argues that he should not have been ordered to pay court costs because he is a poor person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Footnotes omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ADHERENCE TO RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As an initial matter, in contravention of CR\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   76.12(4)(c)(v), Prescott does not state how he preserved any of his arguments in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   CR 76.12(4)(c) [ (v) ] in providing that an appellate brief's contents must contain at the beginning of each argument a reference to the record showing whether the issue was preserved for review and in what manner emphasizes the importance of the firmly established rule that the trial court should first be given the opportunity to rule on questions before they are available for appellate review. It is only to avert a manifest injustice that this court will entertain an argument not presented to the trial court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Elwell v.

It also has a bearing on whether we employ the recognized standard of review, or in the case of an unpreserved error, whether palpable error review is being requested and may be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Oakley v. Oakley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094757\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/391/377/#p380\">\n    391 S.W.3d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (Ky. App. 2012). The instant appeal is taken from the trial court's order denying RCr 11.42 relief on Prescott's motion alleging ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. Review of Prescott's motion and the trial court's order reveals that such issues were presented to the trial court for consideration. Because these issues were so presented, and denied, they are appropriate for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Additionally, CR 76.12(4)(c)(iv), relating to the requirement of a concise statement of the facts and procedural history of an appeal, requires \"ample references to the specific pages of the record, or tape and digital counter number in the case of untranscribed videotape or audiotape recordings ... supporting each of the statements narrated in the summary.\" Similarly, CR 76.12(4)(c)(v), relating to arguments raised on appeal, requires \"ample supportive references to the record and citations of authority pertinent to each issue of law[.]\" It is not the job of this or any appellate court to scour a record to determine whether these citations support a party's assertions.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176447\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/165/#p171\">\n    503 S.W.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (Ky. App. 2016). Appellants must exercise care, diligence, and trustworthiness to ensure the accuracy of pinpoint citations provided to the appellate court in support of any arguments\n   pursuant to CR 76.12, pertaining to both location and substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prescott's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief contains numerous pinpoint citations to the record allegedly supporting arguments advanced before this Court. Review of the cited portions, however, suggests Prescott misapprehends or mischaracterizes substantial portions of the record. As one example, Prescott states the \"Judge even suggested the Attorney's [sic] investigate the witness,\" citing to a portion of the video transcript of his pretrial proceedings. Our review of this, and all other cited portions, reveals that many do not depict the purported subject matter, others are taken out of context and do not support Prescott's argument, and others do not exist (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   citation to V.R., 1/16/11 at 2:37:06pm (supposedly regarding suppression) ). Prescott's repeated inattentive and inaccurate citation to portions of the record in support of his arguments is troubling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We further note that Prescott's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief does not comply with CR 76.12(4)(c)(vii) which requires the appellant to \"place the judgment, opinion, or order under review immediately after the appendix list so that it is most readily available to the court.\" Although the order being appealed was included with the plethora of other attachments, it did not appear until approximately page 178 of 215. This rule also provides that the index \"shall set forth where the documents may be found in the record.\" The purpose of this rule is to ensure that only items in the record are appended to the brief and considered by our court during review. Prescott failed to do this. This rule further requires the appendix contain extruding tabs to indicate to the court the beginning of each attachment. Prescott failed to do this as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As an additional note, we find it appropriate to mention-considering Prescott's lengthy\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   filings before the trial court and now on collateral appeal in our court-that quantity is a poor proxy for quality in court pleadings. It is not well taken that Prescott's numerous and unwieldy arguments have consumed considerable judicial resources to resolve. The Supreme Court of the United States has observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   paupers filing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petitions are not subject to the financial considerations-filing fees and attorney's fees-that deter other litigants from filing frivolous petitions. Every paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes the interests of justice. The continual processing of petitioner's frivolous requests for extraordinary writs does not promote that end.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    In re McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031796\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/180/#p184\">\n    489 U.S. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031796\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/180/#p184\">\n    109 S.Ct. 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 996,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031796\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/180/#p184\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"While\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants are sometimes held to less stringent standards than lawyers in drafting formal pleadings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haines v.

Prescott divides his arguments that the trial court erred in denying him RCr 11.42 relief into three categories: (1) issues he believes the trial court erroneously found should have been presented on direct appeal or were raised and rejected on appeal; (2) issues he believes the trial court incorrectly analyzed by improperly elevating the standard of prejudice required under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) issues raised in his motion which he believes the trial court failed to address or summarily denied without conclusively refuting every allegation, or providing a hearing to dispute any issues of fact. We will address each category, and Prescott's accompanying arguments for each, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Issues that should have been or were presented on direct appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Prescott claims, of the fourteen issues he raised in his RCr 11.42 motion, the trial court barred at least eight claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or refused to evaluate such claims on the basis that they were raised and rejected on direct appeal, or should have been presented on direct appeal and, therefore, were not properly raised in the context of RCr 11.42. In his argument, Prescott relies on\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Some alleged errors, but not all, had been considered on motion for a new trial. Because the ineffective assistance claims had been heard and ruled on by the trial court on motion for a new trial, we proceeded to review those claims in Humphrey's direct appeal, but we stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [A] better approach would have been to have presented the unpreserved errors, if such could have been done in good faith, as palpable error under RCr 10.26. If that approach had been taken unsuccessfully, an ineffective assistance\n   of counsel claim based on those unpreserved errors would still be available in a collateral attack proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   From the above-quoted language it is clear that an unsuccessful attempt to prevail upon a palpable error claim and an adverse ruling from the Court on direct appeal does not preclude the same claim of error from being considered again as ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   ... there are distinctions between palpable error under RCr 10.26 and the \"prejudice\" requirement of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . This prevents a palpable error analysis from being dispositive of an ineffective assistance claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   When an appellate court engages in a palpable error review, its focus is on what happened and whether the defect is so manifest, fundamental and unambiguous that it threatens the integrity of the judicial process. However, on collateral attack, when claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are before the court, the inquiry is broader. In that circumstance, the inquiry is not only upon what happened, but why it happened, and whether it was a result of trial strategy, the negligence or indifference of counsel, or any other factor that would shed light upon the severity of the defect and why there was no objection at trial. Thus, a palpable error claim imposes a more stringent standard and a narrower focus than does an ineffective assistance claim. Therefore, as a matter of law, a failure to prevail on a palpable error claim does not obviate a proper ineffective assistance claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8400838\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/207/1/\">\n    207 S.W.3d at 2-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, Prescott's direct appeal is more like\n   <em>\n    Newton v.

In this case, the Supreme Court found on direct appeal no error existed with respect to the admission of character evidence and bolstering testimony; the Court did not undertake a palpable error review. Accordingly, the holdings in\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   do not render erroneous this court's conclusion that the Court's finding of no error on direct appeal precluded Newton from alleging ineffective assistance of counsel relating to these claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201219241\">\n    2011 WL 1219241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (footnote omitted). Likewise, any issues now raised by Prescott previously decided on their merits on direct appeal are improper for a collateral attack. The trial court properly concluded that a RCr 11.42 motion \"is limited to the issues that were not and could not be raised on direct appeal.

Moreover, a closer look at each of Prescott's arguments, as discussed below, reveals that many of his current arguments are redundant or contain essentially the same components of his original arguments presented on direct appeal, despite being assigned different labels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Text messages not provided in discovery.\n   </strong>\n   The trial court found that, while this issue should have been raised on direct appeal, this argument lacked merit because Prescott's trial counsel argued against the admission of the text messages at issue and Prescott failed to demonstrate prejudice. In fact, review of the record reveals that Prescott's trial counsel was successful in their argument in preventing admission of text messages not provided in discovery into evidence during the Commonwealth's case-in-chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In his brief, Prescott fails to connect legal authority to the facts of his case which undermine the court's findings of fact or conclusions of law on this issue. He cites\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that in some cases a single error can have such a \"pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence, [that it alters] the entire evidentiary picture;\" but he ignores the rest of the sentence that other errors \"will have had an isolated, trivial effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 695-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prescott fails to identify how this alleged error falls into the first category rather than the latter. His conclusory statements and unsupported allegations are both unproductive and unpersuasive. Therefore, we hold the trial court correctly concluded that this claim did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Complete record on appeal.\n   </strong>\n   This issue pertains to the affidavit of Detective Allaman used to obtain the search warrant which was not included in the record on direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court correctly concluded that this issue, as part of whether the warrant was valid, was directly addressed on appeal. The prior panel of our court found the search warrant sufficient to show probable cause without need to review the written affidavit. Again, Prescott fails to connect legal authority to the facts of his case which challenge the court's findings of fact or conclusions of law on this issue. He cites two cases stating a defendant is entitled to effective assistance of counsel in connection with their first appeal but fails to demonstrate how the previous panel of our court's review would have differed at all had they\n   been provided the affidavit. His conclusory statements and unsupported allegations are insufficient. As such, the trial court was correct in finding the inadvertent omission of the affidavit from the written record on appeal did not prejudice Prescott, nor did it rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Affidavit for search warrant and military involvement.\n   </strong>\n   This argument is largely a rehash of the last pertaining to the missing affidavit but also includes Prescott's argument pertaining to suppression of evidence obtained in the search under 18 U.S.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   1385. The trial court found this issue was addressed in Prescott's direct appeal and neither violated the statute requiring suppression nor prejudiced Prescott. The trial court further found that although Prescott made vague statements about trial counsel being unfamiliar with certain case law pertaining to these issues, he did not show how this fell below the objective standard for counsel or how it prejudiced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On appeal, Prescott makes the same mistake. He cites to portions of the record which reflect neither attorney error nor a level of competency below prevailing professional norms required by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Although Prescott moved the trial court to remove his appointed counsel or to allow him to proceed as co-counsel in hybrid representation on more than one occasion, he failed to show that counsel's performance was in any way deficient or prejudicial to him. To the contrary, the instances cited by Prescott demonstrate his counsel made proper arguments and filed proper motions at appropriate times. Finding no error with the trial court's ruling on this issue, it is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Failure to investigate.\n   </strong>\n   In its order denying Prescott's RCr 11.42 motion, the trial court found Prescott's claim that his counsel was ineffective by not conducting further investigation did not specify what witnesses or information would have been revealed with further investigation, nor was prejudice shown. In his appellate brief, Prescott grossly misstates the record in this claim, stating the judge suggested his attorney investigate a witness when he did not. Prescott also claims his counsel had the judges switched-another fact not borne out by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Prescott contends that his trial counsel failed to investigate certain military witnesses, including the Commonwealth's key witness, Percival. Prescott vaguely asserts that the type of information which may have been discovered by further investigation\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   pertain to Percival's mental health and credibility, considering he testified he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, poly-substance dependency, and borderline personality disorder. Nonetheless, it is clear from the record that Prescott's counsel did investigate Percival through the discovery process.

Ironically, however, Prescott alleges that the trial court misrepresented facts pertaining to this issue in its order. Undaunted by the truth-and among a myriad of other misstatements-Prescott alleges his counsel's ineffectiveness \"forced\" him to proceed under an \"all or nothing\" instruction. To the contrary, the record clearly demonstrates that it was Prescott's decision to proceed with instructions for trafficking only rather than including instructions for possession as a lesser offense as well. As addressed previously, we decline to provide comprehensive analysis on Prescott's claims which are based on wholly inaccurate citation of the record; nor will we waste judicial resources to find support for Prescott's underdeveloped arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Prescott further takes issue with the fact that the trial court amended the judgment more than ten days after the sentencing hearing. The trial court specifically addressed this amendment in its order denying RCr 11.42 relief, stating the judgment was amended to reflect the weights found by the jury in accordance with the new HB\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   463 rules. Here we note that it was Prescott's decision to elect to proceed under HB 463, and as the trial court observed, Prescott did not and cannot show that he was prejudiced by this amendment since he benefited from its application. We further agree with the trial court that Prescott's issue with the timing of the amendment should have been addressed by his direct appeal, not this collateral appeal. In any event, because Prescott was not prejudiced by this amendment, the trial court did not err in granting Prescott relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Prescott additionally argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to provide lesser included instructions on criminalizing complicity\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   or criminal facilitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our standard of review for a trial court's ruling regarding jury instructions is for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Cecil v.

A lesser included instruction is required \"only if, considering the totality of the evidence, the jury might have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt of the greater offense, and yet believe beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the lesser offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston v.

In the instant case, the trial court found that the jury clearly believed that Prescott sold cocaine in a controlled buy, so there is no \"reasonable probability\" that the result would have differed with different jury instructions.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. Similarly, because Prescott failed to show sufficient prejudice required by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , Prescott's objection to the word \"dispensing\" in the jury instructions did not rise to the level of ineffective\n   assistance of counsel. Lastly, Prescott's opposition to the word \"will\" as a \"commandment\" in the jury instructions does not consider the word within the context of each instruction, which also uses the phrase \"if and only if.\" Without a sufficient showing of prejudice upon the trial's outcome by any one or a combination of any of these alleged errors with the jury instructions at trial, the trial court did not err in denying Prescott's request for relief under RCr 11.42 on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Narrating the video.\n   </strong>\n   Prescott argues that Percival should not have been allowed to narrate the video of the controlled buys. The trial court found that while this issue should have been pursued on direct appeal, the narration was nonetheless proper under KRE\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   701 and 602 because it was rationally based on the perception of the witness and helpful to a clear understanding of whether a controlled sale was taking place, citing\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

He is correct that\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   differs from his case, but he is incorrect in his analysis of how and why it is different. The videotape at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   portrayed the aftermath of the crime scene and the investigator's impressions thereof; whereas, in the instant case, the video recordings captured Percival's then-live actions of three controlled drug buys. These facts make Percival's narration even more appropriate given his firsthand knowledge of what the recordings portrayed. Similarly, Prescott's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Sanborn v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9975668\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/754/534/\">\n    754 S.W.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1988),\n   <em>\n    overruled by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Percival, on the other hand, had firsthand knowledge of everything the videos portrayed. The relatively poor quality of the video recordings made the narration by Percival proper as it certainly helped clarify what the video portrayed in a manner helpful to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7265113\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/421/388/\">\n    421 S.W.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

The subject of uncharged gun purchases was objected to prior to trial by written motions filed both by Prescott,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and by his counsel. Prescott cites to the trial court's preliminary ruling that evidence of uncharged gun purchases was not to be introduced by the Commonwealth during its case-in-chief, but he ignores the fact the trial court reserved further ruling on admissibility of such evidence during later stages of the trial because the matter was intertwined with the drug purchases at issue and could be introduced for appropriate purposes. The trial court later allowed certain introduction of this evidence for appropriate purposes and instructed the\n   jury with an admonition on how and why it could be considered. In its order denying Prescott RCr 11.42 relief, the trial court found \"[i]t was also proper for the Commonwealth to argue on closing argument about the testimony,\" including references to the video recordings as well as mention of the potential gun transactions as they related to the charged offenses. We hold Prescott's argument regarding his counsel's failure to object during closing is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The trial court also notes that Prescott failed to show prejudice on this issue. We agree. Prescott's contention that a showing of prejudice is not required due to constructive denial of counsel as ineffective is unsupported. Moreover, the trial court points out that this issue was raised by Prescott's appellate counsel on direct appeal and was improperly included in his RCr 11.42 motion. As such, the trial court properly denied Prescott's request for relief on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Testimony regarding uncharged criminal conduct.\n   </strong>\n   In addition to his previous argument concerning mention of uncharged gun purchases, Prescott challenges what he perceives as counsel's failure to object to mention of uncharged drug purchases at trial. The record reflects Prescott's counsel did object to Detective Allaman's testimony regarding uncharged drug purchases. Prescott fails to cite to any portion of the record where other mention of uncharged criminal conduct was made. As previously stated, we will not scour the record to find additional facts to support Prescott's claims. Prescott's allegations that prosecutorial misconduct throughout the trial affected the overall fairness is likewise unsupported and unsubstantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, it is well-established that judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. It must also be assumed that counsel exercised sound trial strategy in choosing not to object to any additional vague or fleeting references to uncharged activity to avoid calling extra attention to such testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8980174\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/160/744/#p759\">\n    160 S.W.3d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 (Ky. 2005). This strategy does not rise to the level of constitutionally deficient performance, and no prejudice has been shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    X. Conflict in Prescott acting\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    (plea advice).\n   </strong>\n   Prescott baldly and blanketly states that there were actual, presumed, and potential conflicts between himself and his counsel, the prosecution, and even the judge. Prescott supports none of these assertions with either fact or relevant legal precedence. His allegations are simply not borne out by the record, which demonstrates both the absence of legal conflict and the presence of counsel rendering competent legal advice. Prescott fails to demonstrate that he was given bad legal advice by his counsel or was prejudiced by his perceived conflict. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's denial of RCr 11.42 relief on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    XI. Suppression of evidence.\n   </strong>\n   Prescott presents a recycled and repackaged argument concerning suppression of evidence discovered pursuant to the aforementioned search warrant in his RCr 11.42 motion and on collateral appeal. Contrary to Prescott's assertions and attempt to attack the same argument from another angle, this issue was conclusively decided by the previous panel of our court, and the trial court found no valid reason for disturbing this ruling. Neither do we; therefore, we must affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    XII.\n    <em>\n     Voir dire.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The trial court denied Prescott's request for relief on this issue because he failed to show prejudice, citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

In that case, the Supreme\n   Court of Kentucky agreed with the trial court that the defendant failed to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by not being able to strike two jurors.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Simply stating that he would have stricken them is not sufficient to satisfy demonstrable prejudice, because there is no indication that he received anything less than a reliable trial. As the trial court reasoned, to find prejudice merely because Appellee identified two jurors he would have stricken would be no different than creating a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   reversal rule in [ineffective assistance of counsel] cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6888031\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/454/843/\">\n    454 S.W.3d at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, Prescott's arguments fail for similar reasons. As such, the trial court did not err in denying relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    XIII, XIV. PSI and Alibi witnesses.\n   </strong>\n   These issues were not specifically addressed by Prescott in his appellate brief. Prescott's failure to present arguments on these issues on appeal constitute abandonment and/or waiver of these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Issues Prescott alleges trial court failed to sufficiently address\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Prescott argues the trial court erred in its order denying him RCr 11.42 relief by failing to address certain issues raised in his motion or by summarily denying issues without conclusively refuting every allegation or providing a hearing to dispute any issues of fact. In this section, Prescott repeats portions of his arguments corresponding to numbered arguments I, IV, V, IX, X, XI, and XII, above. We need not address these issues again. However, we affirm the trial court's treatment of these \"arguments\" as being vague, conclusory, and unsupported allegations. As we-and the Supreme Court of Kentucky-have previously noted, \"vague allegations ... do not warrant an evidentiary hearing and warrant summary dismissal of the RCr 11.42 motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927614\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/170/310/#p330\">\n    170 S.W.3d at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In conclusion, Prescott has failed to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .

In particular, a court need not determine whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel's performance. If it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course should be followed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    , 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     80 L.Ed.2d 674\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    This unpublished opinion is cited pursuant to CR 76.28(4)(c) as illustrative of the issue before us and not as binding authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The trial court made specific findings of fact and conclusions of law for each of the fourteen issues raised in Prescott's RCr 11.42 motion.
