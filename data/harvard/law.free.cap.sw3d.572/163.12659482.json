Beal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his first-degree murder conviction, claiming that the State failed to establish that Beal caused Marvin Carter's death. Because there was sufficient evidence to sustain Beal's first-degree murder conviction, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
