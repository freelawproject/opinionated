The affidavit in support of the warrant alleged that Appellant had committed the offense of improper photography or visual recording in violation of the former version of Section 21.15(b)(1) of the Texas Penal Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The warrant authorized the search of Appellant's home for evidence of the alleged offense. When police searched Appellant's home pursuant to the warrant, they found less than one gram of methamphetamine. Appellant was subsequently indicted for both improper visual recording and for possession of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the pendency of the underlying case, the Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Thompson\n   </em>\n   that, to the extent that it proscribed taking photographs and recording visual images, subsection (b)(1) of Section 21.15 was facially unconstitutional\n   in violation of the freedom of speech guarantee of the First Amendment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6908254\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/442/325/#p330\">\n    442 S.W.3d 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 (Tex.

After\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , the State dropped the improper photography charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant then filed a motion to suppress evidence with respect to the remaining methamphetamine charge. He premised the motion on the contention that the statute upon which the arrest and search warrant were issued was subsequently found to be unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   . The trial court held a hearing on the motion to suppress on stipulated facts. Because the improper video recording statute was declared unconstitutional, Appellant argued that the warrant was void for lack of probable cause. The State responded to Appellant's contention by asserting that the statute was still valid at the time the warrant was issued and that the officers acted in good faith in seeking a warrant based upon a statute that had not yet been invalidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied Appellant's motion to suppress and issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court found that there was no evidence that officers did not act in good faith in alleging a violation of the offense of improper visual recording and that there was no evidence that the officers knew or had any reason to believe the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court also determined that the supporting affidavit for the warrant established probable cause for the magistrate to issue the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In our earlier opinion, we ruled that the trial court erred by denying Appellant's motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204386107\">\n    2016 WL 4386107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

We note that the facts in\n   <em>\n    McClintock\n   </em>\n   differ from the circumstances in this case. The search warrant in\n   <em>\n    McClintock\n   </em>\n   was obtained based upon a predicate search by police officers that was later determined to be tainted by unconstitutional conduct. At the time the predicate search occurred, the officers had no reason to believe that the resulting warrant was tainted.\n   <em>\n    McClintock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655890\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/63/\">\n    541 S.W.3d at 73-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Criminal Appeals concluded in\n   <em>\n    McClintock\n   </em>\n   that, if an officer reasonably believed that his conduct was valid at the time of the warrant application and execution, a subsequent change in the legal landscape will not preclude the application of the good-faith exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655890\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The officer in this case did not rely upon a predicate search for the information supplied in the affidavit for the search and arrest warrant. Instead, the officer's affidavit supporting the issuance of the warrant detailed that officers received a report from a female that Appellant had videoed her fifteen-year-old daughter in Walmart when the daughter bent over to get a case of water. The female further reported that she witnessed Appellant videoing the \"bottoms\" of several other young females while in the store. The officer alleged in his affidavit that Appellant had committed the offense of improper photography or visual recording, and he sought an evidentiary search warrant to search Appellant's home for evidence of this alleged offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In our earlier opinion, we never reached the question of whether the officer acted in good-faith reliance on the law as it existed at the time because we concluded the subsequent invalidation of the offense on constitutional grounds precluded the possibility that the warrant was \"based on probable cause\" under all circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Siller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204386107\">\n    2016 WL 4386107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CRIM.
