Lehrmann, Justice\n   The holder of the executive right to lease a mineral estate owes non-participating mineral- and royalty-interest owners a duty of utmost good faith and fair dealing. We recently examined the scope of this duty and concluded that, while its parameters \"are imprecise, at bottom, the executive is prohibited from engaging in acts of self-dealing that unfairly diminish the value of the non-executive interest.\"\n   <em>\n    KCM Fin. LLC v. Bradshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876471\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/70/#p74\">\n    457 S.W.3d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (Tex. 2015). In this case, we are asked to apply the duty in the context of an executive's refusal to lease in contravention of the non-executive's known wishes. The trial court found that the executive violated its duty, and the court of appeals affirmed. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we hold that legally sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding and therefore affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dora Jo Carter owned the surface estate of a 1,082-acre tract in Frio County known as Derby Ranch. She and her two children, Carolyn Nicholson and William Carter, Jr., collectively owned an undivided 50% interest in the mineral estate. The Hindes family, relatives of the Carters, owned the other 50% mineral interest. In 2002, the Carters sold the surface estate to Texas Outfitters Limited, LLC, along with a 4.16% mineral interest and the executive rights to the 45.84% mineral interest retained by the Carters. Frank Fackovec, Texas Outfitters' sole owner, intended to use the ranch as his residence as well as to operate a hunting business. He testified at trial that he would not have purchased the property without the executive rights and the corresponding control over future mineral development. The Carters partially financed the approximately $ 1 million purchase price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2010, Texas Outfitters received and rejected an offer to lease its and the Carters' mineral interest. Fackovec testified that he believed the offer, which included a $ 450-per-acre bonus and a 22% royalty, was too low. The record does not reflect when the Carters learned about this offer, and they do not complain in these proceedings about Texas Outfitters' rejection of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2010, the Hindeses leased their 50% mineral interest in the ranch to El Paso Oil Exploration &amp; Production Company for a $ 1,750-per-acre bonus and a 25% royalty. El Paso made the same offer to Texas Outfitters for the remaining 50%\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   interest, and the Carters wanted Fackovec to accept it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fackovec was aware of the Carters' position but rejected the offer. At trial, the parties presented competing testimony regarding the reason for the rejection. Fackovec testified he thought the bonus was too low and wanted to wait for prices to go up as the oil play matured. Dora Jo Carter testified that, although she and Fackovec did not specifically discuss the El Paso lease, Fackovec had told her he \"planned not to lease because of his business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Carters requested a meeting with Fackovec, which took place in August 2010 and involved both the parties and their attorneys. The bulk of the negotiations appears to have centered on an arrangement for the Carters to buy back their executive rights. At the conclusion of the meeting, the parties had reached an agreement in principle whereby: (1) Texas Outfitters would convey to the Carters the executive rights on their retained mineral interest; (2) the deed conveying those rights would include as-yet unspecified surface protections to be included in the El Paso lease and any future lease; (3) Texas Outfitters would execute the lease as to its own 4.16% mineral interest; (4) the Carters would forgive $ 263,000 of the owner-financed note on the ranch (approximately half of what was still owed); and (5) El Paso would prepay Texas Outfitters a negotiated amount for surface damages and water usage. However, the agreement was never finalized because the parties were unable to agree on the scope of the additional surface protections, which the Carters concluded were too onerous and would unduly restrict their ability to lease the minerals in the future. Texas Outfitters, through its attorney, made alternative settlement offers to the Carters in October 2010 and May 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither was accepted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Carters sued Texas Outfitters and Fackovec in June 2011. They alleged that Texas Outfitters, as holder of the executive rights to the Carters' mineral interests, breached the duty of utmost good faith and fair dealing by refusing to enter the El Paso lease. After the Carters filed suit, Texas Outfitters received two more offers to lease the ranch's minerals. The first included a larger bonus than the El Paso offer-$ 2,000 per acre-but was withdrawn when the lessee learned El Paso had already leased the Hindeses' interest. The second included a $ 1,500-per-acre bonus and was also withdrawn by the lessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ultimately, drilling in the area revealed that the land was not as productive as anticipated, and Texas Outfitters received no further lease offers. In 2012, Texas Outfitters sold the ranch for approximately $ 3.5 million,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   retaining a portion of the mineral interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a bench trial, the trial court rendered judgment for the Carters and\n   against Texas Outfitters, awarding damages of $ 867,654.32-the amount the Carters would have received in bonuses from El Paso had its lease offer been accepted-plus interest and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court made numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Texas Outfitters exercised its executive rights to both its own mineral interest and the Carters' mineral interests in refusing to enter a lease with El Paso.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Fackovec's \"stated reason for refusing the lease was because he wanted to see how the play matured and try to get more money.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 \"Dora Jo Carter testified that [Fackovec] told her that he planned not to lease because of his business of a hunting lease for bringing in hunters.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 After suit was filed, Texas Outfitters received a subsequently withdrawn lease offer that included a bonus of $ 250 more per acre than the El Paso lease.

Rather, the offer included both the Carters' and Texas Outfitters' interests.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Per the first offer, Texas Outfitters would receive a 25% mineral interest (replacing its 4.16% interest), the Carters would receive the executive rights on their remaining 25% interest, and Texas Outfitters would make a $ 275,000 loan payment upon execution of the El Paso lease. Under the second offer, the Carters were given the option of either (1) purchasing the ranch from Texas Outfitters, including all surface and mineral interests, for $ 4.2 million, or (2) conveying a 25% mineral interest to Texas Outfitters in exchange for the executive rights on the Carters' retained interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The court of appeals stated that the ranch was sold for $ 4.5 million, which appears to be based on testimony from Fackovec that $ 3.5 million was a \"net figure.\" The exact sale price is unclear from the record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Carters sought to hold Texas Outfitters and Fackovec jointly and severally liable for their damages.

However, we have articulated several guiding principles.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    First, we have stated that the duty does not require an executive to subjugate his interests to those of the non-executive; rather, the executive must \"acquire for the non-executive every benefit that he exacts for himself.\"\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876471\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/70/#p74\">\n     457 S.W.3d at 81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Lesley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317851\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/352/479/#p480\">\n     352 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    490 ). We applied these \"no-subjugation\" and \"equal-benefits\" principles in\n    <em>\n     Manges v. Guerra\n    </em>\n    , in which Manges owned a mineral interest in co-tenancy with Guerra and also exclusively owned all the executive rights.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9930468\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/673/180/#p181\">\n     673 S.W.2d 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 181-82 (Tex. 1984).

The Trial Court's Findings\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Turning to the facts at hand, the trial court's written findings provide the basis for its conclusion that Texas Outfitters breached its executive duty. As noted, the principal findings are: by refusing the El Paso lease, Texas Outfitters \"chose to gamble\" with both its own mineral interest and the Carters' much larger interest knowing that the Carters did not want to take that gamble; Texas Outfitters refused the El Paso lease knowing the Hindeses had already leased their 50% interest to El Paso, thereby diminishing the potential pool of lessees; and refusing the lease allowed Texas Outfitters to retain unfettered use of the surface to operate its planned hunting operations and to sell the ranch at a profit free of any encumbrances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Texas Outfitters argues that, as a matter of law, it cannot have engaged in self-dealing merely by \"gambling\" on better lease terms that ultimately did not materialize. It argues that the court of appeals erroneously went beyond these findings and held that Texas Outfitters breached its duty by \"refusing to execute\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    lease, including a lease with El Paso, in order to protect its existing use of the surface.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386784\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/534/65/#p80\">\n     534 S.W.3d at 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). We agree with Texas Outfitters that an executive generally does not breach his duty by declining a lease in honest anticipation of obtaining better terms for all.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We also agree that the trial court in this case did not go so far as to find that Texas Outfitters refused to execute any lease.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    But the trial court did find that the refusal to execute the El Paso lease was a much larger gamble with respect to the Carters' interest (and one Fackovec knew they did not want to take), that Texas Outfitters took this gamble knowing the pool of potential lessees had been diminished, and that refusing the lease benefitted Texas Outfitters' surface interest to the Carters' detriment. The trial court further recognized that protection of the surface interest was important to Texas Outfitters in light of its insistence on acquiring the executive rights as part of the ranch's purchase and its longstanding plan to use the ranch for hunting. We therefore read the trial court's findings to include a determination that Texas Outfitters refused the El Paso lease to benefit\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    its surface interest.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Violation of the Executive Duty\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    But does Texas Outfitters' conduct, as found by the trial court, rise to the level of \"self-dealing that unfairly diminishe[d] the value of the [Carters'] non-executive interest\"?\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876471\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/70/#p74\">\n     457 S.W.3d at 82\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Considering the historical context in which the executive duty arose, applying it becomes particularly difficult when, as in the instant case, one person owns the surface estate and either no associated mineral interest or a very small one, along with the executive right to another person's much larger mineral interest underlying that surface estate.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    Commentators generally\n    agree that the executive right originated \"in response to the fractionalization of the mineral fee interests so as to ease the leasing of oil and gas\" by \"provid[ing] potential lessees with the benefit of only having to wrangle over one lease instead of many.\" Christopher Kulander,\n    <em>\n     Big Money vs. Grand Designs: Revisiting the Executive Right to Lease Oil &amp; Gas Interests\n    </em>\n    , 42 TEX. TECH. L. REV. 33, 34 (2009). In this state of affairs, the interests of the executive and non-executive will largely align. Conflicts may of course still arise, as they do, for example, when only the executive is entitled to bonuses and delay rentals.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876471\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/70/#p74\">\n     457 S.W.3d at 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the executive and non-executive are presumably united, at least generally, in their desire to maximize the value of the mineral estate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    By contrast, a property purchaser primarily interested in the surface may acquire the executive right in order to protect that surface investment. Kulander,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 34-35. This scenario, presented here, gives rise to the potential for a significant conflict between the interests of the executive who favors the surface and those of the non-executive who favors the mineral estate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Christopher S. Kulander,\n    <em>\n     The Executive Right to Lease Mineral Real Property in Texas Before and After\n    </em>\n    Lesley v. Veterans Land Board, 44 ST. MARY'S L.J. 529, 567-68 (2013) (\"If the executive rights holder has an interest in ensuring the minerals remain undeveloped, such as in\n    <em>\n     Lesley\n    </em>\n    , a temptation may arise to put self-interest ahead of the interest of the mineral cotenants-a situation incompatible with the duties of a fiduciary.\"). As indicated above, the parties' divergent legal positions make it difficult to determine when such an executive crosses the line from lawfully promoting his own surface interest to unlawfully doing so at the expense of the non-executive interest, thereby engaging in self-dealing that unfairly diminishes the value of that interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    We addressed these competing considerations to some extent in\n    <em>\n     Lesley\n    </em>\n    , in which the developer-who, like Texas Outfitters, owned the surface estate, a portion of the mineral interest, and the executive rights to the remaining mineral interests-argued that it could not have breached its duty to the non-executive mineral owners because the restrictive covenants that curtailed future leasing burdened all mineral interests equally (including the executive's) and benefitted only the executive's interest in the surface estate.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317851\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/352/479/#p480\">\n     352 S.W.3d at 491\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In rejecting this argument, we reasoned in part that \"the common law provides appropriate protection to the surface owner through the accommodation doctrine.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317851\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/352/479/#p480\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317851\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/352/479/#p480\">\n     at 492\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . We thus implied that an executive surface owner who engages in conduct that burdens the mineral interest to the benefit of the surface, notwithstanding existing legal safeguards, is at particular risk of violating his executive duty.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In turn, while we cannot and do not say that an executive primarily interested in the surface necessarily breaches his duty by engaging in conduct that benefits the\n    surface but not the mineral estate,\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    we conclude that legally sufficient evidence supports the trial court's finding that Texas Outfitters did so in this case. The Carters presented evidence that it was \"common\" for owners in the area who used their land for commercial deer hunting to enter into oil and gas leases with operators who accommodated the surface use. Yet Texas Outfitters chose to reap the benefits of an unburdened surface estate to the Carters' detriment. And, importantly, the harm was not limited to the lost bonuses from one refused lease. Texas Outfitters declined the lease offer with knowledge of the Hindeses' lease with El Paso, which the trial court found had \"unfavorably affected\" the pool of potential lessees. That finding was borne out by evidence that a subsequent lease offer was withdrawn precisely because El Paso had already leased the remaining 50% mineral interest. This constitutes some evidence that Texas Outfitters engaged in acts of self-dealing that unfairly diminished the value of the Carters' mineral interest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Our holding exemplifies the importance of the particular facts and circumstances in evaluating an executive's conduct. Here, the fact that El Paso had already leased the Hindeses' interest impacted the propriety of Texas Outfitters' decision to refuse a lease offer from the same lessee. That is, Texas Outfitters \"gambled\" on a better lease offer despite knowing the circumstances that made such an offer unlikely. And as the trial court further found, this amounted to a much bigger risk for the Carters than Texas Outfitters given the size of their respective mineral interests.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Texas Outfitters notes that El Paso never offered to lease only the Carters' mineral interest and argues that it should not be \"forced\" to lease its own interest to avoid breaching its executive duty. We reject this argument for two reasons. First, as an evidentiary matter, the trial court sustained the Carters' objections to Fackovec's trial testimony regarding his willingness to lease only the Carters' interest and El Paso's refusal to do so. Texas Outfitters does not complain about these rulings on appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Second, and more importantly, the fact that El Paso's offer was to lease both the Carters' and Texas Outfitters' mineral interests is not dispositive; it is simply one of the facts and circumstances under review. The trial court concluded that Texas Outfitters' failure to lease its own interest along with the Carters', in light of all those facts and circumstances, was a breach of its duty. We certainly do not hold that an executive must always accept an offer to lease both the executive's and the non-executive's mineral interests when the non-executive wishes to accept. But we also do not hold that an executive is never required to accept such an offer. By purchasing executive rights, Texas Outfitters also purchased the corresponding duty of utmost good faith and fair dealing. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court's finding that Texas Outfitters breached that duty by refusing the El Paso lease.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     V. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    This case demonstrates yet again the fact-dependent nature of executive duty inquiries. Under our jurisprudence, the Carters had the burden to show that Texas Outfitters engaged in acts of self-dealing that unfairly diminished the value of the Carters' non-executive interest. That burden was met here. Because more than a scintilla of evidence supports the trial\n    court's finding that Texas Outfitters breached its executive duty, we affirm the court of appeals' judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Justice Lehrmann delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Justice Busby did not participate in the decision.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-68\">\n     As discussed further in Section IV(C), this divergence of positions is even starker when the executive's primary interest is the surface and the non-executive's sole interest is maximizing mineral development.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-69\">\n     We did not abandon the equal-benefits and no-subjugation principles in\n     <em>\n      Bradshaw\n     </em>\n     , but instead recognized that, under certain circumstances, they may continue to provide guidance when applying\n     <em>\n      Bradshaw\n     </em>\n     's controlling inquiry. For example, an executive who usurps a shared benefit (say, obtains an increase in his own royalty interest but not in the non-executive's royalty interest) would necessarily engage in self-dealing to the non-executive's detriment and thus breach his duty.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Bradshaw\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6876471\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/457/70/#p74\">\n      457 S.W.3d at 83\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . If, on the other hand, the executive obtains a benefit to which the non-executive has no legal entitlement (say, as in this case, a benefit for the surface interest), the equal-benefits principle does not necessarily apply, and the executive violates his duty only if, by obtaining a benefit to which the non-executive is not legally entitled, the executive engages in self-dealing that unfairly harms the non-executive's interest under\n     <em>\n      Bradshaw\n     </em>\n     . In short, the executive must acquire for the non-executive every benefit he exacts for himself when that benefit affects a shared interest, as the failure to obtain the benefit for the non-executive necessarily harms the non-executive's interest under those circumstances. When the benefit affects an interest that belongs solely to the executive, he need not necessarily acquire that same or any other benefit for the non-executive, but he must not unfairly harm the non-executive's interest in obtaining it.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-70\">\n     By the same token, the no-subjugation principle establishes that the executive duty does not globally require executives to subjugate their interests to those of the non-executives. It confirms that an executive need not\n     <em>\n      always\n     </em>\n     subjugate his interest to the non-executive's interest and does not\n     <em>\n      necessarily\n     </em>\n     violate his duty by failing to place the non-executive's interest above his own. But if by acquiring a benefit solely for himself the executive would unfairly harm the non-executive's interest, the executive must decline that benefit and, in that sense, must subjugate his interest to the non-executive's interest.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-71\">\n     The trial court labeled this finding as a conclusion of law, but we are not bound by that designation and may treat it as a finding of fact subject to the appropriate standard of review.\n     <em>\n      Ray v.
