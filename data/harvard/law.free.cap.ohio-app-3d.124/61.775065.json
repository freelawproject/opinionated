The certified mail was returned unclaimed, but the ordinary mail was not returned. After Emge failed to respond to the complaint, CIC obtained a default judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Apparently, CIC knew that Emge had an address at 2974 Compton Road, which was ostensibly a business address. In fact, this address was next door to Vytautas Bieliauskas, plaintiff-appellee, to whose claim against Emge CIC was subrogated. Prior to the suit, CIC sent Emge three letters about the dispute to the Compton address but received no reply. For this reason, CIC claims that it did not serve Emge at this business address, but used \u201cTrans Union,\u201d a commercial information database, to find Emge\u2019s residential address. Trans Union listed Emge\u2019s address as 9137 Telawaney Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Emge contends that he first received notice of the lawsuit in 1996, when he discovered a lien on his house. In his sole assignment of error, Emge asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to set aside the' default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Service of process must be reasonably calculated to notify interested parties of the pendency of an action and afford them an opportunity to respond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A default judgment rendered without proper service is void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A court has the inherent power to vacate a void judgment; thus, a party who asserts improper service need not meet the requirements of Civ.R. 60(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The plaintiff bears the burden of ensuring proper service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without evidence to the contrary, the defendant\u2019s address used by the plaintiff in the complaint will be assumed to be a place where the defendant will receive service of process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where the plaintiff follows the civil rules, courts presume that service is proper unless the defendant rebuts the presumption with sufficient evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If service by certified mail is returned and marked unclaimed, Civ.R. 4.6(D) allows for service by ordinary mail upon a written request filed with the clerk. If the ordinary mail is not returned, service is deemed complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>In this case, the certified mail was returned unclaimed, and CIC filed a written request for ordinary-mail service. The ordinary-mail envelope was never returned. Thus, CIC followed the civil rules for service of process, which created the presumption that service was properly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The thrust of Emge\u2019s argument is that the service of process was sent to an incorrect address \u2014 that Emge had not lived at 9137 Telawaney Court since 1985, some seven years before the suit. Emge filed an affidavit in which he asserts that he never received service of process and that his address is, and has been since 1985, 2974 Compton Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Some courts have held that an uncontroverted affidavit stating that the affiant did not receive service of process is enough to require that a default judgment be held void <em>ab initio. </em>See, <em>e.g., Rafalski v. Oates </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 65, 17 OBR 120, 477 N.E.2d 1212.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Rafalski, </em>the court held that when a defendant seeking to vacate a judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B) makes \u201can uncontradicted sworn statement that she never received service of a complaint, she is entitled to have the judgment against her vacated even if her opponent complied with Civ.R. 4.6 and had service made at an address where it could reasonably be anticipated that the defendant would receive it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66-67, 17 OBR at 122, 477 N.E.2d 1212, 477 N.E.2d at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">However, other courts, including this court, have distinguished these cases and determined that a \u201cself-serving\u201d affidavit, even if uncontroverted, may not be enough.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When an evidentiary hearing is held and the trial court determines that it does not believe the defendant\u2019s testimony that service was not received, a self-serving affidavit does not rebut the presumption of proper service of process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">No hearing was held on Emge\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment. The trial court merely entered judgment overruling the Civ.R. 60(B) motion. Without a hearing, the trial court could not have appropriately assessed Emge\u2019s credibility or the persuasiveness of Emge\u2019s evidence and could not have determined whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Emge was truthful in alleging that he did not receive proper service of process. At such a hearing, if the court finds that the plaintiff strictly complied with the civil rules regarding service, then the defendant has the burden to prove that service was not received.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In its memorandum in opposition to Emge\u2019s motion to vacate the default judgment, CIC attached as evidence a credit report from Trans World, prepared in 1996, which still listed Emge\u2019s home address at 9137 Telawaney Court. Although this may have weighed against Emge\u2019s position, it did not necessarily controvert Emge\u2019s claim that he did not receive the suit or even that he had not lived there for years \u2014 an equally likely analysis would be that the report has been incorrect all along. An evidentiary hearing is necessary on the issue of whether Emge did in fact receive service.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We hold that the trial court erred in overruling Emge\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment without holding an evidentiary hearing. We believe that this holding comports with the preference of courts to hear cases on their merits and the reluctance of courts to grant default judgments on technical grounds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We thus reverse the decision of the trial court overruling the motion for relief from judgment and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-8\">Doan and Sundermann, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">.
