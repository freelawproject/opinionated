Appellee completed and signed a residential property disclosure form as required by R.C. 5302.30. In that form, appellee acknowledged that the \u201cshower need (sic) drain valve.\u201d She also commented under the \u201cBasement/Crawl Space\u201d section of the form that \u201cheavy rain brought water into shower.\u201d However, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>denied knowledge of \u201cany movement, shifting, deterioration, material crack (other than visible minor cracks or blemishes) or other material problems with the foundation, floors, or interior/exterior walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The contract between the parties provided that the \u201cproperty passing under this contract shall include the following now on the premises IN THEIR PRESENT PHYSICAL CONDITION: all braidings * * (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In the spring of 1996, Mrs. Rogers discovered that the basement had flooded. Upon further inspection, the appellants concluded that mud and water were coming into the basement through a hole in the basement wall. This hole surrounded a water pipe that transected the wall. After making emergency repairs, the appellants observed that after every heavy rain, water entered the basement through cracks in the basement walls. Some of the cracks were painted over and one was covered with paneling.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">After a trial to the court, the trial court concluded that the alleged defects in the premises were not latent, that appellee\u2019s representations were based upon her actual knowledge and were not fraudulent, and that the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>precluded any recovery by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In their sole assignment of error, the appellants argue that the trial court erred in finding against the appellants on their claims of breach of contract and fraudulent concealment because it relied on inaccurate findings of fact. Specifically, the appellants argue that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that the hole in the basement wall was not a latent defect and that the cracks in the basement wall had never leaked prior to the Rogerses\u2019 purchase of the home were against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by some competent, credible evidence. <em>State ex rel. Pizza v. Strope </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 41, 46, 560 N.E.2d 765, 769-770; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. The trial court is entitled to make its own determination as to the weight of the evidence and, more important, credibility of the witnesses because it is in the best position to observe the witnesses\u2019 gestures and voice inflections. See <em>State v. Grant </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 465, 477, 620 N.E.2d 50, 64-65; <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273; <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, at paragraph one of the syllabus. The court is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness appearing before it. <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 65, 76, 619 N.E.2d 80, 88; <em>State v. Caldwell </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 667, 679, 607 N.E.2d 1096, 1104-1105; <em>State v. Harriston </em>(1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 58, 63, 577 N.E.2d 1144, 1147-1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>An \u201cas is\u201d clause in a real estate contract places the risk upon the purchaser as to' the existence of defects and relieves the seller of any duty to disclose. <em>Brewer v. Brothers </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 148, 151, 611 N.E.2d 492, 493-494; <em>Kaye v. Buehrle </em>(1983), 8 Ohio App.3d 381, 382-383, 8 OBR 495, 496-497, 457 N.E.2d 373, 375-376. Such a clause in a real estate contract bars suit for any \u201cpassive non-disclosure\u201d but does not shield the seller from an \u201cactive\u201d fraud of commission (as opposed to a fraud of omission), <em>i.e., </em>a misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment. <em>Chelmsford Properties, Inc. v. Courtney </em>(Mar. 31, 1995), Geauga App. No. 94-G-1887, unreported, 1995 WL 376935. <em>Id.; Brewer, supra, </em>at 151, 611 N.E.2d at 493-494; <em>Lance v. Bowe </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 202, 207, 648 N.E.2d 60, 63-64. The doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>precludes recovery in an action by the purchaser for a structural defect in real estate where (1) the condition complained of is open to observation or discoverable upon reasonable inspection, (2) the purchaser had the unimpeded opportunity to examine the premises, and (3) there is no fraud on the part of the vendor. <em>Layman v. Binns </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 176, 519 N.E.2d 642, syllabus; <em>Traverse v. Long </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 249, 252, 59 O.O. 325, 326-327, 135 N.E.2d 256, 258. Thus, if the vendor perpetrates a fraud, he or she cannot rely on the defense of <em>caveat emptor. </em>The sort of fraud necessary to defeat application of <em>caveat emptor </em>was described by the Supreme Court in <em>Layman, supra, </em>at 178, 519 N.E.2d at 644:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201cAn action for fraud may be grounded upon failure to fully disclose facts of a material nature where there exists a duty to speak. This court has held that a vendor has a duty to disclose material facts which are latent, not readily observable or discoverable through a purchaser\u2019s reasonable inspection.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">There is competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the cracks in the basement wall had not leaked prior to the sale of the house. Nellie Hill testified that the cracks appeared some time after a car had struck the house. After the initial repair of the cracks, Hill never saw water come in through the cracks in the basement walls. Geraldine Bergman and Charles Campbell testified that they had spent time in the house and had never seen water enter the basement through the cracks in the walls. The appellants\u2019 expert, Jay Shoemaker testified that water had been coming into the basement for a long time and that there were water stains around the cracks. Thus, although there was some evidence to the contrary, there was competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the cracks in the basement wall had never leaked prior to the Rogerses\u2019 purchase of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">There is also competent, credible evidence that the hole around the water pipe could have been detected by an inspection. Campbell testified that he had shown Mr. Rogers where the water line entered the house. He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>testified that the concrete wall was covered by paneling but that the paneling was about a foot in front of the wall and the hole was visible. A latent defect is one that could not have been detected by inspection. <em>Layman, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 178, 519 N.E.2d at 644-645. Thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the hole in the basement was not a latent defect since it could have been detected by a reasonable inspection. <em>Layman; Hull v. Arrow Material Products </em>(Sept. 1, 1995), Gallia App. No. 94CA25, unreported, 1995 WL 535186.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There is competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Therefore, the trial court did not err in concluding that the alleged defects in the home were not latent and that the appellants failed to overcome the defense of <em>caveat emptor. </em>We overrule appellants\u2019 only assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-7\">Peter B.
