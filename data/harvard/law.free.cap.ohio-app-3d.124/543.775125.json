Javier Rizzi, the owner of Morrow Auto, told Sellers at the time of sale, \u201cI guarantee the car; the car\u2019s a good car * * Rizzi also told Sellers, \u201c[I]f you have any problems, bring the car back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Sellers did have problems with the car. Four or five days after she purchased the car, Sellers brought it back to Morrow Auto, complaining that the car was \u201crunning hot.\u201d Rizzi told her that the car had a \u201cfloating gauge,\u201d and that it would be alright. After another few days, Sellers brought the car back again still complaining that the car was running hot. Sellers told Rizzi that her husband was going to put a new thermostat in the car. Rizzi gave Sellers $50 towards the cost of the thermostat. The car continued to overheat even with a new thermostat. Sellers brought the car back to Morrow Auto a third time. This time, Rizzi and an employee of Morrow Auto put antifreeze and water in the radiator when the car was turned off. Sellers testified at trial that she asked, \u201c[Shouldn\u2019t I start this car before you put that stuff in the radiator? Won\u2019t it blow it or bust the header?\u201d The employee answered, \u201c[N]o, the car\u2019s fine.\u201d When Sellers did start the car, white smoke came from the engine and Rizzi told Sellers she had \u201ccracked the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Morrow Auto returned Sellers\u2019s Thunderbird to her, but refused to return her $1,250 ($1,300 purchase price minus $50 returned to her for the new thermostat). Sellers brought an action to recover the $1,250 in small claims court. After a trial, the lower court entered judgment in Sellers\u2019s favor. From this judgment, Morrow Auto appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In a single assignment of error, Morrow Auto complains that the trial court\u2019s judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Morrow Auto raises two issues under the assignment of error. First, Morrow Auto states that the trial court should have applied the rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>(\u201clet the buyer beware\u201d) to reach its decision. Second, Morrow Auto argues that its responsibility for the new car ended once Sellers\u2019s husband intervened by putting a new thermostat in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">We reject outright Morrow Auto\u2019s argument that the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies in this case. <em>Caveat emptor </em>typically has no application to the sale of personal property, including used cars. <em>LaVeck v. Al\u2019s Mustang Stable </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 700, 704, 598 N.E.2d 154, 156, citing, <em>inter alia, Feliciano v. Moore </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App.2d 236, 18 O.O.3d 176, 412 N.E.2d 427. Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Chapter Two of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in Ohio at R.C. Chapter 1302, governs Sellers\u2019s purchase of a used car from Morrow. R.C. Chapter 1302 applies to \u201ctransactions in goods.\u201d R.C. 1302.02 (UCC 2-102). \u201cGoods\u201d means \u201call things * * * which are moveable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid,\u201d R.C. 1302.01(A)(8), and includes motor vehicles. See 81 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1988) 191, Sales, Section 41 (\u201cit is self-evident that motor vehicles fall within the statutory definition of \u2018goods\u2019 \u201d). See, also, <em>Fuqua Homes, Inc. v. Evanston Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App.2d 399, 403, 6 O.O.3d 440, 442, 370 N.E.2d 780, 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Under R.C. 1302.26(A)(1) (UCC 2-313), an express warranty is created by a seller when an affirmation of fact or a promise relating to goods becomes part of the basis for the bargain between two parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Express warranties can be made verbally. See <em>Society Natl. Bank v. Pemberton </em>(M.C.1979), 63 Ohio Misc. 26, 17 O.O.3d 342, 409 N.E.2d 1073 (statement that pickup truck would be \u201cjust right for plowing snow\u201d was sufficient basis on which court could find creation of express warranty). They can also consist of guarantees made by the seller. See 3 Anderson (1995), Uniform Commercial Code 80, Section 2-313:101.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The trial judge, as trier of fact, is in the best position to weigh evidence and assess witness credibility. See <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. Therefore, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>Judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to the essential elements of a cause of action cannot be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>C. E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 280, 8 O.O.3d 261, 262, 376 N.E.2d 578, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">In this case, Sellers testified that when she was considering buying the car from Morrow Auto, Rizzi told her that he guaranteed the car and that if she had any problems with the car, she should return it to him. ' It appears that the trial court construed this language as constituting an express warranty on the part of Morrow Auto. When Sellers returned to Morrow Auto to enforce that warranty because the car was \u201crunning hot,\u201d Rizzi did not repair the car, but told her to continue driving it because the gauge was a \u201cfloating gauge.\u201d The trial court concluded that Sellers could not be held liable for damage that occurred because she drove the car on Morrow Auto\u2019s advice after she brought the car in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>for repairs. On these facts, we find that there is competent, credible evidence to support that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Finally, we decline to address appellant\u2019s argument that the installation of a new thermostat in the car was a \u201csuperseding intervening cause.\u201d Morrow Auto did not raise this argument below, nor did the trial court address this issue in its judgment. We can find no error by the trial court for failing to address an issue that was never raised. In any case, the record does not support Morrow Auto\u2019s contention that the damage to the car resulted from the installation of the new thermostat. To the contrary, the record indicates that the car \u201cran hot\u201d both before and after the new thermostat was installed. For the reasons stated above, the assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judgment of the trial court in favor of appellee is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-7\">Powell, P.J., and Koehler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\">.
