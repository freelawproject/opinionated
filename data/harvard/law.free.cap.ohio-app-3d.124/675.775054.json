At approximately 8:00 p.m. on October 13, 1996, defendant and Keith Frazier decided to walk to the corner carryout and purchase some beer. As they left defendant\u2019s house to head to the carryout, Paul Booth pulled up behind them in his car. Booth offered to drive defendant and Frazier to the carryout. Although neither defendant nor Frazier knew Booth well, they accepted the ride. Upon arriving at the carryout, defendant, Frazier, and Booth were joined by Terry Allen. While defendant and Frazier each purchased a forty-ounce bottle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>beer, Allen went across the street and bought a rock of crack cocaine. When Allen returned to the carryout, he, Frazier, and defendant started walking back toward defendant\u2019s house on foot. Booth left the carryout separately in his car, drove ahead, parked his car, and rejoined Allen, Frazier, and defendant on foot a few minutes later. As Frazier, Allen, Booth, and defendant walked toward defendant\u2019s house, Booth became aggressive and began to push and shove the others, and threatened to rob Allen. In an attempt to separate themselves from Booth, Frazier and Allen picked up their pace, leaving defendant and Booth a short distance behind them. As a result, there were no witnesses to the altercation which followed between defendant and Booth, and which, according to the state, resulted in Booth\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">However, according to defendant, as Frazier and Allen turned a corner ahead of him and Booth, Booth reached up and knocked defendant\u2019s hat off, striking him in the head in the process. Booth then demanded defendant\u2019s beer, and when defendant hesitated to hand it over, Booth grabbed the bottle from defendant\u2019s hand. Defendant then attempted to walk quickly away from Booth and to catch up with Frazier and Allen. As he did so, Booth reached out and grabbed defendant from behind. Defendant turned quickly around in an attempt to free himself from Booth\u2019s grasp, and removed a folding knife he was carrying from his jacket pocket. Now facing Booth, defendant backed away from him, opening the knife as he did so. According to defendant, Booth then came at him with the beer bottle, tripped over the curb and fell into defendant, impaling himself on the knife that defendant was holding and causing both men to fall to the ground. When the two men got back on their feet, Booth fled down the street and defendant rejoined Frazier and Allen in front of his house. Defendant testified that he did not realize that Booth was badly hurt. However, the autopsy that was later performed on Booth revealed that in addition to the lethal wound by a knife that entered the upper abdomen and pierced the liver and aorta, Booth had three other nonlethal stab wounds: one to the right side of his neck, one to his right front shoulder, and one to his right rear shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Shortly after defendant rejoined Frazier and Allen, Allen complained that he was cold, and borrowed defendant\u2019s jacket. Allen testified that there was nothing in the pockets of defendant\u2019s jacket when he borrowed it. However, defendant testified that his knife was in the jacket when he loaned it to Allen. Frazier, Allen, and defendant then went around to the back of defendant\u2019s house to drink beer and smoke crack. Allen testified that he left defendant\u2019s house about twenty minutes later still wearing defendant\u2019s jacket. The police never recovered defendant\u2019s knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">At approximately 12:30 a.m. on October 14, 1996, a Columbus Police Officer discovered Booth, still alive, lying in the middle of a street in the vicinity of the stabbing. Booth died several hours later at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Around 4:00 a.m. on October 14, 1996, Allen was stopped by Columbus Police for riding his bicycle without a light. Following a records check, Allen was arrested on an-outstanding warrant. While Allen was being transported to jail he overheard a bulletin on the police radio stating that Paul Booth had died at the hospital. Allen then volunteered the information that he had about the altercation between Booth and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">While questioning Allen about the events that led to Booth\u2019s death, the police inquired about the fact that someone had attempted to use two of Booth\u2019s credit cards in the early morning hours of October 14, 1996, following the stabbing. In response, Allen stated that after he left defendant\u2019s house he happened upon Booth\u2019s car, which was still parked where Booth had left it earlier that night. According to Allen, when he looked into the car, he noticed a credit card sitting on the dashboard and took it. Later he tried to use the card to purchase gas but was unsuccessful, so he cut the card up and discarded it. Allen stated that he had no knowledge of the second stolen credit card. Allen repeated this story at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Based upon Allen\u2019s statements to police, defendant was arrested and charged with one count of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02. Beginning on January 8, 1997, defendant was tried before a jury for Booth\u2019s murder. During the trial, defendant testified in his own defense. On January 17,1997, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant not guilty of murder, but guilty of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court then entered a judgment sentencing defendant to nine years. of incarceration. Defendant appeals therefrom assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\u201cFIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">\u201cAppellant was denied effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed under the ' Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">\u201cSECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">\u201cAppellant was denied his right to a fair trial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">\u201cTHIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">\u201cEvidentiary errors made by the trial court denied Appellant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u201cFOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">\u201cThe jury erred in failing to find that self defense was established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that his counsel\u2019s performance was so deficient as to deny him the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed to criminal defendants by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Section 10, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a ' defendant must meet the two-pronged standard outlined in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. First, he must demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that counsel\u2019s errors were \u201cso serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Second, defendant must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s errors, showing that the \u201cerrors were so serious as to deprive [him] of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To meet this second prong, defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Although defendant has pointed out numerous alleged errors by his defense counsel, we will focus on four related and particularly troubling actions by defense counsel. However, a complete appreciation of the errors committed by defense counsel necessitates a brief discussion of defendant\u2019s explanation of the events which led to Booth\u2019s death. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">While defendant\u2019s explanation of Booth\u2019s stabbing as an accident accounts for only one of Booth\u2019s four knife wounds, during his videotaped statement to police, defendant suggested an alternative and potentially plausible, albeit unlikely, explanation for Booth\u2019s additional wounds. Specifically, defendant suggested that Booth\u2019s three additional wounds were inflicted by Allen. Defendant suggested that Allen, after leaving defendant\u2019s house wearing defendant\u2019s jacket with defendant\u2019s knife in the pocket, found Booth lying in the street wounded by the single accidental stab, took the knife from the pocket of defendant\u2019s jacket, stabbed Booth three additional times and stole his credit cards. Allen then attempted to use Booth\u2019s credit cards numerous times over the next several hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">We now turn to addressing defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel\u2019s first, and most egregious error, occurred shortly after defendant\u2019s arrest. With counsel\u2019s advice and consent, defendant agreed to give a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>statement to the police. Defendant\u2019s statement was given to two homicide detectives from the Columbus Police Department. The statement was videotaped and defendant\u2019s counsel was present throughout. The statement that defendant gave to police was materially consistent with his trial testimony. Specifically, defendant stated that Booth\u2019s stabbing resulted from an accident that occurred when Booth tripped over the curb and fell on defendant. However, at numerous points during defendant\u2019s statement, defense counsel referred to defendant\u2019s explanation of the events as \u201cbullshit,\u201d looked incredulously at defendant, and urged defendant to tell the truth. In fact, defense counsel\u2019s performance during defendant\u2019s statement to police was so outrageous that counsel could easily be mistaken for a police officer at various points throughout the video. Despite defense counsel\u2019s attacks, defendant continued to maintain that the stabbing was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">At defendant\u2019s trial, the videotape of defendant\u2019s statement to police was shown to the jury. Defense counsel, apparently realizing the damaging nature of the video, objected to the playing of the video. When this objection was overruled, defense requested that those portions of the tape showing defense counsel referring to defendant\u2019s story as \u201cbullshit\u201d be excised pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A) prior to showing the video to the jury. The trial court denied this request as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s attack on defendant\u2019s version of the facts as \u201cbullshit\u201d on the videotape was compounded by counsel\u2019s opening statement. Counsel began his opening statement with the following comment:</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\u201cI represent the Defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">\u201cSome of what he says is trae, <em>and some of it is not true. </em>All the facts will come out.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">This statement by defense counsel served to east serious doubt on defendant\u2019s credibility at the very beginning of the trial by suggesting that defendant\u2019s own lawyer did not believe portions of defendant\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Further, despite defendant\u2019s insistence that Booth\u2019s stabbing was the result of an accident, defense counsel failed to request a jury instruction on the defense of accident. Instead, defense counsel requested, and received, a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of self-defense, a defense that is patently inconsistent with defendant\u2019s explanation of the events. Defendant never gave an explanation of the stabbing that would be consistent with the affirmative defense of self-defense. At all times both prior to and during his trial, defendant maintained that Booth\u2019s stabbing resulted from an accident that occurred when Booth tripped and fell onto the knife that defendant was holding. Although defendant\u2019s testimony indicates that defendant took the knife out in preparation to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>himself, defendant consistently maintained that the actual stabbing occurred as the result of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Finally, given the uncontroverted evidence that Allen borrowed defendant\u2019s jacket and that he stole and attempted to use one of Booth\u2019s credit cards after Booth was stabbed, defense counsel failed to adequately develop defendant\u2019s theory that Allen played a role in Booth\u2019s death and that Allen\u2019s role accounted for Booth\u2019s additional stab wounds. Although defense counsel cross-examined Allen briefly about his use of the credit cards, counsel failed in his closing remarks to tie together the evidence regarding Allen\u2019s possession of the jacket, in which defendant testified the knife was located, and Allen\u2019s possession of Booth\u2019s credit card in an attempt to suggest that Allen might have inflicted the additional stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">It is clear that defense counsel\u2019s performance meets the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Defense counsel had a duty to zealously represent defendant within the bounds of the law. DR 7-101(A)(l). Instead, counsel affirmatively prejudiced defendant\u2019s interest by questioning defendant\u2019s version of the facts, and defendant\u2019s credibility in the presence of the jury. DR 7-101(A)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defense counsel also appears to have based his request for jury instructions upon what he believed to be the best explanation of the events leading to the victim\u2019s death, rather than the explanation propounded by defendant. In short, the record suggests that defense counsel allowed his personal doubts about defendant\u2019s version of the facts to cloud his professional judgment and to interfere with his representation of defendant. Defendant presented a plausible, if unlikely, exculpatory explanation of how Booth was killed and how he came to have multiple stab wounds. However, instead of attempting to develop and build upon defendant\u2019s explanation, defense counsel cast aspersions upon it and upon defendant\u2019s credibility. In short, defense counsel\u2019s representation of defendant was far below the objectively reasonable standard of legal representation to which a criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The question under <em>Strickland </em>then is whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of defendant\u2019s trial would have been different. Because defendant was the only witness to testify regarding how Booth was stabbed, the outcome of defendant\u2019s trial turned in large part upon the extent to which the jury believed defendant\u2019s version of the events. However, the jury could not possibly have fairly evaluated defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>credibility after hearing defendant\u2019s own attorney question defendant\u2019s truthfulness in his opening statement, and again in the videotape. It is true that the portions of the videotape containing defense counsel\u2019s improper criticism of defendant\u2019s explanation of the stabbing should have been excised pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A), as counsel\u2019s behavior was terribly prejudicial to defendant and wholly irrelevant to the state\u2019s case. See Evid.R. 403(A). The fact remains, however, that the no such redaction occurred and the jury was fully exposed to defense counsel\u2019s errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Further, defense counsel\u2019s failure to develop Allen\u2019s possible role in Booth\u2019s death in his closing argument prevented the jury from gaining a complete picture of defendant\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Finally, the absence of a jury instruction on the defense of accident prevented the jury from acquitting defendant even if it believed defendant\u2019s story in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Given the cumulative effect of defense counsel\u2019s errors, we can only conclude that there is a reasonable probability that defendant would have been acquitted but for defense counsel\u2019s unprofessional performance. Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Our resolution of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error renders defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error moot, and we decline to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Having sustained defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, and having found defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error to be moot, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this matter for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b714-11\">Petree and John C.
