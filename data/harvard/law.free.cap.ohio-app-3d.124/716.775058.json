We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-20\">The appellant was charged -with one count of domestic violence, in violation of Cuyahoga Falls Municipal Ordinance 537.14(a). She entered a plea of not guilty at her arraignment. On April 29, 1997, the appellant was present before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>court and ready to proceed with the requested jury trial. Prior to the commencement of trial, the city of Cuyahoga Falls dismissed the charge pursuant to Crim.R. 48(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted the prosecution\u2019s request for dismissal, but assessed $50 in court costs to the appellant. At no time was there any proceeding, adjudication, or finding of guilt on the part of the appellant. The appellant brings this appeal, raising a single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThe court erred and violated Appellant\u2019s constitutional right of due process in assessing Appellant court costs, absent a finding of guilt, following the City of Cuyahoga Falls\u2019 dismissal of the criminal charge against Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The appellant argues that the trial court was without authority to assess the court costs to her. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits governmental actions that deprive \u201cany person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d The appellant contends that she was deprived of her property without due process. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In criminal cases, where a defendant has been found guilty and sentenced, \u201cthe judge or magistrate shall include in the sentence the costs of prosecution and render a judgment against the defendant for such costs.\u201d R.C. 2947.23. If a jury has been sworn at a trial of the case, the jurors\u2019 fees are also included in the costs assessed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">However, there is no authority for a court to assess costs against a defendant who has not been sentenced, absent an agreement otherwise between the parties. In fact, an Ohio Attorney General Opinion states:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">\u201cUnder the provisions of Section 2947.23 Revised Code, the per diem fees of jurors in a criminal case * * * constitute a part of the costs of prosecution for which judgment shall be rendered against a convicted defendant * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">\u00ab\u2021 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">\u201cNote that judgment shall be rendered for costs of prosecution \u2018against a convicted defendant.\u2019 An acquitted or <em>an innocent defendant is not required to pay </em>* * * <em>fees.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 1969 Ohio Atty.Gen.Ops. No. 69-081.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">Furthermore, R.C. 2901.05(A) provides that \u201c[ejvery person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt * * *.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lipschutz v. Shoemaker </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 88, 91, 551 N.E.2d 160, 163 (A. William Sweeney, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The appellant in this case was not proven or otherwise found to be guilty. Therefore, she is an innocent defendant and is not required to pay fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The appellant\u2019s assignment of error has merit and is sustained. The judgment of trial court assessing court costs to the appellant is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b750-7\">Dickinson, P.J., and Quillin, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\">. Crim.R. 48(A) pertains to a dismissal by the state, and provides: \"The state may by leave of court and in open court file an entry of dismissal of an indictment' information, or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
