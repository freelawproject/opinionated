Appellant, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, appeals from the granting of summary judgment by the trial court in favor of appellees, Kyle L. Craft (\u201cKyle\u201d), a minor, and Suzanne Craft (\u201cSuzanne\u201d) in a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">Suzanne Craft, now known as Suzanne Kubacko, is the natural mother of Kyle; Andrew is the natural father of Kevin. At the time of the incident, Suzanne and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Andrew were engaged; they have since married. On March 1, 1994, Kevin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was baby-sitting Kyle at the residence then shared by Andrew and Kevin on Route 46 in Cortland, Ohio. According to Kevin, Kyle was playing near a wood-burning furnace when he leaned against the hot surface and was burned on his buttocks. Sometime later, Kevin placed Kyle in a bathtub in which the water was too hot. Consequently, Kyle received second- and third-degree burns over eighteen percent of his body. Kyle\u2019s injuries went untreated for approximately five hours, increasing the severity of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Pursuant to the filing of a bill of information by the prosecutor, Kevin was charged with one count of child endangering, in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A), a felony of the fourth degree, with a specification. Kevin voluntarily entered a guilty plea to the charge of child endangering on August 30, 1995, after being advised of his rights and of the elements of child endangering.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a judgment entry dated October 26, 1995, Kevin was sentenced to one year in prison, which sentence was suspended by the court in lieu of five years of probation. The trial court also ordered that Kevin make restitution in the amount of the medical expenses, and pay the costs of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Previously, on August 27, 1993, appellant had issued a tenant\u2019s insurance policy, naming Andrew as the insured. The policy contained an exclusionary provision stating that personal liability and medical payments were not applicable to bodily injury or property damage \u201cwhich [was] expected or intended by the <em>insured.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) </em>Andrew\u2019s policy was subsequently amended by an endorsement containing the following liability exclusion:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>\u201cSection II </em>\u2014 Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u201cIn all policies under the Section II \u2014 Exclusions for Personal Liability and Medical Payments to Others, paragraph a. is deleted and replaced by the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u201ca. caused intentionally by or at direction of an <em>insured, </em>including willful acts the result of which the <em>insured </em>knows or ought to know will follow from the <em>insured\u2019s </em>conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>On May 30, 1995, appellant filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, requesting the trial court to declare that the incident claimed by defendants Andrew, Kevin, Suzanne, and Kyle was excluded by the intentional-acts exclusion of Andrew\u2019s policy with appellant. Appellees Suzanne and Kyle filed an answer and a counterclaim on July 27, 1995, requesting that the court declare that the negligent and/or accidental acts of Kevin be covered by appellant, and requesting a declaration from the court that the policy provide personal liability coverage in the amount of $100,000, separately, to both of their claims, and that the policy provide medical payments in behalf of Kyle for $1,000. Defendant Kevin filed a separate answer on July 27,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Appellees Suzanne and Kyle filed a motion for summary judgment on January 25, 1996.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They filed a cross-claim against Kevin on February 2, 1996, seeking monetary damages for Kevin\u2019s alleged negligence. Appellant filed its motion for summary judgment on March 29,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In a judgment entry filed on June 7, 1996, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and granted the motion of appellees Suzanne and Kyle, determining that (1) in view of the holding in <em>Physicians Ins. Co. of Ohio v. Swanson </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 189, 569 N.E.2d 906, \u201c[t]here [was] no evidence before the Court that would indicate that Kevin Kubacko even knew the bath water was hot nor did he know that the child would be injured\u201d; (2) \u201c[c]hild endangering does not require knowledge or intent under [the] statute, [but] at best the requirement is recklessness,\u201d which the court found to be a different standard than willful or intentional; and (3) appellant failed to carry the burden of establishing that the actions were excluded by the specific and unambiguous terms of the insurance contract and the conduct was; therefore, presumed to be covered. The trial court first declared that $100,000 of personal liability coverage was available to Kyle under the policy. The court next determined that $100,000 of personal liability coverage was also available to Suzanne. Finally, the trial court stated that the policy would provide medical payments on behalf of Kyle in the amount of $4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Appellant filed a timely appeal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201c[1.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of [appellant] by incorrectly and arbitrarily determining an amount of coverage available under appellant Nationwide\u2019s policy of insurance with appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201c[2.] The trial court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of appellees because genuine issues of material fact exist concerning whether appellee Kevin Kubacko knew, or ought to have known, his conduct in placing appellee Kyle Craft in scalding water would cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u201c[3.] The trial court erred in its application of <em>Physicians Ins. Co. [of Ohio </em>] <em>v. Swanson </em>to the instant case because different policy exclusions distinguish this case from <em>Swanson, </em>and because an issue of material fact exists regarding whether appellee Kevin Kubacko knew, or ought to have known, his conduct would cause injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u201c[4.] The court erred in its award of summary judgment in favor of appellee Kevin Kubacko because the ruling allows a convicted felon to be indemnified by insurance for an illegal act, and is thus, contrary to public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Due to the interrelatedness of the issues in the second and third assignments, we will address the alleged errors under those assignments in consolidated fashion. Since those assignments are dispositive, we will consider them first.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The applicable standard of review for a summary judgment was stated by this court in <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Manning </em>(Aug. 29, 1997), Geauga App. No. 96-G-1999, unreported, at 3,1997 WL 531235:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u201cAs in any summary judgment exercise, the movant bears the responsibility of demonstrating to the trial court that there is an absence of a genuine issue of material fact, and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105 [671 N.E.2d 241, 244-245], If the movant fails to satisfy this burden, summary judgment must be denied. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293 [662 N.E.2d 264, 273-274], If the motion for summary judgment is sufficient to demonstrate an absence of triable issues, a corresponding duty is triggered in the non-movant to come forward with evidence demonstrating a jury question. <em>State ex rel. Mayes v. Holman </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 147, 148 [666 N.E.2d 1132, 1133-1134], If the nonmovant is successful in rebutting the movant\u2019s case, summary judgment must be denied. * * * An appellate court subjects a lower court\u2019s entry of summary judgment to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 552 [671 N.E.2d 317, 320].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>In a declaratory judgment action brought by an insurer, the burden is on the insurer to establish an exclusion. <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Louis Marx &amp; Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 399, 401, 18 O.O.3d 539, 540, 415 N.E.2d 315, 317. \u201cIn order to avoid coverage on the basis of an intentional-act exclusion, the insurer must demonstrate that the injury itself was intentional or expected.\u201d <em>W. Res. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Campbell </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 537, 541, 676 N.E.2d 919, 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Gearing v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 34, 665 N.E.2d 1115, the Ohio Supreme Court articulated the \u201cinferred intent\u201d rule in a child sexual molestation case: \u201cunder the inferred intent rule, intent to injure is inferred as a matter of law from the act of sexual abuse of a child itself, as harm is deemed inherent in the sexual molestation, regardless of the offender\u2019s expression of subjective intent * * <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 665 N.E.2d at 1117. The act of child sexual molestation and the harm caused thereby are \u201cvirtually inseparable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 665 N.E.2d at 1117-1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Although R.C. 2919.22(A) does not expressly state a culpable mental state as an element of the crime of child endangering, the Supreme Court of Ohio has recently held that \u201c[t]he existence of the culpable mental state of recklessness is an essential element of the crime of endangering children under R.C. 2919.22(A).\u201d <em>State v. McGee </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 680 N.E.2d 975, syllabus. See, also, <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144 (construing R.C. 2919.22[B][2]); <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144, (construing R.C. 2919.22[B][3]); <em>State v. Duke </em>(Sept. 30, 1993), Portage App. No. 93-P-0010, unreported, 1993 WL 406574; <em>State v. Schoolcraft </em>(May 29, 1992), Portage App. No. 91-P2340, unreported, 1992 WL 276661.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In our opinion, the critical distinction between the policy exclusion in <em>Swanson </em>and the clause at issue here is that the exclusionary language in the case <em>sub judice </em>is more broadly worded than the exclusion in <em>Swanson, </em>since it precludes coverage for intentionally <em>or </em>willfully caused injuries. Recklessness has been held to be the functional equivalent of willfulness in the civil context. <em>Brockman v. Bell </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 508, 516, 605 N.E.2d 445, 450, citing <em>Thompson v. McNeill </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 102, 559 N.E.2d 705; <em>Jackson v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 448, 602 N.E.2d 363; 2 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 587, Section 500. See, also, <em>Breeds v. McKinney </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 336, 14 O.O.2d 8, 170 N.E.2d 850. For the purpose of deciding whether the exclusion here has been triggered, reckless action is tantamount to willful conduct. Thus, in support of its summary judgment motion, appellant was only required to present evidential materials demonstrating that Kevin acted recklessly, not intentionally, in causing Kyle\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Under Crim.R. 11(B)(1), a guilty plea is a \u201ccomplete admission of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d \u201cBy entering a guilty plea, the accused necessarily admits that he did the specific acts which he is accused of doing. <em>Flenoy v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 131, 133 [564 N.E.2d 1060, 1062-1063], citing <em>United States v. Broce </em>(1989), 488 U.S. 563, 570 [109 S.Ct. 757, 762-763, 102 L.Ed.2d 927, 936].\u201d <em>Manning </em>at 9, fn. 2. \u201cGuilty pleas are admissible as evidence. Evid.R. 803(21).\u201d <em>Manning </em>at 7. In <em>Manning, </em>this court also stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the submission of a guilty plea to a criminal charge, for a crime of which <em>intent </em>is an essential element, is strong enough proof so as to eliminate all doubt as to whether an insured\u2019s conduct would be deemed \u2018intentional\u2019 for purposes of an \u2018intentional act\u2019 exclusion. <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 115 [30 OBR 424, 430, 507 N.E.2d 1118, 1124-1125].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cWhere the insured has [pleaded] guilty to the sexual molestation of a minor, his intent to cause harm may be inferred as a matter of law from the commission of the crime for the purposes of determining whether an intentional act exclusion applies.\u201d <em>Manning </em>at 5, fn. 1, citing <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Roberts </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 532, 537, 624 N.E.2d 343, 346. The inferred-intent rule has also been applied to injuries stemming from reckless conduct. See <em>Campbell </em>at 542, 676 N.E.2d at 922-923; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Cartwright </em>(June 27, 1997), Montgomery App. Nos. 15472 and 15473, unreported, 1997 WL 368370. These cases invariably involved gunshot injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The \u201cinferred-intent\u201d rule is not applicable for our determination of whether the exclusion in the case at bar has been triggered. In child endangerment, unlike child sexual abuse, the causal effect between the perpetrator\u2019s action and the harm suffered by the child is not a foregone conclusion. Reckless and/or wilful conduct involves a different degree of volitional action on the part of the actor than intentional conduct. Reckless conduct involves \u00e1 substantial <em>risk </em>of harm, whereas intentional conduct essentially presupposes the occurrence of harm. Under the facts of this case, we reject the notion that a guilty plea to an offense in which recklessness is an essential element constitutes irrefutable evidence of the certainty of the occurrence of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In his guilty plea to child endangering, Kevin admitted that he created a substantial risk of harm that resulted in serious injury to Kyle. Kevin\u2019s guilty plea was not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish <em>per se </em>that Kyle\u2019s injury was the result of reekless/willful conduct. However, by submitting the certified copy of the guilty plea,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appellant satisfied its burden of presenting at least some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>evidence which demonstrated that Kevin\u2019s conduct fell outside of the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Putting aside Kevin\u2019s guilty plea, recklessness was arguably otherwise demonstrated. It is proper for a court to examine the underlying facts of the crime. <em>Cartwright </em>at 8. It has been held that a self-serving statement in an affidavit is of negligible value in demonstrating intent or expectation in an insurance policy coverage analysis. <em>Campbell, </em>111 Ohio App.3d at 541, 676 N.E.2d at 919. However, in light of the fact that Kyle burned himself on the stove, and assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Kevin did not know that the water was too hot, the fact that Kevin consciously allowed Kyle\u2019s various burn injuries to go untreated for approximately five hours is arguably sufficient, in and of itself, to suggest the occurrence of reckless conduct. \u201c \u2018Reckless misconduct\u2019 involves a \u2018conscious choice of a course of action, either with the knowledge of serious danger to others involved in it or with the knowledge of facts that would disclose this danger to any reasonable man.\u2019 [Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts, (1965) 590, Section 500.]\u201d <em>Ickes v. Tille </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 438, 442, 674 N.E.2d 738, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In any event, it is clear that appellant presented evidence demonstrating that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Kevin\u2019s conduct was reckless for purposes of determining the applicability of the exclusion. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for appellees Suzanne and Kyle. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is also well founded. The court\u2019s declaration of the availability of $4,000 in medical payments for Kyle clearly exceeds the amount allowed under the express terms of the policy, $1,000. Likewise, the policy clearly provides that only $100,000 in coverage is available <em>per occurrence. </em>Kyle\u2019s injury, which resulted from the initial burn, the subsequent placing of his body in the hot water, and the delay in seeking medical attention, constituted a single occurrence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court incorrectly declared that the policy provided $200,000 when only a single occurrence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>involved. Under this policy, the court could only award $100,000 total to either Suzanne, or Kyle, or both of them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Turning to the fourth assignment of error, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that \u201c[liability insurance does not exist to relieve wrongdoers of liability for intentional, antisocial, [or] criminal conduct.\u201d Gearing, 76 Ohio St.3d at 38, 665 N.E.2d at 1118. The <em>Gearing </em>court further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u201cConsistent with the public policy expressed in the Criminal Code, we agree with those courts that have concluded that a \u2018person who sexually manipulates a minor cannot expect his insurer to cover his misconduct and cannot obtain such coverage simply by saying that he did not mean any harm,\u2019 <em>Whitt v. De Leu </em>(W-D.Wis.1989), 707 F.Supp. 1011, 1016. Moreover, requiring an insurer to indemnify an insured who has engaged in sexual abuse of a child \u2018subsidizes the episodes of child sexual abuse of which its victims complain, at the ultimate expense of other insureds to whom the added costs of indemnifying child molesters will be passed.\u2019 <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Fore </em>(M.D.Ala.1992), 785 F.Supp. 947, 956.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 665 N.E.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Appellant argues that the same rationale is equally applicable here, and dictates that we not require an insurer to subsidize an injury stemming from a conviction of child endangerment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In our view, appellant\u2019s proposition casts too broad a net by excluding coverage for injuries that arise as the result of behavior which is undoubtedly criminal \u25a0 under the relevant statute, but involves a set of circumstances that do not indicate heinous, or egregious conduct. The Second District Court of Appeals in <em>Cartwright, </em>at 11, cogently analyzed a broadly worded criminal acts exclusion which illustrates appellant\u2019s strained interpretation of <em>Gearing:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u201cWe are aware that the unfettered application of criminal acts exclusions may mean that insurance companies can avoid their obligations under their policies whenever an insured violates a criminal statute. Insurance companies are now writing their criminal acts exclusions very broadly to exclude any injury resulting from a criminal act, regardless of the type of criminal act and whether the injury was reasonably expected to occur. While it is true that public policy disfavors insuring for <em>certain </em>injuries stemming from <em>certain </em>criminal acts, it surely does not prohibit coverage for all injuries resulting from any criminal act. Of course, public policy does not, for example, prohibit insurance coverage for unexpected injuries stemming from minor traffic offenses or crimes based upon only negligent acts. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u201cThese broadly worded criminal acts exclusions could, without a strong public policy justification, reach many injuries that are normally considered to be covered by insurance. It is possible that these broadly written criminal acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>exclusions will be used to gut normal insurance coverage and extend what may be excluded under insurance policies to include accidents. Either the type of criminal acts that come within the purview of these exclusions need to be restricted or the injuries stemming from criminal acts need to be limited to those which are expected to avoid this problem.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In our view, appellant\u2019s proposed statement of law would represent an improper extension of the <em>Gearing </em>holding. We note, initially, that the standard exclusion in <em>Gearing </em>applied to intent. Furthermore, reckless conduct is not categorically excluded from the ambit of insurance coverage. Moreover, appellant\u2019s argument does not address the possibility that Kevin\u2019s conduct arguably did not rise to the crest of recklessness, but instead constituted negligence. If true, that factor would further militate against this court holding that public policy disfavors providing insurance coverage for any injury arising from any criminal act whatsoever,- regardless of the underlying circumstances. In summary, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error have merit, and the fourth assignment is meritless. The judgment of the trial court in favor of appellees Suzanne and Kyle Craft is reversed, and the cause is hereby remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-8\">Christley and William M.
