Appellant, Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, appeals from a judgment entry granting summary judgment for appellees, Edgar W. Koby, Jr., (\u201cKoby\u201d), Thomas G. Butcher (\u201cButcher\u201d), Beverly Butcher (\u201cBeverly\u201d), Stephanie Butcher (\u201cStephanie\u201d), Sally Butcher (\u201cSally\u201d), and Stacey Butcher (\u201cStacey\u201d), in a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">Koby is a thirty-two year-old captain in the United States Army, stationed at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas. On December 28, 1994, Koby was visiting his parents\u2019 home at 9660 Howland-Springs Road, Trumbull County, Howland Township, Ohio. While he was visiting, he was target shooting in his parents\u2019 backyard when he fired a gunshot into the woods which accidentally struck and injured Butcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">On September 22, 1995, Butcher, individually, and Beverly, in her own behalf and as next friend of the couple\u2019s minor children, filed a complaint against Koby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and his parents, Edgar W. Koby, Sr. and Patricia Ann Koby, seeking damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Koby sought defense and indemnification from appellant, the issuer of a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy on his parent\u2019s home. The policy provides insurance coverage for the insured and \u201cresidents of your household\u201d including the insured\u2019s relatives. Appellant declined to defend and indemnify on the ground that Koby is not a resident in the household of his parents, but instead has his own residence in Texas, where he is stationed as a career officer in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On December 7, 1995, appellant filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, naming Koby as the defendant, seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Koby.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant filed a motion to consolidate case No. 95CV1494, the personal injury action, and case No. 95CV2027, the declaratory judgment action, on February 20, 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An amended complaint, naming Butcher, Beverly, Stephanie, Sally, and Stacey as additional defendants, was filed on April 17,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Appellant filed a motion for summary judgment on June 28, 1996, which was overruled by the trial court on November 22, 1996. In overruling appellant\u2019s summary judgment motion, the trial court determined that there was a substantial indication that Koby considered 9660 Howland-Springs Road to be his residence, based on the fact that he paid taxes in Ohio, possessed an Ohio driver\u2019s license, voted in Ohio, and used that address as his residence address when requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Appellees Butcher, Beverly, and the minor children by and through Beverly, filed their motion for summary judgment on December 20, 1996. In a judgment entry filed on January 29,1997, the trial court granted summary judgment on the issue of insurance coverage, determining that Koby is an insured entitled to defense and indemnification under the subject policy. The court also declared its judgment to be a final appealable order, stated that there was no just cause for delay, and ordered that the consolidated cause proceed to trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, and raises a single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of [appellant] in overruling its motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for summary judgment of [appellees].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The decisive issue in this case is whether, for insurance coverage purposes, Koby, a thirty-two year-old career Army officer residing in Killeen, Texas, is also a resident of his parents\u2019 home in Howland Township, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">A reviewing court \u201cis required to view the evidence most strongly in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Wood v.

LaMarr </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 331, 334, 635 N.E.2d 63, 65, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cWhen construing undefined words in an insurance policy, a court must give the words used in the contract their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 531, 575 N.E.2d 459, 461. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.Rev.1979) defines \u2018resident\u2019 as \u2018a dweller, habitant or occupant; one who resides or dwells in a place for a period of more, or less, duration.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201c[T]he word \u2018resident\u2019 as used in the phrase \u2018resident of your household\u2019 refers to one who lives in the home of the named insured for a period of some duration or regularity, although not necessarily there permanently, but excludes a temporary or transient visitor.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. v. Taylor </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 68, 70, 528 N.E.2d 968, 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u201c \u2018[T]he word \u201cresiding\u201d is an ambiguous, elastic, or relative term, and includes a very temporary, as well as a permanent abode[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. McKain </em>(E.D.Pa.1993), 820 F.Supp. 890, 894-895. Another court has opined:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u201c[T]he words \u2018resident,\u2019 \u2018residence\u2019 and \u2018residing\u2019 have no precise, technical and fixed meaning applicable to all cases. \u2018Residence\u2019 has many shades of meaning, from mere temporary presence to the most permanent abode. It is difficult to give an exact or even satisfactory definition of the term \u2018resident,\u2019 as the term is flexible, elastic, slippery and somewhat ambiguous. * * * Definitions of \u2018residence\u2019 include \u2018a place of abode for more than a temporary period of time\u2019 and \u2018a permanent and established home\u2019 and the definitions range between these two extremes. This being the case, our courts have held that such terms should be given the broadest construction and that all who may be included, by any reasonable construction of such terms, within the coverage of an insurance policy using such terms, should be given its protection.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(N.C.App.1986), 78 N.C.App. 653, 656, 338 S.E.2d 145,147.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The court in <em>DeMatteis v. Am. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 459, 462, 616 N.E.2d 1208,1210, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cIt is well settled that, \u2018where the meaning of language used in a contract of insurance is doubtful, uncertain or ambiguous, the language will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u2019 <em>Blohm v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 63, 66, 529 N.E.2d 433, 436. This is particularly true with exemptions and exclusions which are not expressed plainly and without ambiguity. <em>New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Johnson </em>(1914), 91 Ohio St. 155, 157-158, 110 N.E. 475, 475-476. It is, therefore, presumed that \u2018that which is not clearly excluded from the contract is included.\u2019 <em>Home Indemn.

McConnell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(Ala.1990), 562 So.2d 201, 204; <em>Wood v. Mut. Serv. Cas. Ins.

Co. </em>(Jan. 31, 1986), Erie App. No. E-85-3, unreported, 1986 WL 1306, the court analyzed whether a homeowner\u2019s policy that provided coverage for \u201cRelatives living in your household\u201d afforded such coverage for the insured\u2019s son who had enlisted in the military, but regularly returned home on furloughs. The court stated that the enlisted man was required to \u201cestablish that, although distanced from [his hometown] by reason of active military service, he was, nonetheless, in contemplation of law, living in the household of his parents, the insureds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The <em>Malone </em>court \u201c[recognized] that the term \u2018living in your household\u2019 connotes a much narrower concept than * * * jurisdictional questions incident to residency or domicile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court then took note of several relevant factors, including (1) Malone regularly returned to his parents\u2019 home on furloughs; (2) his Army personnel files listed his parents\u2019 address as his permanent address; (3) Malone\u2019s personal possessions were kept at his parents\u2019 home; and (4) he maintained his savings account with the bank in his hometown. The court, giving particular weight to the fact that Malone had never established a separate residence and/or household, held that the young man was a permanent resident of his parents\u2019 household, reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u201cWe are dealing here with the classic case of a young boy, venturing upon the first moments of early manhood, leaving, for a period of time, the only home he has ever known \u2014 that is, with his parents but without securing a separate residence or maintaining a household of his own. John Malone clearly evidenced every intention to return to [his parents\u2019 home] when service to his country was over, as illustrated by intermittent occasions of furlough enjoyed in the home and company of his parents. We cannot say that the concept of household incumbents [at Malone\u2019s parents\u2019 address], as calculated in numbers, had been diminished by a unit of one upon young Malone\u2019s entry into the Army. Life in the barracks is not household living. Home to John L. Malone, and as viewed by this court in contemplation of law, was with his parents in Sandusky, Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Koby\u2019s answers to appellant\u2019s interrogatories, and the additional evidential materials, demonstrate that at the time of the incident (1) Koby\u2019s personal effects were kept at his own, off-base apartment, (2) his checking account was based in Texas, (3) his vehicle was licensed and registered in Texas, (4) he held an Ohio driver\u2019s license, (5) his credit card was issued from a Texas bank, (6) Koby\u2019s brokerage account was located with a brokerage firm in Texas, (7) Koby voted infrequently in Ohio, but nevertheless cast two votes in this state in 1984 and 1992, (8) he filed his federal income tax return using his parents\u2019 address, (9) Koby averred in his affidavit that his permanent residence was his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>parents\u2019 address in Warren, Ohio, (10) official correspondence from the Army listed 9660 Howland-Springs Road, Warren, Ohio as Koby\u2019s permanent residence address, (11) Koby entered the Army in October 1987, and since that time has been stationed in Alabama, Wiesbaden, Germany, Columbus, Georgia, and Kil-leen, Texas, and (12) Koby stated that he planned to make the military his career and intended to remain in the military until eligible for retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In our opinion, the instant case is factually distinguishable from <em>Malone. </em>Under the totality of the circumstances, it appears that Koby has established a separate residence in Texas. By virtue of his full-time military assignment, it appears that Koby spends a considerable amount of time away from his parents\u2019 residence, their home being the location to which he returns to enjoy visits.. Second, Koby is thirty-two years old and, ostensibly, separated from the parental \u201cnest\u201d some time ago. Third, it appears that Koby is self-supporting and is not dependent upon his parents for support. Finally, Koby\u2019s stated intent, at the time of the hearing, was to maintain his residence in Texas for the immediately foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">However, it also noteworthy that Koby\u2019s express intention is to return to Howland Township, Ohio, following the end of his term of enlistment. Another salient factor is that Koby was not married at the time of the accident. In our view, Koby\u2019s single status strengthens his ties to his parents\u2019 household. Furthermore, a subsequent marriage would not obviate the importance of Koby\u2019s single status with respect to his residential status as of the date of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In <em>Taylor, </em>the court noted that pursuant to a policy provision such as the one at issue here, \u201cthere [was] no requirement * * * that, in order for a person to be a resident of the named insured\u2019s household, such residence must be the <em>sole or exclusive </em>residence of the person[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>39 Ohio App.3d at 70, 528 N.E.2d at 970. It has been held that \u201c[r]esidence is a privilege, unlike domicile, and one can have several residences if he chooses. See, generally, 17 Am.Jur. 201, Domicile Sec. 9 (1957).\u201d <em>Detroit Auto. Inter-Insurance Exchange v. Feys </em>(N.D.Cal.1962), 205 F.Supp. 42, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The application of dual residency most often involves minor children of divorced parents seeking coverage under a parent\u2019s policy. See <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 671 N.E.2d 317; <em>Fay v. Motorists Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 63, 608 N.E.2d 836.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>is admittedly distinguishable from the instant appeal because (1) the person seeking coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>there was a minor, and (2) she regularly spent substantial amounts of time in both of her parents\u2019 homes, two hundred days in her mother\u2019s home, and between one hundred sixty-two and one hundred seventy-two days at her father\u2019s house, pursuant to a visitation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Notwithstanding those distinctions, in our considered opinion the facts of the instant case, involving an emancipated adult who spends time in two households, also lend themselves to the application of the dual residency rule. Initially, we observe that adults occasionally maintain multiple residences, <em>e.g., </em>\u201csnow belt\u201d residents who also maintain residences in the \u201csun belt,\u201d or entertainers who maintain homes in New York and Los Angeles. Thus, it is reasonable that an emancipated serviceman could maintain two or more residences, while having only one legal domicile. Discussing the dual residency rule as applied to emancipated children, the <em>Guillermin </em>court, reviewing <em>Ziegler v. Workman </em>(Mar. 30, 1994), Muskingum App. No. 93-28, unreported, 1994 WL 140755, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u201cIn <em>Ziegler, </em>the court affirmed summary judgment which found that the emancipated son of the insured was covered by the insured\u2019s automobile insurance policy. The court held that the son established dual residency when he testified that he resided in his parents\u2019 household twenty-five percent of the time, and at his girlfriend\u2019s residence seventy-five percent of the time. The son also received his mail at his parents\u2019 home. The court reasoned that the emancipated status of the son was \u2018a distinction without a difference\u2019 because the son was a relative of the insured and the policy language did not \u2018restrict coverage to exclusive residents (of the insured\u2019s household), or * * * allow dual residency only concerning minors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guillermin, </em>108 Ohio App.3d at 555, 671 N.E.2d at 322, quoting <em>Ziegler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The temporal duration of a career serviceman\u2019s various military assignments is a factor that warrants special consideration. Koby, due to his ongoing military obligation, would not have the opportunity to apportion his time on a quantitative/percentage basis comparable to a minor child who spends a substantial amount of time with each parent. However, that does not negate the fact that he <em>regularly </em>spent a <em>sufficient </em>amount of time at the parental abode to justify the classification of Koby\u2019s parents\u2019 household, and his current military address, as constituting two parts of his dual residency equation. This is particularly true when Koby\u2019s periodic visits to Ohio are viewed in conjunction with Koby\u2019s other connections to his parents\u2019 household, <em>i.e., </em>usage of their address as Koby\u2019s permanent residence address, the Ohio driver\u2019s license, the sporadic Ohio voting record, and the filing of income tax returns using the Ohio address, further demonstrating the sufficiency of Koby\u2019s ties to the Howland-Springs Road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>address.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">It is also important to recognize that appellant could have more precisely defined the term \u201cresident,\u201d but failed to do so. In our opinion, if a term is properly defined in the contract, the contract would control most factual situations. In our view, it is not a matter of whether the concept comes within the facts, but instead it turns on whether the facts come within the concept. In summary, having analyzed the pertinent case authorities, and construing the term \u201cresident\u201d liberally and in favor of the insured, we hold that Koby qualifies as a resident of his parents\u2019 household.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Finally, we believe that the cases cited by appellees in support of their position are inapposite because they pertain to the broader concept of domicile and residence for jurisdictional purposes. In fact, the court in <em>Hager v. Hager </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 239, 607 N.E.2d 63, stated that \u201c[t]he word \u2018residence\u2019 in R.C. 3105.13 means \u2018domiciliary residence,\u2019 \u201d a two-part concept that includes \u201c(1) an actual residence in the jurisdiction, and (2) an intention to make the state of jurisdiction a permanent home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 607 N.E.2d at 66.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In <em>Hager, </em>the court reasoned that where the evidence- indicated that for six months prior to the filing of Joseph Hager\u2019s complaint for divorce, the serviceman had lived in Ohio, intended to remain in Ohio, and had no intention to go anywhere else, the soldier had demonstrated that his \u201cdomiciliary residence\u201d was in Ohio. In the instant case, Koby\u2019s present circumstances do not satisfy the domiciliary residence test, although Koby does currently maintain a residence in Howland Township, Ohio.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Based on the evidential material which was presented, we determine that the trial court\u2019s resolution of the pertinent issues was proper, and there is no sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>that the trial court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment for appellees. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is without merit. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-5\">Christley and Nader, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-17\">.

Our reading of <em>Drazen </em>indicates that the court was referring to <em>domicile, </em>and not residence. We further note that unlike this case, in which we are confronted with the meaning of the terms \"resident of your household\u201d' in the insurance context, the <em>Drazen </em>decision was rendered in the context of a jurisdictional challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
