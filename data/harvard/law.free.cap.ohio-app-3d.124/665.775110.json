Stringfield, appeals the judgment of the Medina County Municipal Court finding him guilty of domestic violence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">On approximately November 29,1996, Amy Collins and her daughter, Brittany, were visiting Brittany\u2019s father, Stringfield. It is undisputed that Collins and Stringfield are the natural parents of Brittany. During this visit, Stringfield struck Collins on the face and head with his fist. He was found guilty of domestic violence for this incident. On appeal, he claims that the lower court erred because Collins was not a \u201cfamily or household member,\u201d as required by the domestic violence statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">R.C. 2919.25(A) provides, \u201cNo person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\u201d R.C. 2919.25(E)(1)(b) defines \u201c[fjamily or household member\u201d as including \u201c[t]he natural parent of any child of whom the offender is the other natural parent.\u201d As indicated, neither party disputes that Stringfield and Collins are the natural parents of Brittany. Therefore, the municipal court committed no error in convicting Stringfield of this offense. His sole assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b698-15\">Baird and Reece, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
