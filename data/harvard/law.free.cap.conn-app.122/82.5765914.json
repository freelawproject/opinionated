Cervero, appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) denying her request that her employer pay for two level disc surgery for her compensable injury. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the board improperly sustained the commissioner\u2019s finding that her surgery was not medically reasonable or necessary pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-294d. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The following factual and procedural history is necessary for our discussion. The plaintiff was injured on June 6, 2002, while employed by the defendant Mory\u2019s Association, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a \u201c \u2018waitress-bartender.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff injured her lower back while \u201c \u2018carrying heavy trays from the basement ... to the first floor\u2019 \u201d of the defendant\u2019s New Haven restaurant. A voluntary agreement, under which the defendant accepted that the injury was compensable, was approved by Commissioner George A. Waldron on October 2, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Following her injury in 2002, the plaintiff went to her primary care physician, who referred her to Michael Connair, an orthopedic surgeon. Connair prescribed conservative treatment, including \u201c \u2018lamp therapy,\u2019 \u201d a \u201c \u2018Medrol dose pack,\u2019 \u201d prescription medications and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>physical therapy. On June 18, 2002, Connair diagnosed the plaintiff with \u201c \u2018multi-level degenerative dis[c] disease with spur formation at L4-5, L2-3 and Ll-2 and T12-L1.\u2019 \u201d On September 24, 2002, after a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, Connair determined that the plaintiffs condition was \u201c \u2018not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention at this time.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">In October, 2002, Connair referred the plaintiff to Josef K. Wang, a physician, for a pain management evaluation. Wang suggested \u201c \u2018lumbar epidural steroid injections to control [the plaintiffs] pain\u2019 \u201d and administered two such injections. The defendant asked the plaintiff to be evaluated by its expert witness, John J. Shine, an orthopedic surgeon, on November 14, 2002. Shine\u2019s review of the July, 2002, MRI reports indicated that the plaintiff had \u201c \u2018severe dis[c] degeneration at L4-5 with some slight narrowing of the foramen on the left side but no canal stenosis.\u2019 \u201d The report further showed \u201c \u2018minimal disc bulging atL5-Sl.\u2019 \u201d Shine recommended pool therapy and \u201c \u2018use of a lumbar support brace.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In May, 2003, the plaintiff sought a second opinion from another orthopedic surgeon, Kenneth M. Kramer. The plaintiff testified that Kramer provided \u201c \u2018traction therapy\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018facet\u2019 injections.\u201d Kramer agreed with Connair that the plaintiff had a light duty work capacity and should be treated conservatively. He suggested a follow-up MRI scan to ascertain if the plaintiff would be an appropriate candidate for a \u201c \u2018lumbar decompression at L4-5.\u2019 \u201d In August, 2003, Kramer determined that the plaintiff was not \u201c \u2018surgical under the circumstances\u2019 \u201d and recommended that she return to physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In January, 2004, the defendant had the plaintiff examined by another expert witness, Robert N. Mar-golis, an orthopedic surgeon. Margolis diagnosed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>plaintiff with \u201c \u2018[l]umbar strain syndrome\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018[m]arked degenerative motion segment disease at L4-5.\u2019 \u201d Margolis noted that \u201c \u2018virtually no form of treatment helps her.\u2019 \u201d Margolis concurred with Kramer and Con-nair that the plaintiff had a light duty work capacity. He determined that she had reached maximum medical improvement and assigned a 12 percent permanent impairment to her lumbar spine. Margolis further concluded that \u201c \u2018[t]here [was] absolutely no question in [his] mind that she is not a surgical candidate for any type of procedure.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In February, 2004, Kramer opined that the plaintiffs condition had \u201c \u2018partly improved.\u2019 \u201d He determined that no additional formal treatment measures were \u201c \u2018indicated or anticipated\u2019 \u201d and determined that the plaintiff had reached maximum medical improvement with an 8 percent permanent partial impairment rating and a permanent sedentary work restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Nonetheless, because her \u201c \u2018back pain was getting worse,\u2019 \u201d the plaintiff began treatment with Steven P. Novella, a neurologist. The plaintiff paid for Novella\u2019s treatment through her private insurance. The plaintiff testified that Novella placed her on \u201c \u2018a lot of medications\u2019 \u201d and put her back on \u201c \u2018traction therapy.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff returned to work in September, 2004, at Seaside Mattress, where she worked up to four hours a day handling telephone duties. She continued to work there until June or July, 2005, when she left because she could not commit to working every day and had to leave work sporadically due to her back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The plaintiff thereafter met with John G. Strugar, a neurosurgeon, for consultation and advice. Strugar opined that he \u201c \u2018[could not] clearly recommend surgery for this patient at this point.\u2019 \u201d He suggested that \u201c \u2018there is an indication here for dis[c] replacement at the L4-5, even at L2-3. However, that would be quite difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to do at that level.\u2019 \u201d He recommended a more conservative course of treatment, including an.aqua therapy program. He further suggested that the plaintiff should consult James J. Yue, a neurosurgeon, regarding disc replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Yue examined the plaintiff on October 17, 2005. He evaluated her MRI scans from April, 2005, and diagnosed \u201c \u2018L4-L5 discogenic changes with a central dis[c] bulge, some mild L5-S1 discogenic changes and a normal appearing L4-L5 level.\u2019 \u201d He recommended a disco-gram that revealed \u201c \u2018[m]ultilevel degenerative dis[c] and facet degenerative changes\u2019 \u201d and a \u201c \u2018small end-plate cyst on the superior aspect of L5.\u2019 \u201d Yue directed the plaintiff to return to Wang for additional pain management treatment. The plaintiff testified that Wang has had her take Percocet for two years as of the date of the formal hearing. Yue recommended surgery for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On February 2, 2006, Yue stated that \u201c \u2018[t]he patient desires to proceed with surgical correction of her issues.\u2019 \u201d He recommended a \u201c \u2018L4-L5 and L5-S1 dis[c] replacement\u2019 \u201d but also suggested that a cyst might make replacement of L4-5 impossible. On February 15, 2007, Yue opined that a \u201c \u2018two level lumbar dis[c] replacement would give [the plaintiff] the ability to perform clerical and light-to-moderate duty work in the future.\u2019 \u201d At his deposition, Yue outlined his rationale for performing disc replacement surgery, stating that \u201c \u2018if we can remove that pain generator, there\u2019s a chance we may alleviate some of her pain. She\u2019ll never have a pain free back; it\u2019s not something that I . . . think she will ever achieve because of her other levels of degeneration above, but . . . [if] . . . the replacement functions properly . . . she can expect about 70 to 75 percent relief of her pain . . . .\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Yue also testified that although the plaintiffs bone density and her cyst might make a fusion the only feasible intervention, he preferred disc replacement. He cited three reasons, including that it tended to \u201c \u2018protect the other levels above or below it from future degeneration at least on a rapid scale.\u2019 \u201d He testified that he had performed between \u201c \u2018500 or 600\u2019 \u201d disc replacement surgeries and that although there are significant differences of opinion in the medical community on the effectiveness of disc replacements, he believed that they were statistically superior to fusions. He also testified that although a successful fusion surgery would produce the same chance of relief of symptoms as a disc replacement, a disc replacement would expedite the plaintiffs return to work, which would be delayed six months with a fusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">It was the plaintiffs position that her condition was getting worse, that her pain was an impediment to her performing daily activities and that she was interested in having the disc replacement surgery. She testified that she could not sit without pain and that she could stand only for fifteen or twenty minutes without pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Following an informal hearing, Commissioner Rhoda Loeb directed that the plaintiff should be examined by a commissioner\u2019s examiner. William H. Druckemiller, a neurosurgeon, conducted that examination on November 8, 2006. Druckemiller diagnosed the plaintiff with \u201c \u2018significant degenerative changes at the L4-5 level with a traction spur anteriorly and a suggestion of an early degenerative spondylolisthesis\u2019 \u201d as well as \u201c \u2018moderate degenerative changes at L2-3.\u2019 \u201d Drucke-miller did not agree with Yue\u2019s recommendation that the plaintiff should undergo disc replacement surgery. On December 22, 2006, he stated that \u201c \u2018[the plaintiff] is unlikely to get a good, long term result from surgery and that should be avoided at this point in time.\u2019 \u201d On December 12, 2007, he stated, after examining bone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>scan and MRI scan results, that \u201c \u2018[t]hese reports if anything confirm my previous opinion that surgery is not a good option for this patient.\u2019 \u201d He explained his reasoning by stating that \u201c \u2018the patient [was] not a good surgical candidate and [that he] personally would not perform that surgery . . . [because] she has significant, multiple level disease other than the areas noted to be positive on the [MRI] scan and the previous disco-gram.\u2019 \u201d According to Druckemiller, \u201c \u2018[i]f [the plaintiff] has a two level fusion, she is highly likely to have significant pain early on from an adjacent level syndrome at L3-4 and L2 is already known to be positive on a bone scan.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">At a deposition on April 25, 2007, Druckemiller testified that although single level disc replacement generally has an 80 percent rate of success in improving the patient\u2019s symptoms and that two level disc replacement has a 70 percent rate of success, he did not think surgery would provide the plaintiff with a dramatic difference in the level of pain she was experiencing. Because Druckemiller did not think that the surgery would benefit the plaintiff significantly, he instead suggested that she might benefit from \u201c \u2018a good back strengthening exercise program.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">On the basis of this evidence, the commissioner concluded that the plaintiff was credible and that she was suffering a compensable injury\u2014multilevel degenerative disc disease. He found that Yue had proposed performing either a multilevel or single level disc replacement for the plaintiff, and that Yue had opined that this procedure provided the plaintiff with the best opportunity to return to the workforce. The commissioner also noted that two of the plaintiffs physicians, Connair and Kramer, recommended conservative treatment, as did the defendant\u2019s experts. In reviewing the testimony of Druckemiller, the commissioner concluded that it was Druckemiller\u2019s opinion that disc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>replacement surgery would not be reasonable or necessary medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The commissioner found Drackemiller to be \u201c \u2018fully credible and persuasive,\u2019 \u201d and did not find Yue \u201c \u2018fully credible and persuasive.\u2019 \u201d Thus, he concurred with Drackemiller\u2019s view that disc replacement surgery would not yield a long-term benefit to the plaintiff and that it would result in medical problems to adjoining discs. The commissioner found that, at that time, neither two level nor single level disc replacement was \u201c \u2018reasonable and necessary medical treatment,\u2019 \u201d but suggested that if the plaintiffs condition continued to deteriorate, another commissioner and a different physician should reevaluate the merits of surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Thereafter, the board affirmed the finding of the commissioner. The board\u2019s opinion stated that it was apparent that Drackemiller and Yue utilized different standards for evaluating the efficacy of the proposed surgery and deferred to the commissioner\u2019s decision to give greater weight to the opinion of the commissioner\u2019s examiner, Drackemiller. The board asserted that although a commissioner may choose to approve treatments that have a relatively low percentage of success, that does not establish that, once a minimum threshold is met, the commissioner is obligated to approve surgery. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the board improperly sustained the commissioner\u2019s finding that her two level disc surgery was not medically reasonable or necessary. The plaintiff also argues that the commissioner failed to apply the proper standard of law to the facts of her case and improperly denied payment of her surgery. We disagree and affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. \u201cThe conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . Neither the . . . board nor this court has the power to retry facts. It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Scherwitzky Gutter Co., </em>279 Conn. 265, 272, 901 A.2d 1176 (2006). \u201cThe commissioner has the power and duty, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gartrell </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>259 Conn. 29, 36, 787 A.2d 541 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">It is the exclusive function of the finder of fact to reject or to accept evidence and to believe or to disbelieve any expert testimony. The trier may accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony of an expert witness. <em>Tartaglino </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>55 Conn. App. 190, 195, 737 A.2d 993, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 929, 742 A.2d 364 (1999). \u201cBecause we are required to afford great deference to the commissioner\u2019s conclusion . . . we must interpret [the commissioner\u2019s finding] with the goal of sustaining that conclusion in light of all of the other supporting evidence. . . . As we have made abundantly clear in the past, it would be improper for the board to disregard the commissioner\u2019s findings and substitute its preference regarding testimony.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Section 31-294d (a) (1) provides: \u201cThe employer, as soon as the employer has knowledge of an injury, shall provide a competent physician or surgeon to attend the injured employee and, in addition, shall furnish any medical and surgical aid or hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and nursing service, including medical rehabilitation services and prescription drugs, as the physician or surgeon deems <em>reasonable or necessary. </em>The employer, any insurer acting on behalf of the employer, or any other entity acting on behalf of the employer or insurer shall be responsible for paying the cost of such prescription drugs directly to the provider.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Essentially, the plaintiff claims that Yue\u2019s recommendation was sufficient to require a finding that the plaintiffs surgery was medically reasonable or necessary. Nonetheless, the plaintiff fails to acknowledge that the record contains the opinions of numerous physicians who had determined that she was not a good candidate for surgery. Wang suggested lumbar epidural steroid injections. Shine recommended pool therapy and a lumbar support brace. Connair prescribed conservative treatment and determined that the plaintiffs condition was \u201c \u2018not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiff sought a second opinion from another orthopedist, Kramer, who agreed with Con-nair\u2019s assessment that the plaintiffs condition should be treated conservatively and that she was not a surgical candidate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The plaintiff visited another orthopedic surgeon, Mar-golis, who noted that \u201c \u2018virtually no form of treatment helps her\u2019 \u201d and concluded that \u201c \u2018there is absolutely no question in [his] mind that she is not a surgical candidate for any type of procedure.\u2019 \u201d Novella put her back on medication and traction therapy. The plaintiff was then examined by Strugar, who stated that he \u201c \u2018[could not] clearly recommend surgery for this patient at this point,\u2019 \u201d and indicated that the plaintiffs requested surgery would be quite difficult. It was not until the plaintiff visited Yue, in 2005, that she found a physician who recommended surgery. After Yue\u2019s recommendation, the commissioner directed that the plaintiff be examined by the commissioner\u2019s examiner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Druckemiller, who agreed with the previously expressed and consistent opinion of the other physicians that the plaintiff was not a good candidate for surgery. Druckemiller testified that he did not think surgery was going to work and that the plaintiff might benefit from \u201c \u2018a good back strengthening exercise program.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The plaintiff cites <em>Cirrito </em>v. <em>Resource Group Ltd. of Connecticut, </em>No. 4248 CRB-1-00-6 (June 19, 2001), as establishing that if a treatment might help a claimant or is \u201c \u2018worthy of attempt,\u2019 \u201d then the commissioner is obligated to find that the treatment is medically reasonable or necessary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that the commissioner improperly failed to apply this standard in finding the testimony of Druckemiller to be credible and persuasive. On appeal, the board agreed with the commissioner\u2019s interpretation, finding that <em>Cirrito </em>stands for the proposition that although the commissioner has discretion to approve a treatment with a low chance of success, he is not required to approve it simply because a claimant has found a physician who suggests that the particular treatment would be \u201c \u2018worthy of attempt.\u2019 \u201d The board\u2019s written opinion provides a careful and precise analysis of the <em>Cirrito </em>decision. \u201cWhether a proposed course of treatment is reasonable or necessary is a factual issue to be decided by the trier based on the medical opinions in the record.\u201d <em>Irizarry </em>v. <em>Purolator Courier Corp., </em>No. 4382 CRB-4-01-4 (May 2, 2002). The plaintiff frames the issue by contending that the commissioner improperly adopted Druckemiller\u2019s personal standard of \u201c \u2018reasonable or necessary.\u2019 \u201d We do not share this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u201c[T]he power and duty to determine the facts rests on the commissioner, who is the trier of fact. . . . This authority to find the facts entitles the commissioner to determine the weight of the evidence presented and the credibility of the testimony offered by lay and expert witnesses. . . . Where the subordinate facts allow for diverse inferences, the commissioner\u2019s selection of the inference to be drawn must stand unless it is based on an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . Once the commissioner makes a factual finding, [we are] bound by that finding if there is evidence in the record to support it. . . . Our Supreme Court consistently has held that [n] o reviewing court can ... set aside [an inference of the commissioner] because the opposite [inference] is thought to be more reasonable; nor can the opposite inference be substituted by the court because of a belief that the one chosen by the [commissioner] is factually questionable. . . . <em>This standard clearly applies to conflicting expert medical testimony. It </em>[is] <em>the province of the commissioner to accept the evidence which impresses] him as being most credible and more </em>weighty.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Anderson v. R &amp; K Spero Co., </em>107 Conn. App. 608, 616-17, 946 A.2d 273 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The board properly concluded that the commissioner\u2019s finding that surgery was not warranted was supported by sufficient evidence in the record. The commissioner based his decision on Druckemiller\u2019s determination, and he was able to draw from the opinions of Connair, Wang, Shine, Kramer, Margolis and Strugar. Restricted by our deferential standard of review, we conclude that the facts are consistent with the commissioner\u2019s finding and that the board properly sustained the commissioner\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\"> Travelers Properly &amp; Casualty Company also was named as a defendant. For convenience, we refer in this opinion to Mory\u2019s Association, Inc., as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\"> The plaintiff attempts to define the \u201creasonable or necessary\u201d threshold through the board\u2019s case law and law from other jurisdictions. In according great weight to the commissioner\u2019s and the board\u2019s construction of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, we find that the commissioner\u2019s factual findings, based on the record, are consistent with the language of \u00a7 31-294d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
