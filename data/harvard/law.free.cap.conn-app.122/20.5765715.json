In September, 2005, John Spalding, owner of ABC Moving, was hired by Decorator\u2019s Warehouse in Nor-walk to deliver a couch and love seat to the defendant at 557 Atlantic Street in Bridgeport. When Spalding made the delivery he met the defendant for the first time. The defendant introduced himself as a \u201ccaretaker for a doctor\u201d who orders \u201ca lot of stuff.\u201d The defendant inquired of Spalding as to whether he would like to start picking up deliveries for \u201cus.\u201d The defendant explained that \u201cwe\u2019re doing construction and because at the time we\u2019d like to do some business with you because our current delivery service isn\u2019t working out.\u201d The defendant told Spalding that he worked for \u201cDr. Rosenblatt\u201d and at another time for \u201cMr. Murray.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Spalding gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the defendant his business card. The defendant agreed to pay Spalding $100 for each delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On September 16, 2005, Betsy Nosara Conway, assistant manager of the Coach store in Westport, received a telephone call from a man who identified himself as Larry Rosenblatt. Rosenblatt wanted to place an order for merchandise he had seen in a catalogue. He ordered a number of items totaling $2534.76<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and charged them to an American Express account belonging to Elizabeth Pocsik, who did not make the purchase or authorize anyone else to do so. Rosenblatt told Conway that he would have a man by the name of John Spalding come to get the items. Rosenblatt represented that Spalding was a courier who often picked up things for Rosenblatt.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In the meantime, the defendant had called Spalding and asked him to make a pickup at Coach in Westport. The defendant informed Spalding that Rosenblatt was throwing a party and did not have time to buy his wife a gift, so he sent Spalding to pick it up. When Spalding arrived at Coach, some of the associates helped him put the bags of merchandise in his truck. Spalding met the defendant in the parking lot of a Waldbaum\u2019s supermarket at the comer of North and Park Avenues in Bridgeport where the defendant took possession of the merchandise and paid Spalding $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On September 17, 2005, Conway took another telephone call from the man who again identified himself as Rosenblatt. According to Rosenblatt, his family enjoyed the gifts, and he wanted to purchase more merchandise. These items totaled $2700.88, and Rosenblatt gave Conway a credit card number but not the one he had used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the day before. On September 21, 2005, the same so-called Rosenblatt called Coach twice and placed two additional orders with Conway. His first purchase on that day totaled $2789.92 and was charged to an American Express account belonging to Catherine Saldinger and Pierre Saldinger. Neither one of the Saldingers had authorized the use of their account for the purchase. Minutes after making the first call, the caller, identifying himself as Rosenblatt, yet again called Coach and ordered a diamond watch worth $2117.88. To purchase the watch, Rosenblatt used an American Express account belonging to Ronald Schectman, who had not authorized the use of the account for the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">From September 16 through 21, 2005, the defendant placed four orders with Coach in Westport, charged $10,203.44 to credit card accounts belonging to other persons and asked Spalding each day to pick up the merchandise at Coach and deliver it to him at the Wald-baum\u2019s parking lot in Bridgeport. Each time Spalding delivered the merchandise from Coach, the defendant paid him the agreed upon fee of $100. Among the items purchased from Coach, in this fashion, was a water buffalo billfold wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">From September 16 through 22, 2005, the defendant asked Spalding to make six deliveries of merchandise from Lowe\u2019s in Newington to a garage below an apartment at 557 Atlantic Street in Bridgeport. The value of the merchandise delivered that week totaled $37,558.55.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant paid Spalding $400 for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Lowe\u2019s delivery, including one purchase valued at $278. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The defendant obtained the merchandise by using credit card accounts belonging to, among others, Bruce Angus, John Murray, Michael Morrissey, Estelle Nisson and Susan Seath.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> None of those persons made a purchase at Lowe\u2019s in Newington and did not authorize the defendant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Each time Spalding delivered the Lowe\u2019s merchandise to 557 Atlantic Street in Bridgeport, the defendant was waiting for him. The defendant again represented to Spalding that he was the caretaker for Rosenblatt, a contractor. According to Spalding, the defendant explained that \u201cthey were going to pick them up the next day because they didn\u2019t want them on the job site, you know, because they wanted to install them the next day. That\u2019s what he told me.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">On September 23, 2005, Donna Corra, manager of Coach in Westport, received a telephone call from a person complaining of an unauthorized charge on her credit card account. Corra subsequently notified the Westport police. Corra informed Conway of the call, as well. On September 26, 2006, Conway took a telephone call at Coach from someone identifying himself as attorney Gary Hertzberg, who placed a telephone order and used a credit card account number to make the purchase. When Conway processed the order, the credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>card information was declined. Conway telephoned the Westport police, who went to the Coach store. When Spalding arrived at the store,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the police explained to him that a stolen credit card was used to place the order. Coach employees gave Spalding empty shopping bags, and Detective John Rocke accompanied Spalding in his pickup truck to the Waidbaum\u2019s parking lot in Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Spalding and Rocke waited in the parking lot for the defendant to arrive. When the defendant drove up next to Spalding\u2019s truck, Spalding identified him to Rocke as the man who had hired him to deliver merchandise from Coach and Lowe\u2019s. Rocke got out of the truck carrying a shopping bag filled with empty Coach boxes. The defendant got out of the vehicle that he was driving and met Rocke. Rocke asked the defendant if the packages were his, and the defendant responded affirmatively. Rocke asked the defendant if he wanted the receipt, and the defendant said, \u201cyes.\u201d Rocke reached into the bag as if to retrieve the receipt but pulled out a weapon and arrested the defendant. There was a passenger in the defendant\u2019s vehicle, Francis Beethoven, and the defendant indicated to Rocke that Beethoven was not involved. When Rocke searched the defendant, he found a Coach water buffalo double billfold wallet similar to the one that the man who identified himself as Rosenblatt had purchased on September 17, 2005. The wallet contained $110 in currency<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and two credit cards in the name of Tamika Creer, who resided at 557 Atlantic Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, he was released on a $25,000 bond, but he failed to report for his scheduled court date on January 11, 2006. Subsequently, a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>was issued for his arrest. The defendant was taken into custody again on February 25, 2006. Additional facts will be set out where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The defendant first claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because the court failed to instruct the jury that it could aggregate the value of the property that was stolen only if it determined that the theft was part of one scheme or course of conduct. More specifically, the defendant argues that because no individual charge to a credit card account was valued at more than $10,000, the jury had to aggregate the individual purchases in order to have found him guilty of larceny in the first degree as to the theft of items from Coach and from Lowe\u2019s.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although we conclude that the court committed constitutional error in failing to instruct the jury that it could aggregate the value of the stolen property only if it found that the thefts were part of one scheme or course of conduct, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the state has demonstrated that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The defendant concedes that this claim was not preserved at trial and asks that we reverse his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201c[A]n improper instruction on an element of an offense ... is of constitutional dimension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>260 Conn. 466, 472-73, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002). Although the record is adequate for our review, the claim is of constitutional magnitude and the constitutional violation clearly exists, the defendant cannot prevail because the state has demonstrated that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, at trial, the defendant virtually conceded that there was one scheme or course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable standard of review, \u201c[individual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge. . . . The pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirely, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . Thus, [t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . . Accordingly, [i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. ... In other words, we must consider whether the instructions [in totality] are sufficiently correct in law, adapted to the issues and ample for the guidance of the jury. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u201c[I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. ... [A] jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evi</em>dence,, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em>116 Conn. App. 710, 715-16, 977 A.2d 257 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had devised a plan or scheme to defraud Coach and Lowe\u2019s. \u201c[W]hen the defendant got arrested, there was another guy in the car, Francis Beethoven. What does the defendant say? He\u2019s got nothing to do with this. Well, the defendant wasn\u2019t the scam artist? The defendant wasn\u2019t the guy setting this all up? How would he know there was something to be involved with? If he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, why would he tell the police that Francis Beethoven had nothing to do with this? He wouldn\u2019t. He told the police that because [the defendant] at that point, knew that he was caught.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u201cNow, the defendant wanting a receipt, you know, the defendant did a lot to cover his tracks, didn\u2019t he? He bought warranties on stuff, he bought small innocuous items; he used a third party to make the deliveries. He never had anything delivered to his own residence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>had it delivered to a parking lot in Bridgeport or to Tamika Creer\u2019s address. Everything the defendant did was to cover his tracks and avoid detection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Most important is the defendant\u2019s theory of defense. The defendant did not claim that each of the serial thefts from Coach and from Lowe\u2019s were not part of one scheme or course of conduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em>supra, 116 Conn. App. 716 (\u201cthe omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming </em>evidence\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]). The defendant argued that he was not the schemer. During defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, counsel stated in part: \u201cNobody likes to get taken advantage of. Nobody likes a scam artist. The values we have in our society [are] that you shouldn\u2019t take what doesn\u2019t belong to you. And in this case, you\u2019re going to hear evidence and you\u2019re going to hear that <em>a fraud occurred, </em>that <em>a fraud did take place, </em>that people were taken advantage of. I expect that you\u2019re going to hear that testimony. The issue is, however, the state has the burden of proving not just that a fraud occurred but that [the defendant] was responsible for it. And I submit to you that after all the evidence comes in, the state isn\u2019t going to be able to carry its burden, that the evidence is not going to show that [the defendant] is responsible <em>for this fraud.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Affirming the power of the evidence presented to the jury in this case is defense counsel\u2019s closing argument in which she conceded that there was a carefully designed plan or scheme to defraud Coach and Lowe\u2019s. Defense counsel argued in part: \u201cThe evidence shows in this case, in this case, somebody took great measures to avoid [detection]. Somebody else picked things up. Someone placed orders over phones that couldn\u2019t be traced using different names. It was so carefully planned; how clever is this; whoever is making the orders at Lowe\u2019s orders high ticket items and then items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>that are $1.98. And not even that, they order a long-term plan, a warranty, some of the items. Why do they do it? I submit to you to avoid [detection].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The concurring and dissenting opinion would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Desi-mone, </em>241 Conn. 439, 452-58, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997), concluding that there was not one scheme or course of conduct. The case before us, however, is factually and legally distinguishable. To begin with, the methods of the larcenies are different. The defendant in <em>Desi-mone </em>was charged with larceny in the first degree by means of receiving stolen property. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 and 53a-119 (8).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In <em>Desimone, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201cin determining the degree of the crime of larceny by receiving stolen property, the value of multiple items of allegedly stolen property may be aggregated only if the state has established that the defendant received the property pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 441. In that case, \u201c[b]etween January, 1993, and January, 1994, several items of property were reported missing from [Pfizer, Inc.], where the defendant was employed as a maintenance mechanic. These items included three Compaq laptop computers, one Dell desktop computer system, one Toro snowblower, three power tools and one utility cart. . . . [E]ach of these items had been in the defendant\u2019s possession after Pfizer had reported the loss of the property.\u201d Id., 443. The specific time that the stolen goods came into the defendant\u2019s possession was unknown. Pfizer, Inc., received delivery of the Compaq LTE laptop computers in December, 1993, or early 1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and reported them missing on approximately January 14, 1994. Id., 447 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Our Supreme Court agreed with the New York Court of Appeals that \u201cajury may aggregate the value of stolen property only if the successive takings be pursuant to a single intent and design and in execution of a common fraudulent scheme.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 457, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>286 N.Y. 137, 141, 36 N.E.2d 84 (1941). Our Supreme Court concluded that the state\u2019s contention that the defendant in <em>Desimone </em>had received the two Compaq LTE computers pursuant to a common scheme was not supported by the evidence. Id., 463-64. The \u201cdefendant did not offer the second Compaq LTE computer for sale until several days after the first. Moreover, the evidence did not establish exactly when the defendant received the two computers or whether he received or possessed them at the same time.\u201d Id., 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Under the facts of this case, however, time cannot be the distinguishing factor as to whether there was one scheme or course of conduct by which the defendant defrauded Coach and another scheme or course of conduct to defraud Lowe\u2019s. Although neither we nor the concurring and dissenting opinion have found a precise definition of \u201cone scheme or course of conduct,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 53a-121 (b), cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 439; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>84 Conn. App. 351, 392, 854 A.2d 13, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004); imply that the theoretical linchpin is the accused\u2019s intent. Intent is a question of fact for the jury to decide. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dickman, </em>119 Conn. App. 581, 588, 989 A.2d 613, cert. denied, 295 Conn. 923, 991 A.2d 569 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Here, the court charged the jury as to intent and the facts that may be found on the basis of inferences drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>from the defendant\u2019s conduct. See footnote 11 of this opinion. The theory of defense was that the defendant did not commit the crimes with which he was accused.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Significantly, with respect to the jury instruction, the defendant did not contest whether there was a common scheme to defraud Coach and a common scheme to defraud Lowe\u2019s. In her opening statement, defense counsel acknowledged several times that a fraud had occurred. During her final argument, defense counsel stated that \u201csomebody took great measures to avoid [detection]. Somebody else picked things up. Someone placed orders over phones that couldn\u2019t be traced using different names. <em>It was so carefully planned) </em>how clever is this . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) There was overwhelming evidence that within approximately one week\u2019s time, the defendant received more than $10,000 worth of goods both from Coach and from Lowe\u2019s according to an arrangement he made with Spalding.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201c[A]n alleged defect in a jury charge which raises a constitutional question is reversible [impropriety] if it is reasonably possible that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury was misled .... In other words, the test for determining whether a constitutional [impropriety] is harmless ... is whether it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the [impropriety] complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>293 Conn. 435, 463, 978 A.2d 1089 (2009). In this case, we conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the improper jury instruction, when considered as a whole with the defense and in conjunction with the evidence, did not mislead the jury and that the verdict was not the product of the constitutional impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Secondarily, from a public policy perspective, the theft of personal data, including misappropriation of credit card information is a serious problem in our society. Failure to recognize the defendant\u2019s actions as a scheme or course of conduct provides a road map for a savvy thief whose plan is to use, every other day, stolen credit card information to make purchases but is careful to limit the cost of each purchase to avoid the harsher penalties of a conviction of larceny in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court violated his constitutional right to represent himself. He also claims that the court erred when it failed to conduct an inquiry pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The defendant concedes that his claim is unpreserved and seeks to reverse his conviction pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We will review the defendant\u2019s claim because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant cannot prevail, however, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the constitutional violation did not clearly exist and he clearly was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. On April 24, 2007, immediately prior to the start of evidence, the defendant represented, through counsel, that he wanted to represent himself. The court noted the defendant\u2019s prior requests to represent himself and that at those times, the defendant was not able to complete the court\u2019s canvass. In denying the defendant\u2019s latest request to represent himself, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019ve lost count at this point of how many requests the defendant has had to fire his own attorney to represent himself. I\u2019ve lost count of the canvasses at this point. I do know that he has not been able to successfully get through the canvasses. He\u2019s had ample opportunity ... to hire his own attorney, if he wanted to. He never did that, so I do find that his request to represent himself is nothing but an attempt to hinder, delay or impede the start of the trial.\u201d The defendant has not challenged the court\u2019s recitation of the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u201cBoth the federal constitution and our state constitution afford a criminal defendant the right to [forgo] the assistance of counsel and to choose instead to represent himself or herself at trial. ... A defendant\u2019s right to represent himself or herself, after a clear and unequivocal request to do so, is not unlimited. ... In <em>Faretta </em>[v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975)], the United States Supreme Court identified three grounds for denying a defendant her right to self-representation: (1) [the defendant] makes the request in [an] untimely fashion such that granting it would disrupt the proceedings ... (2) the defendant engages in serious obstructionist misconduct . . . and (3) the defendant has not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cIn accordance with those limitations, our Supreme Court recently held [in <em>State </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>293 Conn. 406, 433, 978 A.2d 64 (2009)], that when a defendant clearly and unequivocally has invoked his right to self-representation <em>after the trial has begun, </em>the trial court must consider: (1) the defendant\u2019s reasons for the self-representation request; (2) the quality of the defendant\u2019s counsel; and (3) the defendant\u2019s prior proclivity to substitute counsel. If, after a thorough consideration of these factors, the trial court determines, in its discretion, that the balance weighs in favor of the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation, the court must then proceed to canvass the defendant in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 to ensure that the defendant\u2019s choice to proceed pro se has been made in a knowing and intelligent fashion. If, on the other hand, the court determines, on the basis of those criteria, that the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation, then the court should deny the defendant\u2019s request and need not engage in a [Practice Book] \u00a7 44-3 canvass.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bozelko, </em>119 Conn. App. 483, 501-502, 987 A.2d 1102, cert. denied, 295 Conn. 916, 990 A.2d 867 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In this case, trial had begun, as trial commences with voir dire. Id., 502 n.7. The court, therefore, was required to balance the factors established in <em>Flanagan </em>to determine whether the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress outweighed the defendant\u2019s interest in representing himself. We conclude that the court engaged in the proper analysis. The court found that the defendant failed to express a clear reason for his request. The court found that the defendant\u2019s real reason for making the request to represent himself merely was an attempt to hinder, to delay or to impede the progress of trial. Although the court did not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the second factor explicitly, the court noted that a number of attorneys had represented the defendant and that he never had suggested that any one of them was not competent. Defense counsel stated, at the time she voiced the defendant\u2019s request, that she thoroughly was prepared, had prepared cross-examinations and researched the rules of evidence. The court made no finding that counsel was not qualified, and the defendant did not ask the court to make such a finding. In light of those aggregate considerations, the second factor is met. The court directly addressed the third factor and found that the defendant had substituted counsel on numerous occasions. In denying the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself, the court noted that it had lost count of the number of requests the defendant had made to discharge his counsel and to represent himself. The court also noted that it had attempted to complete a canvass of the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3 numerous times and that the defendant had not been able at any time to get through the canvass successfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We conclude, therefore, on the basis of the <em>Flanagan </em>factors, that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that granting the defendant\u2019s request to represent himself had the potential to disrupt the proceedings, which outweighed the defendant\u2019s interest in self-representation. Consequently, there was no need for the court to conduct a canvass of the defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 44-3. Because the defendant has not demonstrated that a constitutional violation clearly exists, his claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial because the prosecutor had engaged in impropriety by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>intentionally charging the defendant with crimes that had been nolled in another prosecution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">More specifically, the defendant claims that he was entitled to a mistrial because certain charges of identity theft in the third degree involved the use of credit card accounts belonging to Christopher Miller<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and to Seath<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to make purchases at the Lowe\u2019s store in Newin-gton. The charges to Miller\u2019s and Seath\u2019s accounts actually were made for purchases at the Lowe\u2019s store in South Windsor. The charges against the defendant for allegedly fraudulent purchases made at Lowe\u2019s in South Windsor were nolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u201cThe standard for review of an action upon a motion for a mistrial is well established. While the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. . . . On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial [court] is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which [its] function is to assure a fair and just outcome. ... In [our] review of the denial of a motion for mistrial, [we recognize] the broad discretion that is vested in the trial court to decide whether an occurrence at trial so prejudiced a party that he or she can no longer receive a fair trial. The decision of the trial court is therefore reversible on appeal only if there has been an abuse of discretion. ... In general, abuse of discretion exists when a court could have chosen different alternatives but has decided the matter so arbitrarily as to vitiate logic, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>has decided it based on improper or irrelevant factors. . . . Therefore, [i]n those cases in which an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done, reversal is required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peloso, </em>109 Conn.

The burden of proving a constitutional violation as a result of prosecutorial [impropriety] rests with the defendant . . . and the defendant must demonstrate substantial prejudice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James G., </em>268 Conn. 382, 419, 844 A.2d 810 (2004). \u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>279 Conn. 414, 428, 902 A.2d 636 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is not clear from the record whether the identity theft charges involving the credit card accounts of Miller and Seath arose from purchases made at Lowe\u2019s in South Windsor, as the defendant contends. A prior long form information charged the defendant with, among other things, identity theft as to Miller and Seath for use of their credit card accounts at Lowe\u2019s in Newin-gton. Seath\u2019s credit card statement, which was admitted into evidence, shows that at least one transaction was made at Lowe\u2019s in Newington. Miller did not testify at trial, and the state nolled the identity theft charge as to him. The prosecutor stated on the record that he \u201cwas under the impression that [Miller] was one of the Newington victims . . . .\u201d Although the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>may have been mistaken, the court acted well within its discretion when it found implicitly that no intentional misconduct had occurred. Moreover, there is no evidence of prejudice to the defendant, as the state withdrew the identity theft charge as to Miller before the defendant filed his motion for a mistrial and before the jury returned its not guilty verdict as to all counts of identity theft. The defendant, therefore, has failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In this opinion LAVINE, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\"> The defendant was found not guilty of ten counts of identity theft in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-129d and one count of identity theft in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-129c (a).

There are five elements to this crime, and I\u2019ll now go through them ....</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u201cThe first element is false pretense. This means that the defendant made a false representation or statement of a past or existing fact. A representation may be false either expressly or by implication and may consist of any act or word calculated and intended to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u201cA false pretense is an intentional false statement concerning a material matter of fact in reliance on which the title or possession of property is parted with. A misrepresentation of fact made innocently or inadvertently cannot form the basis of a conviction. Moreover, a false pretense by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the property is obtained must relate to a past or existing fact or set of circumstances. A false pretense as to future acts or events will not support a conviction under the statute. A mere promise to do an act in the future is not a false pretense under the statute unless at the same time the person also makes material false representations as to existing or past facts.</p>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\">\u201cA false pretense may be made by implication as well as by words written or spoken. Under some circumstances, silence may constitute false pretenses. For instance, silence and acquiescing in another\u2019s statements knowing that those statements are false may constitute a false pretense if that silence implies an affirmation of such statements and if that affirmation is engaged in with the intent to defraud another and thus obtain property of another. The mere expression of an opinion does not make the person expressing it guilty under the statute, but if one knows an opinion to be wrong, the matter is, as to him, not an opinion but an existing fact. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"Az3\">\u201cThe second element is that, in making the representation, the defendant knew of its falsity. That is, that the defendant knew the statement was false at the time that he made it and that he made it with the intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"Atz\">\u201cThe third element is that the defendant intended to defraud the particular store\u2014the first, count would be Coach, and the second count would be Lowe\u2019s. This requires that I instruct you on the meaning of intent and how it may be proven.</p>\n<p id=\"AXa\">\u201cIntent relates to the condition of mind of the person who commits the act, his purpose in doing it. As defined by our statute, a person acts intentionally with respect to a result of the conduct when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\"><em>\u201cWhat aperson\u2019s intention has been is very largely a matter of inference. No witness can be expected to come here and testify that he looked into another person\u2019s mind and saw therein contained a certain intention. A jury can determine what a person\u2019s intention was at any given time by determining what that person\u2019s conduct was and what the circumstances were surrounding that conduct and from those things infer what his intention was. An intent may be inferred from circumstantial </em>evidence, <em>provided such inference is reasonable and isn\u2019t warranted by facts that you find proven.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A75\">\n<em>\u201cIntent to defraud may be difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt by direct evidence, but it may be inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct. You may, if you find it reasonable and logical, infer the [necessary] intent to defraudfrom the circumstances and from what was done by the accused.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgC\">\u201cThe fourth element is that the particular store was, in fact, induced by the defendant\u2019s intentionally false representation to act to their ipjuiy. This means that it must be proven that the particular store\u2014in the first count it would be Coach or in the second count it would be Lowe\u2019s\u2014believed the false statement and relied on it and acted on that reliance by giving the defendant the goods or merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"ALE\">\u201cThe fifth element is that the false representation or statement was the effective cause of the defendant receiving something of value without com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>pensation. The defendant must have obtained property of value exceeding $10,000. The word obtain here includes bring about the transfer of property [to] the defendant.

I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion in part I of its opinion and would reverse the judgment as to the defendant\u2019s conviction of two counts of larceny in the first degree by false pretenses in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and 53a-119 (2), and would remand the case for a new trial as to those counts only.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">With respect to part I of the majority opinion, I agree that the failure of the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of aggregation was reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). I also agree that the defendant has satisfied the third prong of <em>Golding </em>in that there was clear constitutional error.

Because the jury never considered, so far as we know, whether the transactions were committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, the instructional error can be harmless only if we \u201c[conclude] beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em>116 Conn.

In the circumstances of this case, however, I do not believe that the existence of one scheme or common plan is supported by such overwhelming evidence that the jury verdict necessarily would have been the same had the mandated instruction been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>When arguing in its brief that the error was harmless, the state noted the following. The credit card numbers used, for the most part, were taken from customers of Advantage Waste Services. Arena Johnson, an employee of Advantage Waste Services who had access to customers\u2019 credit card information, admitted knowing the defendant for fifteen years. All items were purchased using a telephone. When purchasing items from the Coach store in Westport, the defendant identified himself three times as Larry Rosenblatt. The merchandise from Coach and the Lowe\u2019s store in Newington was picked up and delivered by John Spalding, the owner of ABC Moving, who delivered the items to the defendant at a supermarket parking lot in Bridgeport or at a garage in Bridgeport underneath the defendant\u2019s apartment. The defendant paid Spalding $100 for the Coach deliveries and $400 for the Lowe\u2019s deliveries. Spalding identified the defendant as the person who took and paid for the delivery of the merchandise from Coach and Lowe\u2019s. The state further argued that the evidence established that the defendant was the mastermind behind the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">An analysis of case law suggests that the evidence in this case does not so overwhelmingly support the existence of one scheme or course of conduct that a failure to instruct on that issue is harmless. Our Supreme Court\u2019s leading case in this area of the law is <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>241 Conn. 439, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997). In that case, the defendant, a maintenance mechanic, was employed by Pfizer, Inc. Id., 443. He offered for sale several computers that had been taken from Pfizer, Inc. Id. The defendant was charged with larceny by receiving various items of stolen property in the first and third degrees. Id., 449. The value of the items was aggregated for the purpose of charging him with the particular degree of that offense. The trial court, overruling an objection by the defendant as to its jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>instructions, concluded that \u00a7 53a-121 (b) was not applicable to the offense of larceny by receiving stolen property. Id., 450. Thus, the court did not instruct the jury in accordance with that statutory subsection that it may aggregate the value of the allegedly stolen property only if the state has established that the defendant received the property pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, and the defendant challenged this omission on appeal. Id., 449-50. The Supreme Court disagreed with the state\u2019s contention on appeal that the items <em>necessarily </em>were received pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. Id., 463-64. The Supreme Court noted that the evidence revealed that several days interceded between the times that the defendant offered the computers for sale. Id., 464. It continued: \u201cMoreover, the evidence did not establish exactly when the defendant received the two computers or whether he received or possessed them at the same time. Thus, we cannot say that the evidence <em>necessarily compelled </em>the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s unlawful receipt of the two computers was part of a single scheme or course of conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In contrast, in <em>State </em>v. Browne, 84 Conn. App. 351, 367, 854 A.2d 13, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 931, 859 A.2d 930 (2004), this court held that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that it could aggregate the value of the items of stolen property only if it first concluded that the offenses were committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct did not require reversal. Id., 389-94. In that case, the defendant was not charged with committing a series of thefts, but, rather, he simultaneously stole and simultaneously attempted to steal two distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>sets of personalty belonging to the same family. Id., 393-94. Each aggregated charge alleged that the crime was committed at a discrete time and place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id., 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In this case, for the jury to find the defendant guilty of larceny in the first degree, it had to aggregate transactions that occurred at different times. There is no doubt that the values of the goods ordered in each telephone transaction should be aggregated, and the defendant does not assert otherwise. Additionally, the evidence of one scheme or coruse of conduct may well have been sufficient to support the aggregation of the value of goods ordered in different telephone calls and received in different transactions had the court properly instructed the jury regarding aggregation. The transactions, however, occurred on different days and were accomplished by different calls and different deliveries. Although there was evidence that Spalding was to be generally available and the methods of the crimes were quite similar, a jury reasonably could have failed to reach the conclusion that the transactions were but steps effecting a single scheme, had it been so instructed. For example, the jury may not have believed the entirety of Spalding\u2019s testimony; similarly, a reasonable doubt could have arisen from a hypothesis that the defendant\u2019s intent to commit a subsequent transaction was not fully formed until just prior to its commission. There may have been other hypotheses consistent with the evidence. Consistent with <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 439, the transactions were not <em>necessarily </em>part of one scheme or course of conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>1 therefore agree with the defendant that the state did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>prove that the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury in accordance with \u00a7 53a-121 (b) was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I believe that the defendant\u2019s claim satisfies the fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>because the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt, and the error may have resulted in the defendant\u2019s convictions of larceny in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-5\"> There does not appear to have been a formal concession that there was a common scheme; rather, the issue does not seem to have been addressed specifically. The majority aptly summarizes the positions of the parties at trial. Though the majority\u2019s arguments fully support the notion that the element was <em>not </em>contested, they do not amount to a waiver or formal concession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\"> The majority suggests that I would rely on <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>supra, 241 Conn. <em>439, for </em>the \u201cconclu[sion] that there was not one scheme or course of conduct.\u201d Neither the <em>Desimone </em>court nor I reach such a conclusion. To the contrary, there was sufficient evidence on which a properly instructed jury could have concluded that the transactions were undertaken pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 514-19, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995), the Supreme Court held that the values of checks attempted to be cashed within moments of each other could be aggregated under \u00a7 53a-121 (b) The court did not decide whether the values necessarily had to be aggregated. Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"> I have found no precise definition of the phrase \u201cone scheme or course of conduct.\u201d Cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 439; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995); and <em>State </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>supra, 84 Conn. App. 351; suggest by example that the theoretical linchpin is intent: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>if the accused intentionally sets out to engage in a more or less continuous course of conduct that contemplates a series of thefts, then the value of goods taken in the thefts may be aggregated for the purposes of determining the degree of the larceny. If, on the other hand, the accused decides to commit one larceny and later decides to commit another, the values of the goods taken may not be aggregated even if the methods of committing the crimes are very similar. In extreme situations, the failure to instruct the jury pursuant to \u00a7 53a~121 (b) may be harmless, but ordinarily the determination of intent is a factual question for the finder of fact. See generally 3 C. Torc\u00eda, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (15th Ed. 1995) \u00a7\u00a7 345 and 346, pp. 361-69.</p>\n<p id=\"ABX\">The scenario is further complicated by the axiom that a jury may believe some, all or none of any witness\u2019 testimony. Some of Spalding\u2019s testimony, for example, regarding the defendant\u2019s statements to him, may have been self-serving and to some degree disbelieved by the jury. <em>As </em>a reviewing court, we should not be left to speculate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b71-15\"> The majority suggests that a thief could take advantage of the reasoning of the concurring and dissenting opinion and avoid harsh punishment by serializing crimes. I would suggest that even such a well-read and erudite felon runs a great risk of being convicted of the greater degree of larceny by a properly instructed jury. The issue is not whether the evidence presented in this case is sufficient to convict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
