We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The record and the complaint reveal the following undisputed facts and procedural history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 3, 2005, Daniel Riley, while being held in custody, committed suicide by hanging himself at the Union Avenue detention center in New Haven. By letter dated July 29, 2005, the attorney for the estate of Riley filed a claim with the claims commissioner (commissioner), seeking permission to bring an action against the state for Riley\u2019s wrongful death. On November 29, 2006, the plaintiffs filed the present action in the Superior Court. By motion filed November 30, 2006, the state moved to dismiss the claim filed with the commissioner on the ground that the commissioner lacked subject matter jurisdiction over \u201cclaims upon which suit is otherwise authorized by law including suits to recover similar relief arising from the same set of facts.\u201d On January 23, 2007, the state filed a motion to dismiss count one of the complaint in the present action, claiming that the court lacked jurisdiction because sovereign immunity barred the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim against the state. By decision dated March 2, 2007, the commissioner dismissed the claim pending before him because \u201c [b] oth the claimant\u2019s civil rights lawsuit and the instant claim seek money damages and therefore satisfy the \u2018similar relief requirement of [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-142 (2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Before the court ruled on the state\u2019s motion to dismiss count one of the complaint, the plaintiffs filed a motion to stay the proceedings until the General Assembly ruled on the plaintiffs\u2019 request to overturn the decision of the commissioner. The court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion on March 14, 2007. On April 20, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a notice indicating that the stay should be terminated because \u201cthe Committee on Judiciary confirmed the decision of the Claims Commissioner ... .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By memorandum of decision filed April 29, 2009, the court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the state because the commissioner did not grant the plaintiffs permission to bring suit against the state. Accordingly, the court dismissed count one of the complaint. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [denial] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo. . . . [T]he doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of the common law that a state cannot be sued without its consent. . . . We have held that a plaintiff seeking to circumvent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>doctrine of sovereign immunity must show that . . . the legislature, either expressly or by force of a necessary implication, statutorily waived the state\u2019s sovereign immunity . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bacon Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Works, </em>294 Conn. 695, 706-707, 987 A.2d 348 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u201cIn the absence of a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, the plaintiff may not bring an action against the state for monetary damages without authorization from the claims commissioner to do so.\u201d <em>Columbia Air Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>293 Conn. 342, 351, 977 A.2d 636 (2009). General Statutes \u00a7 4-160 (a) provides: \u201cWhen the Claims Commissioner deems it just and equitable, the Claims Commissioner may authorize suit against the state on any claim which, in the opinion of the Claims Commissioner, presents an issue of law or fact under which the state, were it a private person, could be liable.\u201d \u201cWhen sovereign immunity has not been waived, the claims commissioner is authorized by statute to hear monetary claims against the state and determine whether the claimant has a cognizable claim. . . . This legislation expressly bars suits upon claims cognizable by the claims commissioner except as he may authorize, an indication of the legislative determination to preserve sovereign immunity as a defense to monetary claims against the state not sanctioned by the [claims] commissioner or other statutory provisions.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>265 Conn. 301, 317-18, 828 A.2d 549 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The plaintiffs argue that they may bring a direct action against the state in the Superior Court because \u00a7 4-142 (2) exempts their claim from the claims process. They maintain that they did not need permission to bring the present action against the state because the commissioner made a finding in his decision that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>already had filed an action <em>authorized by law </em>in the Superior Court, thereby exempting them from proceeding further with the commissioner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state argues that the plaintiffs made the election to file both a claim with the commissioner and a civil action in the Superior Court, that both matters were pending at the same time, that the negligence action against the state had been commenced without permission from the commissioner, that \u00a7 4-142 (2) precluded the plaintiffs\u2019 claim before the commissioner once the plaintiffs filed their civil rights and intentional infliction of emotional distress action in the Superior Court and that adoption of the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 4-142 (2) would undermine the doctrine of sovereign immunity. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Section 4-142 provides in relevant part: \u201cThere shall be a Claims Commissioner who shall hear and determine all claims against the state except ... (2) claims upon which suit otherwise is authorized by law including suits to recover similar relief arising from the same set of facts . . . .\u201d It is undisputed that the plaintiffs sought permission to bring suit against the state for money damages in the claim that it filed with the commissioner. It also is undisputed that the negligence count against the state in the present case is an action seeking money damages. The facts underlying the claim and the relevant count in the civil lawsuit, as set forth in the claim and the complaint, are identical. The theories of recovery differ, in part, however, because the plaintiffs brought suit in the Superior Court against the judicial marshals for civil rights violations and intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The commissioner dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim because the civil rights lawsuit against the judicial marshals in the Superior Court and the claim before him both sought money damages and arose from the same incident. The commissioner concluded that he therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim before him because \u00a7 4-142 (2) excepts \u201cclaims upon which suit otherwise is authorized by law including suits to recover similar relief arising from the same set of facts . . . .\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 4-142 (2). The pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>sent action against the judicial marshals, brought against them in their individual capacities, was a suit authorized by law, sought the same monetary relief as sought in the claim before the commissioner and arose from the same set of facts as set forth in the claim before the commissioner. On that basis, the commissioner concluded that the claim before him was an excepted claim under \u00a7 4-142 (2) and dismissed the claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The plaintiffs disagreed with the decision of the commissioner and filed a request for review of that decision by the General Assembly. The General Assembly confirmed the decision. This review by the legislature was their only recourse. The Superior Court lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals from the decisions of the commissioner. \u201c[T]he trial court does not have jurisdiction over an administrative appeal from the claims commissioner\u2019s discretionary denial of authorization to bring an action against the state because [t]he commissioner of claims performs a legislative function directly reviewable only by the General Assembly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>D\u2019Eramo </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>273 Conn. 610, 618, 872 A.2d 408 (2005).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Simply put, the plaintiffs were denied permission by the commissioner to bring an action against the state, and there is no statutory provision that authorizes the commencement of a negligence action against the state in the Superior Court for money damages without permission from the commissioner or the General Assembly. The doctrine of sovereign immunity therefore bars the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim against the state, and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over that claim. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>supra, 265 Conn. 317-18. Accordingly, the court properly dismissed count one of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-13\"> In their complaint, the plaintiffs also named five judicial marshals as individual defendants and claimed that they violated Riley\u2019s civil rights and intentionally inflicted emotional distress. The court dismissed count one of a six count complaint, which was the only count directed against the state. Thus, there still are pending counts in the trial court with respect to the individual defendants. The state is the only defendant in this action on appeal. Because the partial judgment disposed of all causes of action against the state, there is a final judgment for purposes of this appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> \u201c[Ljack of subject matter jurisdiction may be found in any one of three instances: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record; or (3) the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Columbia Air Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>293 Conn. 342, 347, 977 A.2d 636 (2009). In the present case, the jurisdictional issue was decided on the basis of the complaint and the undisputed facts in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> In their appellate brief, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the decision of the commissioner was ratified by the legislature during the 2008 regular session of the General Assembly in Substitute House Joint Resolution No. 22, File No. 557 (April 9, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> As an initial matter, we note that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal regardless of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in count one of the complaint.

He indicated: \u201cIn some limited circumstances, the General Assembly has allowed people to bring a lawsuit directly to the [SJuperior [CJourt, bypassingthe [cjlaims [cjommissioner. The [cjlaims [cjommissioner may not review claims which could be brought directly in the [SJuperior [CJourt.

In essence, these claimants are afforded two opportunities to collect from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">\u201c[This amendment] would clarify the original intent of the [cjlaims [cjom-missioner statute by specifying that a claimant who is seeking money damages from the state, and who is authorized to bring a direct action in [SJuperior [CJourt, cannot bring a claim based on the same set of facts simultaneously through the[c]laims [cjommissioner.\u201d Conn.
