This presents a question of first impression in Maryland, <em>viz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">May a doctor whose negligence caused a mother not to abort her pregnancy be successfully sued for \u201cwrongful life\u201d by a genetically defective child born as a consequence of the doctor\u2019s negligence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">We hold that Maryland does not recognize a cause of action for wrongful life and, accordingly, answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Other issues that arose out of a companion \u201cwrongful birth\u201d claim must also be decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>I. <em>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">On September 19, 1995, a daughter, Ibrion Fatuo Kassama, was born to Millicent Kassama. The delivery was uneventful; unfortunately, however, Ibrion was born with Down\u2019s Syndrome.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During her pregnancy, Mrs. Kassama was treated by Dr. Aaron H. Magat, a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Mrs. Kassama, individually and on behalf of Ibrion, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against Dr. Magat, his professional association, and one of his associates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint contained counts for negligence and lack of informed consent. Mrs. Kassama alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that, but for Dr. Magat\u2019s negligence, she would have had an abortion and would not have delivered Ibrion (hereinafter \u201cthe wrongful-birth claim\u201d). In her wrongful-birth claim, Mrs. Kassama, individually, claimed economic damages caused by the necessity of raising her genetically defective child.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>On behalf of Ibrion, Mrs. Kassama filed a claim for wrongful life based on negligence and lack of informed consent theories. Prior to trial, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment as to Ibrion\u2019s claim of lack of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The case was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. At the close of the plaintiffs case, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment as to Ibrion\u2019s claim of negligence, as well as Mrs. Kassama\u2019s lack of informed consent claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, only Mrs. Kassama\u2019s wrongful-birth claim was considered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The jury found that Dr. Magat had breached the applicable standard of care and that the breach was a proximate cause of Mrs. Kassama\u2019s injury. The jury also found that Mrs. Kassama was contributorily negligent and that her negligence was a proximate cause of her own injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">After the trial judge considered and denied Mrs. Kassama\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and motion for new trial, a timely appeal was filed by Mrs. Kassama, individually and on behalf of Ibrion. The defendants responded by filing a conditional cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">II. <em>QUESTIONS PRESENTED</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Several of the questions raised by Mrs. Kassama deal with damages and need not be decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The questions that must be resolved are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>1. Did the trial court err in allowing the jury to consider the issue of whether Mrs. Kassama was contributorily negligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">2. Assuming that the answer to Question No. 1 is \u201cno,\u201d did the trial court err in failing to give the jury a last clear chance instruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">3. Did the trial court err in granting Dr. Magat\u2019s motion for judgment in regard to Ibrion\u2019s wrongful-life claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">We answer all three questions in the negative. Because we shall affirm the judgment entered in favor of the defendants, it is unnecessary to decide the issues raised in the cross-appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">III. <em>MEDICAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">An alpha fetoprotein (\u201cAFP\u201d) blood test is used to detect genetic defects. Ideally, the blood sample for the AFP test is drawn when a woman is fifteen to sixteen weeks pregnant, but it is acceptable to obtain a blood sample as late as nineteen weeks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An abnormally high AFP test score indicates that the fetus may have spina bifida, open spinal cord congenital abnormalities, or certain other serious potential problems. An abnormally low score is associated with Down\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Even if an AFP test shows an increased risk of Down\u2019s Syndrome or other serious potential problems, the test is not definitive\u2014it merely shows a potential problem. To find out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>for certain whether a fetus is afflicted with certain genetic problems, the mother must undergo an amniocentesis, a test whereby a physician, with the assistance of an ultrasound machine, extracts genetic material from the fluid in the sac surrounding the fetus. The material extracted is sent to a laboratory that grows the cells contained in the fluid in order to obtain a genetic profile. Once the results of an amniocentesis is known, the mother must consider the test results and, assuming there is still time for an abortion, decide whether she wants to abort the pregnancy. The parties agreed at trial that if an amniocentesis had been performed in this case it would have shown that the fetus Mrs. Kassama was carrying had Down\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 125, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), Judge Blackman noted that the normal term of human pregnancy is 266 days (38 weeks). When <em>Roe </em>was decided, it was believed that a fetus was viable<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cat about seven months (28 weeks) but [that viability] may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 93 S.Ct. 705. (Citing L. Heilman <em>&amp; </em>J. Pritchard, <em>Williams Obstetrics </em>493 (14th ed.1971)). More recently, in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey, </em>505 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>U.S. 833, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), Justice O\u2019Connor observed that viability sometimes occurs as early as twenty-three weeks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 860, 112 S.Ct. 2791.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">IV. <em>MARYLAND\u2019S ABORTION LAWS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">There is no statutory time limitation in Maryland after which a genetically defective fetus or one suffering from a \u201cserious deformity or abnormality\u201d may not be terminated. In this regard, section 20-209(b) of the Health General article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (2000 Repl.Vol.) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEn\">(b) <em>State Intervention. </em>Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, the State may not interfere with the decision of a woman to terminate a pregnancy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">(1) Before the fetus is viable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">(2) At any time during the woman\u2019s pregnancy, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">(i) The termination procedure is necessary to protect the life or health of the woman; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">(ii) The fetus is affected by genetic defect or serious deformity or abnormality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">As will be seen, however, the fact that Maryland\u2019s abortion law is extremely liberal does not mean that a woman can find a Maryland doctor who will perform an abortion at any time merely because the mother is carrying a genetically defective fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Y. <em>TRIAL TESTIMONY</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">A. <em>Dr. Magat\u2019s Version of Events</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">Mrs. Kassama first visited Dr. Magat\u2019s office on April 19, 1995. On that date, an ultrasound test showed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>gestational age of Mrs. Kassama\u2019s fetus was seventeen weeks, four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Dr. Magat noted on his patient\u2019s chart that Mrs. Kassama was a \u201clate registrant,\u201d meaning that she had come to him late in her pregnancy. He ordered blood work, including an AFP test. The doctor filled out a form for Mrs. Kassama to have the blood drawn and referred her to a laboratory, which was within walking distance from his office, where the blood was to be drawn and analyzed. Dr. Magat dated the blood work requisition slip for the next day\u2014April 20, 1995\u2014when he expected that the blood for the AFP test would be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Dr. Magat told Mrs. Kassama to have the blood work done \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d He also told his patient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">I am going to give you two more slips. Those slips ... are for basically fan] AFP test, the test we want to get between 15 and 19 weeks and 1, again, briefly went over, obviously, as we talked about, screenings for spina bifida.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">I explained, again, [the] AFP test, what it screens for. I also gave her a slip for official ultrasound. We are were [sic] approaching 18 weeks. The best criteria I had to go with at this point was my ultrasound in the office. I have I felt [sic] fairly confident I had gotten a good measurement, but I wanted to confirm my dates were correct as well as there were no anomalies or problems with the baby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Dr. Magat next saw Mrs. Kassama on May 18, 1995, at which time Mrs. Kassama told him that she had the blood drawn for the AFP test on May 16, 1995.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She also said she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>had obtained the second ultrasound on May 11,1995. Because his patient had not had the blood work done as requested, Dr. Magat wrote on Mrs. Kassama\u2019s chart that she had been \u201cnon-compliant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On May 19, 1995, at 3:15 p.m., Maryland Medical Med Path, the laboratory that analyzed Mrs. Kassama\u2019s blood sample, completed a report setting forth the AFP test results. The record does not show when the report was sent to Dr. Magat\u2019s office or when he received it, but Dr. Magat saw the report for the first time on May 25, 1995. The report showed that Mrs. Kassama had a one in fifty-seven chance of delivering a baby with Down\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Mrs. Kassama was thirty-one years old when Ibrion was born. The normal risk for a Down\u2019s Syndrome baby for someone of Mrs. Kassama\u2019s age is approximately one in 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On May 25, 1995, the gestational age of Mrs. Kassama\u2019s fetus was estimated to be twenty-two weeks and four days. According to the undisputed evidence in this case, no physician in Maryland will perform an abortion of a fetus with Down\u2019s Syndrome if the fetus is more than twenty-three weeks and six days old. Mrs. Kassama\u2019s fetus would reach twenty-three weeks and six days in nine days, i.e., on June 3, 1995. This presented a problem because it takes, on average, two weeks to obtain the results of an amniocentesis. According to Dr. Magat, there was no way to do a rush amniocentesis. The results can be obtained only after cells that surround the fetus are extracted and grown in a laboratory. It <em>usually </em>takes about fourteen days to obtain the results. It <em>always </em>takes a minimum of twelve days to get the test results\u2014and sometimes as much as seventeen days\u2014according to Dr. Magat.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Dr. Magat testified that even if he had received the AFP report on Friday, May 19th (the day the report was written), it would have taken at least until Monday\u2014May 22nd to schedule an amniocentesis. By that date, only twelve days would have remained until June 3rd. Twelve days would have been insufficient time to have an amniocentesis, get the results, schedule an abortion, and perform one in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Dr. Magat testified that as soon as he received the AFP results he called Mrs. Kassama. His testimony as to what he told his patient in the May 25, 1995, phone conversation was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">[What] I explained to h\u00e9r was that I received the results of her ... AFP test and she came back very suspicious for Down\u2019s Syndrome. And that at that point, I thought it was the lowest I had seen. I have since seen lower results that have returned normal. But again, I told her I was suspicious about the possible results and also suspicious for Down\u2019s Syndrome. And unfortunately, she had, I explained to her that she had waited four weeks to get the results, that at this point, she was 22 weeks and four days. And at 22 weeks and four days, if you wanted to act on the results, we would get an amniocentesis and the amniocentesis takes about two weeks to get back and the results would come back at greater than 24 weeks, which would still be too late to act in the State of Maryland. But there were other states where she could still go. And at that point, she told me that she would not act on the results and she didn\u2019t want to do anything about it. So, I informed her that you can still get an amniocentesis, even if you wouldn\u2019t act on the results, but the amniocentesis does have a risk to it. Some people have miscarriages from having the amniocentesis. Some people believe if you won\u2019t act on the amniocentesis results, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to do the test just for the information. Again, she said [she] wouldn\u2019t act. I said, you should at least get genetic counseling to explore what options you have left. She said, I wouldn\u2019t do anything about it anyway. At that point, I didn\u2019t push it any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>and I decided to write a note in the chart. That\u2019s where you see the note from 5-25-95.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Dr. Magat wrote the following words in the margin of the Maryland Medical Met Path laboratory report that had notified him of the AFP test results: \u201cPt. [patient] informed. Needs genetic counseling, possible amnio.\u201d A note in Mrs. Kassama\u2019s chart, dated May 25, 1995, reads: \u201c[Decreased] AFP. Pt. is now 22 weeks and four days (risk is one in 57).\u201d Dr. Magat next wrote: \u201cPatient offered amnio even though she would be greater than 24 weeks by the time the results returned.\u201d He then scratched out the words \u201coffered\u201d and the phrase \u201ceven though she.\u201d As corrected, the sentence read: \u201cPt. too late for amnio because she would be ... [more than] 24 weeks by the time the results returned.\u201d He explained why he scratched out the aforementioned words as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alv\">I realized I already had that noted on the lab sheet. I wanted my notes here to reflect the lateness of the test and the lateness of the results and that in the State of Maryland, that she would be too late to act on the amniocentesis in the state because they [sic] would be greater than 24 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alk\">Dr. Magat acknowledged that if a fetus has Down\u2019s Syndrome a woman can get an abortion in New York when the fetus is up to twenty-six weeks of gestational age and that in Kansas it is possible to obtain an abortion for a Down\u2019s Syndrome fetus up to twenty-eight weeks. Upon cross-examination, he also made the following concessions:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Q: So we can agree that if, in fact, you or anybody from your office never contacted Mrs. Kassama about the results of that AFP and didn\u2019t communicate the options available to her, that you would be in the breach of the standard of care, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">A: I would agree with that, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Q: Again, just like I asked Doctor Katz, one of the experts you retained on your behalf yesterday, let\u2019s take it one step further. If you called Mrs. Kassama up, reported the AFP test as being low, but told her that it was too late to have an amnio, because it would be greater than 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>weeks and she wouldn\u2019t be able to act upon it, if that was the information you gave her, you would have been in breach of the standard of care as well?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">A: Hypothetically.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Q: Yes, hypothetically, because I know\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">A: Yes, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">B. <em>Mrs. Kassama\u2019s Version of Events</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">At trial, Mrs. Kassama could not recall when Dr. Magat told her to have the AFP test.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She adamantly maintained, however, that Dr. Magat could not possibly have asked her to have the blood drawn on April 20th, because she always followed Dr. Magat\u2019s instructions promptly. Therefore, if he had asked her to have the blood drawn on April 20th, she would have done so. Mrs. Kassama believed that Dr. Magat must have asked her to take the test on May 16,1995, the date she signed her informed consent verification and the date the blood was drawn for that test. Mrs. Kassama\u2019s strong views in this regard are revealed by the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Q [Defense Counsel]: Now, that would be consistent with your memory that Doctor Magat always asked you to get the testing done that day or the next day, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">A: Exactly, um-hum. (Indicating affirmatively.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Q: Is it your testimony to this Jury that you went on April 20th to get the testing done, as you were requested to do?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">A: If I was requested to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Q: No, that\u2019s not my question. I am sorry, let me ask it again. Is it your memory that you went on April 20th to get the testing done?</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">A: Testing for what, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Q: Testing for the AFP and the other studies that were ordered by Doctor Magat, according to the medical records in that first visit?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">A: Anything that Doctor Magat gave me to have completed was done. Whenever he told me to, I mean, even I did the ultrasound. Why would I wait until the 16th when I did the ultrasound on the 11th [of May]? Why would I skip having the blood test done?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Q: Even if the log of the lab where the AFP test was done ... shows that on May 16th you came and you had the blood drawn for the AFP test, that\u2019s wrong, because if you were told to get it on April 20th, you wouldn\u2019t have waited four weeks, would you?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">A: That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think I was told on April 20th. I mean, you are telling me to look at April 20th on the top of that form. Right at the bottom is 5/16.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Mrs. Kassama testified that she was never advised by Dr. Magat of the results of the AFP test or of the option of having an amniocentesis or an abortion. Put more bluntly, she claimed that the phone call testified to by Dr. Magat never took place on May 25th or on any other date.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Mrs. Kassama testified that if she had known of the AFP test results and had been offered the opportunity she would have had an amniocentesis. She also testified that if she had been informed after the amniocentesis that she was carrying a fetus with Down\u2019s Syndrome, she would have had an abortion either in Maryland or, if necessary, out of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">C. <em>The Experts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">Plaintiff called two obstetricians and gynecologists (\u201cObGyns\u201d) to testify on her behalf, i.e., Dr. Leonard LaBua and Dr. Lawrence Borow. The defense also called an Ob-Gyn, Dr. John Katz.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>1. Dr. Leonard LaBua</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Dr. LaBua was board certified as an Ob-Gyn in 1969. Since 1990, he has restricted his practice to forensic medicine\u2014 reviewing medical malpractice cases and, when necessary, testifying at depositions and in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">On direct examination, plaintiffs counsel and Dr. LaBua had the following exchange concerning the May 19th report showing that Mrs. Kassama had a one in fifty\u2014seven chance of delivering a child with Down\u2019s Syndrome:</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Q: Now, on May 19th, 1995, Doctor, how many weeks was Ms. Kassama in her pregnancy?</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">A: I think on the 19th she was approximately 21.2 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Q: Doctor, assuming that this report was available to Dr. Magat or his office on the 19th, can you tell us, do you have an opinion, a reasonable degree of medical probability, as to whether there would be sufficient time to order or offer the patient amniocentesis with the ultimate goal, should it come back positive, to terminate her pregnancy?</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">A: Yes, very definitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Dr. LaBua further testified that even assuming that by the time the AFP report was completed it was too late to have an abortion in Maryland, and assuming that Dr. Magat told Mrs. Kassama of the AFP results but also told her it was too late to have a Maryland abortion, Dr. Magat nevertheless would have breached the applicable standard of care if he failed to also tell her that she had the option of terminating the pregnancy out of state, i.e., in New York, Kansas, or Arkansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Dr. LaBua was cross-examined closely and effectively as to whether\u2014as of Friday, May 19th\u2014there was still time to have an abortion in Maryland. First of all, according to Dr. Magat\u2019s records, as of May 19th, Mrs. Kassama was twenty-one weeks, six days pregnant, not twenty-one weeks, two days, as he had assumed. That left only fifteen days until June 3, 1995. Dr. LaBua (impliedly) admitted this when he testified that on May 25th there were only nine days left to have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>abortion in Maryland. Dr. LaBua also admitted on cross-examination that, even if Dr. Magat received the AFP report the minute it was signed, it would take until at least Monday, May 22, 1995, to consult with his patient and have an amniocentesis both scheduled and performed. By May 22nd, only twelve days remained until the June 3rd deadline. According to Dr. LaBua it usually took between ten and fourteen days to receive the results of an amniocentesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">2. Dr. Lawrence Borow</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Plaintiff introduced the videotaped deposition of Dr. Lawrence Borow, an Ob-Gyn who practices in Pennsylvania. Dr. Borow testified that the results of an amniocentesis could be obtained by a \u201crush technique\u201d in only seven days and therefore as of May 19th there was \u201cmore than adequate time\u201d to have genetic counseling, obtain the results of an amniocentesis, and schedule and perform an abortion before the fetus was twenty-four weeks old. Moreover, even on May 25, 1995, when the fetus was twenty-two weeks, five days old, the nine days remaining were sufficient to have the counseling, review the amniocentesis results, and abort the fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Plaintiffs counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">If you have\u2014if you tell a patient, look, I got your alpha fetoprotein results back, you have a 1 in 57 chance of having a Down\u2019s Syndrome, now the next test that we can do to give a definitive diagnosis is amniocentesis, but it\u2019s too late for you to act upon those results, is that a form of genetic counseling?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The witness answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">It\u2019s certainly what Dr. Magat would describe as a crude form of genetic counseling. And that\u2019s what, in fact, in my opinion occurred here and is reflected in Dr. Magat\u2019s note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">3. Dr. John Katz</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">The defense called Dr. John Katz, a board certified Ob Gyn from Baltimore County, Maryland. Dr. Katz testified that to his knowledge no physician in Maryland would perform an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>abortion of a Down\u2019s Syndrome fetus once the fetus reaches the age of twenty-four weeks. Dr. Katz also testified that on average it usually takes fourteen days to obtain the results of an amniocentesis. On rare occasions, the results can be obtained in twelve to thirteen days, but sometimes it takes more than fourteen days. As an example, Mrs. Kassama\u2019s medical records showed that it took sixteen days to obtain amniocentesis results when Mrs. Kassama had that procedure performed during her 1998 pregnancy. The speed with which the results may be obtained does not depend on the laboratory; instead, it is dependent upon how quickly the cells grow. Dr. Katz agreed with Dr. Magat that there was no such thing as a \u201crush technique\u201d that could speed up the cell growth process. More specifically, he knew of no facility that could obtain the amniocentesis results in seven days\u2014as Dr. Borow testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Dr. Katz said that even if Dr. Magat received the AFP results on Friday, May 19, 1995, the earliest he would have been able to schedule an amniocentesis was Monday, May 22nd\u2014which left only a window of twelve days to perform an abortion in Maryland. This was insufficient time to have an abortion in Maryland because an amniocentesis showing a genetic defect would first be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Dr. Katz agreed with all the other doctors who testified that in New York and Kansas abortions could be obtained after the fetus was twenty-four weeks old. He also agreed with the other experts that the standard of care required an Ob Gyn to either tell his patient of her out-of-state options or to refer her to genetic counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">VI. <em>MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON ISSUE OF CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">At the end of the entire case, Mrs. Kassama\u2019s counsel made a motion for judgment as to the issue of contributory negligence. Counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">I realize from just a gut level feeling one would think that the issue of contributory negligence has been generated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>But in order to have the issue of contributory negligence go to the jury, the burden is on the defendant in [the] exact same fashion as the burden of primary negligence is on the plaintiff. And there\u2019s four elements to any negligence or contributory negligence: Duty, breach, causation and harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">I think we can all agree that a patient has a duty to act reasonably. So clearly, that, I think, has been established and that\u2019s there. Clearly, in this case the defense has set forth a theory that she was given the blood tests or told to go on April 19th or 20th, and there is evidence to suggest, obviously, we hotly dispute that that is what occurred, but the purpose of my argument, I agree there\u2019s evidence that would suggest that Mrs. Kassama waited four weeks to get the test. The problem that the defense has is that\u2019s all they can show. They can\u2019t take the next step and show that there was any harm or causation that she created herself. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The trial judge ruled that although the evidence was conflicting on many points the defendants had presented evidence that, if believed, would make the issue of whether Mrs. Kassama\u2019s negligence had contributed to her own injury a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">VII. <em>ISSUE 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">\n<em>Contributory Negligence\u2014Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Appellant admits here, as she did in the lower court, that there was evidence, if believed, from which the jury could reasonably find that she was negligent in waiting approximately four weeks to have the AFP test.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellant maintains, however, that the jury could not have reasonably concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that her negligence proximately caused her injury. Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">The [defendant's evidence to the effect that Mrs. Kassama chose not to terminate the pregnancy only served to negate [pjlaintiffs proximate cause, not to show any independent proximate cause of [pjlaintiffs contributory negligence. If the jury had believed that Mrs. Kassama would not have terminated the pregnancy regardless of the results of the amniocentesis, <em>it would have been legally impossible for them [sic] to have found that Defendant Magat proximately caused her injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">According to appellant: \u201cUnder the evidence presented in this case, both the plaintiff and the defendant could not have proximately caused the injury; the proximate cause by one party necessarily excludes proximate cause by the other party.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">\u201cContributory negligence is that degree of reasonable and ordinary care that a plaintiff fails to undertake in the face of an appreciable risk which cooperates with the defendant\u2019s negligence in bringing about the plaintiffs harm.\u201d <em>[Board of] Coimty Commissioners [of Garrett County] v. Bell Atlantic[-Maryland, Inc.], </em>346 Md. 160, 180, 695 A.2d 171 (1997); ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\"><em>McQuay v. Schertle, </em>126 Md.App. 556, 568, 730 A.2d 714 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">\u201cContributory negligence, if present, defeats recovery because it is a proximate cause of the accident; otherwise, the negligence is not contributory.\u201d <em>Batten v. Michel, </em>15 Md.App. 646, 652, 292 A.2d 707 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Any legally sufficient evidence of negligence, however slight, must be submitted to a jury to be weighed and evaluated. <em>Fowler v. Smith, </em>240 Md. 240, 246, 213 A.2d 549 (1965). \u201c[T]he truth of all the credible evidence tending to sustain the claim of negligence must be assumed and all favorable inferences of fact fairly deducible therefrom tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to establish negligence drawn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The question of negligence becomes a matter of law only when reasonable minds could not differ. <em>Union Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Dorsey, </em>125 Md.App. 275, 282, 724 A.2d 1272 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In order to prove the proximate cause of an injury, a party \u201cis permitted to rely on circumstantial evidence. Direct testimony is not essential.\u201d <em>McSlarrow v. Walker, </em>56 Md. App. 151, 159, 467 A.2d 196 (1988). Meager evidence of each of the elements of contributory negligence is sufficient to establish a jury question. <em>Fowler, </em>240 Md. at 246, 213 A.2d 549; <em>McSlarrow, </em>56 Md.App. at 159, 467 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">It is true, as appellant argues, that, if the jury believed Dr. Magat\u2019s testimony that he advised appellant of the AFP test results and that appellant then told him that she would not have an abortion regardless of what the amniocentesis results might be, it would have been impossible for a jury to find that Dr. Magat\u2019s negligence proximately caused appellant\u2019s injury (failure to abort the fetus). But, based on circumstantial evidence, the jury could have found Dr. Magat negligent under a completely different theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">As mentioned earlier, one of Dr. Magat\u2019s notes in Mrs. Kassama\u2019s chart read: \u201cPt. too late for amnio because she would be more than 24 weeks by the time the results returned.\u201d The jury could have believed that Dr. Magat told Mrs. Kassama of the AFP results and also advised her that it was too late to have an abortion in Maryland but did not tell her that she could still have an abortion out of state. Mrs. Kassama\u2019s attorney asked Dr. Borow about this possible scenario, which is strongly suggested by the just-quoted revised note Dr. Magat made in Mrs. Kassama\u2019s chart. He made no mention in that note of the possibility of an out-of-state abortion. Regarding this scenario, Dr. Borow said: \u201cThat\u2019s what, in fact, in my opinion, occurred here and is reflected in Dr. Magat\u2019s notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Based on Dr. Magat\u2019s notes or based upon Dr. Borow\u2019s opinion (or a combination of the two) the jury could have believed that Dr. Magat simply did not know that out-of-state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>doctors would abort a Down\u2019s Syndrome fetus after twenty-four weeks and for that reason failed to tell Mrs. Kassama of her out-of-state abortion options. Alternatively, the jury could have believed that Dr. Magat knew of the out-of-state option but failed to mention it.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">There can, of course, be more than one proximate cause of an injury. <em>Stickley v. Chisholm, </em>136 Md.App. 305, -, 765 A.2d 662, 665 [No. 2962, Sept. Term, 1999, slip op. at 9 (Jan. 18, 2001)]. In fact, the concept of contributory negligence is founded upon that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Appellant cites <em>Myers v. Bright, </em>327 Md. 395, 407, 609 A.2d 1182 (1992), for the well-established proposition that \u201c[negligence that does nothing to cause a mishap cannot create accountability.\u201d But in the case <em>sub judice </em>the jury could have found that Mrs. Kassama\u2019s negligence had a great deal to do with her failure to have an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">A patient has a duty to cooperate with her physician by following his or her instructions regarding treatment and tests. This is especially true in situations like the one in which Mrs. Kassama, as a late registrant, found herself on April 19, 1995. By the time she decided to have the AFP test, she had delayed so long that her fetus was on the cusp of viability.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">1. Dr. Magat, on April 19th, explained to Mrs. Kassama the purpose of the AFP test and told her that it was to be performed between the fifteenth and nineteenth week of pregnancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">2. Dr. Magat told Mrs. Kassama to have the AFP test \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">3. As of April 19th, Mrs. Kassama knew that she was almost eighteen weeks pregnant\u2014yet she waited for almost four weeks\u2014which put her well beyond her nineteenth week\u2014to have the blood drawn for the AFP test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>4. By delaying nearly four weeks in having the genetic test, \u201cMrs. Kassama breached a duty to herself.\u201d (See n. 13, <em>supra.)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">5. If Mrs. Kassama had followed her doctor\u2019s orders, Dr. Magat would have had plenty of time to handle her pregnancy in the usual fashion, i.e., schedule an amnio-centesis, obtain the amniocentesis results, and, if requested, arrange for an abortion in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq3\">6. Because Mrs. Kassama failed to follow her doctor\u2019s orders, her case went from the routine\u2014to one where any abortion performed would come extremely late in her pregnancy\u2014so late that no doctor in Maryland would abort the fetus\u2014even though such an abortion would not have been prohibited by state law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">In her brief, Mrs. Kassama focuses on the fact that her own negligence would have caused her no harm but for Dr. Magat\u2019s subsequent negligence. If, on May 25, 1995, Dr. Magat failed to tell his patient that she could still get an abortion out of state, and if Mrs. Kassama was, in fact, willing to travel out of state for an abortion, this is true. But the fact that there would have been no injury but for Dr. Magat\u2019s negligence is not dispositive. In any case where both primary and contributory negligence are proven, it is always true that the plaintiff would have suffered no injury had the defendant not also been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Although she does not phrase her argument as such, Mrs. Kassama contends, in effect, that (1) Dr. Magat\u2019s negligence was a superseding cause of her injury; and (2) a superseding cause negates a defendant\u2019s contributory negligence defense. Intervening negligence is a superseding cause if it is not reasonably foreseeable. <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 52, 656 A.2d 307 (1995). When the issue is whether a defendant is guilty of primary negligence, a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>party\u2019s intervening negligence that is a superseding cause absolves a defendant from his or her act of negligence. <em>Id. </em>But recently, in <em>May v. Giant Food, Inc., </em>122 Md.App. 364, 712 A.2d 166 (1998), we held that \u201cfor purposes of contributory negligence, the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s act of primary negligence constitutes an intervening or superseding cause is properly analyzed as a question of proximate causation and foreseeability\u201d\u2014not under a superseding cause analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 391, 712 A.2d 166. At bottom, however, the matter comes down to a question of semantics rather than substance. <em>See Rawl v. United States, </em>778 F.2d 1009 (4th Cir.1985), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">The problem of whether the superseding and intervening negligence theory is available only for the benefit of defendants may, however, be simply no more than a matter of labels, for the doctrine of intervening and superseding negligence is very similar to a rule of law which allows a plaintiff to avoid the consequences of contributory negligence by showing that his own negligence did not proximately cause the injury he suffered. <em>Thus, contributory negligence will not bar recovery where the plaintiff can show that his own conduct did not expose him to a foreseeable risk of the particular injury that in fact occurred through the negligence of the defendant. </em>The doctrine has been characterized in terms of lack of proximate cause: if the harm that occurred was not a foreseeable hazard of plaintiffs negligence, the plaintiff may recover from defendant. The proximate cause of the injury was the defendant\u2019s intervening negligence, and the causal connection between the plaintiffs negligence and the injury was broken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1015 n. 11 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In <em>Yonce v. SmithKline Beecham Clinical Labs., Inc., </em>111 Md.App. 124, 680 A.2d 569 (1996), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">Two subparts comprise the element of proximate cause. [T]he element of proximate cause is satisfied if the negligence is 1) a cause in fact of the injury and 2) a legally cognizable cause. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 51, 656 A.2d 307 (1995). Our courts have used two tests when determining whether a defendant\u2019s negligence is the cause in fact of a plaintiffs injury. Respectively, they are described as the \u201cbut for\u201d and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 680 A.2d 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The <em>Yonce </em>Court, after discussing the \u201cbut for\u201d and \u201csubstantial factor\u201d tests, went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">Regardless of the test employed, the focus remains on the fundamental and sometimes metaphysical inquiry into the nexus between the defendant\u2019s negligent act and the resultant harm to the plaintiff. If there is no causation in fact, we need go no further for our inquiry has reached a terminal point. If, on the other hand, there is causation in fact, our inquiry continues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">If causation in fact exists, a defendant will not be relieved from liability for an injury if, at the time of the defendant\u2019s negligent act, the defendant should have foreseen the \u201cgeneral field of danger,\u201d not necessarily the specific kind of harm to which the injured party would be subjected as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. This is in accord with the Restatement (Second).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">\u00a7 435. Foreseeability of Harm or Manner of Its Occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">(1) If the actor\u2019s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another, the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred does not prevent him from being liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">(2) The actor\u2019s conduct may be held not to be a legal cause of harm to another where after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor\u2019s negligent conduct, it appears to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 139, 680 A.2d 569 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Although the aforementioned language is geared to determinations of proximate cause as it relates to primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>negligence, there is no legitimate reason why the same language should not be modified and then utilized to establish the test of whether a plaintiffs negligence proximately caused her own injury. As modified, the test is: (1) If the plaintiffs conduct is a substantial factor in bringing harm to herself, the fact that the plaintiff neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred does not prevent the plaintiff from being guilty of contributory negligence, and (2) the plaintiffs conduct may be held not to be a legal cause of harm to herself where, after the event and looking back from the harm to the plaintiffs negligent conduct, it appears to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellees, there was evidence from which the jury could find that Mrs. Kassama\u2019s inaction was a cause in fact of her injury because, if she had not delayed in getting the AFP test, her amniocentesis and abortion would have been accomplished routinely in Maryland. Likewise, a jury question was presented as to whether appellant should have foreseen the general field of danger that her nearly four weeks of delay might occasion. Evidence germane to the foreseeability issue was: (1) Mrs. Kassama knew that the purpose of the AFP test was to screen for genetic defects; (2) she also knew that the test should be performed between the fifteenth and nineteenth week of pregnancy; (3) Mrs. Kassama likewise knew that the fetus was almost eighteen weeks of gestational age when she first saw Dr. Magat; and (4) Mrs. Kassama was instructed to have blood drawn for the AFP test as soon as possible. Given the relatively late stage of her pregnancy, common sense would tell a woman in that predicament that a nearly four-week delay in having genetic testing might drastically affect her ability to have an abortion. Thus, her injury (failure to end her pregnancy) was within \u201cthe general field of danger\u201d viewed from Mrs. Kassama\u2019s position. Moreover, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that, using hindsight, it was \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d that Mrs. Kassama\u2019s disregard of her doctor\u2019s clear instructions would lead to her own injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>VIII. <em>ISSUE 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_1\">\n<em>Last Clear Chance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aya\">Appellant argues: \u201cEven if the trial court properly allowed the issue of contributory negligence to go to the jury, the trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to also instruct the jury on last clear chance.\u201d We disagree. Language used in the case of <em>Simmons v. Urquhart, </em>101 Md.App. 85, 643 A.2d 487 (1994), is apposite. In <em>Simmons, </em>Judge; Harrell for this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">The last clear chance doctrine \u201cpresupposes a perilous situation created or existing through both a defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiffs contributory negligence and assumes that there was a time after such negligence has occurred when the defendant could, and the plaintiff could not, by the use of the means available, avert the accident.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Dortch, </em>27 Md.App. 605, 614, 342 A.2d 326, <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 745 (1975) (examining last clear chance . doctrine in a boulevard law case). <em>In the context of medical malpractice, a physician\u2019s act of primary negligence may not be used again to serve as the last clear chance of avoiding injuries.

Conveniently, however, she ignores the second sentence\u2014which we have emphasized.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">If Mrs. Kassama was contributorily negligent and Dr. Magat was negligent, then Dr. Magat could only have been negligent by his failure to tell Mrs. Kassama (after he received the AFP report) that there was still time to get both an amniocentesis and an out-of-state abortion\u2014if an abortion was desired.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Dr. Magat\u2019s act of negligence was, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>subsequent to Mrs. Kassama\u2019s negligent failure to have the blood drawn for the AFP test \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Although Dr. Magat\u2019s negligence was last in time, his act of primary negligence \u201ccannot be used again to serve as the last clear chance of avoiding injuries.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In the portion of her brief dealing with the court\u2019s failure to give a last clear chance instruction, appellant makes no effort, whatsoever, to show some act of negligence on Dr. Magat\u2019s part prior to May 25, 1995, that caused her injury; instead, appellant merely uses the same May 25th act of primary negligence a second time and calls it a \u201clast clear chance\u201d to avoid harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Accordingly, appellant has failed to demonstrate that a last clear chance instruction was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">IX. <em>ISSUE 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">As a result of being afflicted with Down\u2019s Syndrome, Ibrion is moderately retarded and has a congenital heart defect.

Campagnolo, </em>332 Md. 226, 630 A.2d 1145 (1993). As will be seen, however, the vast majority of courts that have considered the matter have rejected wrongful-life claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">A wrongful-birth claim differs from a wrongful-life claim in that the latter is brought by or on behalf of the disabled child, and the damages claimed are different. <em>See generally </em>Alan J. Belsky, <em>Injury as a Matter of Law: Is this the Answer to the Wrongful Life Dilemma?, </em>22 U. Balt. L.Rev. 185 (1993); Adam A.

Using traditional negligence analysis, as has been used in other birth-related claims, a wrongful-life action asserts that the defendant/doctor owed a duty\u2014directly or derivatively\u2014to the infant plaintiff. <em>See </em>Hutton Brown et al., <em>Special Project: Legal Rights and Issues Surrounding Conception, Pregnancy, and Birth, </em>39 Vand. L.Rev. 597, 750-55, 767 (1986). The gravamen of a wrongful-life action is the assertion that but for the physician\u2019s negligence the mother would have had an abortion and the child would never have had to experience the pain and expenses occasioned by injuries and/or diseases that the physician could have foreseen. <em>Id. </em>at 750. Because it was not the doctor who caused the defect, this amounts to an assertion on the part of the infant plaintiff, \u201cnot that [he or she] should not have been born without defects, but that [he or she] should not have been born at all.\u201d <em>Procanik v.

Sherman, </em>512 Pa. 14, 515 A.2d 1327, 1329 (1986), took the view that wrongful-life claims should be rejected because the plaintiff could not prove a \u201clegal injury.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Thus an \u201cinjury\u201d is a harm that is inflicted upon one person or entity by another. The condition about which the plaintiff complains, a diseased life, was inflicted upon the plaintiff not by any person, but by the plaintiffs genetic constitution. Thus, it may not be said that the plaintiff has suffered a legal injury, for even though his physical and mental condition is unfortunate, and even though this condition presumably would constitute a legal injury if it had been inflicted by some negligent or intentional act of anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>er, in this case, the condition was caused not by another, but by natural processes. It is not, therefore, a legal injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcX\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The New York Court of Appeals articulated a different reason for rejecting wrongful-life claims when it ruled that such claims should not be allowed because of the impossibility of calculating damages. <em>Becker v. Schwartz, </em>46 N.Y.2d 401, 413 N.Y.S.2d 895, 386 N.E.2d 807 (1978). The <em>Becker </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">Whether it is better never to have been born at all than to have been born with even gross deficiencies is a mystery more properly to be left to the philosophers and the theologians. Surely the law can assert no competence to resolve the issue, particularly in view of the very nearly uniform high value which the law and mankind has placed on human life, rather than its absence. Not only is there to be found no predicate at common law or in statutory enactment for judicial recognition of the birth of a defective child as an injury to the child; the implications of any such proposition are staggering. Would claims be honored, assuming the breach of an identifiable duty, for less than a perfect birth? And by what standards or by whom would perfection be defined?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">Simply put, a cause of action brought on behalf of an infant seeking recovery for wrongful life demands a calculation of damages dependent <em>upon a comparison between the [child\u2019s] choice of life in an impaired state and nonexistence. This comparison the law is not equipped to make. </em>Recognition of so novel a cause of action requiring, as it must, creation of a hypothetical formula for the measurement of an infant\u2019s damages is best reserved for legislative, rather than judicial, attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 812 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The impossibility of calculating damages is, of course, determinative, because it is a fundamental goal of tort law to put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the victim, insofar as it is possible to do so by compensatory damages, in the position that he/she would have been in if the defendant had not been negligent. <em>Tucker v.

Sortini, </em>31 Cal.3d 220, 182 Cal.Rptr. 337, 643 P.2d 954 (1982). In the <em>Turpin </em>case, Dr. Adam Sortini examined James and Donna Turpin\u2019s daughter (Hope) and advised the parents that Hope\u2019s hearing was within normal limits. <em>Id. </em>at 956. Approximately one year later, the child was correctly diagnosed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>being \u201cstone deaf\u2019 as a result of a hereditary ailment. <em>Id. </em>In their complaint, the Turpins alleged that if they had known that Hope was deaf they would not have conceived their second child (Joy), who suffered from the same total deafness as did her sister. <em>Id. </em>The Turpins, on behalf of Joy, brought a wrongful-life action in which they sought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">(1) general damages for being \u201cdeprived of the fundamental right of a child to be born as a whole, functional human being without total deafness\u201d and (2) special damages for the \u201cextraordinary expenses for specialized teaching, training and hearing equipment\u201d which she will incur during her lifetime as a result of her hearing impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The trial court sustained a demurrer to the Turpins\u2019 wrongful-life action. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendants/appellees took the position that Joy had suffered \u201cno legally cognizable injury or rationally ascertainable damages as a result of their alleged negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In <em>Turpin, </em>the California Supreme Court recognized that there was a \u201ccritical difference between wrongful-life actions and the ordinary prenatal injury cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961. In the ordinary prenatal injury case, where some negligent act on the part of the defendant injures the fetus, the child would have been born healthy but for the defendant\u2019s negligence; however, in a wrongful-birth case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">the obvious tragic fact is that plaintiff never had a chance \u201cto be born as a whole, functional human being without total deafness\u201d; if defendants have performed their job properly, [the plaintiff] would not have been born with hearing intact, but\u2014according to the complaint\u2014would not have been at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">The <em>Turpin </em>Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">Because nothing defendants could have done would have given plaintiff an unimpaired life, it appears inconsistent with basic tort principle to view the injury for which defendants are legally responsible solely by reference to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tiff\u2019s present condition without taking into consideration the fact that if defendants had not been negligent she would have not been born at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Court rejected the proposition that impaired life is always preferable to non-life, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">While it thus seems doubtful that a child\u2019s claim for general damages should properly be denied on the rationale that the value of impaired life, as a matter of law, always exceeds the value of non-life, we believe that the out-of-state decisions are on sounder ground in holding that\u2014with respect to the child\u2019s claim for pain and suffering or other general damages\u2014recovery should be denied because (1) it is simply impossible to determine in any rational or reasonable fashion whether the plaintiff has in fact suffered an injury in being born impaired rather than not being born, and (2) even if it were possible to overcome the first hurdle, it would be impossible to assess general damages in any fair, nonspeculative manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In reaching this decision, the Court quoted from Justice Weintraub\u2019s separate opinion in <em>Gleitman v. Cosgrove, </em>49 N.J. 22, 227 A.2d 689, 711 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">Ultimately, the infant\u2019s complaint is that he would be better off not to have been. Man, who knows nothing of death or nothingness, cannot possibly know whether that is so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">We must remember that the choice is not being born with health or being born without it.... Rather the choice is between a worldly existence and none at all.... To recognize a right not to be born is to enter an area in which no one can find his way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-11\"><em>Turpin, </em>182 Cal.Rptr. 337, 643 P.2d at 963.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">After rejecting the infant plaintiffs claim for general damages, the <em>Turpin </em>Court held that a plaintiff in a wrongful-life cause of action was entitled to recover damages for \u201c \u2018extraordinary expenses for specialized teaching, training and hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>equipment\u2019 \u201d that she would incur during her lifetime because of her deafness. <em>Id. </em>at 965. According to the Court, these types of extraordinary expenses stood on a \u201cdifferent footing\u201d than general damages. <em>Id. After </em>observing that parents, in wrongful-birth actions, were permitted to recover medical expenses incurred on behalf of a child born with disability, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">Although the parent and child cannot, of course, both recover for the same medical expenses, we believe it would be illogical and anomalous to permit only parents, and not the child, to recover for the cost of the child\u2019s own medical care. If such a distinction were established, the afflicted child\u2019s receipt of necessary medical expenses might well depend on the wholly fortuitous circumstances of whether the parents are available to sue and recover such damages or whether the medical expenses are incurred at a time when the parents remain legally responsible for providing such care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amt\"><em>Id. </em>at 965. The distinction between general damages and \u201cextraordinary expense\u201d that the Court made was that the latter expenses were \u201cboth certain and readily measurable ... [and] in many instances ... vital not only to the child\u2019s well being but to his or her very survival.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>Siemieniec v. Lutheran Gen. Hosp., </em>117 Ill.2d 230, 111 Ill.Dec. 302, 512 N.E.2d 691 (1987), the Supreme Court of Illinois puts its finger on the essential flaw in the rationale of the <em>Turpin </em>opinion. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">In awarding special damages, ... the <em>Turpin </em>court ignored the reasoning that prevented an award of general damages. The problem of establishing the fact of injury was simply passed over, and all discussion focused on the nonspeculative nature of a recovery for extraordinary medical expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The reasoning of the <em>Turpin </em>Court has been criticized by many other commentators. As an example, the California Law Review published a case note shortly after <em>Turpin </em>was decided that criticized the Turpins\u2019 court decision. <em>See </em>Kurtis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>J. Kearl, note, <em>Turpin v. Sortini: Recognizing the Unsupportable Cause of Action for Wrongful Life, </em>71 Cal.L.Rev. 1278 (1983). We are in accord with the views expressed by the author of that note, who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">The court\u2019s recognition of the wrongful life cause of action is unjustified by traditional legal principles or sound public policy. The <em>Turpin </em>court failed to account fully and consistently for the fundamental flaw of the wrongful life claim\u2014 the inability to make the required comparison between the plaintiffs actual condition and nonexistence. Without this comparison, a plaintiff can never establish that she has suffered any detriment which would entitle her to recovery. While the court acknowledged this flaw, it nevertheless granted special damages to a plaintiff who could not demonstrate that she had suffered harm in being born. The policy considerations that led the court to contravene established legal principles do not require creation of a new cause of action. The same result could have been achieved through existing law without doing violence to traditional tort principles.<footnotemark>[19]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">Attempts by the <em>Turpin </em>court and others to circumvent this fundamental obstacle to recovery have not adequately dealt with the inherent conceptual difficulties of the wrongful life claim. In view of the peculiar nature of this cause of action, the supreme court should have followed the unanimous consensus of the other jurisdictions that had considered the question and refused to allow any recovery in a wrongful life claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Despite criticism such as those just mentioned, the Washington Supreme Court, in <em>Harbeson v. Parke-Davis, Inc., </em>98 Wash.2d 460, 656 P.2d 483 (1983), followed, with no deviation, the reasoning of the <em>Turpin </em>Court and disallowed general damages but allowed the plaintiff in a wrongful-life suit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>recover damages covering the medical and educational needs of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Likewise, the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in <em>Procanik v. Cillo, </em>97 N.J. 339, 478 A.2d 755 (1984), also followed the lead of the <em>Turpin </em>Court and recognized a wrongful-life action but restricted monies recoverable to special damages for extraordinary medical expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 762. Like the <em>Harbeson </em>and <em>Turpin </em>Courts, the <em>Procanik </em>Court made \u201cthe analytical leap from injury to damages without explanation.\u201d Hutton Brown et al., <em>Special Project: Legal Rights &amp; Issues Surrounding Conception, Pregnancy, and Birth, </em>39 Vand.L.Rev. 597, 759 (1986). The <em>Procanik </em>Court, however, emphasized policy grounds that were somewhat different from those enunciated in <em>Turpin </em>and <em>Harbeson, viz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">Recovery of the cost of extraordinary medical expenses by either the parents or the infant, but not both, is consistent with the principle that the doctor\u2019s negligence vitally affects the entire family. <em>Gleitman[ v. Cosgrove, </em>49 N.J. 22, 50, 227 A.2d 689 (1967)] (Jacobs, J., dissenting). As Justice Jacobs stated in <em>Gleitman:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">And while logical objection may be advanced to the child\u2019s standing and injury, logic is not the determinative factor and should not be permitted to obscure that he has to bear the frightful weight of his abnormality throughout life, and that such compensation as is received from the defendants or either of them should be dedicated primarily to his care and the lessening of his difficulties. Indeed, if this were suitably provided for in the ultimate judgment, the technical presence or absence of the child as an additional party plaintiff would have little significance. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">Law is more than an exercise in logic, and logical analysis, although essential to a system of ordered justice, should not become [an] instrument of injustice. Whatever logic inheres in permitting parents to recover for the cost of extraordinary medical care incurred by a birth-defective child, but in denying the child\u2019s own right to recover those expenses, must yield to the injustice of that result. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>right to recover the often crushing burden of extraordinary expenses visited by an act of medical malpractice should not depend on the \u201cwholly [fortuitous] circumstance of whether the parents are available to sue.\u201d <em>Turpin v. Sortini, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at 228, 643 P.2d at 965, 182 Cal.Rptr. at 348.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">The present case proves the point. Here, the parents\u2019 claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Does this mean that Peter must forego medical treatment for his blindness, deafness, and retardation? We think not. His claim for the medical expenses attributable to his birth defects is reasonably certain, readily calculable, and of a kind daily determined by judges and juries. We hold that a child or his parents may recover special damages for extraordinary medical expenses incurred during infancy, and that the infant may recover those expenses during his majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\"><em>Procanik, </em>478 A.2d at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Judge Schreiver, dissenting in part in <em>Procanik, </em>countered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">[X]t is unfair and unjust to charge the doctors with the infant\u2019s medical expenses. The position that the child may recover special damages despite the failure of his underlying theory of wrongful life violates the moral code underlying our system of justice from which the fundamental principles of tort law are derived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">We adopt the view accepted by the higliest courts of twenty-three of our sister states that have refused to recognize a cause of action for wrongful life because it is an impossible task to calculate damages based on a comparison between life in an impaired state and no life at all. Attempts by the highest courts in California, Washington, and New Jersey to circumvent this problem are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">For the foregoing reasons we hold that the trial judge did not err when he granted the defense motion for judgment as to Ibrion\u2019s wrongful-life claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-13\">.

United States, </em>848 F.Supp. 962, 965 (M.D.Ala.1994), the Court noted that \"for clinical and practical purposes, [the AFP test] must be administered within a narrow time frame during pregnancy (sixteen - twenty weeks).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b667-6\">. \u201cViability\u201d means \u201cpotentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.\u201d <em>Roe v.

The <em>Roe </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a <em>lifesaving </em>procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 93 S.Ct. 705.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b668-15\">. \"The survival of infants bom from 23 to 25 weeks of gestation increases with each additional week of gestation.

A two-page clinical requisition form prepared by Dr. Magat requested that an AFP test be performed. The form is dated April 20, 1995.

The apparent reason for the refusal to abort at twenty-four weeks is that at least some fetuses can survive outside their mothers' wombs at that gestational age. <em>See Roe, </em>410 U.S. at 160, 93 S.Ct. 705.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\">.
