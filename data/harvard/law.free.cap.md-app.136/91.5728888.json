Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>lants, Hollingsworth <em>&amp; </em>Vose Company (\u201cH &amp; V\u201d) and Lorillard Tobacco Company (\u201cLorillard\u201d), promptly appealed from that judgment, and present the following questions, which we have rephrased, renumbered, and consolidated for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">1. Did the trial court err, as a matter of law, in denying H &amp; V\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, because of the lack of contacts of H &amp; V and its subsidiary with the State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">2. Did the trial court err, as a matter of law, by instructing the jury that it could not consider plaintiffs exposure to the asbestos-containing products of non-parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">3. Did the trial court err, as a matter of law, by instructing the jury that H &amp; V and Lorillard had a post-sale continuing duty to warn about the potential danger of a perishable consumer product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">4. Did the trial court err, as a matter of law, by refusing to include a state of the art instruction on the jury verdict form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">5. Did the trial court err in allowing Dr. Dement to testify concerning the work of Dr. Longo, because such testimony lacked foundation and was both hearsay and deficient, and further err in allowing Dr. Dement to offer opinions outside his area of expertise based on this improperly admitted evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">6.

Did the trial court err in denying defendants\u2019 post-trial motion seeking appropriate credits under the Uniform Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to question 1, remand as to questions 6 and 9, and answer \u201cno\u201d to questions 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Appellee was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June of 1997 and died as a result of this disease on July 3, 1999. Testimony adduced that appellee\u2019s mesothelioma was induced by his exposure to asbestos, although there was divergence as to whether his mesothelioma was caused by the asbestos contained in Kent cigarettes or the occupational asbestos to which he had been subjected. Appellee initially sued 27 \u201coccupational defendants\u201d that manufactured, distributed, or installed asbestos and/or asbestos-containing industrial or commercial products. Appellee alleged that he contracted mesothelioma because he was occupationally exposed to asbestos and asbestos-containing products for 25 years while working as an assembly man and electronics technician at an aircraft manufacturing facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Appellee later amended his complaint to include both appellants, contending that his mesothelioma was also substantially induced due to smoking Kent cigarettes from 1952 through 1956, at a time when these cigarettes contained crocidolite asbestos as one of the components in their filters. Lorillard manufactured and distributed the Kent brand cigarettes, and H &amp; Y manufactured the crocidolite asbestos filter used in the Kent cigarettes. When trial commenced, only four defendants remained. During jury deliberations, the last two \u201coccupational defendants\u201d settled -with plaintiff; thus, H &amp; V and Lorillard were the only remaining defendants. Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against H &amp; V and Lorillard in the amount of $2,225 million, with $225,000 representing medical expenses and $2 million repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>senting non-economic damages. Final judgment was entered; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">I Personal Jurisdiction over H &amp; V</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">H <em>&amp; </em>V contends that the trial court erred by denying its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. It argues that the State of Maryland lacks personal jurisdiction because it is a non-resident defendant, and jurisdiction cannot be achieved under Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">H &amp; V is not a Maryland corporation; it was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and its principal place of business is in that state. Thus, in order for a Maryland court to assert personal jurisdiction over H &amp; Y, it must do so through Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum Supp.), \u00a7 6-103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">(a) Condition.\u2014If jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon this section, he may be sued only on a cause of action arising from any act enumerated in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who directly or by agent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">(1) Transacts any business or performs any character of work or service in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">(2) Contracts to supply goods, food, services, or manufactured products in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">(3) Causes tortious injury in the State by an act or omission in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">(4) Causes tortious injury in the State or outside of the State by an act or omission outside the State if he regularly does or solicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct in the state or derives substantial revenue from goods, food, services, or manufactured products used or consumed in the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-14\">(5) Has an interest in, uses, or possesses real property in the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(6) Contracts to insure or act as surety for, or on, any person, property, risk, contract, obligation, or agreement located, executed, or to be performed within the State at the time the contract is made, unless the parties otherwise provide in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The purpose of this statute is to give the courts personal jurisdiction over all out-of-state defendants who purposefully avail themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Maryland, thus invoking the benefits and protections of Maryland law. <em>Mylan Labs., Inc. v. Akzo, </em>N.V., 2 F.3d 56 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Malinow v. Eberly, </em>322 F.Supp. 594 (D.Md.1971); <em>Mohamed v. Michael, </em>279 Md. 653, 370 A.2d 551 (1977) (it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state\u2014thus invoking the benefit and protection of its laws); <em>Harris v. Arlen Properties, Inc., </em>256 Md. 185, 260 A.2d 22 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Appellee\u2019s Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Appellee points out that H &amp; V \u201cwas directly involved in the promotional undertakings\u201d together with Lorillard in regard to the Kent cigarettes and that \u201cH &amp; V even went so far as to place an upper level employee at Lorillard on a full-time basis.\u201d We are given no specific examples of such conduct in appellee\u2019s brief. We will not consider this, or subsequent, general conclusory arguments that are supported only by circular reasoning and that are not appropriately correlated with specific legal authority or evidence included in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The same holds true for appellee\u2019s vacant claim that H &amp; V \u201ctook affirmative steps to help insure that consumers in Maryland would smoke Kent cigarettes.\u201d The record extract in this case consists of five volumes, totaling 3,350 pages. If appellee had evidence of specific instances that would support such allegations, he should have made reference to the record extract. We will not peruse the record extract to find evidentiary support for appellee\u2019s conclusory statements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The liberalizing provision relating to record extracts in Rule 8-501 (c) does not excuse the failure to furnish in the brief references to factual material in support of a party\u2019s argument as required by Rule 8-504(a)(4). Nor does the liberalization in Rule 8-501 (c) alter the fundamental rule of appellate practice under which the appellate court has no duty independently to search through the record for error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af\"><em>ACandS, Inc. v. Asner, </em>344 Md. 155, 192, 686 A.2d 250 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Appellee states that \u201cH <em>&amp; </em>V and Lorillard jointly developed the asbestos filter and jointly incorporated it into a product which they placed in the national stream of commerce, including Maryland.\u201d Appellee also states that \u201cH &amp; V profited directly from the sales in Maryland and elsewhere\u2014a profit which was 100% contingent upon the marketing effort.\u201d Although appellee\u2019s arguments may, at first glance, seem seductive, we are not so gullible, devoid of worldly knowledge, or so childlike in our approach to realities that we can be deceived and hoodwinked by claims that have no factual or legalistic basis. First, appellee presents not a spark of evidence to support his claim that H &amp; V had any involvement with Lorillard\u2019s placement of the cigarettes in the stream of commerce. Other than a typical manufacturer-retailer relationship, there is no evidence of a joint venture or partnership between the two companies. H &amp; V merely produced the filters that were used as one of the components of the cigarettes; Lorillard placed the cigarettes in the stream of commerce by marketing and distributing them to its consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Appellee\u2019s claim that H &amp; V profited directly from the sales and that its profits were completely contingent upon marketing efforts promoting the cigarettes is of dubious relevance. We are at a loss to determine how this has any bearing on whether H &amp; V had minimum contacts with the State of Maryland. Of course its profits were directly related to the sales of the cigarettes. H <em>&amp; </em>V manufactured a component that was used in the cigarettes sold by Lorillard. We take judicial notice of the obvious\u2014that all manufacturers\u2019 profits are directly contingent upon the commercial success of the finished product and that H &amp; V profited from its sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>filters that were used in the cigarettes. Obviously, the more cigarettes Lorillard sold, the more H <em>&amp; </em>V filters Lorillard purchased. How can this be any indication of minimum contacts by H <em>&amp; </em>V? If we were to follow appellee\u2019s reasoning, then all manufacturers will be subject to personal jurisdiction for the acts of retailers. Such a result would effectively emasculate the due process clause, and the reach of the long-arm statute would approach infinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Appellee argues that \u201cH &amp; V was intimately aware of how its filter was being used in the Kent cigarettes, how they were marketed (including marketing in Maryland through a national advertising campaign), and how they were packaged and sold.\u201d These claims are unpersuasive on two grounds. First, once again, there is no reference to any part of the record that substantiates these claims. Second, even if appellee had made specific references to support its claims, the truth of those claims would still not subject H <em>&amp; </em>V to personal jurisdiction. What is the relevance of H &amp; V\u2019s knowledge of these matters? To accept appellee\u2019s premise, we must then assume that a non-resident advertising agency has minimum contacts with a state if it is \u201cintimately aware\u201d of how its clients market their products in that state. It is incredible to contemplate the consequences of such reasoning on our traditional notions of due process and justice. H <em>&amp; </em>V\u2019s role in the sale of the Kent cigarettes was merely in manufacturing the filters. Lorillard\u2019s role was to market and distribute the cigarettes. There is nothing in the record that contradicts this conclusion. We choose not to substitute \u201cmany-tentacled\u201d for \u201clong-arm\u201d in the statute so that all distributors, manufacturers, and retailers are automatically embraced and subject to personal jurisdiction simply because a company in its supply chain happens to be accessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Appellee quotes from <em>Burger King v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985): \u201cSo long as a commercial actor\u2019s <em>efforts are \u2018purposefully directed\u2019 toward residents of another State, </em>we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there\u201d (emphasis added) (citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ted), and then goes on to state that, \u201c[h]aving shown that H &amp; V <em>purposefully established this relationship </em>with Maryland, additional factors must then be considered----\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellee has once again used semantics at its convenience. How has H &amp; V purposefully established any relationship with Maryland? It only may be concluded that it purposefully established a business relationship with Lorillard\u2014nothing further. Lorillard\u2019s factories were not in Maryland. Lorillard marketed its cigarettes in Maryland, as well as throughout the country, but appellee has not begun to establish that H <em>&amp; </em>V purposefully established a relationship with Maryland. The reference to <em>Burger King </em>directly preceding appellee\u2019s statement does not make his claim more convincing. H <em>&amp; </em>V\u2019s efforts were pellucidly not \u201cpurposefully directed\u201d toward residents of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Appellee\u2019s reliance on the cases it cites is disingenuous; they are easily distinguished from the facts in this case. For example, in <em>Vermeulen v. Renault U.S.A. Inc., </em>975 F.2d 746 (11th Cir.1992), the defendant had designed its products specifically for the United States market, and thus was subject to personal jurisdiction in the United States. In this case, there is no evidence that H &amp; V designed its filters specifically for the Maryland market, nor is there any evidence that the Maryland market was in any way specifically considered when the filters were designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Appellee argues that the State of Maryland has a \u201cstrong interest in adjudicating this matter\u201d because it involves injury to a Maryland resident. Moreover, appellee asserts that H &amp; Y is not significantly inconvenienced by having the State of Maryland as a forum for this action, because H <em>&amp; </em>V already has been required to defend claims in several other jurisdictions in which it was not a resident corporation. In response, we quote the Maryland Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">The legitimate interest that Maryland has in providing a forum to one of its citizens, and the fact that the action could probably be litigated in this State without significant inconvenience to the foreign corporations, while factors wor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>thy of serious consideration, cannot alone serve as the foundation for assumption of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><em>Camelback Ski Corp. v. Behning, </em>307 Md. 270, 513 A.2d 874 (1986), <em>vacated for further consideration, </em>480 U.S. 901, 107 S.Ct. 1341, 94 L.Ed.2d 512 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>312 Md. 330, 539 A.2d 1107, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 849, 109 S.Ct. 130, 102 L.Ed.2d 103 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Appellee claims that the \u201cmatter would be most efficiently handled by maintenance of the lawsuit against both defendants here.\u201d Although such reasoning is certainly a factor in such circumstances, we do not sacrifice due process, fair play, and adherence to judicial precedent on the altar of judicial efficiency. The Due Process Clause \u201cdoes not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties, or relations.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. 286, 294, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980) (quoting <em>International Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Compensation and Placement, </em>326 U.S. 310, 319, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-7\"><em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 294, 100 S.Ct. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">We hold that H &amp; V did not establish minimum contacts with the State of Maryland, and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over H <em>&amp; </em>V would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice; consequently, the trial court erred in asserting personal jurisdiction over H <em>&amp; </em>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">We turn now to an examination of the trial court\u2019s finding that it had jurisdiction over H <em>&amp; </em>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\n<em>Personal Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Application of this long-arm statute is a two-step process. First, it must be determined whether the statute purports to authorize the assertion of personal jurisdiction. Secondly, it must be determined whether an exercise of jurisdiction permitted by the statute violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Mohamed v. Michael, </em>279 Md. 653, 370 A.2d 551 (1977); <em>Geelhoed v. Jensen, </em>277 Md. 220, 352 A.2d 818 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Under the familiar due process analysis enunciated in profuse Maryland and U.S. Supreme Court decisions, a defendant must have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state so that the maintenance of a suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>Malinow v. Eberly, </em>322 F.Supp. 594; <em>Mohamed, </em>279 Md. 653, 370 A.2d 551; <em>Geelhoed, </em>277 Md. 220, 352 A.2d 818; <em>Groom v. Margulies, </em>257 Md. 691, 265 A.2d 249 (1970) <em>Harris v. Arlen Properties, </em>256 Md. 185, 260 A.2d 22; <em>Allen v. Allen, </em>105 Md.App. 359, 659 A.2d 411 (1995). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the power of a state court to exert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. \u201c[The] constitutional touchstone\u201d of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process \u201cremains whether the defendant purposefully established \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 in the forum <em>State.\u201d Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174 (quoting <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">This concept of minimum contacts, however, has been the source of considerable controversy. In 1945, the Supreme Court first articulated that the \u201cpresence in a state\u201d necessary in order to establish personal jurisdiction over the person was too limited for the increasing demands of interstate commerce and an expanding economy. Subsequently, the Supreme Court adopted a more tractable approach that recognized a state\u2019s jurisdictional power over a person not only when an individual is physically present within the state, but also when the individual conducts meaningful activity within the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>even though not physically present, as long as notions of fairness are present in asserting jurisdiction over that individual. See <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">In the passage of time since <em>International Shoe, </em>the Supreme Court has further polished the definition of \u201cminimum contacts.\u201d In <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 251, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958), the Court limited the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary to confer jurisdiction to those activities of an out-of-state defendant by which the defendant \u201cpurposely avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228. This occurs when the contacts \u201cproximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 with the forum state,\u201d <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174, or when the defendant\u2019s efforts are \u201cpurposefully directed\u201d at the state. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174. This determination must depend \u201cupon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure.\u201d <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The sequel to <em>International Shoe </em>was the landmark 1980 Supreme Court case, <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. 286, 100 S.Ct. 559. In that case, a married couple purchased a new Audi automobile from a dealer in New York, and were involved in an accident in Oklahoma while on their way to their home in Arizona. The accident resulted in severe injuries to the wife and two children. The couple brought suit in Oklahoma against the New York dealer and the New York distributor, claiming that design defects in the automobile contributed to the injuries. While the plaintiffs acknowledged that the two New York corporations were present, and did business, only in New York, they argued that Oklahoma\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the New York corporations was appropriate because of the mobile nature of the automobile and the foreseeability that some cars these corporations sold would find their way into Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The Supreme Court, however, rejected this argument, ruling that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the New York corporations by an Oklahoma court would violate the Fourteenth Amendment because the New York corporations directed no activity to Oklahoma. The Supreme Court maintained the same reasoning it had held in previous cases, including <em>International Shoe, </em>which was the lodestar on this subject. The Court stated that the defendants had not availed themselves of any privileges and benefits of Oklahoma law, that the defendants had not solicited any business there either through salespersons or through advertising reasonably calculated to reach the state, that the record did not show that the defendants regularly sold cars at wholesale or retail to Oklahoma customers or residents, and that the defendants had not indirectly, through others, served or sought out to serve the Oklahoma market. <em>Id. </em>at 295, 100 S.Ct. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The holding in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>was consistent with the earlier cases; however, the Court addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that, because an automobile is mobile by its very design and purpose, it was \u201cforeseeable\u201d that the plaintiffs\u2019 Audi would cause injury in Oklahoma. The Court responded that \u201cforeseeability\u201d alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>It added, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">This is not to say, of course, that foreseeability is wholly irrelevant. But the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product \u25a0will find its way into the forum State. Rather, it is that the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 297, 100 S.Ct. 559. <em>See Kulko v. California Superior Court, </em>486 U.S. 84, 97-98, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The Due Process Clause, by ensuring the \u201corderly administration of the laws,\u201d gives a degree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit. <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 319, 66 S.Ct. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">This brings us to the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d rationale raised in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>relied on by appellee. The <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>Court stated that \u201c[t]he forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 297-98, 100 S.Ct. 559. The Court concluded that, although it was foreseeable that purchasers of automobiles sold by defendant may take them to Oklahoma, the mere \u201cunilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 100 S.Ct. 559. Thus, although the Supreme Court in <em>WorldWide Volksioagen </em>held that personal jurisdiction was not present, it gave credence to the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d assertion on which appellee bases its contention for personal jurisdiction. We shall now discuss this \u201cstream of commerce\u201d approach and explain why we reject it under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In its review of the <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>opinion, the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in <em>Lesnick v. Hollingsworth &amp; Vose Co., </em>35 F.3d 939 (4th Cir.1994), stated that, \u201c[notwithstanding the breadth of this \u2018stream of commerce\u2019 language, the entire opinion indicates that the Court has not abandoned the notion that jurisdiction must rest on a person\u2019s activity deliberately directed toward the forum state.\u201d <em>Lesnick, </em>35 F.3d at 943-44. The Fourth Circuit went on to assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">In sum, the <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>Court\u2019s repeated reliance upon the fact that defendants, who did not direct any of their activities toward Oklahoma, could not have anticipated being subject to the jurisdiction of Oklahoma courts, leads us to believe that we should not read the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d language out of context. While <em>World-Wide </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>Volkswagen </em>has been cited for the proposition that personal jurisdiction may follow a product if it is delivered \u201cinto the stream of commerce with the expectation that [it] will be purchased by consumers in the forum state,\u201d [citations omitted] we read the holding of the case to be much narrower, requiring purposeful activity on the part of the defendants to establish a meaningful contact with the forum state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The next Supreme Court case refining the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d standard and its application to personal jurisdiction was the paradoxical case of <em>Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of California, </em>480 U.S. 102, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987). In <em>Asahi, </em>a Californian was injured in a motorcycle accident when its rear tire tube exploded. He filed suit against the Taiwanese manufacturer of the tube, which, in turn, impleaded Asahi, a Japanese company that manufactured and supplied the tube\u2019s valve assembly. Asahi conceded that it was aware that its valve assemblies would eventually be sold on motorcycles throughout the United States, but it contended that it never expected to be sued in the United States, since all of its sales flowed from Japan to Taiwan.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In <em>Asahi, </em>the Supreme Court produced two dissonant plurality opinions, with each opinion shared by four Justices. The schism was over whether the first prong under the <em>International Shoe </em>analysis, specifically, the minimum contacts standard, had been achieved. Although there was no majority opinion as to whether minimum contacts existed, the Court did unanimously hold that personal jurisdiction was not present. Taking into account the burden on Asahi to defend an American suit, the Court relied on the second prong of <em>International Shoe </em>and decided that California\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over <em>Asahi </em>would be unconstitutional, because it would \u201coffend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>Asahi, </em>480 U.S. at 113, 107 S.Ct. 1026. In discussing the first prong of the <em>International Shoe </em>analysis\u2014whether minimum contacts were present\u2014four Justices, including Justice O\u2019Connor, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices Pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ell and Scalia, opined that the minimum contacts standard had not been met. Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for that plurality, articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">The placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State. Additional conduct of the defendant may indicate an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum State, for example, designing the product for the market in the forum State, advertising in the forum State, establishing channels for providing regular advice to customers in the forum State, or marketing the product through a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in the forum State. But a defendant\u2019s awareness that the stream of commerce may or will sweep the product into the forum State does not convert the mere act of placing the product into the stream into an act purposefully directed toward the forum State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Asahi, </em>480 U.S. at 112, 107 S.Ct. 1026. In sum, according to the plurality opinion written by Justice O\u2019Connor, even though Asahi may have been aware that its products would eventually be sold in California, its lack of conduct directed specifically at California made jurisdiction in California improper under a \u201cminimum contacts\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In contrast, Justice Brennan, joined by Justices White, Marshall, and Blackmun, concluded that <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>should not be read to require \u201cadditional conduct\u201d beyond simply placing a product in the stream of commerce with the expectation that it will be purchased in the forum state. As Justice Brennan continued, \u201c[a]s long as a participant in this process is aware that the final product is being marketed in the forum State, the possibility of a lawsuit there cannot come as a surprise.\u201d <em>Asahi, </em>480 U.S. at 117, 107 S.Ct. 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Justice Stevens remained above the discord by declining to address the issue and stating that it did not need to be resolved because of the unanimous decision to rely on the second prong of <em>International Shoe. </em>He did state, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that, \u201ceven assuming that the [minimum contacts] test ought to be formulated here,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion \u201cmisapplies [the test] to the facts of <em>[Asahi].\u201d Id. </em>at 122, 107 S.Ct. 1026. Justice Stevens concluded that Asahi\u2019s conduct did rise to the level of \u201cpurposeful avaihnent\u201d in the state of California because of the large number of Asahi\u2019s units that ended up there. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Conceding that there has been dissension among courts in the interpretation of the minimum contacts standard, the O\u2019Connor plurality opinion in <em>Asahi </em>articulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">In World-Wide Volkswagen itself, the .state court sought to base jurisdiction not on any act of the defendant, but on the foreseeable unilateral actions of the consumer. Since ' World-Wide Volkswagen, lower courts have been confronted with cases in which the defendant acted by placing a product in the stream of commerce, and the stream eventually swept defendant\u2019s product into the forum State, but the defendant did nothing else to purposefully avail itself of the market in the forum State. Some courts have understood the Due Process Clause, as interpreted in World-Wide Volkswagen, to allow an exercise of personal jurisdiction to be based on no more than the defendant\u2019s act of placing the product in the stream of commerce. Other courts have understood the Due Process Clause and the above-quoted language in World-Wide Volkswagen to require the action of the defendant to be more purposefully directed at the forum State than the mere act of placing a product in the stream of commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 110, 107 S.Ct. 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Concluding the discussion on the two divergent interpretations of the minimum contacts standard, the O\u2019Connor plurality opinion stated that the more stringent \u201cpurposefully directed\u201d test, rather than the \u201cstream of commerce test,\u201d was the position that was \u201cconsonant with the requirements of due process.\u201d <em>Asahi, </em>480 U.S. at 112, 107 S.Ct. 1026. \u201cThe substantial connection between the defendant and the forum State necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>about by <em>an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.\u201d Id. See Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 476, 105 S.Ct. 2174; <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>465 U.S. 770, 774, 104 S.Ct. 1478, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Aware that the federal circuits are confrontational on this recondite question of whether the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d language in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>should control in this type of analysis, our reading of <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>and <em>Asahi </em>is in harmony with the ray that broke through the clouds of logical inconsistency in the Fourth Circuit with <em>Lesnick. </em>The <em>Lesnick </em>Court reviewed in considerable detail the <em>Asahi </em>Supreme Court opinion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">[T]he Supreme Court has not abandoned the <em>International Shoe </em>two pronged test as further articulated in <em>Hanson </em>and <em>Burger King. </em>The touchstone of the minimum contacts analysis remains that an out-of state person have engaged in some activity purposefully directed toward the forum state. <em>See Hanson, </em>357 U.S. at 253[, 78 S.Ct. 1228]; <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 475, 105 S.Ct. 2174; <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, </em>444 U.S. at 297[, 100 S.Ct. 559], And if that initial tost is met, a court must still determine whether the exercise of such jurisdiction would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. <em>See Asahi, </em>480 U.S. at 113[, 107 S.Ct. 1026], This reading of <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>and <em>Asahi </em>has prior support in our jurisprudence. <em>See Ellicott Mach. Corp. v. John Holland Party, Ltd., </em>995 F.2d 474, 477 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that minimum contacts exist where the defendant \u201cpurposefully directs its activities toward the residents of the forum\u201d); <em>see also Federal Insurance Co. v. Lake Shore, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 654 (4th Cir.1989). To permit a state to assert jurisdiction over any person in the country whose product is sold in the state simply because a person must expect that to happen destroys the notion of individual sovereignties inherent in our system of federalism. Such a rule would subject defendants to judgment in locations based on the activity of third persons and not the deliberate conduct of the defendant, making it impossible for defendants to plan and structure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>their business contacts and risks. Moreover, we do not believe that the holding of <em>World-Wide Volkswagen </em>takes us as far as plaintiff in this case suggests. Thus, we hold that the test to be applied in considering the reach of personal jurisdiction inquires whether (1) the defendant has created a substantial connection to the forum state by action purposefully directed toward the forum state or otherwise invoking the benefits and protections of the laws of the state; and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction based on those minimum contacts would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, taking into account such factors as (a) the burden on the defendant, (b) the interests of the forum state, (c) the plaintiffs interest in obtaining relief, (d) the efficient resolution of controversies as between states, and (e) the shared interests of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies. <em>See Hanson, </em>357 U.S. at 253[, 78 S.Ct. 1228]; <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S. at 475[, 105 S.Ct. 2174]; <em>Asahi, </em>480 U.S. at 113[, 107 S.Ct. 1026].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><em>Lesnick, </em>35 F.3d at 945-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">As in <em>Asahi, </em>H &amp; V in the case at bar has done nothing that would subject it to personal jurisdiction under the minimum contacts standard. H &amp; V manufactured its filters in Massachusetts, it did not maintain an office in Maryland, it did not ship its filters to Maryland, it does not appear from the record that it designed or manufactured its filters specifically for the Maryland market, nor did it advertise or market its filters in Maryland. The evidence shows that H &amp; V distributed its filter material to Lorillard\u2019s plants in Kentucky and New Jersey and that H &amp; V had no involvement with the manufacture of Kent cigarettes, nor any control over their sale and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Although it is reasonable to assume that H <em>&amp; </em>V was aware that its filters, as components of Kent cigarettes, would be purchased and smoked within the State of Maryland, this will not suffice to establish minimum contacts. We hold that H &amp; V did not possess sufficient minimum contacts with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>State of Maryland in order to subject it to personal jurisdiction within this State under the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">II Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>355 Md. 34, 46-47, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">We have held that the standard of review for jury instructions is that so long as the law is fairly covered by the jury instructions, reviewing courts should not disturb them. Accordingly, Md. Rule 2-520, \u201cInstructions to the jury,\u201d states in pertinent part: \u201c(c) How given. The court may instruct the jury, orally or in writing or both, by granting requested instructions, by giving instructions on its own, or by combining any of these methods. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d Thus, simply because a requested instruction is an accurate statement of the law and supported by the evidence does not mean the trial judge is required to give it to the jury. So long as the trial judge has covered the applicable law in another instruction, or combination of instructions, Md. Rule 2-520(c) makes clear that he or she does not have to give it to the jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">In reviewing the propriety of a trial court\u2019s denial of a requested jury instruction, we must examine \u201cwhether the requested instruction was a correct exposition of the law, whether that law was applicable in light of the evidence before the jury, and finally whether the substance of the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instruction actually given.\u201d <em>Moreover, the standard for reversible error places the burden on the complaining party to show both prejudice and error.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">(Emphasis supplied, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We now turn to an examination of the jury instructions at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\n<em>Appellee\u2019s exposure to asbestos by non-parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Appellants assert that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that \u201ca plaintiffs possible exposure to asbestos-containing products of non-parties is not to be considered by you in your determination of substantial causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The Court instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">If a defendant\u2019s products were a substantial factor in bringing about the injuries to the plaintiff, the fact that the defendant could not anticipate the exact type of injury for which the plaintiff seeks recovery or the exact manner in which the injury came about does not reheve the defendant from responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">Whether the exposure of any given user or consumer to a particular manufacturer\u2019s, supplier\u2019s or installer\u2019s product would be legally sufficient to permit a finding of substantial causation is a fact specific to each case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">The analysis of substantial causation, which is Question Two, focuses upon the plaintiffs failure\u2014exposure to all products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">The fact that the plaintiff may have been exposed to a variety of asbestos products does not relieve the defendant of liability for the injuries complained of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\n<em>A plaintiff\u2019s possible exposure to asbestos-containing products of non-parties is not to be considered by you in your determination of substantial causation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">That finding would involve the interrelationship between the use of a defendant\u2019s products and the activities of the person using it either at the work place or in the general public domain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Appellants argue that they have shown asbestos exposure by non-parties by demonstrating that the cigarettes were not unreasonably dangerous and that they were not a substantial causal factor of plaintiffs mesothelioma. They claim to have demonstrated this through evidence of appellee\u2019s occupational exposure to asbestos during his 25-year employment at Glen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>L. Martin. They further claim to have demonstrated this through the testimony of Dr. Allen Gibbs, an expert in the field of pathology and asbestos-related disease, who testified that the release of asbestos from the Kent filter was insignificant; by Dr. Rubin\u2019s testimony that \u201cworkers at Glen L. Martin have mesothelioma far greater than anybody else in the universe\u201d; and by the testimony of three other experts that indicated that 80% of mesothelioma diagnoses in North American men are attributable to occupational exposure to asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The Court, continuing to instruct on the defendants\u2019 duty, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">There may be more than one cause of an injury; that is, several negligent acts may work together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">Each party whose negligent act is the cause of an injury is responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">It is necessary and sufficient to constitute probable cause that the conduct of a particular defendant charged or the product or products of a particular defendant were an efficient cause that helped to set in motion the chain of circumstances leading up to the injury and that helped to produce the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">Failure to warn must be a proximate cause of the incident. Each defendant\u2019s product or products may be considered a legal cause of the plaintiffs harm if the defendant\u2019s product or products are a substantial factor in bringing about the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">The word substantial used in this sense means that the defendant\u2019s product or products must have had such an effect in producing a harm as to lead reasonable persons to regard it as a cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">Where a plaintiff has proved a disease resulting from exposure to asbestos products of different identified manufacturers or suppliers, no manufacturer or supplier has a defense solely on the ground that the plaintiff would probably have suffered the same disease from inhaling or ingesting fibers originating from the products of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Where the separate and independent acts of sevei-al defendants combined to produce a single injury, each defendant is responsible for the entire injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">In other words, joint defendants may be legally responsible, even if their participation in that injury occurred at different times, in different ways and in unequal proportions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">You shall not apportion or distribute responsibility in these cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We find no basis for disturbing the trial judge\u2019s ruling regarding this jury instruction. The trial court\u2019s jury instruction followed the legal explanation articulated in <em>ACandS, Inc. v. Asner, </em>344 Md. 155, 686 A.2d 250 (1996), a case cited by both appellants and appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In <em>Asner, </em>the Court of Appeals provided a guideline for dealing with jury instructions as to exposure by non-parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAf\">A factual defense may be based on the negligible effect of a claimant\u2019s exposure to the defendant\u2019s product, or on the negligible effect of the asbestos content of a defendant\u2019s product, or both. In such a case the degree of exposure to a non-party\u2019s product and the extent of the asbestos content of the non-party\u2019s product may be relevant to demonstrating the non-substantial nature of the exposure to, or of the asbestos content of, the defendant\u2019s product. But, a defendant would not ordinarily generate a jury issue on lack of ' substantial factor causation only by showing the dangerousness of a non-party\u2019s product to which the claimant was exposed. Ordinarily a defendant would have to follow up the evidence of exposure to the products of non-parties with evidence tending to prove that the defendant\u2019s product was not unreasonably dangerous or was not a substantial causal factor. Under these circumstances the proposition that the defendant\u2019s product is not a substantial cause may be made more probable by evidence tending to prove that the claimant\u2019s disease was caused by the products of one or more non-parties. <em>See, e.g., Becker v. Baron Bros., </em>138 N.J. 145, 649 A.2d 613 (1994) (whether processed ehrysotile in brake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>products posed a risk of causing mesothelioma in users was a sharply disputed issue of fact at trial, so that trial court erred in instructing as a matter of law that the products were defective without a warning).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 686 A.2d 250 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We point out that, at the time this jury instruction was given, Owens-Corning was still a defendant in this action. It was not until after jury instructions had been given and the jury began its deliberations that Owens-Corning settled with appellee. Therefore, at the time of the instruction, Owens-Corning was still a party, and, consequently, the instruction did not preclude the jury from considering the effects of any asbestos exposure caused by Owens-Corning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">To counter the possible effect on the jury of the technical application of this instruction, appellants could have re-visited this issue once Owens-Corning was no longer a party in this action. After the settlement, appellants may have been better served by requesting further instructions at that time. However, appellants\u2019 insouciance prevents us from addressing the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Therefore, we find that the trial judge properly instructed the jury that it should disregard any evidence relating to plaintiffs exposure to the asbestos-containing products of non-parties. Appellants have not demonstrated that any prejudice and error resulted from the trial judge\u2019s jury instructions. The instructions given to the jury adequately covered the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\n<em>Continuing Duty to Warn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Appellants\u2019 next contention is that the trial court should not have provided the standard jury instruction pertaining to a defendant\u2019s continuing duty to warn about a perishable consumer product. Appellants contend that the instruction does not apply in a situation where the product was used and discarded by the consumer. The jury instruction in question, in relevant part, provided: \u201cGenerally, a manufacturer or supplier of a defective product has the duty to warn of the product defects which they discover after the time of sale and must make reasonable efforts to issue a post-sale warning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Appellants concede that, as a general rule, \u201ca manufacturer of a defective product has a duty to warn of product defects which the manufacturer discovers after the time of sale.\u201d <em>See Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 446, 601 A.2d 633 (1992). However, appellants contend that in the present case this jury instruction was incorrect because \u201cno post-sale warning could have prevented the harm alleged to have been suffered by plaintiff. Unlike, for example, asbestos-containing pipe insulation, which stays in place for many years after installation, Kent cigarettes were used and discarded shortly after they had been purchased.\u201d Appellants further contend that \u201c[a] \u2018product recall\u2019 of asbestos-containing Kent cigarettes many years after Lorillard stopped manufacturing them would have been a futile gesture.\u201d In support of their position, they cite <em>Ierardi et al. v. Lorillard, Inc., </em>777 F.Supp. 420 (E.D.Pa.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Mass production and wide distribution may limit the response duty rather than defeat the duty\u2019s existence. When a manufacturer of a mass-produced, widely distributed product becomes aware that. there is a peril associated with the product, creating a risk of serious injury or death, the manufacturer may have a duty to take reasonable steps to notify users of that danger. It would be unreasonable to require such a manufacturer to track down every purchaser and user, but it may be appropriate, in certain cases, to require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>manufacturer to take reasonable steps under the circumstances to widely disseminate notice of the danger. What constitutes reasonable notice would be a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Appellants presented this contention to the trial judge; the judge nonetheless chose to instruct the jury pertaining to a continuing duty to warn. We will not disturb the trial judge\u2019s findings as to whether such efforts to warn, either by use of a product recall or other type of remedial measure, would have been futile. We observe that this \u201ccontinuing duty to warn\u201d instruction was not error, and, moreover, that it was certainly not prejudicial to appellants\u2019 case; the jury, irrespective of this instruction, found that appellants were liable to plaintiff, as their products were substantial causes of his mesothelioma. We find, therefore, that the trial judge properly instructed the jury that a manufacturer or supplier has a continuing duty to warn about a product defect discovered after the sale of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\n<em>State of the Art Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The trial court erred, appellants contend, by failing to provide a specific instruction on the jury verdict form, or as a curative instruction, that consideration of the state of the art is appropriate. Appellants assert that a determination as to whether there was insufficient knowledge of the manufacturer or of the scientific field in general would have been relevant in order to determine whether the Kent cigarettes, and more specifically the asbestos filters therein, were defective for legal purposes. Appellants contend that the jury should have been instructed as to the state of scientific and medical knowledge, as it existed at the time when plaintiff smoked the Kent cigarettes, regarding the hazards of asbestos exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The Court instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Under both the negligence and strict liability theories of liability, the manufacturer is held to the knowledge and skill of an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>A manufacturer\u2019s status as an expert means that, at a minimum, the manufacturer must keep abreast of the scientific knowledge, discoveries and advances and is presumed to know what is imparted thereby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">Industry standards and state of the art are not synonymous. State of the art includes all of the available knowledge on a subject at a given time. And this includes scientific, medical, engineering and other knowledge that may be available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">State of the art includes the element of time; what was known and when was this knowledge available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">You are instructed that evidence offered by any of the defendants to show that its conduct was reasonable in the light of prevailing industry standards and the scientific and medical knowledge at relevant points in time may be considered by you in determining whether a defendant was negligent or the product was defective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Appellee correctly points out that a state of the art instruction <em>was </em>given as part of the jury instructions and in accord with <em>ACandS, Inc. v. Asner, </em>344 Md. at 165-66, 686 A.2d 250 (quoting <em>Lohrmann v. Pittsburgh Corning Corp., </em>782 F.2d 1156, 1164 (4th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201cIndustry standards are the practices common to a given industry. They are often set forth in some type of code, such as a building code or electrical code, or they may be adopted by the trade organization of a given industry. State of the art is a higher standard because scientific knowledge expands much more rapidly than industry can assimilate the knowledge and adopt it as a standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">The role of state of the art evidence under Maryland law in strict liability, failure to warn cases was explained in <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 432-38, 601 A.2d 633, 638-641, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>325 Md. 665, 602 A.2d 1182 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>(1992). Acknowledging some division of opinion in the authorities, [the Maryland Court of Appeals] recognized in <em>Zenobia </em>that a majority of courts hold, expressly or implicitly, \u201cthat a manufacturer of a product, which is defective only because of the lack of an adequate warning, is not liable when the failure to warn resulted from an absence of knowledge of the dangerous quality of that product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 601 A.2d at 639. But, \u201cthe required knowledge can be established by evidence that the dangerous quality of the product should have been known by a manufacturer because it was known in the scientific or expert community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[E]vidence concerning the presence or <em>absence </em>of knowledge in the expert community is called \u2018state of the art\u2019 evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 601 A.2d at 640 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Testimony adduced at trial by appellee, although contested by appellants\u2019 testimony, demonstrated that it was known within the scientific community at the time the Kent cigarettes were being manufactured with the asbestos filters that exposure to asbestos could cause disease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury was free to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>assess the credibility of the testimony, and decide for itself which evidence to believe. <em>See Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. <em>578, </em>596, 671 A.2d 974 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We find that the trial judge did in fact instruct the jury regarding a state of the art defense, and such instruction adequately covered the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\n<em>Statutory Cap on Non-Economic Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Appellants assert that the trial court erred in its instruction to the jury regarding a statutory cap on non-economic damages. Appellants correctly argue that the jury instruction on this issue directly affected the amount of damages awarded. We agree with appellants\u2019 contention that this jury instruction was incorrect. The instruction in question, Jury Interrogatory 2, asked of the jury: Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the first cellular changes which lead [sic] to the existence of Charles M.P. Connor\u2019s mesothelioma began before July 1, 1986?\u201d Appellants had proposed that the trial court instead phrase the question in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">When did the cellular change caused by asbestos result in Charles Connor\u2019s mesothelioma? a) on or after July 1, 1986, b) before July 1, 1986, or c) we can not determine whether Mr. Connor\u2019s disease began before or after July 1, 1986.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUr\">The wording of the instruction is critical because of Maryland\u2019s Cap Statute, which provides that noneconomic damages \u201cmay not exceed $350,000\u201d in any personal injury action \u201cin which the cause of action arises on or after July 1, 1986....\u201d C.J. \u00a7 11-108(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The parties disagree as to what stage of appellee\u2019s illness is the critical point for determining whether noneconomic damages are subject to the cap statute. Appellants\u2019 position is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>that appellee\u2019s cause of action arose after July 1,1986, thereby imposing the applicability of the statute and effectively reducing the amount of noneconomic damages. Thus, appellants assert that appellee\u2019s cause of action arose only when he actually contracted mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Appellee, on the other hand, naturally wishes to convince this Court that his cause of action arose before that time, specifically, when the first cellular change took place within his body. Appellee urges that this cellular change gave rise to his cause of action, as this is when his body first changed as a result of his exposure to asbestos. Such interpretation would result in the injury predating the cap statute. Appellee\u2019s position, that his cause of action arose before July 1, 1986, would preclude the statute\u2019s applicability in this case. The jury instruction given by the trial court asked when there was evidence of the first cellular changes that led to the mesothelioma; this wording represented the interpretation posed by appellee, focusing on the onset of cellular change, rather than appellants\u2019 position, which focused on the onset of the actual mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">If appellee\u2019s interpretation is correct under the intent of the statute, then the jury instruction was indeed correct. The instruction is incorrect, however, if the intended point of time under the statute is actually the contraction of the disease. Consequently, the issue can be simply stated\u2014what stage within the temporal spectrum of appellee\u2019s disease is the determinative point under the cap statute? Identifying the time at which an asbestos-related injury came into existence is easier said than done. Due to the incipient nature of asbestos-related disease, experts and courts alike have had difficulty in pinpointing its onset. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In construing the cap statute, \u201cwe assume that the words of the statute are intended to have their natural, ordinary and generally understood meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 121, 604 A.2d 47 (1992); <em>Brodsky v. Brodsky, </em>319 Md. 92, 98, 570 A.2d 1235 (1990); <em>see also Edmonds v. Cytology Services of Maryland, Inc., et al., </em>111 Md.App. 233, 681 A.2d 546 (1996). According to <em>Webster\u2019s New World </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>(2d ed.) the word \u201carise\u201d means \u201cto come into being; originate.\u201d Giving the word its ordinary meaning, we believe that a cause of action arises when it first comes into existence. <em>Armstrong, </em>326 Md. at 121, 604 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">A cause of action in negligence or strict liability arises when facts exist to support each element. <em>Id. </em>In a negligence cause of action, the fact of injury would seemingly be the last element to come into existence. The breach, duty, and causation elements logically precede the fact of injury. Likewise, in a strict liability claim, the existence of the defective product and the causal connection will precede the resultant injury. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, appellee\u2019s non-economic damages would have to be reduced under \u00a7 11-108 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article if his \u201cinjury\u201d came into existence on or after July 1, 1986. We have pointed out that, according to \u00a7 388 and \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u201charm\u201d is one of the necessary elements of a cause of action in both negligence and strict liability. The Restatement, in \u00a7 7(2), defines \u201cthe word \u2018harm\u2019 as used throughout the Restatement ... to denote the existence of loss or detriment in fact of any kind to a person resulting from a cause.\u201d <em>Owens Corning v. Bauman, </em>125 Md.App. 454, 477, 726 A.2d 745 (1999). Comment b to \u00a7 7 further explains that \u201c \u2018harm\u2019 implies a loss or detriment to a person, and not a mere change or alteration in some physical person, object or thing....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Anchor Packing Co. v.

Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 713 A.2d 962 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Appellants cite this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bauman </em>to support their contention that the jury\u2019s award of noneconomic damages must be reduced. In that case, we remanded to the circuit court for the submission of the issue of when appellee\u2019s mesothelioma \u201carose\u201d for purposes of determining the applicability of the statutory cap, pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 11-108. Judge Davis, speaking for this Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">The unique facts of this case compel us to conclude that the ends of justice can only be served by granting appellant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>opportunity to submit the issue of the statutory cap to a jury, particularly in view of the court\u2019s advisement that it would consider the cap issue on appellant\u2019s post-trial motion. On remand, the circuit court should submit to a newly empaneled jury only the limited issue of when mesothelioma arose in appellee. Should the jury determine that the disease arose before July 1, 1986, the statutory cap would not be applicable and the noneconomic damage award of the original jury would stand. A jury decision that appellee\u2019s mesothelioma arose on or after July 1, 1986, on the other hand, would require the circuit court to apply the $350,000 cap on the noneconomic damage award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">125 Md.App. at 522, 726 A.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As part of our discussion in <em>Bauman, </em>and before we had declared our holding, we had clarified this point by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">In sum, mere exposure, without cellular change, does not constitute an injury or harm for which one may maintain a cause of action. Furthermore, cellular change without accompanying injury does not constitute harm or functional impairment that would give rise to a cause of action. For purposes of the statutory cap, the crucial distinction is whether a plaintiffs cellular change develops into an asbestos-related disease or simply into an asbestos-related condition. When cellular change later results in an asbestos-related disease, the harm was irreversible from the time of contraction, and the \u201cinjury\u201d as well as the cause of action arose when the disease came into existence. Consequently, the presence or absence of symptomatology is irrelevant for purposes of the statutory cap, because the cause of action arose when the disease was contracted. On the other hand, when a plaintiff becomes afflicted with an asbestos-related condition, such as pleural plaques, it is not until symptomatology is present that any functional impairment occurs. Therefore, when a plaintiff develops an asbestos-related condition, the statutory cap only is triggered upon the presence of symptoms, because there is no harm! until the symptoms arise. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>developed an asbestos-related disease and the irreversible harm arose when the disease came into existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 482-83, 726 A.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Appellee incorrectly asserts that the <em>Bauman </em>Court concluded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">When a plaintiff actually contracts an asbestos-related disease, the legally compensable harm may be retraced to the first moment of cellular change; however, when a plaintiff contracts the condition of pleural plaques, the legally compensable harm only arises with the onset of a symptom. Therefore, the standard for determining harm is uniform, but an \u201cinjury\u201d does not arise until symptoms are manifested while the harm for a fatal and irreversible \u201cdisease\u201d arises as soon as the cellular change develops. Our recent decisions in <em>Ford [Motor Co. v. Wood, </em>119 Md.App. 1, 703 A.2d 1315] and <em>[ACandS, Inc. v.] Abate[, </em>121 Md.App. 590, 710 A.2d 944] have followed the <em>Grimshaw </em>standard and, accordingly, Maryland law is clear as to when an asbestos-related injury becomes a legally compensable harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">125 Md.App. at 482, 726 A.2d 745. Appellee errs in his interpretation of <em>Bauman, </em>as we have already set forth our conclusion in the <em>Bauman </em>case. Our conclusion in <em>Bauman </em>clearly stands for the interpretation posed by appellants. Moreover, in that they contradict our holding in that case, we reject and disregard the two paragraphs quoted from <em>Bauman </em>by appellee. This language represents inaccurate statements of the law on this point, and leads to further obfuscation on this topic. We reject appellee\u2019s other quote taken from Bauman, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">A person diagnosed with mesothelioma has suffered a real and immediate injury which was inflicted when the cancer cells first began growing in his body-even though the person was not aware of that injury until the cancer was diagnosed. By contrast, a person who is merely diagnosed with pleural plaques has no present loss, detriment, impairment or injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>This quoted language was actually taken from a footnote in the <em>Grimshaw </em>case. The statement it footnoted was: \u201cAlthough pleural plaques are merely changes in the body that only become \u2018injury\u2019 if symptoms develop, <em>mesothelioma and asbestosis are diseases that constitute compensable harm upon contraction.\u201d </em>125 Md.App. at 479, 726 A.2d 745. (Emphasis added.) We regret that the footnote quoted by appellee, intended to clarify the discussion, actually caused additional confusion, as is evident by appellee\u2019s reliance on it. We will not, however, raise a mere footnote to a loftier stature than the actual statement that it attempts to clarify. We observe that the original statement, \u201c[although pleural plaques are merely changes in the body that only become \u2018injury\u2019 if symptoms develop, mesothelioma and asbestosis are diseases that constitute compensable harm upon contraction,\u201d is an accurate statement of our position, and that this statement completely explains the distinction we are dealing with in this case. To the extent that it unsettles the issue before us and clearly is a misrepresentation of the law on this subject, we unequivocally reject that particular language used in footnote 7 in <em>Grimshaw.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Appellee has quoted language from <em>Grimshaw, </em>and that case remains sound law, but for the language we have now rejected. In fact, the standard enunciated in <em>Grimshaw, </em>which is controlling in Maryland, is that \u201charm results when the cellular changes <em>develop into an injury or disease.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Grimshaw, </em>115 Md.App. at 160, 692 A.2d 5; <em>see ACandS, Inc. v. Abate, </em>121 Md.App. 590, 710 A.2d 944, <em>cert. denied, </em>350 Md. 487, 713 A.2d 979 (1998); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Wood, </em>119 Md.App. 1, 703 A.2d 1315 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We reject appellee\u2019s contention regarding the point in time to be used for cap statute purposes when dealing with noneconomic damages for mesothelioma and accept appellants\u2019 position on this issue. Consequently, the trial court erred in its jury instruction: the critical point in time that was posed to the jury should not have been whether appellee had experienced <em>cellular change </em>before July 1,1986; the question should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>have instead pertained to whether appellee had <em>contracted mesothelioma </em>before July 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Ill Dr. Dement\u2019s expert testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Appellants contend that the trial court, by allowing Dr. Dement to testify concerning the work of Dr. Longo, improperly allowed the introduction of inadmissible hearsay. Appellants further contend that the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Dement to testify outside of his area of expertise based on this allegedly inadmissible hearsay. A motion <em>in limine </em>was filed raising the issue of whether the report by Dr. Longo was of the type relied upon by experts in a particular field so as to be admissible under Maryland Rule o-703(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the hearing on this motion, the following occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The Court: The next is Lorillard\u2019s motion to exclude Dr. William Longo\u2019s testimony and evidence experiments conducted by MAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Mr. Geary [Counsel for Lorillard]: We would adopt appropriate Maryland law and run with it. Your Honor I think what we would suggest on that issue, Your Honor, as we approach the day when Dr. Longo is going to testify, which I think is several weeks off, we might discuss that issue, but I don\u2019t think we will approach the issue at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The Court: <em>You are withdrawing your motion then?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Mr. Geary: Your Honor, that is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">It is thus clear that appellants had withdrawn their motion <em>in limine. </em>Before Dr. Dement actually began to testify, Lorillard preserved this issue for appeal, as it had requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>and was granted a continuing objection to any reference to Dr. Longo\u2019s work. H &amp; V did not ask for a continuing objection, and did not join in on Lorillard\u2019s continuing objection. H &amp; V\u2019s failure to preserve this contention is irrelevant, however, as we have already ruled that its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction should have been granted. The continuing objection by Lorillard was granted after Mr. Geary (counsel for Lorillard) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">[W]e have some criticisms of what [Dr. Longo] did. Without him being here, we won\u2019t be able to cross-examine him, but we understand other witnesses, including Dr. Dement today, will talk about the work of Dr. Longo, what sort of materials have been provided to him. And our objection, Your Honor, is that that would be pure hearsay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Continuing objections have only recently become a recognized part of Maryland trial practice. Rule 2-517(b) provides that, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, the court may grant a continuing objection to a line of questions by an opposing party. For purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal, the continuing objection is effective only as to questions clearly within its scope. <em>Schreiber v. Cherry Hill Construction Co., Inc., </em>105 Md.App. 462, 482, 660 A.2d 970, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 500, 667 A.2d 341 (1995). We find that the! continuing objection in this instance was specific and that the testimony being objected to was within the scope of this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Dr. Dement was properly offered as an expert, at which time the trial judge asked appellants\u2019 counsel whether they wished to cross-examine the doctor regarding his qualifications. Appellants declined to do so. Dr. Dement testified as to several matters before he was questioned about Dr. Longo\u2019s publication. That particular questioning transpired as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AXk\">Q: I want to ask you a little bit about Kent cigarettes. Can you tell us, Doctor, whether or not you are familiar with the fact that, during the period of time from 1952 to 1956, Kent cigarettes were made with a micronite filter?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>A: I am certainly familiar with that from some published reports, yes</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Q: What is your familiarity, Doctor?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">A: Well, I\u2019m familiar with the publications, first of all, that looked at workers in the factory that actually made the filter, some epidemiology studies. And there is also a study by Dr. Longo published in the literature that reviewed that circumstance and also release of fibers as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Q: You have reviewed the Dr. Longo study?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">A: I have.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Q: And the jury has heard testimony about Kent cigarette makers\u2019 attempts to reduce or eliminate mineral fiber exposure from the cigarette smoke. What does Dr. Longo\u2019s study tell us in that regard?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">A: Well, Dr. Longo\u2019s studies demonstrated that these filters, these cigarette filters were\u2014released fibers in its experimental circumstances, so they certainly released fibers that would be in the smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Q: It seems to make common sense to me, but I will ask the question anyway. If the cigarette fibers are releasing fibers in the smoke, where are those fibers going?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Mr. Geary: Your honor, I object. It is argumentative.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The Court: I will strike the portion regarding common sense. The balance is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">A: Of course, smoke is designed to be inhaled. And if it comes in the smoke, it is going to be inhaled.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Q: Doctor, is the inhalation of crocidolite fibers a hazard to the health of human beings?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">A: In my opinion, yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">Q: And what do you base that on?</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">A: The epidemiology, published information.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">Q: In that scenario where the human being is inhaling the fibers directly from the cigarette filter, is there any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>safe level of asbestos that that individual can inhale, crocidolite asbestos, in your opinion, Doctor?</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">A: No. There is no\u2014again, there is no established threshold below which there is no risk of disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Appellee argues that, even if Dr. Dement\u2019s testimony was erroneously admitted over proper objections, the jury\u2019s verdict should be affirmed because it was effectively cumulative and, therefore, harmless error, as other evidence admitted at trial produced the same results. As examples, appellee cites to the testimonies by Dr. Brody and Dr. Rubin, as well as the study by the Fullam Laboratory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is, of course, true that the erroneous admission of evidence will not justify reversal unless the complaining party can show that the admission was prejudicial. <em>Kapiloff v. Locke, </em>276 Md. 466, 472, 348 A.2d 697 (1975); <em>William F. Klingensmith, Inc. v. David H. Snell Landscape Contractor, Inc., </em>265 Md. 654, 662, 291 A.2d 56 (1972); <em>McKay v. Paulson, </em>211 Md. 90, 126 A.2d 296 (1956). However, it is also clear that this Court will not hesitate to reverse when hearsay evidence is erroneously admitted and prejudice is shown. <em>Kapiloff, </em>276 Md. at 472, 348 A.2d 697. The burden of proving prejudice in a civil case is on the complaining party, here, the appellants. <em>Klingensmith, </em>265 Md. at 662, 291 A.2d 56; <em>M.A. Realty v. State Roads, </em>247 Md. 522, 527, 233 A.2d 793 (1967); <em>State Roads Comm. v. Kuenne, </em>240 Md. 232, 235, 213 A.2d 567 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In the present case, we do not believe that appellants have met their burden of proving prejudice. Appellee has shown that the admission of Dr. Dement\u2019s testimony was in fact harmless error, and does not constitute grounds for reversal. We need only look to testimony by Dr. Rubin on the subject to arrive at this conclusion. The relevant portion of Dr. Rubin\u2019s testimony adduced:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Q: ... do you have an opinion to a reasonable medical certainty as to whether or not Mr. Connor\u2019s exposure to Kent cigarettes was a substantial contributing factor in his developing of mesothelioma?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">A: Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Q: And what is your opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">A: My opinion is that it was a substantial contributing factor to his development of mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Q: What is the basis of that, Doctor?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">A: The basis is that this\u2014first of all, we know that crocidolite is a potent carcinogen, as we have talked earlier, the most potent or among the most potent of the asbestos fibers in producing cancer. This was asbestos that was put up directly against his respiratory tract that he was breathing through. And I think it is highly likely, given that information that there were asbestos fibers that were released from these filters that were respirable, that were deposited into his respiratory tract and, therefore, contributed to the asbestos burden in his lung that ultimately led to his development of mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Thus, although the trial judge may have erroneously admitted Dr. Dement\u2019s testimony, this was harmless error, as there was other testimony that used similar language and produced similar results.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">IV Sufficiency of Evidence relating to Kent filters</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Appellants filed Motions for Judgment and/or for New Trial on two grounds involving the Kent filters. First, appellants contend that appellee did not produce sufficient evidence that Kent cigarettes actually caused his disease, as there was doubt raised by appellants as to whether he smoked the cigarettes at a time when the asbestos filters were being used. Second, appellants contend that, assuming he did actually smoke the cigarettes with the asbestos filters, appellee nonetheless failed to introduce evidence that the Kent filter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>released asbestos in amounts sufficient to cause his mesothelioma.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">There was testimony adduced at trial that supported appellee\u2019s contention that Kent cigarettes caused his disease, and that he smoked Kent cigarettes at a time when they contained asbestos filters. That matter is beyond review. The jury had an opportunity to assess appellee\u2019s credibility, as well as the credibility of his witnesses. Appellants had an opportunity at trial to question appellee and his witnesses-regarding these claims. Whether testimony at trial was credible goes to the weight of the evidence, rather than its sufficiency. <em>See Binnie v. State, </em>821 Md. 572, 580, 583 A.2d 1037 (1991). Weighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder. <em>Id.; McKinney v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 111, 117, 570 A.2d 360, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 222, 577 A.2d 50 (1990). In performing this role, the fact-finder has the discretion to decide which evidence to credit and which to reject. <em>See Velez v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 194, 202, 664 A.2d 387 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 173, 669 A.2d 1361 (1996) (\u2018\u201c[I]t is the exclusive function of the jury to draw reasonable inferences from proven facts.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>McMillian, </em>325 Md. at 290, 600 A.2d 430 (1992)). In this regard, it may believe part of a particular witness\u2019s testimony but disbelieve other parts. <em>See Pugh v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 624, 651, 654 A.2d 888, <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 355, 663 A.2d 73 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony. <em>See Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 654, 498 A.2d 666 (1985), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>308 Md. 208, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986). The trial court did not err in denying appellants\u2019 motion for judgment and/or new trial due to insufficient evidence produced by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Y Motion to Revise or Reopen Judgment/Exhumation of Body</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to reopen and revise the judgment and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>dismiss appellee\u2019s claims based on the refusal by appellee\u2019s family and counsel to preserve appellee\u2019s lung tissue as requested by appellants. Appellants argue that availability of the lung tissue would have presented appellants with an opportunity to analyze the fiber burden of the tissue in order to determine causation of the mesothelioma. Appellants further contend that the trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 alternative request for an order to exhume plaintiffs body so that the lung tissue could be obtained and tested. Appellants accuse appellee of deliberate spoliation of the evidence resulting from the burial of plaintiffs body without the removal and testing of plaintiff\u2019s lung tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Court orders denying motions are reviewed on an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Cooper v. Sacco et al., </em>357 Md. 622, 745 A.2d 1074 (2000). Appellants have failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Appellants have presented not the slightest suspicion of a deliberate spoliation of evidence; appellants astoundingly compare the burial of a loved one to the destruction of documents. In <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 728 A.2d 727 (1999), this Court identified the elements that must be established in order to demonstrate that there has been a destruction of evidence. The <em>Klupt </em>Court reiterated a recent decision of the United States District Court for Maryland, which clearly laid out the consensus rules for sanctioning destruction of evidence. <em>See White v. Office of the Public Defender, </em>170 F.R.D. 138, 147-48 (D.Md.1997). The <em>White </em>Court identified four elements generally regarded as being prerequisite to a court\u2019s imposition of spoliation sanctions: (1) An act of destruction; (2) Discoverability of the evidence; (3) An intent to destroy the evidence; and (4) Occurrence of the act at a time after suit has been filed, or, if before, at a time when the filing is fairly perceived as imminent. <em>Id. </em>at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Appellee\u2019s family, in their efforts to respect the rights of the deceased, vestigial though they be, understanding^ shrunk back from appellants\u2019 requests to exhume and disfigure the deceased plaintiff\u2019s body. We concede that many dollars are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>contingent upon the outcome of this case; nonetheless, we do not place cash before conscience. Appellants were certainly aware of the lethal nature of mesothelioma, and could have taken the procedural steps necessary, earlier in this action, in order to obtain or preserve the evidence they desired without having to ask for the exhumation of the body. They elected not to go through discovery procedures to request a biopsy or for the preservation of the lung tissue. We find it unconscionable that appellants now denounce appellee\u2019s next of kin and counsel for \u201cdeliberate spoliation of evidence,\u201d simply because they arranged for their loved-one\u2019s burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Although plaintiffs body had obvious evidentiary value in this case, we perceive no \u201cdeliberate spoliation of evidence.\u201d The deceased\u2019s family properly disposed of the body as would be expected in the circumstances. We affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding the denial of appellants\u2019 motions to review or reopen judgment and to dismiss, or, in the alternative, for exhumation of the plaintiffs body.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">VI Settlement Credits under Tortfeasor Act</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying them credit pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act, Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), C.J. \u00a7 3-1404. This contention is based on the fact that appellee entered into settlements with several of the original \u201coccupational defendants.\u201d The Uniform Act, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides, but it reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The Act defines \u201cjoint tort-feasors\u201d as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally hable in tort for the same injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-1401. The purpose of the Act is to prevent double recovery. The amount recoverable from the non-settling defendant when added to the amount recoverable from the settling defendant cannot exceed the plaintiffs verdict. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 126, 604 A.2d 47 (1992); <em>see Martinez v. Lopez, </em>300 Md. 91, 476 A.2d 197 (1984). The drafters intended this Act to deal with the common liability of two or more joint tortfeasors and not with the unique liability of an individual wrongdoer. <em>Armstrong, </em>326 Md. at 127, 604 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">At common law, a plaintiff who settled a claim with one joint tortfeasor would lose his right to sue other joint tortfeasors on the same claim. <em>See Loh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>47 Md.App. 110, 117, 422 A.2d 16 (1980). To avoid this stringent result, a number of states, including Maryland, enacted the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort-Feasors Act in order to encourage settlements by allowing a plaintiff to maintain his claim against a non-settling joint tortfeasor when he settles with another joint tortfeasor and signs a release. <em>See id. </em>at 117-18, 422 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Appellants, in an effort to have the judgments against them reduced pursuant to the settlement amounts paid by the settling defendants, claim that the settling defendants should be considered joint tortfeasors. Their contention is based on the premise that the settling defendants\u2019 alleged negligence should be used in determining tortfeasor status for purposes of making the adjustment under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">As the Court of Appeals recognized, \u201c[t]he [A]ct does not specify the test of liability. Clearly, something short of an actual judgment will suffice.\u201d <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619, 133 A.2d 428 (1957). The fact, however, that a party has been sued or threatened with suit is not enough to establish joint tortfeasor status. <em>Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 374-75, 749 A.2d 174 (2000). <em>See Owens-Corning Fiberglas, Corp. v. Garrett, </em>343 Md. 500, 531-32, 682 A.2d 1143 (1996). Tortfeasor status, in the absence of adjudication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>generally rests on admission by the purported tortfeasor of such status. Thus, a party will be considered a joint tortfeasor when it admits joint tortfeasor status in a settlement agreement, <em>see Martinez, </em>300 Md. at 94-95, 476 A.2d 197, or if a default judgment has been entered against a party. <em>See Porter Hayden Co. v. Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 473-74, 713 A.2d 962 (1998) (because a default judgment is considered an admission of liability, it is sufficient to establish joint tortfeasor status). One will not be considered a joint tortfeasor, however, merely because he or she enters a settlement and pays money. <em>See Garrett, </em>343 Md. at 532, 682 A.2d 1143. When the settling parties specify in the release that the settling party shall not be considered a joint tortfeasor, monies paid on account of such settlement will be considered merely volunteer payments; a non-settling defendant judicially determined to be liable will not be entitled to a reduction of the damages awarded against it on account of the consideration paid by the settling party. <em>See id. </em>at 531-33, 682 A.2d 1143; <em>Collier v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., </em>86 Md.App. 38, 57, 585 A.2d 256, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 33, 591 A.2d 249 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">There was no adjudication regarding the liability of the settling defendants, and appellants have not provided this Court with evidence regarding any admission by those settling defendants. The settlement agreement, in the absence of an actual admission by those parties, is dispositive of this issue. As the record now before us lacks the information necessary for this determination, we remand this issue to the circuit court in order to review the settlement agreements between appellee and the settling defendants. Such review shall take place solely to determine whether those agreements specify a joint tortfeasor status between the defendants, or, in the alternative, whether they contain admissions of such or of general liability by the settling defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANTS AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\">. To reiterate, the jury instruction prohibited consideration of evidence relating to appellee\u2019s exposure to the asbestos-containing products of <em>non-parties. </em>While the jury was deliberating, appellants\u2019 counsel discovered that Owens-Corning had settled with appellee. Immediately thereafter, the jury was called back to the courtroom. The judge instructed the jurors to cross off every reference to Owens-Corning on their verdict sheet, because \u2018\u2018[tlhey are no longer a party in this proceeding, so you do not consider them.\u201d After this instruction, the jurors were told to go back and continue their deliberations. At no time after this did either appellant request additional jury instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">. There was testimony presented both agreeing and disagreeing that this relationship was known within the scientific community at that time. Among others, Dr. Dement testified that this relationship was known at the time:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Q: Doctor, let me ask you this question. When was it established that asbestos could cause disease and harm in human beings? When was that established in the United States?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">A: Well, certainly the fact of causing harm in the case reports were before 1924, but the date when I would say minimally that there was a causal relationship, not just an observation of disease and population, interesting finding, but one that the exposures cause the disease was by 1924. You can argue about dates, but by 1938, we had large-scale studies in the U.S. that were documenting asbestosis, again, in the asbestos textile industries by chest x-rays and measures of exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">So most researchers will say between '49 to '55 period is when you could say, with confidence, that there was a causal relationship, if you will, between lung cancer and exposure to asbestos. That is, it is not just objectionable cases, but there is a causal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">Q: Doctor, was there an editorial that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association in the late 1940s that spoke on this issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>A: It did. There was an editorial that reviewed, again, these studies that I referred to. And the editorial concluded that there were\u2014 there appeared to be a causal relationship between exposure to asbestos and cancer of the lung. That, again, was published in the U.S. in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. In his Motion To Strike Arguments First Raised in Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief, appellee asks this Court to strike certain portions of the Reply Brief of appellant Lorillard that present a new contention not raised in initial briefs. In its reply brief, Lorillard asserted that expert testimony by Dr. Gabrielson was speculative and not probative on the issue of the inception of appellee\u2019s disease, and that the testimony was \"insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>as a matter of law to carry plaintiff's burden on the Cap Statute's application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We will not rule on the merit of Lorillard's contention because, as appellee correctly states, the issue of the sufficiency of expert testimony regarding the cap statute was not raised in either of appellants\u2019 initial briefs. In <em>Federal Land Bank of Baltimore, Inc. v. Esham, </em>43 Md.App. 446, 459, 406 A.2d 928, 937 (1979), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">The function of a reply brief is limited. The appellant has the opportunity and duty to use the opening salvo of his original brief to state and argue clearly each point of his appeal. We think that the reply brief must be limited to responding to the points and issues raised in the appellee\u2019s brief. This is the uniform view of other courts which have considered the issue. <em>See, e. g., Molnar v. City of Aurora, </em>38 Ill.App.3d 580, 348 N.E.2d 262, 264 (1976) (\"The reply brief, if any, shall be strictly confined to replying to arguments presented in the brief of appellee....\"). <em>See also St. Regis Paper Co. v. Hill, </em>198 So.2d 365 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1967); <em>Wolfswinkel v. Gesink, </em>180 N.W.2d 452 (Iowa 1970); <em>Horicon v. Langlois\u2019 Estate, </em>115 Vt. 470, 66 A.2d 16 (1949); <em>Mead School Dist. No. 354 v. Mead Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>85 Wash.2d 278, 534 P.2d 561 (En banc 1975). To allow new issues or claims to be injected into the appeal by a reply brief would work a fundamental injustice upon the appellee, who would then have no opportunity to i'espond in writing to the new questions raised by the appellant. Due process requires that all parties have an opportunity to reply to new issues asserted against them, as the California Supreme Court has recognized in a similar context: \u201cObvious reasons of fairness militate against consideration of an issue raised initially in the reply brief of an appellant.\u201d <em>Varjabedian v. City of Madera, </em>20 Cal.3d 285, 295 n. 11, 142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 436 n. 11, 572 P.2d 43, 50 n. 11 (1977). <em>See also Ryall v. Waterworks Improvement Dist. No. 3, </em>247 Ark. 739, 447 S.W.2d 341 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\"The reply brief must do what it purports to do: it must respond to the points raised in the appellee's brief which, in turn, are addressed to the issues originally raised by the appellant.\u201d <em>Esham, </em>43 Md.App. at 459, 406 A.2d 928. We shall therefore grant appellee\u2019s motion to strike certain portions of Lorillard\u2019s Reply Brief. The specific portion mentioned, namely, the sufficiency of Dr. Gabrielson\u2019s expert testimony, will not be considered, and Lorillard shall be confined in its appeal to the issues raised in appellants' initial briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b153-13\">.
