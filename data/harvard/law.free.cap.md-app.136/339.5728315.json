(\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7 9-503 (1999 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supp.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The presumption is rebuttable, but neither the statute nor Maryland precedent spells out what type of testimony can be presented by the employer to rebut the presumption. More specifically, Maryland case law leaves it unclear whether an expert\u2019s testimony should be excluded if one of the grounds for the expert\u2019s opinion is that there is no scientific basis to support the view (impliedly embraced by the General Assembly) that there is sometimes a link between the high level :of stress associated with certain occupations (fire fighter, police officer, etc.) and the development of heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial judge ruled that the videotaped deposition of the employer\u2019s expert, a cardiologist, was inadmissible because one of the grounds for his opinion that the claimant\u2019s heart disease was not related to his occupation was the expert\u2019s belief that there is no link between stress and heart disease. That ruling left the employer with no evidence to rebut the presumption set forth in section 9-503(b) and left the trial court with no choice but to grant summary judgment in favor of the police officer. On appeal, appellants (the City of Frederick/insurer) raise several questions, which we have rephrased and condensed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">1. Did the circuit court err when it. struck the expert testimony of Alan G. Wasserman, M.D., on the grounds that one of the reasons for Dr. Wasserman\u2019s opinion that Officer Shankle did not suffer from an occupational disease was his belief that there was no link between occupational stress and heart disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>2. Is an expert cardiologist required to accept that occupational stress causes coronary artery disease in order to testify, even when he testified that \u201cit is not accepted in the medical community that stress causes coronary artery disease or [is] a risk factor for it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">3. Is it possible for any employer to ever rebut the presumption in LE \u00a7 9\u2014503(b)(1), if experts are not allowed to express their opinions that a claimant\u2019s coronary artery disease is unrelated to his occupation, in part because they believe occupational stress does not cause coronary artery disease?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">I. <em>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXe\">A. <em>General Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Donald Shankle joined the Frederick City (\u201cthe City\u201d) police force in 1975. Approximately twenty years later, when he was forty-five years of age, he was admitted to Washington Hospital Center where he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. He returned to his job in late December of 1995 and worked for seven weeks, but then stopped working because his heart disease prevented him from performing his police duties. In May of 1996, Officer Shankle underwent bypass surgery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Officer Shankle filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) in 1996. He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his coronary artery disease constituted an \u201coccupational disease\u201d that arose out of his employment as a City police officer. The City and its insurer opposed the claim and maintained that Officer Shankle\u2019s heart problem was not work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">On October 31, 1997, the Commission ruled that the claimant\u2019s coronary artery disease was work-related. It awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Officer Shankle legal fees, medical benefits, and compensation for temporary total disability for a period of approximately eleven months. The City and its insurer filed a timely petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Frederick County and prayed for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In preparation for trial, counsel for Officer Shankle took a discovery deposition of the employer/insurer\u2019s expert-Dr. Alan Wasserman. Later, a video deposition of Dr. Wasserman was taken for use at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">B. <em>Video Deposition Testimony of Alan Wasserman, M.D.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Dr. Alan Wasserman, at all times here pertinent, was: (1) Chief of Medicine at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., (2) board certified in both medicine and cardiology,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) a professor of cardiology at George Washington University Medical School. Additionally, he has served as Chief of Cardiology at George Washington University. Over the years, Dr. Wasserman has had extensive experience in conducting medical research and has received \u201cmultiple\u201d research grants. As a researcher, one of his major interests has been the detection, treatment, and prevention of heart disease. He has published approximately one hundred articles in various medical journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Dr. Wasserman reviewed Officer Shankle\u2019s medical records with the goal of discovering the cause of his coronary artery disease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Dr. Wasserman, the six major risk factors <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for coronary artery disease are male gender, family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>history of a parent or sibling with diagnosed coronary artery disease by age sixty or below, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">1. Claimant\u2019s Medical Records</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">A review of claimant\u2019s medical records revealed that at age sixty Officer Shankle\u2019s father died suddenly. Although no autopsy was performed, Officer Shankle was told that his father died of a heart attack (myocardial infarction).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Prior to Officer Shankle\u2019s leaving the police force he had smoked at least a pack of cigarettes a day for \u201cmany years.\u201d He started smoking at age 15, but his consumption greatly increased after he became a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Before the onset of Officer Shankle\u2019s disability, he had a \u201cvery high [blood] cholesterol level.\u201d His low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol was \u201cvery elevated,\u201d and his high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol was \u201cvery low.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">2. Dr. Wasserman\u2019s Opinion as Expressed on Direct Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">In Dr. Wasserman\u2019s opinion, Officer Shankle developed coronary artery disease because he had four of the six major risk factors, i.e., he was male, \u201che had a horrendously abnormal cholesterol level, he smokes, and had a family history\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>heart disease. The claimant\u2019s \u201coccupation was a nonfactor for when he developed [coronary artery disease] or if he developed it.\u201d Dr. Wasserman also expressed the view that, given the presence of four of the major risk factors, the claimant would have developed coronary artery disease if he had been a \u201clawyer, doctor, teacher, or [was engaged in] any other occupation.\u201d The witness admitted that sudden stress (such as stress that might be encountered as a policeman) could precipitate a heart attack-but, in his opinion, would not cause the underlying coronary disease process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Dr. Wasserman was asked whether he agreed with the medical opinion expressed by claimant\u2019s expert, i.e., that occupational stress was one of the causes of Officer Shankle\u2019s coronary artery disease. He said that he did not and explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">There is no body of literature that is accepted in the cardiac field that says that stress is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. If one wants to search hard enough, one can find evidence in the literature for anything anybody wants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">. You can find evidence that snake oil can prevent diabetes. You can find evidence that chelation therapy can prevent coronary artery disease. There are tons of garbage jour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>nals that publish garbage that are not peer reviewed, as we discussed before. So there are opinions in the literature. It does not mean that it\u2019s correct or gospel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">I can tell you from 20 years of experience and from teaching preventive medicine and preventive cardiology that it is not accepted in the medical community that stress causes coronary artery disease or is a risk factor for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">3. Cross-Examination of Dr. Wasserman</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A significant portion of the cross-examination of Dr. Wasserman by claimant\u2019s counsel was devoted to questions concerning the presumptions set forth in LE section 9-503. In this regard, Dr. Wasserman stressed that he had never read the statute and did not believe he was competent to interpret it. Nevertheless, he was shown a copy of section 9-503 as well as excerpts from two Maryland appellate decisions that discussed that statute. Over objection, Dr. Wasserman was questioned as to whether he agreed or disagreed with the scientific premise underlying section 9-503, i.e., that the stress brought about by employment as a police officer (or a firefighter) sometimes caused coronary artery disease. Dr. Wasserman answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">I still today believe and I believe the medical literature and the entire medical community supports this, that there is no reason to believe that being a policeman or fireman contributes anything to developing coronary artery disease.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">He was next asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">If I would ask you to assume that the purpose and the premise behind this statute that we have discussed is that the unusual stress or occupation of a police officer or fire fighter contributes to the development of coronary artery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>disease, not asking about the statute, but is it my understanding that you disagree with that premise?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Dr. Wasserman answered, \u201cI disagree with the premise.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">C. <em>Claimant\u2019s Motion to Exclude Dr. Wasserman\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On the morning that Officer Shankle\u2019s compensation case was to be heard by a jury, claimant\u2019s counsel filed a written motion <em>in limine </em>to prohibit the jury from considering any part of Dr. Wasserman\u2019s videotaped deposition. Claimant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">Dr. Wasserman expressly rejects the legislature of the State of Maryland\u2019s statutory presumption of compensability for firefighters and police officers who develop hypertension [sic]. Dr. Wasserman has, in fact, stated that in his opinion, medicine does not recognize stress as a factor in the development of heart disease. Therefore, according to Dr. Wasserman, Mr. Shankle\u2019s job did not, and could not, contribute to his heart disease. In other words, Dr. Wasserman seeks to repeal the legislation which has been in force in Maryland for decades.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Officer Shankle\u2019s counsel went on to argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">[A]n expert\u2019s opinion, where legally mistaken or based on an erroneous concept of law, is devoid of competency.... Clearly, Dr. Wasserman\u2019s opinion in this case, which is clearly contrary to the express provisions of the Maryland worker\u2019s compensation statute, is based on the erroneous concept of the law and is legally mistaken. Thus, his opinion must be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">D. <em>Hearing on the Motion to Strike Dr. Wasserman\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">In his oral opposition to the motion to strike, counsel for the employer/insurer stressed that he had objected when claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ant\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Wasserman whether he agreed with the premise underlying section 9-503. Defense counsel maintained that answers to such questions should be stricken as irrelevant. He did not, however, contend that Dr. Wasserman\u2019s explanation as to why he disagreed with plaintiffs expert should be stricken. Instead, defense counsel contended that Dr. Wasserman was competent to give his opinion as to the cause of Officer Shankle\u2019s coronary artery disease\u2014 even though one of the bases for his opinion was his belief that there was no link between the stress of being a police officer and the development of coronary artery disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">E. <em>The Trial Judge\u2019s Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The trial court, relying on <em>Franch v. Ankney, </em>341 Md. 350, 670 A.2d 951 (1996), and other cases cited by claimant in his motion, struck Dr. Wasserman\u2019s video-taped deposition testimony in its entirety. The court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">I do note, and I know [counsel for the employer/insurer] didn\u2019t indicate otherwise, that the authority from the other states that specifically decided this issue, do not allow an expert to testify, basically that they disagree with one of the presumptions of the statute, so the authority is in accord with <em>Franch, </em>that says, no, that is not admissible. I think based on <em>[Montgomery County v. Pirrone, </em>109 Md.App. 201, 674 A.2d 98 (1996) ], based on <em>Franch, </em>I do find that the claimant\u2019s motion is proper, and I am going to grant the motion <em>in limine.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">II. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\n<em>The Nature of the Section 9-503 Presumption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Section 9-503 has its origin in Chapter 695 of the Acts of 1971, which became Code 1957, article 101, section 64A. In <em>Colgan v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>21 Md.App. 331, 320 A.2d 82 (1974), Judge Menchine for this Court explained some of the legislative history surrounding the passage of Chapter 695:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In the course of its passage through the legislature, both the title and the body of the Bill (H.B.433) were amended. As introduced, the title of the bill had provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that its purpose was to \u201cestablish certain medical conditions where the death or disability of a fire fighter is <em>presumed to be accidental </em>and as a result of his employment.\u201d An amendment to the title of the bill struck out the above quoted language and declared that its purpose was to \u201cprovide that there is <em>a presumption of compensable occupational disease </em>in cases of certain fire fighters sustaining temporary or total disability or death under certain conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">The body of the bill at introduction had contained the words: <em>\u201cpresumed to have been accidental </em>and to have been suffered in the course of his employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By amendment in the course of passage the above quoted language was stricken and the following words substituted: <em>\u201cpresumed to be compensable under this AHicle </em>and to have been suffered in the line of duty and as a result of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 335, 320 A.2d 82 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). In 1972, the General Assembly added \u201cpaid state, municipal, county, or airport authority police officers\u201d to those entitled to the presumption. <em>See </em>Chapter 382, Laws of Maryland 1972, page 840. Later, some deputy sheriffs received the benefit of the presumption: <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">No legislative history currently is available showing what medical evidence, if any, was considered by the General Assembly when it enacted the predecessor to section 9-503. But it is obvious that the legislature believed that there was a link between occupational stress and heart disease. <em>See Montgomery County v. Pirrone, </em>109 Md.App. 201, 216, 674 A.2d 98 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The statute sets forth rebuttable <em>factual </em>presumptions, <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Colgan, </em>274 Md. 193, 210, 334 A.2d 89 (1975), one of which is that a paid police officer who has heart disease is \u201cpresumed to be suffering from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>occupational disease that was suffered in the line of duty\u201d if that disease results in \u201cpartial or total disability or death.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-503(b). The presumption is not one of law. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the presumption is not based on probabilities; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> instead, it is \u201cbased largely on a legislatively mandated social policy.\u201d <em>Montgomery County Fire Bd. v. Fisher, </em>298 Md. 245, 259, 468 A.2d 625 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The purpose of LE \u00a7 9-503 \u201cis to provide a presumption of compensable occupational disease to certain classes of public employees including police officers who, in the course of their daily activities, are subject to unusual hazards, stresses, and strains.\u201d <em>Soper v. Montgomery County, </em>294 Md. 331, 336, 449 A.2d 1158 (1982). To rebut the presumption, the employer/insurer must prove a negative, i.e., that the non-existence of the presumed fact is more probable than its existence. <em>Pirrone, </em>109 Md.App. at 214, 674 A.2d 98; <em>see also Sunderland v. North Dakota Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau, </em>370 N.W.2d 549, 552 (N.D.1985), and authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In <em>Fisher, supra, </em>the claimant (a firefighter) had the benefit of a presumption, which was in all material respects exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>like the one here at issue <em>(see </em>section 9-503(a) quoted <em>supra </em>note 1). The claimant argued that the statute set forth a \u201cMorgan-type\u201d presumption\u2014a presumption that never drops out of the case, and imposed both the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion upon the party against whom the presumption operates. Fisher, 298 Md. at 257, 468 A.2d 625. The <em>Fisher </em>Court agreed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">We think the legislature intended that the Morgan type presumption be applied in adjudicating cases arising under \u00a7 64A(a) [now LE \u00a7 9\u2014503(a)]. Undoubtedly, as we first recognized in <em>Bd. of Co. Comm\u2019rs v. Colgan, </em>274 Md. 193, 334 A.2d 89 (1975), and again in <em>Lovellette[ v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore], supra,[ </em>297 Md. 271, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983) ] \u00a7 64A(a) is reflective of a social policy affording preferential treatment to fire fighters disabled by heart disease. Although the presumption of compensability is <em>a rebuttable one of fact, </em>the legislature manifestly intended that <em>the statute impose a formidable burden on the party against whom it operates. </em>Accordingly, both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion remain fixed on the employer; neither ever shifts to the claimant and the presumption constitutes affirmative evidence on the fire fighter\u2019s behalf throughout the case, <em>notwithstanding the production of ccmtrary evidence by the other side.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">The Thayer-Wigmore theory of presumptions is simply inappropriate in occupational disease cases brought under \u00a7 64A(a) because the presumption of compensability is too easily rebutted. <em>It is extremely unlikely in any case that the presumption\u2019s adversary would fail to produce some evidence that heart disease was not due to the fire fighter\u2019s employment; </em>thus, if the Thayer-Wigmore approach to presumptions were applied, practically every case would be decided without the benefit of the statutory presumption, thereby emasculating the presumption and subverting the clear legislative policy which undergirds \u00a7 64A(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 468 A.2d 625 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>As made clear in <em>Fisher, </em>the \u201cMorgan-type\u201d presumption shifts both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion to the employer. Unlike the presumptions covered by Maryland Rule 5-301(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the jury need not be notified of a Morgan-type presumption-but the jury must be notified of the allocation of the burden of persuasion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Carrion v. Linzey, </em>342 Md. 266, 279, 287, 675 A.2d 527 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>III. <em>ISSUE 1</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Did the circuit court err when it struck the expert testimony <em>of </em>Alan G. Wasserman, M.D., on the grounds that one of the reasons for Dr. Wasserman\u2019s opinion that Officer Shankle did not suffer from an occupational disease was the belief that there was no link between occupational stress and heart disease?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">A. <em>The Franch Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">In granting appellee\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to strike Dr. Wasserman\u2019s testimony, the trial court placed great reliance on <em>Franch v. Ankney, supra. </em>Appellee likewise relies on <em>Franch, </em>citing it for the proposition that \u201c[a]n expert\u2019s opinion predicated upon a faulty interpretation of Maryland law must be stricken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\"><em>Franch </em>concerned a legal malpractice case that had its origin in a claim filed with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. <em>Franch, </em>341 Md. at 354, 670 A.2d 951. The claimant, Ankney, suffered a back injury on the premises of a third party while in the course of her employment. <em>Id. </em>Ankney, without the permission of either her employer or her employer\u2019s insurer, Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Aetna), settled her claim against the owner of the premises where she was injured. <em>Id. </em>at 354-55, 670 A.2d 951. Subsequently, Ankney brought a workers\u2019 compensation claim against her employer/insurer to recover certain medical expenses suffered as a result of her work-related injury. <em>Id. </em>at 355, 670 A.2d 951. Aetna opposed the claim and contended that it was no longer liable for the medical expenses because Ankney had settled her claim against the third-party tortfeasor without its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>authorization. <em>Id. </em>The Commission agreed with Aetna and dismissed the claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Ankney then hired William Franch, an attorney, to advise her as to the likelihood of a successful appeal. <em>Id. </em>Franch told Ankney that her appeal probably would not succeed, \u201capparently based on the view that the unauthorized settlement probably foreclosed Ankney\u2019s right to future benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ankney took Franch\u2019s advice and did not appeal the Commission\u2019s decision. Later, however, Ankney sued Franch and his law firm for legal malpractice. At the malpractice trial, two lawyers testified on behalf of Ankney that the unauthorized settlement by her did not absolve Aetna from liability but would only entitle Aetna to a credit for the amount of the settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 362-63, 670 A.2d 951. The foundation of the experts\u2019 opinion was their belief that any prejudice Aetna may have suffered because of the settlement was irrelevant to Aetna\u2019s liability to pay benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 670 A.2d 951. At the conclusion of Ankney\u2019s presentation of her malpractice case, the trial judge struck the testimony of both of Ankney\u2019s experts on the ground that their testimony \u201cwas predicated on a faulty interpretation of Maryland law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363, 670 A.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>Franch, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the amount of prejudice suffered by Aetna was relevant. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 670 A.2d 951. It affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to strike the testimony of both experts, <em>id. </em>at 364, 670 A.2d 951, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aml\">[I]f an expert\u2019s opinion testimony is based upon a premise which is shown to be unsound or faulty, the judge should strike the testimony. <em>See Evans v. State, </em>322 Md. 24, 34-35, 585 A.2d 204, 209 (1991) (\u201cThe expert\u2019s opinion is of no greater value than the soundness of the reasons given for it will warrant. If no adequate basis for the opinion is shown, the opinion should not be admitted or, if already admitted, should be stricken.\u201d) (quoting Maryland Evidence \u00a7 705.1, at 256-57). <em>See also State, Use of Stickley v.

The plaintiffs\u2019 experts in <em>Franch </em>were giving legal opinions as to the status of Maryland law. Legal opinions are admissible in a legal malpractice case if there is an adequate basis for the opinion because the plaintiff must \u201c[establish] the standard of care for a reasonable, prudent lawyer in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 670 A.2d 951. But here, Dr. Wasserman did not venture an opinion as to what Maryland law provided. Instead, he testified, in effect, that one of the reasons that he did not believe that there was a link between Officer Shankle\u2019s occupation and his heart disease was because he did not subscribe to the premise that undergirds the presumption found in LE section 9-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">B. <em>The Premise Underlying Section 9-503</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">There is a cleavage in medical opinion as to whether occupational stress, or stress of any kind, causes heart disease. Many prominent cardiologists share Dr. Wasserman\u2019s view that there is no link between stress and heart disease. That view finds expression in research articles published in prestigious medical journals. For instance, according to a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> data compiled by researchers suggested, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8-\">that depression, anxiety, hostility, and <em>stress </em>are not related to coronary-artery calcification....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Patrick G.

Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, Department of Corrections, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 461, 97 Cal.Rptr. 713 (1971).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <em>Stephens </em>case involved a Worker\u2019s Compensation claim by a guard at Folsom State Prison. After a long period of stressful service, the guard developed heart disease. He filed for compensation under section 3712.2 of the California Labor Code, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">In the case of officers and employees in the Department of Corrections having custodial duties, ... the term \u201cinjury\u201d includes heart trouble which develops or manifests itself during a period while such officer or employee is in the service of such department or hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cSuch heart trouble so developing or manifesting itself in such cases shall be presumed to arise out of and in the course of the employment. <em>This presumption is disputable and may be controverted by other evidence, but unless so controverted, the appeals board is bound to find in accordance with it.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 464-65, 97 Cal.Rptr. 713 (emphasis added). In <em>Stephens, </em>the employer took the position that the claimant\u2019s heart disease was not related to his occupation and called a cardiologist, Dr. Paul DeSilva, as an expert witness. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 97 Cal.Rptr. 713. According to the <em>Stephens </em>Court, Dr. DeSilva testified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">that in his opinion stress and stressful occupations do not cause or relate to acceleration of any arteriosclerosis. He argued that the majority of medical opinion was to that effect. He even characterized the theory (and thus the opinion of [Stephens\u2019s expert]) as being a \u201cridiculous assumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 466-67, 97 Cal.Rptr. 713. Based on this testimony, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) denied Stephens\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 97 Cal.Rptr. 713. The California Court of Appeals reversed, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">Statistically we cannot assert at the appellate level on the basis of this record that the majority of doctors do accept the proposition that stress and tension relate to acceleration of arteriosclerosis of the coronary artery. But what we can and must assert is that the Legislature has declared that in workmen\u2019s compensation applications stress and tension are to be taken into consideration. We have pointed out above that sections 3212 and 3212.2 have allied the state in workmen\u2019s compensation cases with those medical practitioners who disagree with doctors holding Dr. DeSilva\u2019s beliefs. <em>It is impermissible for a compensation earner to \u201crepeal\u201d this legislation, wiping out the presumption created by section 8212.2 by seeking out a doctor whose beliefs preclude its possible application. It is impermissible for the board or its referee to accept the opinion of a physician so disposed as the basis for disallowing a claim.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 467, 97 Cal.Rptr. 713 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The holding in <em>Stephens </em>was later noted in <em>Bechtel v. Board of Retirement of Contra Costa County Employee Retirement Association, </em>102 Cal.App.3d 9, 16, 162 Cal.Rptr. 154 (1980). But in <em>Bechtel, </em>the claimant was a building inspector and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>presumption mentioned in the <em>Stephens </em>case was inapplicable. <em>Id. Stephens </em>is the only case that discusses the <em>admissibility vel 7ton </em>of expert testimony similar to Dr. Wasserman\u2019s and <em>holds </em>that such testimony is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On the other hand, cases from other jurisdictions appear to be unanimous in holding that a presumption\u2014similar to the one here at issue\u2014cannot be overcome by expert testimony that does no more than challenge the premise undergirding the presumption; instead, to overcome the presumption the employer/insurer must produce evidence of some non-job related cause for the disease. <em>Cunningham v. City of Manchester Fire Dep\u2019t, </em>129 N.H. 232, 525 A.2d 714, 718 (1987); <em>Worden v. County of Houston, </em>356 N.W.2d 693, 695-96 (Minn.1984); <em>Linnell v.

Interestingly, however, one court that has closely scrutinized the sufficiency of evidence to rebut the presumption also strongly implied in <em>dicta </em>that evidence that attacks the premise underlying the presumption was inadmissible because it would \u201cvitiate the presumptive effect\u201d of the statute. <em>Cunningham, supra, 525 </em>A.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In <em>Cunningham, </em>the Supreme Court of New Hampshire construed a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that any heart or lung disease of a volunteer or regular member of a fire department was occupationally related, if the firefighter could prove by \u201creasonable medical evidence\u201d that he was free of such disease at the beginning of his employment. <em>See </em>RSA 281:2, V-a.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In the <em>Cunningham </em>case, the administratrix of the estate of a deceased firefighter (Young) who suffered a fatal heart attack, filed a compensation claim against the employer, 525 A.2d at 716. At trial, the employer called a physician as an expert, one Dr. Elliott Sagall. Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony was summarized by the <em>Cunningham </em>Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">Dr. Sagall examined, <em>inter alia, </em>the medical records from Young\u2019s November 1979 hospitalization.... [He] testified on the subject of Young\u2019s coronary arteriosclerosis. He stated that, in his opinion, the decedent\u2019s arteriosclerosis was not related to his employment as a firefighter. In arriving at his conclusion, Dr. Sagall did not rely on the decedent\u2019s medical records; instead he referred to the uncertainty in the medical community on the causation of heart disease, and to studies indicating the absence of a correlation between firefighting and heart disease. Thus, in Dr. Sagall\u2019s opinion, there was no medical evidence that the decedent\u2019s occupation played a role in the development of his arteriosclerosis....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 716. Based on Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony, the trial court rejected the administratrix\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court, 525 A.2d at 719, relying in part on our Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Fisher, supra, </em>categorized the presumption as \u201cMorgan type\u201d and went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">Application of the Thayer theory of presumptions simply would not be consistent with the policy objective of RSA 281:2, V-a. Even a slender amount of rebuttal evidence can too handily defeat a Thayer presumption; and RSA 281:2, V-a would be bereft of the strength the legislature wished to give it. For the same reason, the rebuttal evidence adduced must be of a type that addresses factors unrelated to the plaintiffs occupation. Although medical literature acknowledges that the exact cause of heart diseases is unknown, various \u201crisk factors\u201d are thought to influence their develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ment. These risk factors include: smoking, a family history of heart disease, lipid abnormalities, metabolic disorders (such as diabetes or hyperuricemia), diet, obesity, hypertension, and emotional stress and strain. I. Weinreb, A. Lee, D. Goldberg, W. Breall, Heart Disease, in 2 Attorneys\u2019 Textbook of Medicine para. 30.41(1), at 30-23 (R. Gray and L. Gordy 3d ed.1985). <em>Only evidence of risk factors such as those enumerated above, provided those factors are non-work-related, is acceptable to rebut the presumption of RSA 281:2, V-a. </em>Basic logic dictates that a presumption stating that a disease is job-related can only be rebutted by evidence that the disease was not job-related. Any other interpretation would subvert the manifest intent of the provision. We thus hold that the presumption in RSA 281:2, V-a must be interpreted in accordance with the Morgan theory of presumptions. The defendant bears the burden of persuasion, and can rebut the presumption only by producing evidence that one or more non-occupationally-related factors were more probably the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s heart disease than his firefighter occupation. Needless to say, the sufficiency of any such rebuttal evidence is for the trier of fact to determine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 718 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence, the <em>Cunningham </em>Court returned to an analysis of Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony. Among other things, Dr. Sagall had testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">There is no medical indication in any way that his employment contributed to initiate or hastened the development of this disease. The disease is one of unknown cause or causes, and various studies which have appeared in the medical literature concerning the incidence and severity of this type of disease in firefighters as compared to other members of the general population have not indicated any increased number of, or percentage of incidents of this type of heart disease in firefighters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The <em>Cunningham </em>Court criticized that testimony by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>The infirmity of Dr. Sagall\u2019s citation of medical studies is that such testimony only attacks the rationale of RSA 281:2, V-a. As we have already stated, the legislature was aware that the exact causation of cardiac diseases is unknown, and that the medical community disagrees as to the role of one\u2019s occupation in the development of these diseases. The legislature decided, nevertheless, that a sufficiently positive relationship exists between heart disease and the environmental and stressful aspects of firefighting to warrant the creation of RSA 281:2, V-a\u2019s presumption. <em>Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony went no further than to question the loisdom of the legislature, without producing evidence of non-work-related causes of Young\u2019s arteriosclerosis. This type of testimony is insufficient to rebut the presumption. See Sperbeck, </em>46 Wis.2d at 289, 174 N.W.2d at 549; <em>Linnell, </em>305 N.W.2d at 601; <em>Wright [v. State Accident Ins. Fund], </em>289 Or. [323] at 332, 613 P.2d [755] at 760 [1980].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Dr. Sagall then went on to testify as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u201cA So that there would be, in my opinion, no medical evidence that his occupation as a firefighter played any role, whatsoever, in his basic underlying disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Q So what you\u2019re saying, Doctor, and I want to make sure I understand you correctly, is that Mr. Young has an underlying disease process going on, which, in your opinion, I take it, in reasonable medical probability, was neither caused or accelerated or hastened by his employment as a fireman, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">A That\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">At this point, Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony entered an area on the threshold of valid rebuttal evidence. <em>He refrained from referring to general academic studies, and addressed his remark to the heart condition of the plaintiffs decedent. </em>The weakness of Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony was that he still did not cite evidence of non-work-related risk factors that may have precipitated Young\u2019s heart disease. All one can infer from this latter segment of Dr. Sagall\u2019s testimony is that his doubts concerning the occupational causes of heart disease,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and not a particularized analysis of Young\u2019s pathology, formed the foundation for his conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 720-21 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Unlike the situation in <em>Cunningham, </em>some of the answers Dr. Wasserman provided were admissible\u2014at least if viewed in isolation. For instance, he did give a particularized, non-work-related cause for Officer Shankle\u2019s heart disease. Significantly, however, the City did not argue before the trial court, or in this Court, that the trial judge should have parsed through the videotaped deposition and excised answers in which the expert made clear that one of the principal reasons he excluded occupational stress as a cause of Officer Shankle\u2019s heart disease was because he believed that occupational stress never caused heart disease. And, as already mentioned, on direct examination by the City\u2019s attorney, when Dr. Wasserman was asked to give the reason why he disagreed with plaintiffs expert, he made it crystalline that his reason for disagreement was that he did not accept the premise that there was a link between occupational stress and heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> \u201c \u2018[T]he admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Myers v. Celotex Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 442, 460, 594 A.2d 1248 (1991). \u201cA trial judge\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony will be reversed only if it is founded on an error or law or some serious mistake, or if the judge has abused his discretion.\u201d <em>Franch, </em>341 Md. at 864, 670 A.2d 951 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The Maryland General Assembly intended that paid police officers be given preferential treatment in compensation cases; it also intended that the presumption set forth in section 9-503 should impose a formidable burden upon employers of those given preferential treatment under the statute. <em>Fisher, </em>298 Md. at 258-59, 468 A.2d 625. Given that legislative intent, we agree with the <em>Stephens </em>Court that employers should not be allowed to circumvent the statute by the simple expedient of producing experts who testify, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>effect, that the legislative premise underlying the statute was wrong. Under the circumstance of this case, we do not believe that the trial judge abused her discretion in excluding Dr. Wasserman\u2019s video-tape deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">IV. <em>ISSUE 2</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Is an expert cardiologist required to accept that occupational stress causes coronary artery disease in order to testify, even when he testified that \u201cit is not accepted in the medical community that stress causes coronary artery disease or [is] a risk factor for it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">We answer this question in the negative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In <em>Pirrone, </em>we said: \u201cWhile it may true that the stress of being a firefighter/paramedic neither causes nor leads to coronary artery disease or heart disease, the legislature has determined otherwise.\u201d The same holds true for cases involving police officers who suffer from coronary artery disease. This means that if Dr. Wasserman had simply attributed the heart disease to the presence of four of the six major risk factors for cardio-vascular disease, that testimony would have been admissible. <em>See Cunningham, </em>525 A.2d at 718. Where defense counsel went astray was attempting to bolster that opinion by having Dr. Wasserman tell the jury, on direct examination, that stress never causes heart disease. As a matter of science that may be correct. But because it undercuts the premise of section 9-503, it is not admissible evidence and not a permissible basis for an expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">V. <em>ISSUE 3</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">Is it possible for any employer to ever rebut the presumption in LE \u00a7 9\u2014503(b)(1), if experts are not allowed to express their opinions that a claimant\u2019s coronary artery disease is unrelated to his occupation, in part because they believe occupational stress does not cause coronary artery disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">We also answer that question in the affirmative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Appellant contends that the factual presumption set forth in LE section 9-503 would be irrebuttable unless employer/insurers are able to call experts who are permitted to testify that they do not agree with the legislative premise. As already stated, employers can call experts who disagree with the legislative premise. Such experts simply are prohibited from grounding their opinion as to lack of causation upon such a disagreement. What the Court said in <em>Cunningham </em>is again apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">The law from other jurisdictions thus supports our conclusion that acceptance in rebuttal of <em>anything less than evidence of non-job-related factors would only vitiate the presumptive effect of [the statute]. </em>We emphasize that this standard does not impose upon the defendant the burden of proving the specific cause of the plaintiffs heart disease. Eather, it requires that the defendant provide evidence of non-occupationally-related risk factors from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the plaintiffs heart disease was, more probably than not, caused by one or more of those non-occupational factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"><em>Cunningham, </em>525 A.2d at 719 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The trial judge did not err in disallowing the testimony of Dr. Wasserman because one of the principal reasons that he advanced in support of his opinion that Officer Shankle\u2019s heart disease was not caused by occupational stress was his belief that job stress never causes the development of heart disease. That portion of the expert\u2019s basis was at odds with the thesis accepted by the legislature when it enacted the predecessor to LE, section 9-503\u2014which imposes \u201ca formidable burden on the party against whom it operates.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>298 Md. at 258, 468 A.2d 625.

We do know some things can stabilize plaque, such as lowering your cholesterol level, probably makes it less prone for that plaque to break and bleed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">A simple thing like aspirin maybe makes it less prone for it to bleed, and there may be other medications. What makes it prone to bleed and break off we are not quite sure, but I have seen enough patients in my experience that had coronary artery disease that had a heart attack after having an argument with their wife, getting into a car accident, so something that might increase the stress level and increase the epinephrine level, the hormones in your body that makes you, you know, your heart race, that may be something that in some people help cause the blood clot to break off and form and cause the heart attack, and that is what I was referring to.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\">. This is but one of several similar answers given on cross-examination.

McLain <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>vol. 5, section 301.1, p. 190, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">Other presumptions are based on probabilities. Somewhat akin to judicial notice, they provide a short cut to proof of what is believed to be generally true. For example, an item which has been properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been received by the addressee. This presumption is supported by the probability of receipt, as well as by the fact that the addressee is in a belter position to have knowledge of receipt or nonreceipt than is the sender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). Later, McLain says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">Some presumptions seem to rest primarily on policy grounds. The presumption that the person who possesses property owns it is believed to contribute to the stability of our society. Others, such as the presumption of love of life and against suicide and invited injury, may have mixed bases of probabilities and policy considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axt\"><em>Id. </em>at 191 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Some courts have opined that the presumptions such as those set forth in LE, section 9-503 are based on probabilities. <em>See Sperbeck v. Dep\u2019t of Indus. Labor &amp; Human Relations, </em>46 Wis.2d 282, 174 N.W.2d 546, 548 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b377-5\">. Maryland Rule 5-301(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">Effect. Unless otherwise provided by statute or by these rules, in all civil actions a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption. If that party introduces evidence tending to disprove the presumed fact, the presumption will retain the effect of creating a question to be decided by the trier of fact unless the court concludes that such evidence is legally insufficient or is so conclusive that it rebuts the presumption as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">. Recently, in <em>McQuay v. Schertle, </em>126 Md.App. 556, 595, 730 A.2d 714 (1999), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">In <em>Carrion v. Linzey, </em>342 Md. 266, 675 A.2d 527 (1996), the Court of Appeals explained that by adopting the hybrid form of presumption articulated in <em>Grier[ v. Rosenberg, </em>213 Md. 248, 131 A.2d 737 (1957)] in fashioning Rule 5-301(a), the Rules Committee rejected both the \"Thayer-Wigmore\u201d approach to presumptions (found in Fed.R.Evid. 301) and the \"Morgan-type\u201d approach to presumptions (found in Unif.R.Evid. 301 (1986)). <em>Id. </em>at 278, 675 A.2d 527. The Court observed that under neither of these rejected approaches will the jury in a civil case be instructed about the existence or effect of a given presumption. Under the \"Thayer-Wigmore\u201d approach, the jury is not told of the presumption because once the opponent of the presumption has met his burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumed fact, making the issue a jury question, the presumption disappears from the case altogether. Under the \"Morgan\u201d approach, because the presumption operates to shift the burden of persuasion on the issue to which it applies, the court effectuates it by tailoring its burden of proof instruction to incorporate the reallocated burden of persuasion, thereby making a separate jury instruction about the presumption unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Examples of other Morgan-type presumptions found in Maryland law are: (1) rebuttable presumption that a person is the legitimate child of the man to whom its mother was married at the time of conception (Md.Code Ann.Fam.Law \u00a7 5\u20141027(c)(1) (1999 Repl.Vol.)); (2) \"[wjhere it is shown that a will or codicil was in the maker\u2019s possession and custody but cannot be found at the time of death despite a diligent search, a rebuttable presumption arises that the maker of the instrument destroyed it....\u201d <em>(Plummer v. Waskey, </em>34 Md.App. 470, 481, 368 A.2d 478 (1977)); (3) presumption in civil drug forfeiture cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>money found in close proximity to contraband was used or intended to be used in a drug operation <em>(Ewachiw v. Dir. of Fin., 70 </em>Md.App. 58, 65, 519 A.2d 1327 (1987)); and (4) alterations on the face of a deed are presumed to have been made either prior to or contemporaneously with its execution <em>(Ruden v.
