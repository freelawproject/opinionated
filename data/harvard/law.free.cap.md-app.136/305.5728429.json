Stickley, III (\u201cStickley\u201d), appellant, filed a medical malpractice action against Roy D. Chisholm, III, M.D. (\u201cDr. Chisholm\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>appellee. Prior to deliberation, the circuit court instructed the jury that in order for appellant to recover damages, the jury must find that negligence was <em>the </em>cause of the injury. Appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the court re-instruct the jury in accordance with Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 19:10, which states that in order for the plaintiff to recover, the jury must find that the negligence was <em>a </em>cause of the injury. The circuit court refused that request. The jury found in favor of appellant on the issue of whether appellee had breached the standard of care in his treatment of appellant, but found in favor of appellee on the issue of proximate cause. Appellant now presents the following questions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">I. DID THE TRIAL COURT MISSTATE MARYLAND LAW ON PROXIMATE CAUSE WHEN IT INSTRUCTED THE JURY THAT IN ORDER FOR APPELLANT TO RECOVER IT MUST FIND THAT THE NEGLIGENCE WAS <em>THE </em>CAUSE OF THE INJURY[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">II. WAS THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S MISSTATEMENT OF MARYLAND LAW ON PROXIMATE CAUSE PREJUDICIAL TO THE APPELLANT AND DID IT CONSTITUTE REVERSIBLE ERROR[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cyes\u201d to each of appellant\u2019s questions, vacate the judgment of the circuit court, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">On January 17, 1995, appellant sought treatment from appellee for a mass under his arm on the left side of his chest wall. The mass was approximately 10 x 12 centimeters in size. Concerned that the mass could possibly be cancer, appellee recommended a biopsy. Appellant agreed with that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>recommendation. An incisional biopsy of the mass showed that the growth was a desmoid tumor.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">On January 27, 1995, appellee performed surgery to remove the tumor. When appellee received the pathology results from the January 27, 1995 surgery, he learned that the surgery might not have succeeded in removing all of appellant\u2019s abnormal cells.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At this point, appellee chose not to recommend that appellant undergo (1) further surgery, or (2) radiation therapy to kill the residual tumor cells. Rather, appellee decided to follow appellant closely to see if there would be any reoccurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In June of 1995, during one of his return visits, appellant complained of pain in the incision. As appellant had returned to work, appellee felt that the pain was likely occurring from the scar tissue. On August 9, 1995, appellant returned and again complained of pain in this area. At that time, although appellee felt there was no definite tumor reoccurrence, he was concerned about the possibility of a reoccurrence, so he sent appellant for a CT scan of the area. The CT scan report stated that, \u201cthis finding is suspicious for a neoplastic process and a biopsy is recommended. Some of the soft tissue prominence could represent post-surgical fibrosis if the patient had previous surgery at this location.\u201d Appellee did not perform a biopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The jury received conflicting expert testimony on the issue of causation. When it came time to instruct the jury, both parties agreed that an instruction on causation was needed. They chose Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction (\u201cMPJI\u201d) 19:10,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>To recover damages or to be barred from recovery, the negligence must be a cause of an injury. [There may be more than one cause of an injury, that is, several negligent acts may work together. Each person whose negligent act is a cause of an injury is responsible.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The circuit court agreed to deliver that instruction. When instructing the jurors, however, the circuit court stated that, \u201cin order for a Plaintiff to recover, the negligence alleged must be <em>the </em>cause of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">At a post-instruction bench conference, appellant\u2019s counsel excepted to the \u201cthe cause\u201d instruction. Meanwhile, a juror requested a clarification of the meaning of proximate cause. At this point, the following transpired:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">[BY THE COURT:] Ladies and gentlemen, counsel have pointed out a couple of things to me. First I\u2019ll try to respond to your question. The definition of proximate ... The best advice I can give you is disregard the title to that instruction, which is entitled proximate and concurring causes. Concentrate on the sentence that I read to you. To recover damages, the negligence must be the cause of an injury. Does that clear it up? That\u2019s one of those lawyerly words that we probably shouldn\u2019t use any longer, but we still do. To recover for damages, the negligence must be the cause of an injury. Just concentrate on those words. (Bench conference continued:)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL:] The one and two before you get to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">(Further instruction to the Jury)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">[BY THE COURT:] With respect to ... I gave you some misinformation. Refer to the special verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">I told you that if your answer to the first question is no then your deliberations have ended. The question to the second ... to the first ... if your answer to the first question is yes, then you need to answer question number two. And so that you\u2019re not confused, just cross through the word proximate if you want to on your copy of the form. If your answer to that question is no, you are finished. If your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>answer to that question is yes, then you need to go forward and consider damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">(Bench conference continued)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Your Honor, one other point.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">[BY THE COURT:] Go ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">* \u2756 <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] On this particular question, if they cross off proximate, the instruction nineteen ... ten ... states that it\u2019s a cause, not the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">[FOREPERSON:] Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">[BY THE COURT:] Just a minute. (Counsel at bench)</p>\n<p id=\"AHt\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] A confusing aspect of that would be what if it\u2019s argued that the cause of the injury here was the natural occurrence of the desmoid tumor.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] If it\u2019s argued that the cause of the injury was a natural occurrence of the desmoid tumor and they go no further beyond that, that they may look at it in terms of what came first. Proximate cause is a cause, not the cause, not the only cause. There may be several under the instruction. It expresses that and explains it. It\u2019s using the form of the cause rather than a cause. I request that you do have to say that it is a cause, or one of the causes without which it would not have happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL:] I don\u2019t think it\u2019s confusing at all the way it is now.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">[BY THE COURT:] (unintelligible\u2014papers rattling)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">(Judge to the foreperson)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">What was your question?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">[FOREPERSON:] (Unintelligible\u2014not using microphone)</p>\n<p id=\"AR0\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL:] Your Honor, I think ...</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>[BY THE COURT:] No, if your answer to question number one is no, then you\u2019re finished. See the little sub-instruction. Okay. If you answer number one and move on to number two, again, your answer is no, you\u2019re finished.</p>\n<p id=\"AXQ\">The jury found for appellant on the issue of negligence, but for appellee on the issue of proximate cause, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Negligence as <em>THE </em>Cause of the Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> Appellant contends that the circuit court should not have instructed that, in order for appellant to recover, the jury must find that the negligence was <em>the </em>cause of the injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When we review the adequacy of a specific jury instruction, we must determine whether the instruction \u201cfairly and accurately set for the law applicable to the case [and was] supported by testimony or evidence presented during the case.\u201d <em>Odenton Development Co. v. Lamy, </em>320 Md. 33, 43, 575 A.2d 1235 (1990); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 512, 495 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1093, 106 S.Ct. 868, 88 L.Ed.2d 907 (1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are persuaded that the instruction about which appellant complains did not conform with Maryland law, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>cause it erroneously suggested that proximate cause must be the sole cause of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u201cAs with other cases, in order to prove causation, a medical malpractice plaintiff must establish that but for the negligence of the defendant, the injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Jacobs &amp; Jacobs v. Flynn, </em>131 Md.App. 342, 354, 749 A.2d 174 (2000); <em>See Suburban Hosp. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Mewhinney, </em>230 Md. 480, 484-85, 187 A.2d 671 (1963). \u201cBecause of the complex nature of medical malpractice cases, ... [plaintiffs must present expert testimony] to establish breach of the standard of care and causation.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>131 Md.App. at 354, 749 A.2d 174. <em>See also Meda v. Brown, </em>318 Md. 418, 428, 569 A.2d 202 (1990). When instructing on the issue of proximate cause, the circuit court read MPJI 19:10 almost verbatim, but made two major changes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">1) \u201cmust be <em>the </em>cause of the injury\u201d was substituted for \u201cmust be <em>a </em>cause of an injury;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">2) the second sentence in the instruction, which provides that \u201cthere may be <em>more than one cause </em>of an injury <em>...,\u201d </em>was omitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The combination of substitution and omission erroneously assigned to appellant an incorrect burden of persuasion on the issue of proximate cause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are therefore persuaded that the causation issue was not \u201cfairly covered by the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>given\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the jurors were not provided with a \u201ccorrect statement of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Prejudicial Error</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Maryland law states that \u201c[a] plaintiff must prove that the defendant or defendants were negligent and that negligence was <em>a </em>proximate cause of any injuries.\u201d <em>Bartholomee v. Casey, </em>103 Md.App. 34, 56, 651 A.2d 908 (quoting <em>Jones v. Malinowski, </em>299 Md. 257, 269, 473 A.2d 429 (1984)) (emphasis added). \u201cIn traditional negligence cases, the plaintiff must satisfy the following four basic elements by a preponderance of the evidence: 1) duty; 2) breach; 3) causation; and 4) harm. W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts \u00a7 30, at 164-65 (5th ed.1984). The causation element requires the plaintiff to prove that there is a reasonable connection between the defendant\u2019s negligence and the plaintiffs damages. See id. \u00a7 41, at 263.\u201d <em>Murray v. United States, et al., </em>215 F.3d 460, 463 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>We are persuaded that it is more likely so than not so that the jury found that appellee\u2019s negligence was not the proximate cause of appellant\u2019s injury because that negligence was not the <em>sole </em>cause of injury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the jury should have been instructed that appellee\u2019s negligence can\u2014in combination with other causes\u2014be a cause, the erroneous instruction entitles appellant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Proceedings on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Appellant contends that the proceedings on remand should be limited to the issues of proximate cause and damages. According to appellant, he should \u201cnot be put through the burden of having to prove negligence all over again when the determination of that issue was properly made by the Jury. There has been no argument raised or assignment of error claimed concerning the instruction on the law or the evidence received by the trial Court [sic] on the issue of negligence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The United States Supreme Court has held that, \u201cwhere the practice permits a partial new trial, it may not properly be resorted to unless it clearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and separable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had without injustice.\u201d <em>Gasoline Products Co., Inc. v. Champlin Refining Co., </em>283 U.S. 494, 500, 51 S.Ct. 513, 75 L.Ed. 1188 (1931). In this case, the Supreme Court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">... at common law there was no practice of setting aside a verdict in part. If the verdict was erroneous with respect to any issue, a new trial was directed as to all.... This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>continued to be the rule in some states after the adoption of the Constitution; ... but in many it has not been followed, notwithstanding the presence in their constitutions of provisions preserving trial by jury. The Massachusetts courts early modified it to permit a new trial of less than all the issues of fact when they were clearly separable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 51 S.Ct. 513 (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted). The <em>Gasoline Products </em>Court ultimately concluded that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had erred in issuing a remand that restricted a new trial to the issue of damages because \u201cthe question of damages ... is so interwoven with that of liability that the former cannot be submitted to the jury independently of the latter without confusion and uncertainty, which would amount to a denial of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 51 S.Ct. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In Maryland, a partial new trial is expressly permitted by Md. Rule 8-604(b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">If the Court concludes that error affects a severable part of the action, the Court, as to that severable part, may reverse or modify the judgment or remand the action to a lower court for further proceedings and, as to the other parts, affirm the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Although the Maryland cases applying this rule have not identified every factor to be considered in determining whether a partial new trial should be ordered, according to the majority rule: \u201c... [w]hen manifest justice demands it and it is clear that the course can be pursued without confusion, inconvenience, or prejudice to the rights of any party, a new trial may be limited to a particular severable question.\u201d 34 A.L.R.2d 988, 990. <em>See also Wheatland Irrigation Dist. v. McGuire, </em>552 P.2d 1115, 1116 (Wyo.1976); 39 Am Jur, New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Trial \u00a7 21. \u201cAppellate courts have the power to order a retrial on a limited issue, if that issue can be separately tried without such confusion or uncertainty as would amount to a denial of a fair trial. Whether it can or not depends upon the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Gyerman v. U.S. Lines Co., </em>7 Cal.3d 488, 102 Cal.Rptr. 795, 498 P.2d 1043, 1054 (1972)(quot-ing <em>Brewer v. Second Baptist Church, </em>32 Cal.2d 791, 197 P.2d 713, 720 (1948)); <em>Templeton Feed and Grain v. Ralston Purina Co., </em>69 Cal.2d 461, 72 Cal.Rptr. 344, 446 P.2d 152, 157 (1968). For instance, \u201c[a]n error may ostensibly relate to one issue only, but be of such a character as to have a prejudicial effect upon the other, and in such a case a full retrial should be had.\u201d <em>Parizo v. Wilson, </em>101 Vt. 514, 144 A. 856, 860 (1929)(citing <em>Griffin v. Boston &amp; M.R. R., </em>87 Vt. 278, 89 A. 220, 228 (1913)). \u201cAnd although an error affects one issue only, a new trial on all issues is to be granted where this will best subserve the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Citing <em>Carpenter v. Central Vermont Ry. Co., </em>90 Vt. 35, 96 A. 373, 374 (1916)).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">According to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, for a partial new trial to be ordered, \u201cit must clearly appear that the effect of the error did not extend to all the issues tried.\u201d <em>McBride, v. Huckins, </em>76 N.H. 206, 81 A. 528, 531, 532 (1911).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We believe that to be the appropriate standard and have applied that standard in this case. From our review of the record, it does not clearly appear to us that the effect of the erroneous jury instruction was limited to the issue of causation. Because we do not know whether the jury decided to compromise,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and because the issues of negligence and proxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>mate cause are so intricately intertwined,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the entire case must be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">.
