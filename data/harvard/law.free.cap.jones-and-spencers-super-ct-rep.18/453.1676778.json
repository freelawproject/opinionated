The complaint in an action by the real owner in such a case, to recover the money from the bank, should show notice to, or knowledge by the bank at the time of the deposit, that the plaintiff is the true owner, or that the money was deposited for the benefit of, and in trust for the plaintiff. Such facts must be alleged as will relieve the defendant from its contract liability with the depositor. *</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-8\">The complaint in this action being deficient in the allegation of such facts, it was held that the demurrer, on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, should have been sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b477-9\">If in this case the original depositor, had been made a party defendant, with proper allegations, there would have been an equitable cause of action (Sedgwick, Oh.

It does not show that the defendant knew that the money was the plaintiff\u2019s money, nor that it was left for the benefit of and in trust for the plaintiff. The inference to be drawn from the complaint is that the money was given to Hewitt by the plaintiff to be deposited with the defendant in Hewitt\u2019s name, and, therefore, it must be held that the plaintiff is bound .by the contract with the defendant, made with Hewitt, viz., that it would repay the money to Hewitt, the depositor, or to his legal representatives, on demand, as required by the General Savings Bank Act <em>(Laws </em>1875, ch. 371; amended <em>Laws </em>1882, ch. 409, \u00a7 257).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The deposit became the property of the defendant and the defendant .became a debtor to the depositor (Sims v. Bond, 5 <em>B. &amp; Ad. </em>393 ; People v. Merchants, &amp;c. Bank, 92 <em>N. Y. </em>7). This.contract was made by and with consent of the plaintiff. It does not appear that the defendant refuses to perform its contract, and, until it does so appear, there is no cause of action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In Mulcahy <em>v. </em>Develin (17 <em>Week. Dig. </em>308), cited by respondent, the complaint alleged that the plaintiff was the owner of and was possessed of a certain sum of money on deposit with a third person, which sum of money, in some way, the defendant, without plaintiff\u2019 s knowledge or consent, became possessed of. ' The general term of the court of common pleas held that a demurrer to the complaint would not lie, because the defendants by demurring admitted that the plaintiff owned and was possessed of the money that the defendant had appropriated, without her knowledge and consent. In this respect the two cases differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>This action is to be distinguished\u00bbfrom those actions in which it has been held that whenever one man has the money of another which he ought to pay over, he is liable in an action of assumpsit. Here, as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the defendant ought not to pay over the money to plaintiff, because with plaintiff\u2019s consent it has promised to pay to another (Stephens <em>v. </em>Radcock, 3 <em>Barn. &amp; Adol. </em>354).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Of course, if there be no cause of action, stated in the complaint, the defendant is under no obligation to bring in Hewitt, as provided by section 259 of the general savings bank act. That section applies to an action brought by the party in whose name the deposit was made when a claim to the deposit is made by another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The judgment.and order are reversed with costs, and demurrer is sustained, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b479-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A18\">[Concurring.] I concur with Judge Truax in his opinion, that there is no legal cause of action, but I think there would have been an equitable cause of action if Hewitt (the depositor) had been made defendant with proper'allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>CASES DECIDED AT SPECIAL TERM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
