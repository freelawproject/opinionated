The lease contained the ordinary provisions; a covenant of the tenant to repair, and also a clause as follows: \u201cIn lieu of security, party of the first part accepts and the party of the second part agrees to pay to him the sum of $900. The party of the first part to pay interest at the rate of six per cent, thereonj and to hold the same as his security for the payment of rent by the party of the second part, according to the conditions and provisions of this lease on the part of the party of the second part, said security to be paid back to the party of the second part on the full compliance with the provisions of this lease on the part of the party of the second part.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-14\">The tenant was dispossessed during the term for non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>payment of rent to an amount differently stated by plaintiff (assignor of tenant) and defendant, but admitted to be less than the deposit. Plaintiff, as assignee of tenant, sued to recover the $900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">The trial justice, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, rendered a verdict for the' defendant, on the ground, as stated in the order, that \u201chis assignor (the tenant) had failed to pay some rent, irrespective of the amount thereof,\u201d and had thus failed \u201c to comply with the provisions of the lease.\u201d Plaintiff excepted ; asked to go to the jury, and his exceptions were ordered to be heard in the first instance at general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-6\"><em>Alfred I.

Said Dosot was dispossessed for non-payment of rent. The plaintiff, as assignee of said Dosot, brings this action to recover said sum of $900. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the court directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant. To this ruling and to the denial of a motion for leave to go to the jury the plaintiff excepted, and the court ordered the exceptions to.be heard in the first instance at the general term.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">The evidence shows that all the covenants of the lease, except the covenant to pay rent, were fully performed, that the covenant to pay rent was broken by the non-payment of the sum of $138.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The money was deposited for two purposes: 1st. It was deposited in the place of security for the payment of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>rent as should be due at the termination at the lease, which was in this case $138.36 ; and, 2nd. It was deposited as security for the performance of the other covenants on the part of plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and, as none of these other covenants were broken, the deposit could only be held for the payment of the rent due.of the termination of the lease. On the evidence the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the difference between the amount of rent due ($138.36) and $900. It was error to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The exceptions are sustained and a new trial is ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
