(Sedgwick, Oh. J.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b414-10\">Though the widow swears before the action, <em>e. g., </em>in an examination to enable a complaint to be framed, what the transaction was by which she obtained title, it does not necessarily show bad faith or mismanagement that the administrator disbelieves the statement of an interested party. (Sedgwick, Oh., J.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b414-11\">Defendant failing in such a case, to move for security for costs under section 3271 of the Code, plaintiff should be charged therewith only on clear proof of bad faith.

J., and Ingeaham, J.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-14\">Appeal from order, directing that the costs of the action should be paid by the plaintiff personally, under section 3246 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>It appeared that Daniel McGovern, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, was in his lifetime a liquor merchant, carrying on business at the city of New York, and reputed to be a man of means. At the time of his death he was apparently in possession of a large stock of goods and a valuable good will, the sign over the door of the place of business being in his name, as were also the licenses under which the business was transacted. He left a will which was duly propounded for probate. The plaintiff, who was named as executor, endeavored to take an inventory of the estate. The defendant, his widow, refused to permit him to do so, claiming that the deceased had left no property or estate whatsoever. Thereupon, alleging the facts that the defendant threatened to contest the probate of the propounded will, plaintiff applied for and was granted letters of temporary administration. After such appointment tlie plaintiff again demanded possession of the property, which was refused. Defendant then moved to set aside the letters of temporary administration and the motion was denied. Plaintiff then instituted proceedings for the discovery of asset's of the deceased pursuant to the provisions of the Code (\u00a7 90). Defendant claimed to be the owner of the property and the proceedings were dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Thereupon this action of conversion was brought to test the title to the property, in which action defendant claimed title by gift from her husband, and recovered a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">Defendant\u2019s affidavits on this motion, to show bad faith, etc., among other things, alleged that the will provided that certain legacies should first be paid to plaintiff\u2019s mother and sister, and thereafter a legacy to defendant; that the plaintiff personally had had the paper drawn, and procured a letter from the deceased\u2019s physician advising the deceased\u2019s being taken out to ride often ; took him out to ride on the day the paper was signed, when the deceased had to be carried to the carriage, and at a saloon on the Boulevard had the deceased\u2019s cross put to the will, which he witnessed, and which will was not brought to the attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of the widow of the deceased until after the death of the said Daniel McGovern ; that at the time of the commencement of this action the plaintiff was not in possession of any property belonging to the estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-5\"><em>E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">The effort by defendant to show that the plaintiff had acted improperly in respect of the paper proposed as the deceased\u2019s last will, cannot be considered on this appeal. The surrogate, with competent jurisdiction, thought it right to appoint the plaintiff to be the temporary administrator, and it became the duty of the latter to bring actions for the protection of the estate. The facts were that a large quantity of property that had belonged to the deceased and was in his possession within a short time before his death, was after his death in the possession of the defendant, and was claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>by her to be her own. It does not appear that she ever explained the transaction or the manner or time of transfer to her, or made a specific statement as to her kind of title. The only opportunity that the papers show the plaintiff had of learning this, was upon an examination of the defendant by the plaintiff, to enable him to draw his complaint. On that examination, when the questions approached an inquiry as to defendant\u2019s title, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected that the order for examination confined it to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the property, and all outside of that was objected to. When a question was asked whether the defendant had checks from the deceased in July, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected, whether correctly or not need not be determined, or gave notice that the question was within the rule as to communications with a deceased person. The practical effect of this was to stop a line of questions that if followed, vrould have given the defendant power to be a witness as to the transfer to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Or, if she had stated under oath what the transaction was, it cannot be determined as the case stands, that it would have been bad faith or mismanagement on plaintiff\u2019s part to have disbelieved'the statement of an interested party.</p>\n<p id=\"AC3\">The case was unusual, and it does not appear that the plaintiff could have fully performed his duty without subjecting it to the test of litigation. For these reasons, my opinion is that the order should be reversed, and the motion below denied, with $10 costs and disbursements to be taxed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b417-7\">Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atj\">[Concurring.] The plaintiff was not personally interested in the result of the action, and in order to charge him personally with costs, it must appear that he was guilty of mismanagement or bad faith in the prosecution of the action <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 3246). There was a substantial dispute between the legatees under the will and the defendant, as to the title to the property. Plaintiff was acting for the legatees under an appointment of the surrogate, and from the facts as they appeared prior to the trial, plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>cannot be charged in prosecuting this action to test the defendant\u2019s title to the property with bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u2022 Defendant could have applied under section 3271 of the Code, to require plaintiff to give security for costs, and having failed to make such application, should not be allowed to compel plaintiff to pay the costs of an action which he was prosecuting for the benefit of others, without clear proof of bad faith I concur, therefore, with the chief judge that the order should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
