On the trial of the cause a juror was withdrawn to enable plaintiff to move to amend the complaint. The amended complaint, charged that plaintiff was injured <em>without knowledge on her part </em>that said ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>chine was then defective. Neither complaint specified in what respect the machine was out of order or defective. The affidavit of the manager and superintendent of the defendant stated that the machine had been examined on the day of the accident immediately before, and again immediately after, the accident, and that after careful examination and diligent inquiry, defendant had not been able to discover wherein the machine was defective or out of order, and that defendant did not believe that the machine was out of order or defective, and did not know where to obtain the information on which the allegation in the complaint was based.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">The motion was denied, for the reason, as stated in the opinion, \u201c I do not think that this is a case in which a bill of particulars should be ordered\u2014defendant has the same means of knowledge or better than plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">From the order denying motion the appeal is taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">The court at general term said:\u2014\u201cThe granting or denying the motion was within the discretion of the special term, and this court sees no reason to doubt that such discretion has been properly exercised in this case (Butler r. Mann, 9 <em>Abb. N. C. </em>49 ; 2 <em>Civ. Pro. R. </em>240). With the knowledge and information which defendants have, or can acquire as to the condition of the machine at which plaintiff was employed, there can be no difficulty in their making such answer to her complaint as would put on her the burden of proving the existence of the defect, if any there were, in the machine, by reason of which the injury to her occurred, and of testing the worth of the evidence on her behalf by the everyday experience of the working of the machine which, by reason of its being in their possession, they can command.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-8\">Burrill, <em>Zabriskie &amp; </em>Burrill, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-9\"><em>John D. </em>Townsend, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Opinion by O\u2019Gorman, J.; Sedgwick, Ch.
