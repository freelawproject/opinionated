Whether if the defendants had asked the court to submit to the jury the credibility of the witness giving the evidence, it would have been right to refuse, does not seem to be a question in the case. At the end of the testimony for plaintiff, his counsel moved for a direction in his favor. The defendants\u2019 counsel opposed the motion, and requested to go to the jury upon the \u2018 question of delivery, and also upon the p\u2019oint whether or no there was not a further agreement that took the place of the written agreement.\u2019 The court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion, and denied defendants\u2019 request. The effect of the rulings was that if the defendants were deprived of the benefit of a construction of the jury favorable to them, on the only question as to which they asked to go to the jury, yet on the face of the testimony which they did not ask that the jury should consider, the verdict should be for plaintiff. If the counsel had called the attention of the court to the position, that although the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was clear that he had given a consideration, his credibility was for the jury, the court might have submitted the matter to the jury, and as it stands, the demand for the submission of the two questions is a waiver of right as to others.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-5\"><em>Moody B. </em>Smith, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-6\"><em>Childs &amp; </em>Hull, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Opinion by Sedgwick, Ch.
