Pro. \u00a7 469, and general rule 49, the court will not appoint him guardian <em>ad litem </em>of said infant, though it appears that such infant has no other relative or friend of greater means who would assume such position, and that such decision may work hardship to the infant.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b120-8\">Before Sedgwick, Ch. J., and O\u2019Gorman, J.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-10\">Appeal from an order of the special term denying the application of the petitioner to be appointed special guardian, of his daughter on the ground that the petition does not show the applicant to be a responsible person, within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 469, and of the 49 th general rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-11\">The facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-12\"><em>R. V. W. Du Bois, </em>for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-13\">By the Court.\u2014O\u2019Gorman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af7\">It is set forth in the petition, that Louisa Mang, an infant, was driven over by the team and wagon, of which the Schaefer Brewing Company are the owners, and severely injured thereby; that the petitioner is her father, and desires to be appointed her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>to bring suit on her behalf against said company ; that he is forty-three years old, has a wife and five children to support, and earns two dollars a day in the employment of one Fischer, a manufacturer of pianos.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">That neither he nor his child Louisa has any relatives or friends of greater means than himself, who would assume the position of guardian <em>ad litem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">The Code of Civil Procedure, section 469, provides that, \u201c before a summons is issued, in the name of an infant plaintiff, a competent and responsible person must be ap- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\u25a0 pointed to appear as Ms guardian for the purpose of the action, who shall be responsible for the costs thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Rule 49 provides that no person shall be appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>who is not of sufficient ability to answer to the infant for any damage which may be sustained by his negligence or misconduct in the defense dr prosecution of the suit, and such ability must be shown by the affidavit stating facts in respect thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In accordance with this rule, in McDonald <em>v. </em>Brass, &amp;c. Manufacturing Co., supreme court, second department (1877), <em>2 Abb. N. C. </em>434, Judge Barnard held, that the guardian <em>ad litem </em>should not have been appointed, unless the papers on which the application was made,, showed her pecuniary responsibility; and stayed all proceedings until she had. given security for costs, with sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">In the face of these provisions of law and this authority, the learned judge \u00e1t special term would not have been justified in relaxing the strictness of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">It may work a hardship in this particular instance. But the uncertainty of the law is one of the most dangerous of the defects which can be charged against it, and when rules cease to be binding they cease to be rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
