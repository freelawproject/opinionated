L. J. </em>83). Is there evidence that the defendants in this instance failed to perform that duty ? The testimony on that subject is substantially as follows : The accident occurred at about two o\u2019clock in the day. It had rained in the forenoon, but was not then raining. The stairs leading to defendant\u2019s ticket office were made of wood, of very fair width, the steps covered with india rubber strips. There was no roof overhead. The memory of the witnesses as to whether that was the condition of the stairway <em>on the day of the accident </em>to the deceased is not .certain. The side rails were from two feet eight inches to three feet five inches high, came up to about a man\u2019s hip. They were on the top about four inches and a-half wide\u2014 too wide for witness to put his hand, round them. In rainy or slushy weather the place was, in the opinion of one of the witnesses, dangerous for people to travel on. A man had fallen on the stairs before the injury to the deceased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>but how, or why, or exactly where, or under what circumstances he fell, did not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">\u201cThe case of Dougan <em>v. </em>Champlain Trans. Co. (56 <em>N. Y. </em>1), is, in its leading features, similar to the c\u00e1se at bar. In that case, the deceased fell down and slipped under the railing of the gangway of a steamboat, went overboard and was drowned. Held that there was no ground for supposing that any passenger would fall under the railing, and it was obvious that no such thing was likely to occur, the plaintiff should be non-suited ; and the non-suit was sustained by the court of appeals. In the case at bar there was no evidence, that from any imperfection in their construction, any danger of any passenger falling over the stairs to the ground, could fairly have been apprehended, or that such defect would necessarily or naturally lead to such a result, although the stairs may, in some respects, have been imperfect and inconvenient for travel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">\u201c The question whether evidence offered to prove negligence should be passed upon as a question of law by the court, or left to the jury as matter of fact, is always doubtful and difficult, and depends on the circumstances of each case. In the case at bar it does not seem to have been passed upon by the trial judge, the motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint being granted expressly on the ground that there was no evidence that the negligence of the deceased did not contribute-to the injury. The plaintiff was bound to prove that no contributory negligence on his part existed (Hale <em>v. </em>Smith, 78 <em>N. Y. </em>480). 'Where there is an entire absence of evidence that plaintiff is free from fault, he cannot recover (Wendell <em>v. </em>R. R, 91 <em>Id. </em>420). \u2018It is not enough to prove facts, from which either the conclusion of negligence or of the absence of negligence may be with equal fairness drawn, but the burden is upon the plaintiff to satisfy the jury that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased (Hart <em>v. </em>Hudson Bridge Co., 84 <em>Id. </em>56). It is not sufficient that the evidence in this respect was equally balanced, it was essential that at least <em>aprima facie </em>case should be established <em>(Id.). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Where there is no evidence as to what actually did take place at the time, and the proof is such as to render it uncertain, it cannot be said that absence of negligence is established. No inference can be legitimately drawn in favor of the plaintiff \u2019 <em>(Id.).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-4\">\u201cThis is the difficulty in the case at bar. There is absolutely no evidence to show how or why the accident to the deceased occurred. No one was near him at the time. Witnesses, standing on the ground below, saw him go up the stairs until he got to the second flight, and reached a' spot within three or four steps of the upper platform leading to the ticket office, where he fell. 1 He stopped, and leaned against the rail. He went over sideways. He fell across the rail. He did not have hold of the hand rail. He walked up the stairs the same as anybody else.\u2019 This is all. Whether he imprudently and incautiously l\u00e9aned over and lost his balance, whether he slipped on the stairs, and fell over, or whether he was the victim of sudden dizziness, and the disaster was inevitable, does not appear. There is no evidence of any -negligence on his part contributing to his fall. Neither is there any evidence that he was not negligent. There is no fact bearing on the subject to go .to the jury\u2014no conflict of evidence to be considered\u2014no inference from any fact to be weighed by them ; and in such cases, the question must, of necessity, be determined by the court (Wendell <em>v. </em>R. R., 91 <em>N. Y. </em>420 ; Reynolds <em>v. </em>R. R., 58 <em>Id. </em>248; Cordell <em>v. </em>R.
