This stipulation renders an order for the production and inspection of the books unnecessary, at least until it is shown that the defendants have refused to comply with l;he terms of their stipulation. When they shall be produced before the referee, they will be under his control, and he may then make such order concerning them a.s he deems just. Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements to be taxed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
