But <em>further held, </em>that the order for said precept cannot be sustained, for the reason that it fails to adjudicate in terms that accused has committed the offense charged, and that it was calculated to or did defeat, impair, etc., the rights or remedies of plaintiff. <em>It seems, </em>that said fees are not to be deemed costs within Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 15, forbidding arrest for non-payment of costs in certain cases.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b116-8\">Before Sedo-wick, Ch.

Respondent procured . an order by default, granting her $12 a week alimony, <em>pendente </em>lite, and $100 counsel fee. Subsequently, and on December 11, 1882, as a favor to appellant, default was opened, and the matter referred to a referee, to take proof of appellant\u2019s financial ability to pay alimony and counsel fee; the appellant to stipulate to pay the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>and expenses of the reference, which the stipulation appellant gave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">Subsequently, on April 12, 1883, on continuing the reference before another referee, expenses of the reference were ordered to be paid by the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">The referee reported in respondent\u2019s favor. The referee\u2019s fees amounted to $80, and the stenographer\u2019s fees to same amount. A motion was thereupon made to compel the appellant to pay said fees, which motion was granted, and appellant having failed to comply with said order, a motion was made to punish him as for a contempt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">Thereafter, and on August 16, 1883, it was ordered that a precept issue, directing that the defendant be detained in the common jail until the payment of said fees. The order to show cause upon which this order was granted was not served on defendant personally, but on his attorneys, and the order (August 16, 1883), while it recited specifically the grounds of the motion, viz.: defendant\u2019s non-payment of said fees, did not in terms adj\u00f1dicate that he had been guilty thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">Defendant appealed from the said order directing payment of said fees, and from the said order for a precept.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-9\"><em>Culver </em>&amp; Wright, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6E\">It is necessary to serve a party with all papers to bring him into contempt. The papers to bring defendant in contempt were not served on him, but on his attorneys <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 802; Ward <em>v. </em>Arenson, 10 <em>Bosw. </em>589; Fischer <em>v. </em>Raab, 56 <em>How. Pr. </em>218; aff\u2019d 58 <em>Id. </em>221).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-10\">The person who made the demand, managing clerk of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, does not show authority to receive the same, or that he was authorized to make a demand. It should be so shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-11\">' The order of August 16, 1883, is void, as it does not adjudicate the defendant guilty of any act which the law recognizes as a contempt of court. It should so appear in the order (see 3 R. S. \u00a7 20, tit. 13, ch. 8; Clark <em>v. </em>Bin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>inger, <em>75 N.

Y. </em>237, 238).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">The referee\u2019s fees in this action are in the nature of interlocutory costs, and cannot be enforced by arrest <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 15, <em>Laws </em>1847, ch. 390; Lansing <em>v. </em>Lansing, 4 <em>Lans. </em>395; Ford <em>v. </em>Ford, 10 <em>Abb.

Y. </em>46).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">The order is also void on the ground that it calls for an absolute commitment under proceedings in pursuance of section 5 of the statute, while at most a precept under section 4 of the statute could issue (People <em>v. </em>Bennett, 4 <em>Paige, </em>282 ; Patrick <em>v. </em>Warner, <em>ld. </em>397; Watson v. Nelson, 69 N. <em>Y. 537; </em>People <em>v. </em>Cowles, 3 <em>Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 507; In re </em>Kelly, 62 <em>N.

Proc. </em>\u00a7 14; Fischer <em>v. </em>Langbein, <em>N. Y. Daly Reg. </em>August 14, 1883).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">Code, \u00a7 15, has no application to the case at bar. The referee\u2019s and stenographer\u2019s fees in question, are not costs within the intent of the statute. They are in the nature of special expenses, which were occasioned by reason of the granting of a favor to appellant, upon his special compact with the court to pay same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-9\">It was not necessary that the appellant should have been personally served with the motion papers. Pitt <em>v. </em>Davison, 37 <em>N. Y. </em>235; S. C., 3 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>398 ; 34 <em>How. </em>355. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 802 has no application. It is a substitute for section 418 of the old Code, which was in force at the time of the decision of Pitt <em>v. </em>Davison, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b118-10\">By the Court.\u2014Truax, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATB\">Sections 2281 and 2283 provide that if upon the return of an order to show cause it is determined that the accused has committed the offense charged, and that the offense was calculated to, or actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>did defeat, impair or prejudice the rights or remedies of a party to an action . . . the court must make a final order accordingly, directing that the accused by punished by fine, or imprisonment, or both, and that a warrant of commitment must issue accordingly. There is no determination or adjudication in this order directing that a precept issue, that the accused has committed the offense charged, and that that offense was calculated to or did actually defeat, impair or prejudice the rights or remedies of the plaintiff. This order should therefore be reversed. Where a party has appeared in an action by attorney it is not necessary to serve him with the order to show cause why he should not be punished as for a contempt; such an order is correctly served if served on the party\u2019s attorney (Pitt <em>v. </em>Davison, 37 N. <em>Y. </em>235).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The defendant contends that the order directing him to pay the sum of one hundred and sixty dollars, referee and stenographer\u2019s fees, should be reversed on the ground that the person who made the demand does not show authority to receive the same or that he was authorized to make such demand. Under the circumstances of this case, the defendant having obtained a favor upon stipulating that he would \u201c pay all charges and expenses incurred for referee\u2019s fees,\u201d the demand made, viz., that defendant pay such charges and expenses, and notifying him of the amount thereof, was sufficient. Under the stipulation it became the defendant\u2019s duty to pay such charges and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">This order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We cannot give the respondent the relief she asks for, viz., that both of the orders appealed from and the order of December 11,1882, and April 12, 1883, be vacated and set aside. The order of August 16,1883, is reversed, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right to renew the motion to commit the defendant, and also without prejudice to his right to move to vacate those orders on the ground that the defendant has not complied with his stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"AUW\">No costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">O\u2019Gorman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
