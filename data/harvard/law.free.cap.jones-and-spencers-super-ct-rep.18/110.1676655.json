J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWS\">I agree to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On a motion on behalf of defendants for re-argument of appeal, or for leave to go to the court of appeals, the following opinion was rendered, February 4, 1884.</p>\n<author id=\"b136-7\">By the Court.\u2014O\u2019Gorman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWT\">The application is based on an alleged mistake as to a matter of evidence, made by me in my opinion, in that I stated that the plaintiff was employed by' defendants on September 1, 1881. The learned counsel for the defendants claims that it appears on the evidence that the time of the alleged employment was about August 15, 1881, to take effect on the first day of September thereafter; and that the agreement being thus for services to commence at a future time, and by its terms not to be performed within one year, was void. The plaintiff testified, \u201cI was first engaged by the defendants to do temporary work, on August 15, 1881. After -my work was then completed, I was offered the superintendency' of construction under the general manager Warren, to take effect September 1, 1881. At that time, I took charge of the office, and was employed by the defendants, &amp;c.\u201d This statement of the plaintiff, I regarded as fixing the date of the employment, at September 1, 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The plaintiff further testified: \u201cI was informed by Mr. Warren, yvhen I was first employed, that my salary would not be less than $1,800.. He told me that about August 15, 1881, when I was first employed there. It was understood my appointment took place from September 1, 1881. These l\u00e1tter statements are not inconsistent with that first referred to, viz : that on September 1, 1881, plaintiff took charge of the office, and was employed by the defendants <em>then.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>This question as to the bearing of the statute of frauds on this case, does not appear to have been in any way noticed by the counsel on the trial, or by the learned judge in his charge, and it was for the first time called to the attention of the court on the argument of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">I do not understand that the plaintiff claimed that the defendants hired him for any fixed or definite period, but only at the rate of $1,800 a year; and the learned trial judge seems to have so regarded the case, and so, in effect, charged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Unless the plaintiff\u2019s case depended on proof of a contract of hiring, to continue in terms for a year or more, the question whether the contract was made on September 1, the day when it went into effect, or a month before that day, would be immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The jury were justified in believing that the contract was made on September 1, when the employment began ; and they were also justified in believing, as they no doubt did believe, that there was no evidence of any contract to hire the plaintiff for a year certain, but only an agreement to pay him a sum for each month that he was employed at the rate of $1,800 a year. There is no evidence of a contract <em>by its terms </em>not to be performed within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Thus, the question as to the statute of frauds is in no respect pertinent to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The question as to the effect of the receipts in full signed by the plaintiff, was discussed by*the defendant\u2019s counsel, and fully presented in his printed points. It does not appear that the attention of the trial judge was called to it. The case of Ryan <em>v. </em>Ward (48 <em>N. Y. </em>204), is, however, conclusive on the subject. A recept in full furnishes only <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and is open to explanation or contradiction ; and explanation satisfactory to the jury appears to have been given in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">In my opinion, the motion for a re-argument, or for leave to go to the court of appeals, should be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
