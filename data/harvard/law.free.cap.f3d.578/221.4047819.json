He was sentenced to 180 months of incarceration. Because it is unclear whether the District Court sentence was the result of an upward departure authorized by the United States Sentencing Guidelines or a variance from those guidelines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, we will remand to the District Court for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">FBI agents recovered images of child pornography from Brown\u2019s home. After Brown entered his guilty plea, the Probation Office prepared a Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Applying the 2007 edition of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, the PSR calculated Brown\u2019s offense level to be 30 and his corresponding sentencing range to be between 97 and 121 months of incarceration. Neither party objected to this calculation of the guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">When calculating that the total offense level under the guidelines \u2014 apart from any potential departure or variance \u2014 was 30, the PSR applied the following reductions and enhancements to defendant\u2019s base offense level of 22: (1) a two-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) because the evidence did not establish an intent to traffic or distribute the illicit images; (2) a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2) because some of the images involved a prepubescent minor or a minor under the age of 12 years; (3) a four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) because some of the images portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct; (4) a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6) because a computer was used for the receipt and possession of the images; (5) a five-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) because the offense involved 600 or more images; (6) a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a); and (7) a one-level reduction for timely notifying the government of the intention to plead guilty pursuant to \u00a7 3 E 1.1(b). Starting from the base offense level of 22, these reductions and enhancements yielded the agreed total offense level of 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">The five-level enhancement for possession of 600 or more images is at the core of this appeal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7) (also referred to as \u201csubsection (b)(7)\u201d or \u201c(b)(7)\u201d) provides that a defendant convicted of possessing child pornography is subject to the following schedule of potential sentencing enhancements under the guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">If the offense involved\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-16\">(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-17\">(B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-18\">(C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-19\">(D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-20\">Application Note 4 to subsection (b)(7) gives instruction as to how a court is to count images.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (As discussed <em>infra </em>in Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tion IV of this opinion, the counting procedure set forth in Application Note 4 has no function other than as an adjunct to (b)(7).) Pursuant to Application Note 4, a still photograph counts as one image (unless that \u201csubstantially underrepresents the number of minors depicted,\u201d in which case \u201can upward departure may be warranted\u201d). Further, also pursuant to Application Note 4, a video counts as 75 images (but if \u201cthe length of the recording is substantially more than five minutes, an upward departure may be warranted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Brown\u2019s PSR recited that Brown had 6350 still photographs and 221 videos depicting children engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Manifestly, the still photographs alone put Brown well over the 600 images which, pursuant to (b)(7)(D), called for a five-level enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In a section entitled \u201cFactors That May Warrant Departure,\u201d the PSR stated that, pursuant to Application Note 4, an \u201cupward departure may be warranted if the Court determines that the number of images substantially underrepresents the number of minors depicted\u201d or \u201cif the Court determines that the length of a video-clip, movie, or similar recording is substantially more than five minutes.\u201d (PSR \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.) Brown possessed at least 28 digital movies or videos that were substantially longer than five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">After Brown entered his guilty plea but before Brown\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government filed a \u201cMemorandum Recommending Upward Variance\u201d with the District Court. At the sentencing hearing, the government\u2019s attorney began his presentation by telling the court that the government was \u201cseeking an upward variance from the sentencing guidelines.\u201d (App.48.) Later, the government\u2019s attorney informed the court that this was \u201cthe first time [he had] ever asked a Court to depart upward \u2014 to do an upward variance.\u201d (App.58.) Shortly thereafter, he noted that he was \u201casking for an increase, upward variance, in the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>He also emphasized that he \u201cneeded to get approval from [his] boss[] before [he] can ask the Court to depart from the sentencing guidelines\u201d and that, in this case, \u201cthe sentencing guidelines have\u2014 have given to the Court the discretion and asked the Court \u2014 invited the Court to use its judgment.\u201d (App.61.) After asking \u201cthe Court to increase the \u2014 the applicable sentencing guidelines range five levels to a range of 168-210 months\u201d because that increase would \u201cadequately reflect the factors in 3553 A[,]\u201d the government\u2019s attorney concluded by requesting that the court grant \u201cthe government\u2019s motion for an upward variance.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Brown submitted a sentencing memorandum to the District Court urging a downward variance from the guidelines. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, Brown\u2019s counsel emphasized that defendant\u2019s age, poor health, lack of criminal history, expressed remorse, and family support suggested that recidivism was unlikely and that long-term imprisonment was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Court observed at the outset that a brief had been \u201cfiled by the government seeking an enhancement under the appropriate provisions of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d (App.48.) The court later referred to the guidelines again, noting the applicability of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">And as the government has pointed out, and as the probation officer brought to our attention, we have Section 2-G 2.2 of the guidelines which has an application note which says that an upward departure may be warranted if the Court determines the number of images substantially under represents the number of minors depicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">There\u2019s a gross number here. The guideline alludes to 600. And the same application note \u2014 or different application note, 4B.2, provides that it\u2019s appropriate for an upward departure if the Court determines that the length of any video, video clip movie is substantially more than five minutes. If I remember correctly, at least one of these ran 24 minutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">(App.63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">The District Court also discussed its consideration of the factors bearing on sentencing set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the court noted that \u201cthe public needs to be protected\u201d from those who, like Brown, \u201cperpetuate an industry\u201d of child pornography, and that the child pornography possessed by Brown represented \u201csadistic behavior in excess of anything\u201d the court had ever seen in similar cases. (App.63-64.) Then, after having announced that the defendant would be sentenced to 180 months of imprisonment, the court stated, \u201cI think this sentence satisfies the purposes set forth in Section 3553A.\u201d (App.66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">After the District Court announced the sentence, defense counsel asked the judge \u201cfor clarification\u201d on whether the court had \u201cformally rule[d] on the motion for an upward departure and if so, how many levels?\u201d (App.66-67.) The following colloquy between the court, defense counsel, and the Probation Officer ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-15\">THE COURT: Well, it\u2019s gone from\u2014 I don\u2019t have that immediately before me. Would you it give [sic] to him, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-16\">PROBATION OFFICER: Your Hon- or, when we applied the guideline, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>advisory range was 97 to 121 based on a total offense level of 30 with a criminal history category one. The government\u2019s motion argued for a five-level increase which would take it to a 35 total offense level and a criminal history, again, category one with a range of 168 months to 210.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">MR. LATELLA: I\u2019m sorry, 168 to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">THE COURT: 168 to 210.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">MR. LATELLA: So the Court granted a five-level upward departure; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">THE COURT: Yes, I granted the government\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">MR. LATELLA: \"What\u2019s the range?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">THE COURT: 168 to 210 is the new range under the guidelines, and I imposed a sentence of 180 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">MR. LATELLA: Thank You.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">(App.67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">The Sentencing Guidelines \u201care now advisory, and appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing a criminal sentence, an appellate court should:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-17\">first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af6\"><em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-20\">In this Circuit, district courts should engage in the following three-step process when determining an appropriate sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-21\">(1) Courts must continue to calculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentence precisely as they would have before Booker,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-22\">(2) In doing so, they must formally rule on the motions of both parties and state on the record whether they are granting a departure and how that departure affects the Guidelines calculation, and take into account our Circuit\u2019s <em>pre-Booker </em>case law, which continues to have advisory force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-23\">(3) Finally, they are to exercise their discretion by considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... in setting the sentence they impose regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-24\"><em>United States v. Lofink, </em>564 F.3d 232, 237-38 (3d Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006)) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-25\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-26\">We expressly distinguish between departures from the guidelines and variances from the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Vampire Nation, </em>451 F.3d 189, 195 n. 2 (3d Cir.2006). Departures are enhancements of, or subtractions from, a guidelines calculation \u201cbased on a specific Guidelines departure provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These require a motion by the requesting party and an express ruling by the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 197-98. Variances, in contrast, are discretionary changes to a guidelines sentencing range based on a judge\u2019s review of all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and do not require advance notice. <em>Id. </em>at 195-98. \u201c[District courts should be careful to articulate whether a sentence is a departure or a variance from an advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Whether a district court has imposed a departure or, instead, a variance has real consequences for an appellate court\u2019s review. <em>See, e.g., Irizarry v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008) (holding that the notice requirement of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) applies to departures but not to variances). An appellate court reviewing a variance for reasonableness does so by evaluating the district court\u2019s analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whereas an appellate court reviewing a departure must consult the relevant guidelines provision in order to determine whether the departure was appropriate. Accordingly, when a sentencing court engages in either a departure or a variance from the guidelines, it is imperative that the judge make clear which of these is being applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In the instant matter, we are unable to determine whether the District Court intended to grant an upward departure or intended to grant a variance. The court expressly addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when discussing the sentence and concluded that the sentence satisfied the purposes of \u00a7 3553; in this respect, the sentence seems to represent a variance. On the other hand, the court also appears to have taken U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 4 into consideration, which would indicate a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">When asked by defense counsel, \u201cSo the Court granted a five-level upward departure; is that correct?\u201d the Judge replied, \u201cYes, I granted the government\u2019s motion.\u201d The government\u2019s motion had \u201curge[d] the court to impose an upward variance from the sentencing guidelines,\u201d and the government had used the term \u201cvariance\u201d rather than \u201cdeparture\u201d fairly consistently throughout the sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the court\u2019s answer to defense counsel\u2019s question simultaneously suggests two not readily reconcilable positions: (1) that the court intended to grant an upward departure, as indicated by its responding \u201cyes\u201d to defense counsel\u2019s inquiry whether the court had \u201cgranted a five-level upward departure,\u201d and (2) that the court intended to grant a variance, as indicated by its reference to \u201cthe government\u2019s motion,\u201d which was captioned \u201cMemorandum Recommending Upward Variance.\u201d The court\u2019s reply leaves us unable to determine whether the court intended to grant an upward departure or a variance. In sum, the court did not \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. <em>See also Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Where, as here, a sentencing court has made a non-constitutional error, \u201cwe will remand for resentencing \u2018unless [we] conclude on the record as a whole ... that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Langford, </em>516 F.3d 205, 215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>(3d Cir.2008) (citing <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). Because the District Court explicitly discussed both U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 4 <em>and </em>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when explaining its sentence, we cannot conclude with any certainty that its failure to distinguish between a departure and a variance did not affect the selection of the sentence imposed. Had the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in isolation from (rather than conflation with) the Application Note, it is entirely possible that the court would not have viewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as independently able to provide sufficient support for imposing a sentence within a range five levels higher than the range the parties agreed had been properly calculated by the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Moreover, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 4, to which the District Court referred, could not have grounded an upward guidelines departure under any circumstances. \u201c \u2018When construing the Guidelines, we look first to the plain language, and where that is unambiguous we need look no further.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ashley, </em>342 F.3d 850, 852 (8th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Andreas, </em>216 F.3d 645, 676 (7th Cir.2000)). The language in Application Note 4 referring to an \u201cupward departure\u201d comes from Section \u201cB\u201d of the Application Note, which is entitled \u201cDetermining the Number of Images\u201d and which applies \u201c[f]or purposes of determining the number of images under subsection (b)(7).\u201d Contrary to the view expressed by the government and the court, the plain meaning of the Application Note is that an upward departure <em>in the number of images used to apply the sentencing enhancement at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7) </em>\u2014 not an upward departure from the guidelines as a whole \u2014 may be warranted when those images cannot properly be tabulated by the counting procedures enumerated in the body of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had he Sentencing Commission wished to provide for an upward departure <em>from the guidelines </em>based on the number of images or the length of videos, it easily could have done so in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 6, entitled \u201cUpward Departure Provision.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Because the Commission did not do so, and because the plain meaning of Application Note 4 refers to a procedure for counting images under the guidelines in order to \u201ccalculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentence,\u201d <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247, rather than a procedure for departing from the guidelines, Application Note 4 could not have justified the court\u2019s sentence in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The District Court did also justify its sentence by reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, had the court clearly specified that Brown\u2019s sentence was the result of a variance, perhaps any misinterpretation of the Application Note would have constituted harmless error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, in view of the possibility that the court intended to formulate a departure, rather than a variance, from the guidelines, and given the court\u2019s invocation of its erroneous interpretation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 4, we cannot be confident that the court would have arrived at the same conclusion had it properly construed the Application Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">For the reasons given, we will VACATE the judgment of the District Court and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\">.

But it is also the case that the government's sentencing memorandum was itself not entirely clear about the distinction between a departure and a variance. Although the memorandum relied on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the memorandum also noted that \"Application Notes 4(B)(i) and (ii) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 suggest that the number of images of child pornography and the length of videos/movies of child pornography are areas where courts are warranted in making upward variances or departures from the sentencing guidelines range.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\">. The following two hypothetical situations may help to clarify the intended meaning of the Application Note. First, we may consider a case in which a single pornographic photograph involves four minors: Application Note 4(B)(i) might encourage a judge to count the single photograph as four images, rather than as just one, for the purposes of determining the number of images under subsection (b)(7), because, in such a case, the number of images (one) underrepresents the number of minors depicted (four). Second, we may consider a case (e.g. the instant matter) in which a defendant possesses a video of substantially more than 5 minutes: Application Note 4(B)(ii) might encourage a judge to count the video as more than 75 images because, in such a case, the number of images (75) under-represents the severity of the video when compared to a shorter video (e.g. a thirty-second video) that also otherwise counts as 75 images for the purposes of determining the number of images under subsection (b)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\">. That application note provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_U\">Upward Departure Provision. \u2014 If the defendant engaged in the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor at any time (whether or not such abuse or exploitation occurred during the course of the offense or resulted in a conviction for such conduct) and subsection (b)(5) does not apply, an upward departure may be warranted. In addition, an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(5) but that enhancement does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the sexual abuse or exploitation involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7S\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 6. Unlike Application Note 4, which deals with the way in which a sentencing court should apply a sentencing enhancement from the body of \u00a7 2G2.2 (namely the enhancement from Subsection (b)(7)), Application Note 6's plain language speaks to an upward departure <em>beyond </em>that already available pursuant to the body of \u00a7 2G2.2 (namely the enhancement from Subsection (b)(5)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\">. It is true that, as a general matter, use of the term \u201cupward departure\u201d in the guidelines \"means departure that effects a sentence greater than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence that is otherwise greater than the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 Application Note 1(E) (defining terms \u201cthat are used frequently in the guidelines and are of general applicability\u201d). In this case, however, the plain meaning of that term, taken in context, is different. <em>See </em>U.S.S.C. \u00a7 2G2.2 Application Note 4(B) (\"For purposes of determining <em>the number </em>of images under subsection (b)(7) ... [i]f the length of recording is substantially more than 5 minutes, an upward departure may be warranted\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b254-17\">. In that event, we would have proceeded to analyze the variance for reasonableness. We would also observe, but without a conclusive ruling, that we have certain reservations about whether the District Court adequately addressed Brown's argument that his personal history and characteristics \u2014 his age, poor health, lack of criminal history, strong family support, and admission of guilt \u2014 make his likelihood of recidivism minimal. <em>See United States v. Levinson, </em>543 F.3d 190, 196 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cIn each case ... we <em>must have an explanation </em>from the [Djistrict [CJourt sufficient for us to see that the particular circumstances of the case have been given meaningful consideration within the parameters of \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
