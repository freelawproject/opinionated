Action by Oarlock against Tap-pan &amp; Tappan for damages for infringement \u2022of a patent. There was a verdict for plaintiff at November term, 1841; and at April term, 1S42, he moved to increase the dam\u25a0ages assessed, under Act July 4, 1S30 (5 Stat. 123), which provides that whenever, in any \u25a0action for the infringement of a patent, a verdict shall be rendered for the plaintiff, \u201cit shall be in the power of the court to ren\u25a0der judgment for any sum above the amount found by such verdict as the actual damages \u2022sustained by the plaintiff, not exceeding three times the amount thereof.\u201d] The defendants oppose the motion, and also contend that plaintiff is not entitled to judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">On the trial it appeared that plaintiff was patentee of a patent for shipping stocks, granted August 9, 1831. He assigned one-half the amount to Arrowsmith, May 18, 1839, and Arrowsmith reassigned to the pat-entee the same one-half Jan. 30, 1S3S. The jury, by their verdict, found the damages for violation of the patent previous to the assignment at $120, and between that and the reassignment (1S38). $1,241.70, and subsequent to July, 1S38, $1,000. The plaintiff \u2022claimed he was entitled to one-half of the two first sums, and treble the amount of the total. The defendant insisted that plaintiff could not recover in his separate action for his joint interest, so long as Arrowsmith was part owner, etc.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-11\">Staples &amp; Dana, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b78-12\">Silliman &amp; Mitchell, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b78-13\">PER GURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajx\">If the defendant intended to object that another was justly interested with the plaintiff in the patent, he should have pleaded in abatement. The rule in England and this state is well settled, that a party having a common interest may sue in a separate action, and recover his individual injuries actions of tort. 1 Johns. 471; 6 Johns. 108; 8 Johns. 151; 6 Durn. &amp; E. [6 Term R.] 766; 7 Durn. &amp; E. [7 Term R.] 279; 1 Chit. Pl. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">On the question as to the construction of the statute of 1S3G, increasing the damages, THE COURT ruled, that the jury had fixed the actual damages, which could only be varied by the court on satisfactory proofs that the plaintiff ought, by way of protection or smart money, to recover further damages.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
