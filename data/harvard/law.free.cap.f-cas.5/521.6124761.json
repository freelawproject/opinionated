The defendants\u2019 answer to the bill of complaint alleges, among other things, that this invention was not new, but, before the date of the alleged invention, was known and used, among others, by Kasson Fraser, of Syracuse. The evidence in the case shows, conclusively, the use, by Fraser and others, as early as 1853, at Syracuse, of buckles provided with such a wing or flange as is described in the complainant\u2019s patent, \u2022and attached to a strap in the described manner. This is a perfect defence to the claim in the patent of the complainant, as the evidence proves an extensive use of the Fraser \u25a0buckle since 1853. Bill dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
