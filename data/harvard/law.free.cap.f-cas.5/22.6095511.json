The respondents set up that the master of the brig allowed her to be seized for debts incurred for her at Port an Prince, and they advanced moneys there to free the vessel to the amount of $511.10. and the balance,$1SS.90, they paid after suit brought. The question was whether what they had paid at Port au Prince was to be credited upon the charter money beyond the $150 specified in the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-16\">Ordered, that it be referred to a commissioner to ascertain whether the sum of money paid by the respondents to the master of the vessel at Port au Prince, or upon his draft at that place, or paid the libel-ants since the commencement of the suit, satisfies in full the $700 payable on- the charter party, together with costs of suit due at the time of payment thereof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
