Judge of the Court of Admiralty of the State of Pennsylvania:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-14\">\u201cThe bill of Manuel Sagas de Ca\u00f1izares respectfully sheweth: That Donju\u00e1n Joseph de Aguire Perez, of the city of Cadiz, in the kingdom of old Spain, now resident in the city of Philadelphia, was and is owner of a certain brigantine called the Santissima Trinidad; and that Narisco Sanchez y Serna was commander of the said brigantine, being thereto properly authorized and appointed, the said brigantine being of the burthen of 120 tons, or thereabouts. That the said Na-risco Sanchez y Serna, being on the high seas and within the jurisdiction of this court, viz. at the Havannah, in the island of Cuba, was under the necessity of taking up money on the freight and property of the said brigantine, the said brigantine having suffered by storms and tempests on the high seas, and the crew of the said brigantine being in want of provisions. In consequence whereof, and from the prolongation of the voyage thereby occasioned, the said Narisco Sanchez, y Serna did then and there, upon the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of this court, borrow from Santiago Cupisono the sum of 200 Mexican' dollars, equal to the sum of \u00a375 lawful money of Pennsylvania; in consideration whereof, the said Narisco Sanchez, y Serna did, on the 6th day of June, 1788, on the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of this court, by a certain writing, with the proper hand of the said Narisco Sanchez y Serna, then captain, thereto subscribed, (which said writing is here exhibited to this-court) contract, covenant and agree with the said Santiago Cupisono, and to him did hy-pothecate the said brigantine, and her freight,, in the words following, viz. (The contract, in the Spanish language), the meaning and purport of which words are as follows, to-wit: \u2018Received of Mr. Santiago Cupisono the sum of two hundred dollars, current money of Mexico, for the victualling and first expenses of the brigantine, which sum I will pay at first sight, in the name of the owner Don Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez, who is in Philadelphia: which cash I receive, mortgaging the freight, the brigantine and her<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rigging, as the said Santiago Cupisono has lent me the above sum for the advantage of the vessel at Havannah. June 6th, 178S. Narisco Sanchez y Serna.\u2019 And afterwards, to \\vit, on the 13th day of August, in the-year of our lord last aforesaid, the said Santiago Cupisono, by his endorsement on the-said writing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with his proper hand thereto-subscribed, did order the contents to be paid to your libellant. And your libellant in fact says, that the said brigantine did arrive safely from the port of Havannah to the port of Philadelphia on the 12th day of October in the present yeai. And the said Narisco Sanchez y Serna, the said captain, did not, neither did the said Don Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez, owner of the same brigantine, pay, or cause to be paid, to your libellant, the said sum of 200 dollars, or any part thereof, which, according to the true intent and meaning of the said writings, so as aforesaid exhibited, the said Narisco Sanchez y Serna, and the said Don Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez ought to have paid to your libellant; although your libellant hath demanded the said sum both from the same Narisco Sanchez y Serna, the eaptain. and the said Don Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez, the owner, at Philadelphia aforesaid. And your libellant begs leave further to represent, that your li-bellant is an able seaman and pilot, well acquainted with the several harbours in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>island of Cuba, and on the continent of North America, and, as such, was shipped on hoard the brigantine Santissima Trinidad ai Havannah, by Narisco Sanchez y Serna, now \u25a0or late captain, master and commander of the said brigantine, at the monthly wages in the account hereunto annexed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> mentioned; tr \u25a0sail from the said port of Havannah to tin; port of Philadelphia; and that it was stipulated by and between the said captain and .your libellant, that in case the owners of the said brigantine should think proper to discharge your libellant at the port of Philadelphia, in such case, your libellant should receive three months\u2019 wages, and be furnished with a passage back to the said port of Ha-vannah.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That the said brigantine did accordingly sail from the port of Havannah and arrive at the port of Philadelphia, and .your libellant continued on board the said brigantine during all the said voyage, and did his duty as a seaman and a pilot aforesaid, until the said vessel arrived at the port \u25a0of Philadelphia, and your libellant was discharged from doing any more duty on board 'the said brigantine by the captain and owner thereof. And although your libellant hath requested the said captain and the said owner to pay him three months\u2019 wages, and to furnish him with a passage back to the Ha-wannah, according to the agreement aforesaid, yet the said captain and owner have hitherto refused, and still do refuse, to do the same. \"Wherefore, your libellant prays, that the process of this honourable court may issue against the said brigantine, and that :she may be condemned by a sentence and decree of this honourable court, and that the said brigantine may be sold, and the money .arising from such sale may be applied to the payment of the said several sums due to your libellant.

The one founded on an hy-pothecation of the said vessel, made by the then captain to Santiago Cupisono at Ha-vannah, for 200 dollars advanced by the said Cupisono for necessaries for the said brigantine, as it is said, and to enable her to prosecute her voyage; which instrument of hy-pothecation is endorsed or assigned over by the lender to the present libellant: and the other, founded on a written contract between the said Narisco Sanchez y Serna, then captain, and Ca\u00f1izares, the libellant, made at Havannah, respecting the wages he should receive for serving as pilot and mariner on board the said brigantine, in her voyage from Havannah to Philadelphia. As these' claims arise from different contracts, it is manifest that they must be separately considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-22\">To determine on the force of this instrument of bottomry, I shall first state the circumstances necessary to the formation of a genuine hypothecation, according to the maritime law; and then take a view of the history of this vessel\u2019s voyage, and her situation at the Havannah, when Cupisono advanced the money in question. As to the first, I have had occasion, in three former suits in this court, to state the doctrine respecting a maritime hypothecation, and have not since found reason to alter my opinion of the principles on which these causes were decided. The cases to which I refer were Liebart v. The Emperor [Case No. 8,340], Turnbull v. The Enterprize [Id. 14,242], and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Forbes v. The Hannah [Id. 4,925]. The first and third of these causes were carried into the high court of errors and appeals, were there again solemnly argued and considered, and, without the intervention of any new testimony to alter the case, the sentences of the admiralty were confirmed on the same, or nearly the same, principles. I can only now repeat the substance of what was then observed. (Here the judge recapitulated the doctrines advanced, and the authorities cited in the three foregoing causes, and then proceeded to say:)</p>\n<p id=\"b17-3\">\u201cI shall now state the history of the voyage of this brigantine, as the same may be deduced from the testimony exhibited.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears, that this vessel was chartered on account of the Ring of Spain, and was to sail from Philadelphia with a cargo of flour for Carthagena; that the flour was there to be sold, and a cargo of dye-wood purchased and brought back to Philadelphia, or some port of the United States. Such was the designated voyage. But. it seems, the captain, instead of returning to Philadelphia from Carthagena, went to Jamaica with an adventure of his own; to what amount does not appear. That at Jamaica he purchased dry goods fit for the Havannah market, and then sailed with the brig to Havannah, where he disposed of the goods he had bought at Jamaica, on his own account.' That at Havannah he borrowed 200 dollars of Cupisono, and executed the instrument called an hypothecation, to engage the vessel and her freight to Cupisono as security for this sum. That part of this money was expended in paying wages to the sailors, and part in supplying them with fresh provisions. That the vessel was refitted at the king\u2019s arsenal, and at the expense of the intendant. And that she afterwards sailed for and arrived at the port of Philadelphia. I agree with the counsel for the libellant, that the validity of an hypothecation ought not to depend upon the regularity of the captain\u2019s conduct with respect to his owners, previous to the time of her arrival in a foreign port, and of lending money for the relief of the ship\u2019s necessities; and will go farther, and say, that neither ought it to be affected by the captain\u2019s subsequent conduct, provided the lender was in no ways privy to, or knowingly assistant in, his obliquities.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>It has been urged on the other side, that the law of hypothecation was designed solely for the benefit of the owners, and an inference drawn, that if it can be shewn that the owners of a vessel have not been benefited, but injured, by the captain\u2019s conduct and consequent hypothecation, it ought not to be allowed. But this law has for its object the good of commerce in general. And no stranger would lend money on hypothecation, if his lien on the ship was to be invalidated by some future proof that the voyage was irregular, or that the captain had deviated from the orders of his owners and injured their interests, either before or after the hypothecation made. But where shall we find, in the present case, that necessity which should justify the captain\u2019s conduct, and be the ground of a genuine hypothecation? This vessel was chartered by the king of Spain or his agent, the cargo on board was on the king's account, and she arrives in a leaky and disabled condition in one of his majesty\u2019s ports, where he had an officer stationed. This officer, the intendant, orders the brig to the public warehouse to be discharged, and then round to hie king\u2019s arsenal to be repaired; all which was done at the king\u2019s expense. In truth, I cannot conceive a case of less necessity, or one wherein a more certain and able relief could be depen Jed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-3\">But, it is said, there were considerable delays before the intendant interfered, and that the captain was obliged to send in five or six memorials, and in the mean time the mariners were in great want of wages and fresh provisions, and that in this necessity the captain applied to Cupisono for 200 dollars, who refused to lend them unless the vessel should be hypothecated for his security. It appears, however, by the deposition, that the money was lent by Cupisono before the captain had made any application at all to the intendant, and therefore the neglect of the intendant could not have occasioned the necessity of borrowing money from Cupisono. That the captain of a vessel in the king's service, and in one of his majesty\u2019s ports, should not have credit for a few days' provisions, until the proper officer could bo applied to, is too incredible to be seriously admitted. Still less can it be a sufficient ground for an hypothecation, that the mariners must have wages paid to them, in a place where it does not appear that any wages wore due. nor is it probable that any could be due, because this was neither the conclusion of the voyage, nor even a port of delivery. The- money ought to have been lent solely on the faith of the hypothecation, and not on any personal credit; but here was a strong and well founded credit, for it is in testimony that Cupisono knew that this brig was chartered for the king's service, and it is expressly said, that the money was borrowed to pay wages and procure fresh provisions until money could be had from the intendant</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">Further, in the quotation from Molloy, b-ii. c. 11. s. 11. it is said: \u201cWhen a master is out of the country, and where he hath no-owners, nor any goods of theirs, nor of his own,\u201d &amp;c. Now it \u25a0 is confest that the captain had property of his own, and, as it should seem, to a considerable amount, since it was sufficient to induce him to violate his duty to his owners, in taking the brig, contrary to their orders,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on a trading voyage to Jamaica for his own benefit; that at Jamaica he bought goods suitable for the Havan-nah market, and actually sold them at Hav-annah, though contraband \u2014 -and that Cupiso-no, the lender, was privy to these circumstances. So that, instead of the lender\u2019s having the brig alcne to look to for his security, he had two substantial persona-' credits to depend upon, viz. the intendan* from whom he might expect repayment of moneys advanced for the use of a vessel in the king\u2019s employ, and the captain, whose property he might have attached before he left the island, if satisfaction was not made. This circumstance alone, that is to say, Cupisono\u2019s knowledge that th\u00e9 captain had property of his own on the spot, sufficient to answer the present exigencies of the vessel, would have invalidated the bond as a maritime hypothecation, inasmuch as it removes that necessity which the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">There is a circumstance in the present case, which, although not in itself conclusive, forms too striking a feature in the transaction to pass unnoticed. A singularity peculiar in a maritime hypothecation is, that the law allows an extraordinary premium or interest to the lender, even to any extent, according to the risk to be run; because, if the ship should be lost, the money lent is. lost with her. But here a stranger lends 200 dollars to a captain in distress, without even stipulating for common legal interest for the use of his money. I say, this alone might not be conclusive against the hypothecation, because a stranger may be as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>generous as be pleases; but, in connexion with the other circumstances, it gives room for suspicion that the engagement of the brig to Cupisono was not made within the rules and spirit of the maritime law. For the above reasons, I adjudge that the bill in this cause be dismissed, so far as the same hath respect to a claim of 200 dollars, said to have been lent on the credit of the brig Santissima Trinidad.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-3\">I am now to consider the libellant\u2019s demand of wages for serving as pilot and mariner on board this vessel from Havannah to I-\u2019hiladelpliia. The counsel for the libellant hath rested his claim of \u00a3S7 5s. for wages, on a written contract made at the Havan-nah, between Fariseo Sanchez y Serna, then captain, and Ca\u00f1izares. But it has been contended, on the other side, that as this agreement is in writing, and bears a seal, and is not, according to the terms thereof, in the usual way of agreeing for mariners\u2019 wages, it becomes a special contract, and is not properly of admiralty jurisdiction. Its being in writing, however, is no more than a testimony or memorandum of the agreement made, and does not affect the jurisdiction of this court. What is called a seal, appears to be nothing more than a printed stamp, for which a duty is paid to the crown: certainly, it is not the seal of the parties, or of either of them. But, as to the terms of the contract, these are indeed out of the usual course, and deserve further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-4\">One of the reasons for allowing mariners to sue in the admiralty for their wages is, that the debt arises from services performed, or to be performed, at sea; and a lien on the ship is given them for security, because the contract they make is supposed to be on the credit of the ship. Now, although the wages of 20 dollars per month, promised in the present case, appear to be extravagant, yet as the difficulty of getting a person qualified to serve both as a skilful pilot and able mariner might have been great, I think the rate of wages per month ought to be allowed as contracted for. But I cannot, upon any principle, allow, that a captain hath a power to bind his owners and their vessel to the payment of a mariner\u2019s wages for three months after his discharge, and after all services at sea or elsewhere have ceased. If he could legally do this for three months, why not for six or for twelve months, or even saddle his owners with an annuity for life to a mariner, for a few weeks\u2019 actual service? How far the common law might consider this contract as binding on the captain personally, it is not my business to say; but, as judge of admiralty, I shall be far from doing my part towards establishing a precedent by which captains, in addition to the great power they necessarily have over the property of their employers, may have that of obliging them to the payment of unlimited sums for an unlimited time. The captain might have engaged for his owners, to pay wages per month during the service, or a specific sum for the run, to any amount justifiable by the circumstances and necessities of the case; but to bind the owner to periodical payments to a mariner, after a total discharge from the service, is what I believe no captain of a vessel ever before attempted. For, whether this was to be paid all at once, or at three several times, it matters not; the contract is for three months\u2019 wages after discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">There is another claim under this contract for CO dollars, to take the libellant back to the Havannah, on being discharged here. The maritime custom is, that if a master or owner, discharge a mariner in a foreign port, before the completion of the voyage for which he is engaged, some reasonable allowance shall be made, over and above the wages due, to enable him to return to his own country, or to go to the port which, by the articles, should have completed the voyage. And this allowance is usually the amount of one month\u2019s wages. And it is a reasonable custom, where the mariner is willing to perform articles and finish the voyage, but the master or owner thinks fit to discharge him sooner, for their own convenience, and without just cause of complaint against the mariner. This part of the contract before us is, therefore, consistent with maritime custom, but certainly unreasonable as to the sum promised. Whatever power a captain may have by law to bind his owners by contracts made abroad for the services of the ship, yet he cannot oblige them beyond what is usual and customary, without shewing that the unusual charge arose from tlie necessity of the case. The present charge is expressly made for conveying the libellant back to the Havannah. I have therefore inquired what is the usual charge for a passage from this port to the Havan-nah, and find that 40 dollars is an ample and generous allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajv\">Fraud and collusion between the captain and Ca\u00f1izares, the libellant, have been suggested, but not proved. let, if I had not found that this cause might and ought to be determined on general principles, there are two circumstances in the case which would have induced a more strict inquiry into this captain's conduct. The one, which I have already noticed, is Cupisono\u2019s lending money on hypothecation, without securing or even asking for common interest; which, though a possible, is not a usual occurrence. The other, is a contract between the captain and Ca\u00f1izares, which concludes with these remarkable words \u2014 \u201cEach,\u201d (that is, the original and copy) \u201chaving the same strength as if they had been executed before a notary public at Havannah.\u201d The question naturally occurs, and why was not this contract made and executed before a notary public 'at the Havannah? An honest captain, who is reduced to the necessity of binding his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>owners to hard and unusual terms, would at least take care that nothing should be wanting in point of form and public notoriety to justify his conduct. And, besides, 1 suspect that this contract, which bears a printed seal, or stamp, could not be legally executed, according to the regulations of the Spanish maritime laws and customs, but in the presence of a notary, or some public officer. But it was not necesary to clear up these appearances, as the cause may be decided on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">Upon the whole, I adjudge and decree, that Ca\u00f1izares, the libellant, have and receive from Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez, the respondent, the sum of 112 dollars and G0-00ths of a dollar, equal to \u00a342 5s. Pennsylvania currency \u2014 that is to say\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">For five months and nineteen days\u2019 \u00a3. s. d. wages, from July 1st to December 19th, at twenty dollars per month.. 42 5 0</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">For his passage to the Havannah.. 15 0 0 \u00a9 <em>IG </em>lO</p>\n<p id=\"A3H\">O O o F* <em>% </em>*5 g n3 - \u00bf3 a a* o <em>a u </em>fa</p>\n<p id=\"AM-\">There remains. 42 5 0</p>\n<p id=\"A4n\">With respect to the \u00a35 12s. Gd. added to the account, and charged for a month\u2019s boarding, I shall take no further notice of it than to observe, that it is neither mentioned in the libel, nor supported by any vouchers or testimony whatever. Finally, I adjudge, that the libellant pay one half, and that the respondent pay the other half, of the costs and charges of this suit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b17-4\"> There was but one deposition produced in this cause, viz. that of the late captain of the brig. It might have been a question, whether his testimony was legally admissible or not, but he was not objected to as a witness by the proctors for either side. His deposition was in these words: \"Inarisco Sanchez y Serna, a witness produced on the part of the libellant in this cause, on his solemn oath on the holy Evangelists of Almighty God, saith: That he, this deponent, received the 200 dollars mentioned in the libel (he being then captain of the said brigantine at the Havannah) of Cupisono, by the hands of the libellant; which money, or any part thereof, he, the deponent, hath not paid to Cupisono again; and that he employed the said money in paying wages to the crew, and in furnishing fresh provisions, until he should receive money from the intendant. That a survey was ordered upon the vessel, and a report made to the intendant, and he then received a verbal order to take his vessel from the bay to the upper part of the harbour. _ where the king's warehouses are. there to discharge, and after that to Transport his vessel to the king's arsenal, where she was repaired and had a new bottom. That he, the deponent, had no money, nor any person to whom he could apply to obtain the same. That the vessel leaked before he went into the Havannah to such a degree, as to make more than thirty inches of water in an hour. That he never knew Mr. Cupisono: but he had had three or four days\u2019 acquaintance with the libel-lant. That he requested the libellant to borrow him some money, and he took him to Mr. Cupisono\u2019s, where the money was paid to him. That the paper marked \u2018A,\u2019 exhibited in this' cause and shown to him, is a contract made between the libellant and the deponent. That at the house of Cupisono. the said Cupisono insisted upon the vessel and freight being hypothecat-ed to him, otherwise he would not lend the money. That Cupisono knew that the vessel put in in distress \u2014 that every body knew it. and that he, the deponent, had told Cupisono of it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b17-5\">\u201cBeing erossexamined, he saith, that the sailing orders (marked \u2018B\u2019) are the sailing orders he received. That the paper (marked \u2018C\u2019) is the charter-party signed between him and the freighter. That the paper (marked \u2018D\u2019) is the account delivered- by the deponent, on his return, to his owners. Being asked how he came to apply to the intendant for money, he saith, that he presented a memorial to him for that purpose. Being asked whether he got any money in consequence of the memorial, he says, that he did not; but he was obliged to present five or six memorials. Being asked, how long after he arrived at the Havannah he presented a memorial, he answers, that he received the money from Cupisono the first Sunday after his arrival. Being asked on what day he arrived at the Havannah. he answers, that he does not remember whether it was on Thursday or Wednesday; that the memorial was presented to tht intendant alter the money was received from Cupisono. That in the conversation he had with Cupisono, he told him that he expected to receive money from the intendant, as he was chartered on account of the king. That he took on board a passenger at St. Martha, who was to proceed with him to this country.
