Aguilar timely appealed the judgment of the district court. Because of his conviction on these charges, the district court also revoked Aguilar\u2019s supervised release related to a 2004 conviction of transportation of an unlawful alien. Aguilar gave timely notice of his appeal from that order as well, and the two appeals have been consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">During Aguilar\u2019s jury trial, Government witnesses testified regarding Aguilar\u2019s pri- or arrests for alien smuggling and Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction for transporting illegal aliens. In addition, Aguilar was cross-examined regarding a prior arrest. Aguilar contends that the district court reversibly erred in admitting this testimony. He contends that the extrinsic conduct had \u201cno probative value\u201d because other testimony by Government witnesses was sufficient to show that he had a plan to circumvent the border patrol checkpoint. Aguilar also contends that his prior bad acts were prejudicial because they were criminal in nature and because the district court allowed the Government to introduce cumulative evidence of multiple previous incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">The admission of evidence under Fed. R.Evid. 404(b) is reviewed under a heightened abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>70 F.3d 818, 831 (5th Cir.1995). To be admissible under Rule 404(b), extrinsic offense evidence (1) must be \u201crelevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character\u201d and (2) \u201cmust possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of [Fed.R.Evid.] 403.\u201d <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc). Because Aguilar\u2019s plea of not guilty placed his intent at issue for purposes of Rule 404(b), <em>see United States v. Pompa, </em>434 F.3d 800, 805 (5th Cir.2005), his claim turns on whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction and arrests were probative because they were similar to the charged offense; indeed, the circumstances of his prior arrest on May 14, 2007, involved the same maroon Suburban along the same 1-35 corridor as the instant offense conduct. <em>See Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 915. In addition, the extrinsic evidence was not of a \u201cheinous nature\u201d such that it would \u201cincite the jury to irrational decision by its force on human emotion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction and 33-month prison term for transporting illegal aliens lessened the likelihood of the jury desiring to punish Aguilar for his prior offenses. <em>See id. </em>There is no reason to believe that the admission of the extrinsic evidence was \u201clikely to confuse the issues, mislead the jury, cause undue delay, or waste time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Aguilar does not dispute that the prejudicial effect of admitting the extrinsic evidence was mitigated by the district court\u2019s limiting instructions; nor does he contend that the instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>were otherwise inadequate. <em>See United States v. White, </em>972 F.2d 590, 599 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, Aguilar has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence. <em>See Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 914, 917 &amp; n. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Aguilar contends that, in the event that his conviction is vacated, the court should also vacate the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release. Because we have determined that the instant conviction should be affirmed, it follows that the district court\u2019s order revoking Aguilar\u2019s supervised release should also be affirmed. <em>See United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
