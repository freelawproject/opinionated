On appeal, Howard argues that the district court erred in part because it dismissed his action based on failure to file his Title VII and ADEA claims within the ninety-day statutory deadline. He also alleges that the court erred in dismissing his action without permitting him to amend his complaint to add Equal Pay Act and state law tort claims. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">We conduct a de novo review of the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (6). <em>Etape v. Chertoff, </em>497 F.3d 379, 382 (4th Cir.2007). We may affirm a district court\u2019s judgment on any ground supported by the record. <em>Suter v. United States, </em>441 F.3d 306, 310 (4th Cir.2006). After reviewing the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix and supplemental joint appendix, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Howard v. U.S. Army, </em>No. 1:06-cv-00783-GBL (E.D.Va. Apr. 27, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
