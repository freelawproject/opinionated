Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the gang violence Diaz experienced did not constitute past persecution or establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; therefore, she has not shown an entitlement to asylum. <em>See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444-45 (5th Cir.2001). Because Diaz has failed to satisfy the requirements for asylum, she has also failed to satisfy the requirements for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 667 (5th Cir.2002). Diaz has inadequately briefed the issue whether she is entitled to relief under the CAT, and it is therefore waived. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
