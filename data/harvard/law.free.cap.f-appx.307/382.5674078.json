Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Decisions based on a legal' determination are reviewed <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the [IJj\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (<em>en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">An alien may receive asylum if he can carry the burden of proving that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d which is defined as: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) \u201cUncorroborated but credible testimony from the applicant may be sufficient alone to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818-19 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail ... [himself] of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Accordingly, to be eligible for asylum, \u201cthe alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of [his] political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that [his] political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b)). We have recognized that an alien\u2019s imputed political opinion satisfies the requirement that persecution be based on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1289. To establish persecution by a guerilla group on account of a political opinion, the petitioner must establish that the guerillas persecuted him, or will seek to persecute him in the future, because of his actual or imputed political opinion. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIt is not enough to show that [he] was or will be persecuted or tortured due to [his] refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u2018well-founded fear,\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the [government].\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Withholding of removal may be granted if the alien establishes that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). If an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution on the basis of a protected ground, and he would not be able to avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find no reversible error. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination that Gutierrez did not establish past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution based on a protected ground because the guerilla threats alleged by him constituted only criminal extortion efforts, and were not based on an imputed political opinion or other protected ground. Essentially, Gutierrez\u2019 testified that he believed that the FARC was demanding money from him and his company, Coca Cola, in the form of a tax, to pay for the existence of each of the trucks that the company had in the region and to support the guerillas. Gutierrez did not offer any evidence to show that the persecution that he faced was because of an imputed political opinion, as he did not: (1) assert what his imputed political opinion was; (2) establish that the FARC imputed a political opinion to him as a result of his unwillingness to pay them; or (3) show any causal connection between his political opinion and the persecution. Accordingly, we affirm the BIA\u2019s conclusion and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-14\">. Gutierrez has abandoned his claim for CAT relief by not arguing it on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (\"[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
