Bridwell and Gee moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and the district court entered summary judgment for Bridwell on the \u00a7 1983 claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the state law claim, remanding it to state court. Brienza filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59(e). The district court granted the motion, holding that Bridwell was not entitled to qualified immunity, and vacated its prior order entering summary judgment for Bridwell. Bridwell takes this interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s order of June 15, 2008, denying him qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">A brief was filed on behalf of Sheriff Gee, who is sued only in his official capacity. Qualified immunity is not available to Sheriff Gee in his official capacity, and he does not argue that it is. There being no final judgment, Sheriff Gee\u2019s appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">Brienza\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim alleges a Fourth Amendment violation. Brienza claims that Bridwell arrested him for driving under the influence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.193, without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">Bridwell is entitled to qualified immunity, and thus summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claim, if there was \u201carguable probable cause\u201d to arrest Brienza. <em>Von Stein v. Brescher, </em>904 F.2d 572, 579 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cArguable probable cause\u201d exists if a reasonable officer, in the same situation and with the same knowledge as Bridwell, could have believed under the totality of the circumstances that probable cause existed to arrest Brienza for a DUI offense. <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). This is an appeal of the denial of a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Bridwell is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>entitled to qualified immunity only if the undisputed facts show that \u2018arguable probable\u2019 cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Given the undisputed facts, a reasonable officer in Bridwell\u2019s position could have concluded that there was probable cause to arrest Brienza for a DUI violation. A violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.193 occurs when a person drives a car while under the influence of alcohol or certain other chemical substances to the extent that the person\u2019s \u201cnormal faculties are impaired.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.193(l)(a). Here, Bridwell pulled Brienza over for an alleged speeding violation. (R.23 at 30-31.) After Bridwell turned on his lights and siren, Brienza admits he handled his car in an \u201cawkward\u201d fashion and failed to pull entirely onto the shoulder, leaving a portion of his car on the road. (R.23 at 29-30.) When Bridwell first spoke with Brienza, he thought he detected the odor of alcohol. (R.21 at 34.) When asked about this odor, Brienza stated that he had just used mouthwash. (R.23 at 31.) Bridwell\u2019s experience in law enforcement has been that those who have been drinking and driving will often attempt to explain the odor of alcohol as mouthwash. (R.22 at 19.) Finally, Brienza did not fully comply with the instructions given to him by Bridwell during the field sobriety test. (R.23 at 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Because \u201carguable probable cause\u201d is determined by the facts and circumstances present at the time of the arrest, <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 207, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2159, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), the results of Brienza\u2019s breath test and urinalysis tests are irrelevant to the question of whether a Fourth Amendment violation occurred when Bridwell arrested Brienza.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The breath and urinalysis tests, given after the arrest in question, show that there was no alcohol or prohibited chemical substance in Brienza\u2019s body. With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that Brienza should not have been arrested for driving under the influence. But, the undisputed facts show that Bridwell had \u201carguable probable cause\u201d to arrest Brienza on the DUI charge. Bridwell is entitled to qualified immunity, and thus summary judgment for Bridwell was appropriate. Accordingly we reverse the district court\u2019s Order entered on June 15th, 2008 in its entirety. We dismiss the appeal of Sheriff Gee for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">REVERSED IN PART, APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
