Because the district court\u2019s decision displays no reversible error of law or fact, we affirm. The district court\u2019s opinion adequately presents its reasoning and the relevant facts, and we write here merely to amplify three points.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-16\">First, the Bank of Louisiana insists that SunGard told Peggy Schaefer that she would have to ship either the missing back-up tapes or the bank\u2019s prohibitively heavy computer to SunGard\u2019s facilities in Smyrna, Georgia, and that SunGard would not provide any other assistance. If true, such an ultimatum might be evidence that SunGard breached its contract with the Bank to provide any of four different types of \u201cMobile Recovery Services.\u201d However, the Bank does not cite any evidence that a SunGard employee made this statement and failed to provide an affidavit claiming that this evidence exists. Instead, the Bank merely reiterates that this statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">Second, the Bank argues that SunGard was contractually obliged to be \u201cproactive\u201d and that SunGard\u2019s failure to suggest other recovery methods constituted breach of contract. Again, as the district court noted, the Bank does not point to evidence that it asked SunGard for Mobile Recovery Services covered by the contract, but not contemplated by the bank\u2019s disaster recovery plan, nor did the Bank submit an affidavit claiming that this evidence exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-18\">These two assertions are not evidence, and the Bank\u2019s claims, without more, are insufficient to show genuine issues of material fact. <em>See Douglass v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1429 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Cir.1996). Because the Bank fails to cite evidence that SunGard issued the alleged ultimatum or refused to provide contractually required services, SunGard is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law that it did not breach the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Finally, because SunGard is not liable for breach, the Bank did not have cause to terminate the contract. The Bank argues that the contract fails for lack of \u201cconsideration\u201d because the Bank altered its operations, making SunGard\u2019s services unnecessary. This argument mischaracterizes as consideration a party\u2019s benefit received under a contract for services performed. It is basic contract law \u2014 including in Pennsylvania, this contract\u2019s choice of law \u2014 that consideration is a bargained for performance or return promise required at the time of contract formation. <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>579 Pa. 618, 858 A.2d 91, 105-06 &amp; n. 5 (2004) (citing Restatement 2d of Contracts \u00a7 71 (1981)). The contract between the Bank and SunGard is a valid one, and the Bank does not argue otherwise. The Bank\u2019s \u201cconsideration\u201d argument as a justification for non-performance is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Instead, the Bank is really claiming that it was justified in withholding payment because the contract was no longer in its interest. Obviously, this is not a legal excuse for non-performance of contractual obligations. <em>See </em>Restatement 2d of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 261-72 (1981) (describing established excuses of performance). The Bank\u2019s failure to pay SunGard is therefore a breach of the contract for which the Bank was correctly required to pay damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
