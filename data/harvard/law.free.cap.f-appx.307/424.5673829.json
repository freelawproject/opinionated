United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court, in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, concluded that Kelley did not meet the requirements of the savings clause contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and dismissed his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>On appeal, Kelley argues that his actual innocence claim can be heard pursuant to section 2241 and that it was a fundamental miscarriage of justice for the district court not to render a merits determination of his claim. We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under section 2241. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Although collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence generally must be brought under section 2255, the savings clause of section 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to section 2241 in the following limited circumstance: if an otherwise available remedy under section 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. The burden of affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the section 2255 remedy rests with the prisoner. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), we explained that the savings clause applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) that decision establishes that the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [section] 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244. This showing is significant because a prisoner does not \u201copen the portal\u201d to a section 2241 proceeding until he has demonstrated that the savings clause applies to him. <em>See id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. \u201cOnce the savings clause ... applies to open the portal to a [section] 2241 proceeding, the proper inquiry ... will be whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence of the crime for which he has been convicted....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">We conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Kelley\u2019s section 2241 petition. While Kelley met the first part of the <em>Wofford </em>test because <em>Richardson </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, <em>see Ross v. United States, </em>289 F.3d 677, 681 (11th Cir.2002), we have determined that \u201ca <em>Richardson </em>claim is not the type of defect that opens the portal to a [section] 2241 proceeding,\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1366. In <em>Sawyer, </em>we explained that <em>Richardson </em>did not render CCE offenses nonexistent because that case merely clarified the standard by which a jury must find defendants guilty of those offenses. <em>Id. </em>Thus, because Kelley did not meet the second part of the <em>Wofford </em>test, he did not show that the savings clause applied to him. As such, Kelley failed to open the portal to a section 2241 proceeding, and the district court did not need to inquire into Kelley\u2019s actual innocence claim. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3 (actual innocence claims are considered only after the portal to a section 2241 proceeding has been opened).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-14\">. Kelley does not need a certificate of appeal-ability to proceed in this appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that a federal prisoner proceeding under section 2241 does not need a certificate of appealability to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-24\">. In <em>Richardson, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \"a jury in a federal criminal case brought under [section] 848 must unanimously agree not only that the defendant committed some 'continuing series of violations' but also that the defendant committed each of the individual 'violations' necessary to make up that \u2018continuing series.\u2019\u201d 119 S.Ct. at 1709.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\">. We decline to address arguments raised for the first time in Kelley's reply brief. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cissues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned\u201d on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
