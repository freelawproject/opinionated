After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In 1998, following a jury trial, Brodie was convicted of five crack-cocaine offenses relating to a scheme to import drugs into the United States. At the original sentencing, the district court imposed a 328-month sentence, in the middle of the then-applicable guidelines range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In May 2008, Brodie filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, amends. 706, 713. The. district court granted in part Brodie\u2019s motion and reduced Brodie\u2019s 328-month sentence to 264 months\u2019 imprisonment, in the middle of Brodie\u2019s new guidelines range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brodie appeals the extent of the reduction, arguing that the district court should have imposed a 235-month sentence, at the low end of the new guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">If a defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, the district court \u201cmay reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that, in determining the extent of any reduction, the court shall consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as the \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i)-(ii). \u201cThe court may consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment in determining ... the extent of such reduction. <em>...\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l (B)(iii). \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 762 (11th Cir.1998) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by reducing Brodie\u2019s sentence to the mid-point of the new, amended guidelines range. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, citing specifically the nature and seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, to deter other and to protect the public. The district court also considered Brodie\u2019s submissions relating to his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct, and concluded that, although these accomplishments were commendable, a low-end sentence would be insufficient to serve the purposes of sentencing. The district court also explained that, because Brodie was originally sentenced at the middle of the then-applicable guidelines range, a sentence at the middle of the amended range was appropriate. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760 (explaining that the district court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guidelines range and holding all other guidelines findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant). We cannot say that the refusal to extend the reduction to the low end of the new range was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">For the first time on appeal, Brodie argues that the district court should have imposed a sentence below the new range and that it is unclear whether the district court knew it had authority to do so under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Brodie did not ask for a sentence below the new range or raise his <em>Booker </em>argument in the district court, our review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In <em>United States v. Jones, </em>this Court concluded <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d 548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220). At first blush, this seems to resolve the issue. However, in <em>Jones, </em>there was no basis for entertaining a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion at all. Here, Bro-die\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that had been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The question thus becomes, once the district court determines that a defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, is the district court\u2019s discretion cabined by the new, amended guidelines range in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, or can the district court reduce the sentence further based on <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">The two circuits to address this question, have reached different answers. <em>See United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 840-41 (10th Cir.2008) (concluding that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence modifications and that a district court lacks authority to impose a sentence below the amended guideline range); <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167, 1172-73 (9th Cir.2007) (concluding that, after <em>Booker, </em>a district court can go below the amended guideline range in modifying a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u201cto the extent the [Sentencing Guidelines\u2019] policy statements are inconsistent with Booker by requiring the Guidelines to be treated as mandatory, the policy statements must give way\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">Because our review is for plain error only, we need not resolve this question here. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>the district court believed it lacked authority to reduce Brodie\u2019s sentence below the low end of the new guidelines range, any alleged <em>Booker </em>error was not plain given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>lack of binding precedent in our Circuit. In addition, the district court did not go as low as it could have gone under the amended guidelines range, which strongly suggests that the district court would not have imposed a below-guidelines sentence in Brodie\u2019s case even if it had believed <em>Booker </em>permitted it to do so. Finally, since the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to impose a sentence at the low end of the new guidelines range, we cannot say the district court committed plain error by failing to impose an even lower sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\">. Pursuant to the district court's instructions, the parties conferred and f\u00edled a joint stipulation that Brodie was eligible for a sentence reduction and that, under Amendment 706, Brodie\u2019s sentence could be reduced by as much as 93 months or to a total term of 235 months' imprisonment. Brodie requested that the court exercise its discretion and reduce the sentence to 235 months, and the government did not oppose this request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-10\">. We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b392-14\">. \"The factors to be considered under section 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the applicable sentencing range under the guidelines; (5) any pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statement; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims.\u201d <em>United States v.
