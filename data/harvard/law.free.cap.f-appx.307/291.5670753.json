For the reasons set out below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">In 2005, Francisco Domingo filed an \u201cApplication for Suspension of Deportation or Special Rule Cancellation of Removal,\u201d pursuant to the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act. The application provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that she was a native and citizen of Guatemala who had been living in the United States since her arrival in 1992. She lived in Florida with her husband, who was also a native and citizen of Guatemala, and her children, who were U.S. citizens. Her husband had filed an asylum application, which was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) served Francisco Domingo with a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d). The NTA alleged that she was removable for being an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">After granting Francisco Domingo a continuance, the IJ rescheduled the removal hearing for September 26, 2007. The IJ personally served Francisco Domingo with notice of this hearing, which also provided that \u201c[fjailure to appear for this hearing other than because of exceptional circumstances beyond your control will result in your being found ineligible for certain forms of relief____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">On September 26, 2007, the IJ ordered Francisco Domingo removed from the United States. He explained that Francisco Domingo did not attend the removal hearing, even though he had provided her with written notification and had warned that failure to appear would result in removal. Thus, the IJ conducted the hearing <em>in absentia, </em>pursuant to INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). The IJ stated that Francisco Domingo had conceded removability at a prior hearing and, therefore, he found \u201cremovability established as charged\u201d in the NTA. Finally, the IJ found that, as a result of Francisco Domingo\u2019s failure to appear, any previous applications for relief from removal were deemed \u201cabandoned and denied for lack of prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">On October 12, 2007, Francisco Domingo filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reopen the removal proceedings. She explained that she did not attend the removal hearing because the windshield wipers broke on the way there, and she could not continue driving because it was raining. She attached an affidavit from her husband, who confirmed this account. He added that the windshield wipers broke approximately one hour before Francisco Domingo\u2019s hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>was scheduled to begin and that, like Francisco Domingo, he was unable to attend his own immigration hearing that morning. He explained that he \u201ccould not call a taxi because [he] had little money to pay.\u201d Instead, he stated that he took the car to a mechanic. He attached the receipt from the repair shop, which indicated that he paid $175 in cash to repair a broken windshield wiper.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The IJ issued a decision denying Francisco Domingo\u2019s motion to reopen. The IJ found that Francisco Domingo had not established \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d excusing her failure to attend the hearing, as required under INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C). He explained that \u201c[t]he possibility of rain and minor car troubles are risks inherent to driving that should be reasonably anticipated,\u201d and there was no indication that Francisco Domingo attempted to contact the court \u201cat any time prior to the present motion.\u201d Thus, the IJ found the case to be \u201con par\u201d with <em>Magdaleno de Morales v. I.N.S., </em>116 F.3d 145 (5th Cir.1997) and <em>Skarma v. I.N.S., </em>89 F.3d 545 (9th Cir.1996), holding that mechanical failure and traffic/parking difficulties, respectively, did not constitute \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Finally, the IJ expressed concern with Francisco Domingo\u2019s husband\u2019s assertion that they did not have money to take a taxi, as the receipt from the repair shop indicated that they paid $175 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Francisco Domingo appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In her notice of appeal, she stated that she did not know why her motion was denied because her husband was also ordered removed as a result of his failure to attend his hearing, but the judge in his case reopened the proceedings. She filed a <em>pro se </em>brief in the BIA repeating the same point about her husband\u2019s case. For support, she attached a notification sent by the IJ in her husband\u2019s case, reflecting that the IJ had scheduled a hearing in the case for July 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">On May 16, 2008, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. The BIA first \u201cagree[d] with the Immigration Judge that the respondent failed to establish that these proceedings should be reopened based on exceptional circumstances.\u201d The BIA then rejected Francisco Domingo\u2019s argument that her husband\u2019s case had been reopened under the same circumstances. It explained that, while Francisco Domingo submitted evidence that her husband had a hearing scheduled in July 2008, she did not submit any proof that her husband was ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>or that his case was reopened based on the same set of facts. On June 16, 2008, Francisco Domingo petitioned this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">\u201cWe review only the Board\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, although the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, it did \u201cagree\u201d with the IJ that Francisco Domingo did not show exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant the reopening of her removal proceedings. Because the BIA appears to have incorporated the IJ\u2019s reasoning on this point, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">\u2018We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>review is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cGenerally, motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">An alien who fails to attend a removal proceeding \u201cshall be ordered removed in absentia if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable.... \u201d INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). Such an order may be rescinded \u201cupon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section)....\u201d INA \u00a7 240(b)(5)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i). Subsection (e)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">The term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">INA \u00a7 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The issue on appeal is whether the BIA abused its discretion by finding that Francisco Domingo did not show exceptional circumstances under \u00a7 1229a(e)(l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Francisco Domingo contends, as she did in her motion to reopen, that she could not attend the removal hearing because the windshield wipers on her car broke during a rainstorm on the drive to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The plain language of \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) undermines her argument. This is so because the statute provides that \u201cthe term \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 refers to ... battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, <em>but not including less compelling circumstances </em>.... \u201d INA \u00a7 240(e)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) (emphasis added). Driving with broken windshield wipers in a rainstorm appears to be far \u201cless compelling\u201d than circumstances involving battery, cruelty, illness, or death. Thus, Francisco Domingo\u2019s argument fails under the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">In addition, the IJ correctly relied on <em>Magdaleno de Morales </em>and <em>Sharma </em>to support his conclusion in this regard. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Magdaleno de Morales, </em>the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cthe mechanical failure of the petitioner\u2019s car on the way to the hearing did not constitute exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the Act.\u201d 116 F.3d at 148. And in <em>Shanna, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that \u201cPetitioners\u2019 traffic difficulties do not qualify as exceptional circumstances beyond Petitioners\u2019 control.\u201d 89 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Francisco Domingo does not point to any opposing authority, but rather attempts to distinguish <em>Magdaleno de Morales </em>and <em>Shanna </em>on the ground that those cases did not involve the life threatening situation of driving without windshield wipers in a rainstorm. However, this distinction is not persuasive because all three cases involved some sort of car trouble preventing the petitioner from arriving at the hearing on time; the specific type of car trouble is irrelevant. Further undermining Francisco Domingo\u2019s contention in this regard is the fact that her husband paid $175 in cash to repair the car, indicating that she could have used some of that money for a taxi ride to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Moreover, we have emphasized the significance of contacting the IJ in order to explain one\u2019s inability to attend a removal hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">Lonyem did not indicate that he made any effort to contact the Immigration Court on the day of his removal hearing to alert the IJ of his absence and to explain the reasons for it. Giving such notice of one\u2019s unavailability is a minimal and logical step that, if not taken, is a factor which tends to undermine a claim of exceptional circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-13\"><em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Similarly, the Fifth Circuit in <em>Magdaleno de Morales </em>emphasized the fact that, although the petitioner\u2019s car broke down approximately one hour before the hearing, the petitioners did not call the IJ to explain what had happened. <em>Id. </em>at 149. Indeed, the petitioners \u201cdid not attempt any further correspondence with the immigration court until over two weeks after their scheduled hearing, when they received notice of the in absentia order of deportation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">In this case, as in <em>Magdaleno de Morales, </em>the affidavit submitted by Francisco Domingo\u2019s husband provided that the windshield wipers broke approximately one hour before her hearing. Furthermore, the IJ was correct that nothing in the record indicates that Francisco Domingo attempted to contact the immigration court at any point before filing the motion to reopen. In this respect, the Fifth Circuit has stated: \u201cIn a matter of such overriding importance in an individual\u2019s life, we would expect such efforts to be made.\u201d <em>Magdaleno de Morales, </em>116 F.3d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">For the above reasons, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Francisco Domingo did not show \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) so as to warrant the reopening of her removal proceedings. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. Francisco Domingo\u2019s petition for review was timely because, although she filed it 31 days after the BIA's order, the 30th day fell on a Sunday, which gave her until the next business day to file it. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 26(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. Francisco Domingo does not challenge whether she received notice of the removal hearing or whether she was removable and, therefore, has abandoned these issues on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d). Nor does Francisco Domingo raise the primary argument that she raised in the BIA, namely that the IJ should have reopened her case because her husband\u2019s case was reopened. Accordingly, she has also abandoned this argument on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXY\">Francisco Domingo devotes much of her brief to arguing the merits of her prior application for cancellation of removal, as she emphasizes that her removal would result in extreme hardship for her and her family. However, this issue is outside the scope of this appeal, which is limited to the denial of her motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
