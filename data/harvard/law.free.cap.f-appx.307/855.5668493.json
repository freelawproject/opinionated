He was sentenced to a total of 465 months of imprisonment. He now appeals the conviction for simple possession on March 5, 2007, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the fruits of the warrantless search of his vehicle on that date because the officer lacked probable cause for the initial stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-16\">\u201cThe standard of review for a motion to suppress based on live testimony at a suppression hearing is to accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous or influenced by an incorrect view of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 704 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cQuestions of law are reviewed de novo, as are the district court\u2019s ultimate conclusions of Fourth Amendment reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>298 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-17\">The Fourth Amendment permits police officers to \u201cstop and briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes if they have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Goodson v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>202 F.3d 730, 736 (5th Cir.2000). A decision to stop an automobile is reasonable when the officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). However, the legal justification for the stop must be objectively grounded. <em>United States v. Lopez-Valdez, </em>178 F.3d 282, 288 (5th Cir.1999). If the supposed traffic violation that formed the basis for a stop was in fact not a violation of state law, there is no objective basis for probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>cause justifying the stop. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>146 F.3d 274, 279 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Williams contends that there was no objective basis for probable cause justifying the stop in his case because there was no traffic -violation under Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 502.409 (Vernon 2006). He urges that the statute does not criminalize obstructed plates per se but requires some affirmative action on the part of the driver of a vehicle, i.e. the knowing attachment or display of a covering that obscures the numbers on a license plate. Williams reasons that, because there was no evidence that he created or was even aware of the obstruction on his sister\u2019s car, there was no traffic violation, and the stop of his vehicle was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The district court did not err in determining that Officer Alaniz had probable cause for the traffic stop in this case because Williams violated \u00a7 502.409 by driving a vehicle displaying a covering (a broken piece of trunk trim) that obstructed the license plate numbers, despite the absence of any evidence that Williams personally attached the obstruction. The plain language of the statute shows that a violation occurs if the offender either \u201cattaches to or displays on a motor vehicle\u201d the license plate obstruction, listing the verbs \u201cattach\u201d and \u201cdisplay\u201d in the alternative. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the verb \u201cdisplay\u201d as \u201c[t]o open up or expose to view, exhibit to the eyes, show.\u201d Oxford English Dictionary (2nd Ed.1989). Thus, no evidence of the driver\u2019s intentional act, beyond driving a car with a displayed obstruction to the license plate, is required. <em>See United States v. Contreras-Trevino, </em>448 F.3d 821, 822-23 (5th Cir.2006) (finding a violation of \u00a7 502.409 despite the fact that the plastic license plate frame which caused the obstruction had been attached by the car dealer, not the driver of the vehicle). Because it is undisputed that the hanging trunk trim obscured the license plate on the car Williams was driving, Officer Alaniz\u2019s initial stop of the vehicle was validated by probable cause to suspect that Williams had committed a traffic violation under \u00a7 502.409. <em>See Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769; <em>Miller, </em>146 F.3d at 279. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b878-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
