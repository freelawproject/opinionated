California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ayers has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Ayers\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-21\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Ayers\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Ayers\u2019s motion for the appointment of new counsel and his motion to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
