He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of his sentence. Rice based his motion on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s adoption of Amendment 706, which modified the sentencing ranges applicable to crack cocaine offenses to reduce the disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentences. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>Supp. to Appendix C, Amendment 706, p. 226-31 (Nov. 1, 2007) (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-23\">\u201cSection 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and we review the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-24\">Rice has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reduce his sentence. A reduction in Rice\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendment 706 would not affect his guidelines range of imprisonment, because the guidelines range was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Rice\u2019s guidelines range of imprisonment was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, Rice was not sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). To the extent that Rice argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the argument is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>was not \u201cbased on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>did not abuse its discretion in denying Rice\u2019s motion for a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b849-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
