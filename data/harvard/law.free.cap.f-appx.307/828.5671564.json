The district court dismissed Cur-bow\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Curbow argues that the defendants failed to protect him and were deliberately indifferent to his safety when they called for outdoor recreation after being warned that a prison riot would occur. Curbow was stabbed and beaten during the riot. Curbow argues that the defendants obviously knew that the riot would ensue because they had been told by a prison instructor who heard about the planed riot from an inmate and because they were prepared with gas grenades.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Curbow\u2019s \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Curbow\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is therefore granted. This court may, however, address the merits of Curbow\u2019s claims at this time and may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1003, 1005 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Even if Curbow has alleged sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding that the defendants were \u201csubjectively aware of a risk to inmate health or safety,\u201d <em>see Adames v. Perez, </em>331 F.3d 508, 512 (5th Cir.2003), \u201c[n]o liability exists, ... if an official reasonably responded to a known substantial risk, \u2018even if the harm was ultimately not averted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Longoria v. Texas, </em>473 F.3d 586, 593 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). Curbow has alleged that prison supervisors repositioned security officers, equipped them with full riot gear, and placed them in the recreation yards. Cur-bow admits that prison officials were positioned and ready to respond prior to recreation being called. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants reasonably responded to a potentially substantial risk was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 345-48, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986); <em>Stanley v. Foster, </em>464 F.3d 565, 569 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Curbow also argues that his due process rights were violated because he was found guilty in a prison disciplinary proceeding of fighting in the riot. Curbow argues that the determination of his guilt was based solely on Hinkle\u2019s false testimony. Curbow lost good-time credits in the proceeding, along with other privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Curbow\u2019s due process claim is not cognizable in his \u00a7 1983 suit because a judgment in his favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity\u201d of his prison disciplinary proceeding. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481-82, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>see also Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b850-18\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr.
