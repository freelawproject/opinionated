Canchola-Velez raises two issues for the first time: whether the regulation that prohibits an alien from filing a motion to reopen subsequent to removal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ultra vires because it conflicts with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) and whether he should be permitted to file the motion because his \u201cexile\u201d entitles him to the same protections given to refugees who seek asylum. Because Canchola-Velez did not raise the two issues in his motion to reopen or in a subsequent motion to reconsider before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 451, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Canchola-Velez also challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to reopen his removal proceedings. He asserts that his former attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness amounted to a denial of due process that justifies reopening the proceedings on equitable grounds. In <em>Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 675-76 (5th Cir.2003), we upheld as reasonable the BIA\u2019s interpretation of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(d) (formerly found in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(d)) as removing its jurisdiction to reopen the removal proceedings of a deported alien. We are \u201cbound by <em>Navarro-Miranda </em>under this circuit\u2019s strict application of <em>stare decisis.\u201d Castillo-Perales v. Mukasey, </em>298 Fed.Appx. 366, 369 (5th Cir.2008)(unpublished). Accordingly, we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1003.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">It is not necessary to reach the remaining issue raised by Canchola-Velez, whether his former attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness tolled the statute of limitations for filing a motion to reopen. <em>See Am. Eagle Airlines, Inc. v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int'l </em>343 F.3d 401, 411 n. 6 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
