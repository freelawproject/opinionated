After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-26\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). However, \u201c[wjhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United, States v. </em>Moore, 541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (Supp. May 1, 2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Sharp based his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered most, but not all, of the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The district court did not err in concluding that Sharp was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At Sharp\u2019s original sentencing, the district court found that Sharp was responsible for at least 15 kilograms of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although Amendment 706 reduced by two levels the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses involving less than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 left unchanged the base offense level (level 38) for offenses involving 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2006) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), (2) (2008). Because Sharp is responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 had no effect on his base offense level or applicable advisory sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">To the extent Sharp argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) entitles him to a sentence reduction, <em>Booker </em>does not provide an independent basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008). Further, because Sharp did not qualify for resentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court had no occasion to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines or to exercise its discretion to impose a new sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority to modify a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\">. Sharp's argument that the district court incorrectly calculated the amount of drugs at his original sentencing is outside the scope of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir. 2000) (explaining that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u2019\u2019); <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (upholding district court\u2019s refusal in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to re-examine drug quantity because factual decisions from the original sentencing are to be left intact). In any event, Sharp challenged the drug quantity finding on direct appeal, and this Court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Andrews, </em>953 F.2d 1312, 1326-27 (11th Cir.1992). Moreover, Sharp filed an earlier \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction based on a prior guidelines amendment \u2014 Amendment 505 \u2014 and in the appeal of the denial of that motion, this Court pointed out: \u201cThe district court was not authorized to review its findings about the quantity of cocaine attributed to Sharp.... \u201d <em>United States v. Sharp, </em>No. 96-6538, 117 F.3d 1432, slip. op. at 3 (11th Cir. June 19, 1997) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
