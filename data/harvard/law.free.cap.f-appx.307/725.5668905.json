Fernandez appeals the district court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment to the Defendant in Fernandez\u2019s civil action and denying her motions to alter or amend judgment, for a protective order, and to compel. On appeal, Fernandez contends the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow her to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>discovery as to count one of her complaint prior to summary judgment, and the district court erred in concluding that there was insufficient evidence of disparate treatment, of retaliatory action, and that Fernandez\u2019s alleged harassment was based on her gender to survive summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Holland v. Washington Homes, Inc., </em>487 F.3d 208, 213 (4th Cir.2007), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 955, 169 L.Ed.2d 734 (2008). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s refusal to allow discovery prior to granting summary judgment. <em>Harrods Ltd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names, </em>302 F.3d 214, 244 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Nguyen v. CNA Corp., </em>44 F.3d 234, 242 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201c[T]here is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party. If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record and find no abuse of discretion or reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Fernandez v. Hayden, </em>No. 1:04-cv-03009JFM (D. Md. Oct. 23, 2007; Aug. 27, 2007; Apr. 2, 2007; Aug. 25, 2006; Aug. 24, 2006; Sept. 26, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
