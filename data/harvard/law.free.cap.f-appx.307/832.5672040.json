He asserts that the district court plainly erred by entering a judgment reflecting that he was convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) when he did not have a prior conviction that qualified as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Rosales correctly concedes that review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 52(b); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). To show plain error, he must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cAn error affects substantial rights if it affect[s] the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333 (internal quotation marks omitted). If Rosales makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">The maximum penalty for unlawful reentry of an alien whose removal was subsequent to a prior felony conviction is 10 years. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). The maximum penalty for unlawful reentry of an alien whose removal was subsequent to a prior aggravated felony conviction is 20 years. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). An \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined in relevant part as a crime of violence for which the punishment is no less than one year of imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">Rosales\u2019s prior felony conviction for robbery is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because he was sentenced to only 90 days. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Accordingly, the district court committed a clear or obvious error when it entered a judgment reflecting that he was convicted pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Campos, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 505, 506 (5th Cir.2008). However, Rosales fails to show that the error affected his substantial rights because there is no indication in the record that the district court\u2019s sentencing determination was influenced by an incorrect understanding of the statutory maximum sentence. Moreover, his sentence falls below the statutory maximum of 10 years under the correct subsection of \u00a7 1326(b). As a result, there was no reversible plain error. <em>See Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 333. The judgment, however, is modified in accordance with this opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>to reflect a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d 536, 543 n. 16, 547 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Rosales also asserts that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. He asserts that the court relied solely upon the presentence report to determine that his prior robbery offense was a crime of violence when the definition of his robbery offense is broader than the ordinary, contemporary, and common meaning of the enumerated offense of robbery under \u00a7 2L1.2. The Government asserts that Rosales waived any objection to the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\u201c[Wjaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)(in-temal quotation marks omitted). An attorney may waive his client\u2019s objection under the Guidelines so long as the record suggests that counsel made a knowing, conscious choice to forgo the objection. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006). Waiver extinguishes any error by the district court, <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, because the court cannot be expected to override the intentions of defense counsel and to assert a right on the defendant\u2019s behalf sua sponte. <em>United States v. Reveles, </em>190 F.3d 678, 683 (5th Cir.1999). Counsel\u2019s statement to the court during sentencing that he had discussed the crime of violence enhancement with the probation officer, reviewed the applicable case-law, and determined that Rosales\u2019s prior offense was \u201csufficient to enhance him the 16 levels\u201d constituted waiver. <em>See Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Lastly, Rosales asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to object to the application of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and to the crime of violence enhancement. Because the record has not been developed sufficiently for us to evaluate this claim fully, we decline to address it on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>346 F.3d 135, 136-37 (5th Cir.2003). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
