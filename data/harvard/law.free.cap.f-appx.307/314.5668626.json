The district court, in an order entered on March 31, 2008, recalculated Wilson\u2019s offense level at 30. At criminal history category V, the sentence range came to 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, lower than the 188 to 235 range the court used initially in fashioning Wilson\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>tence. Although it lowered Wilson\u2019s sentence range, the court denied Wilson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. It did so \u201cbased on factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), namely the history and characteristics of the defendant and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On April 14, 2008, Wilson moved the district court to reconsider its March 31 order. On April 16, while the motion was pending, he filed a notice of appeal, challenging the March 31 order. On June 23, 2008, the court denied the motion for reconsideration on the ground that Wilson\u2019s filing of the notice of appeal had divested the court of jurisdiction to consider the motion on its merits. Wilson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The filing of a notice of appeal normally divests the district court of jurisdiction over matters concerned in the appeal and transfers jurisdiction over those matters to the court of appeals. <em>Shewchun v. United States, </em>797 F.2d 941, 942 (11th Cir.1986). The question this appeal presents, therefore, is whether Wilson\u2019s filing of the motion for reconsideration on April 14 gave the district court the authority to entertain the motion notwithstanding Wilson\u2019s subsequent filing of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">A defendant in a criminal case must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of judgment. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(1)(A). However, if a defendant timely files one of the tolling motions listed under Rule 4(b)(3), then the notice of appeal is not effective until the date of the entry of the order disposing of the tolling motion, or until the date of the entry of the judgment of conviction, whichever is later. Fed.R.App.P. 4(b)(3)(B). The three tolling motions listed in Rule 4(b)(3)(C) include a motion for judgment of acquittal, a motion for new trial, and a motion for arrest of judgment. Fed.RApp.P. 4(b)(3)(A). Moreover, \u201c[a] valid notice of appeal is effective \u2014 without amendment \u2014 to appeal from an order disposing of any of the motions referred to in Rule 4(b)(3)(A).\u201d Fed.RApp.P. 4(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize the filing of a motion to reconsider an order by the district court. Nonetheless, \u201cthe timely filing of such a motion in a criminal action tolls the time for filing a notice of appeal and the time begins to run anew following disposition of the motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d 1412, 1413-14 (11th Cir.1992) (citing <em>United States v. Dieter, </em>429 U.S. 6, 8-9, 97 S.Ct. 18, 19-20, 50 L.Ed.2d 8 (1976)). In this case, the motion for reconsideration was timely since it was filed within the period of time allotted for appealing the March 31 order. <em>Vicaria, </em>963 F.2d at 1414. Hence, the April 16 notice of appeal did not transfer jurisdiction to this court, i.e., it did not oust the district court of jurisdiction, until the district court entered its June 23 order denying Wilson\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">The district court\u2019s order of June 23, 2008, denying Wilson\u2019s motion for reconsideration on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain it, is accordingly vacated, and the case is remanded with the instruction that the district court pass on the merits of Wilson\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">VACATED and REMANDED, with instruction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-15\">. The district court\u2019s probation office, and subsequently the district court, set Wilson's base offense level at 32 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1, having found that Wilson's offense involved at least 50 grams but less than 150 grams of crack cocaine (53 grams were attributable to Wilson). There were no adjustments, so the total offense level was 32. This level coupled to a criminal histoiy category of V yielded a sentence range of 188 to 235 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-13\">. The court noted that Wilson had three previous felony drug convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
