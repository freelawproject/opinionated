The district court sentenced White to a statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, but later reduced White\u2019s sentence based on the government\u2019s Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 35(b) substantial assistance motions. Thereafter, White filed a motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court held White was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced under a statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">On appeal, White argues the district court possessed the authority to reduce his sentence despite the mandatory statutory minimum sentence because, pursuant to Rule 35(b), the court had the authority to reduce White\u2019s sentence below the applicable statutory minimum. White additionally argues his original sentence was imposed in violation of his constitutional rights because a jury did not find he was responsible for a specific amount of illegal drags.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). In the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation. <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements \u2014 and, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also id. </em>at cmt. n. 1(A) (noting a defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction where a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Amendment 706 retroactively reduced the offense levels in crack cocaine cases, calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), by two levels. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant, whose guideline imprisonment range was determined in accordance with the offense level calculations under \u00a7 2D1.1, to seek a reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Additionally, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the proper avenue through which to raise issues arising from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), as such a claim does not involve an amendment made retroactive. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), only changes to the Guidelines made by the Sentencing Commission after the defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, not Supreme Court decisions, can be used as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Here, the court sentenced White to the mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment, which applied based on his previous felony drug convictions. Because the district court relied on a statutory mandatory sentence, rather than a base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court did not err in concluding it lacked authority to reduce White\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The fact that the district court granted the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motions to reduce White\u2019s sentence does not change this result. We do not review White\u2019s constitutional claim on the merits because a motion filed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not the proper vehicle to raise a constitutional claim. Accordingly, based upon a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
