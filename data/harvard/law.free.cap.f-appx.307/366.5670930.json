No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). The district court did not err by denying equitable tolling; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">In 1996, a jury convicted Appellant of attempted second-degree murder of a correctional officer; aggravated battery involving great bodily harm to a law-enforcement officer; aggravated battery of a law-enforcement officer with a deadly weapon; and battery of a law-enforcement officer. A habitual felony offender, Appellant was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment, running concurrent with sentences for ten and thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">Appellant\u2019s conviction became final on 3 November 1998: ninety days after the conclusion of his direct appeal. Accordingly, the one-year statute of limitations for filing timely a federal habeas petition expired on 4 November 1999. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Appellant did not commence state post-conviction relief proceedings until 7 August 2000, when he filed a Rule 3.850 motion with the state of Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus on 21 December 2006. On 28 January 2008, this Court granted Appellant\u2019s application for a Certificate of Appealability on whether Appellant was entitled to equitable tolling because he was denied access to the law library due to his \u201cclose management\u201d status in prison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Appellant maintains that the district court should have equitably tolled the limitation period because his close-management status prevented him from visiting the prison library and from consulting with prison law clerks. He also argues that his lack of education and inability to access legal assistance prevented him from timely filing for post-conviction relief and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>those circumstances justify equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The district court determined that Appellant was not entitled to equitable tolling based on close-management status; even restricted access to a law library, lock-downs, and solitary confinement do not qualify as ordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling. <em>See, e.g., Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1089-90 (11th Cir.2000). Moreover, Appellant\u2019s close-management status was the result of his own violent acts towards prison officials \u2014 not unlawful action by the state. In addition, Appellant was not entitled to equitable tolling because of his lack of legal training, <em>see United States v. Montano, </em>398 F.3d 1276, 1280 n. 5 (11th Cir.2005) (even alleged language difficulties did not constitute extraordinary circumstances for equitable tolling). Neither was tolling justified by an inability to obtain appointed counsel. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2566, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (no constitutional right to attorney in state post-conviction proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of equitable tolling <em>de novo. Lawrence v. Florida, </em>421 F.3d 1221, 1224 (11th Cir.2005). Because the district court\u2019s determination of relevant facts will only be reversed if clearly erroneous, <em>Dorsey v. Chapman, </em>262 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2001), we affirm the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless \u201cthe record lacks substantial evidence to support that determination.\u201d <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">To obtain equitable tolling \u2014 \u201can extraordinary remedy that must be applied sparingly\u201d \u2014 an Appellant carries the burden of showing that he was diligent in his efforts to file timely and that extraordinary and unavoidable circumstances prevented the Appellant from filing timely. <em>See Holland v. Florida, </em>539 F.3d 1334, 1338 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cA truly extreme case is required.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Appellant does not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances or diligence in his effort to obtain relief. The state contends that Appellant was not denied access to the law library and that he could and did communicate about his case with people outside the prison \u2014 including many lawyers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inmate law-clerks are by statute available to provide research assistance to inmates, like Appellant, who are under close-management status. <em>See </em>Fla. Admin. Code Ann. R. 33-501.301(3)(e) (providing inmate law-clerk services to disabled and illiterate inmates upon request). Appellant offers no record evidence rebutting the state contentions; his bare assertions regarding lack of library access are both conclusory and contrary to state statute. <em>See Drew, </em>297 F.3d at 1292-93 (denying evidentiary hearing on equitable tolling because Petitioner\u2019s allegations were conclusory). Appellant does not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances that warrant equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Appellant also fails to carry the burden of proving the diligence required for this court to grant equitable tolling. Filing a Rule 3.850 motion only two days before Florida\u2019s statute of limitations expired does not demonstrate the diligence necessary for equitable tolling. Neither does the 642 days that elapsed between Appellant\u2019s conviction becoming final on 3 November 1998 and the Rule 3.850 petition he filed on 7 August 2000. Neither did Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>pellant exhibit diligence in filing a federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Appellant demonstrates neither diligence nor extraordinary circumstances. He is not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of equitable tolling. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-12\">. Had Appellant filed a 3.850 petition during AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations, that filing would have tolled the one-year period. The statute of limitations was not tolled, however, because Appellant filed the 3.850 petition more than one year after the conviction became final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\">. Our review is limited to the issues specified in the Certificate of Appealability. <em>See Murray </em>v. <em>United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). We will not, therefore, examine issues beyond the COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">. Thus, Appellant \u2014 even when under close-management status \u2014 had access to legal sources both inside and outside of prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
