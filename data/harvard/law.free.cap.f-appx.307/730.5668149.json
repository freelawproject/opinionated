(\u201cNVR\u201d) \u2014 the defendant below \u2014 has satisfied the amount-in-controversy requirement for federal removal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) (West 2008). The district court, finding that NVR\u2019s estimates of the amount in controversy were too speculative to support removal jurisdiction, granted Appellees\u2019 motion for remand. Because we agree with the district court that NVR\u2019s estimates rely on a wholly unsupported assumption that members of the plaintiff class will claim to have worked an average of five hours of overtime per week, we affirm the decision to remand to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">This litigation began in federal court in the Western District of New York, in the case of <em>Patrick Tracy v. NVR, Inc. </em>(Case No. 04-CV-06541 DGL). NVR is in the business of constructing and selling new homes. Tracy, who worked as a Sales Marketing Representative (\u201cSMR\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for NVR, filed a federal Fair Labor and Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) claim against the company, on behalf of a nationwide class of SMRs, for its failure to provide SMRs with overtime compensation. At NVR\u2019s request, the <em>Tracy </em>district court dismissed the various state law claims brought by class members, declining to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over them. To preserve these claims, various <em>Tracy </em>class members then initiated state law actions in them respective state courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">On September 21, 2007, Plaintiffs-Appellees Nicholas Bartnikowski, Aimee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Moore, and Amber Wilcox (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed an amended complaint against NVR in the Superior Court of Durham County, North Carolina. Plaintiffs, present and former North Carolina-based SMRs, claimed that NVR had wrongfully denied them overtime compensation for the hours they worked in excess of forty hours per week. In their complaint, Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of a class of all current and former SMRs at NVR\u2019s North Carolina locations who had not been paid overtime, claimed that NVR\u2019s actions constituted a willful violation of North Carolina\u2019s wage and hour laws, including N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 95-25.6 (2007), as well as a breach of contract. Plaintiffs did not specify damages in their complaint; they simply stated that they \u201cfrequently worked over 40 hours in a week\u201d (J.A. 12) and asked for the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">(a) that all matters so triable be tried by a jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">(b) an order preliminarily and permanently restraining defendant from engaging [in] the aforementioned pay violations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">(c) an award of the value of plaintiffs\u2019 unpaid wages, including fringe benefits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">(d) all relief available under North Carolina law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">(e) [a]n award of reasonable attorneys fees, expenses, expert fees and costs incurred in vindicating plaintiffs\u2019 rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">(f) [a]n award of pre-and post-judgment interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">(g) [s]uch other and further legal or equitable relief as this Court deems to be just and appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">(J.A. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">On October 16, 2007, NVR removed the case to federal district court in the Middle District of North Carolina, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) (2000), asserting that CAPA, codified in relevant part at 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) (West 2008), gave the district court original jurisdiction over the action. In its notice of removal, NVR alleged that the amount in controversy in the case exceeded $5,000,000, thus satisfying CAFA\u2019s jurisdictional requirements. Plaintiffs then filed a motion to remand to state court, questioning NVR\u2019s ability to prove the amount in controversy since the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint had left the amount of damages unspecified.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">In its response to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, NVR attached a declaration from Dennis Littell, NVR\u2019s payroll director. Littell stated in the declaration that the average annual compensation paid to SMRs in North Carolina during the two-year time period relevant to the statutory claims<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>was $145,892, and that North Carolina SMRs worked a total of 1174 \u201cperson-months\u201d in those two years. Littell did not define the term \u201cperson-months,\u201d nor did NVR in its memorandum of law opposing the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">NVR used Littell\u2019s estimates to define an amount-in-controversy in excess of $5,000,000. Based on an average annual compensation of $145,892, NVR calculated that SMRs in North Carolina had an average hourly wage of $70.14, which would make their average hourly overtime wage $105.21 (or one and a half times their average hourly wage). NVR then assumed that putative class members will claim to have worked an average of 5 overtime hours per week, creating damages of $2,279.37 per person-month.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With SMRs working a total of 1174 person-months, NVR estimated damages for the statutory period at about $2,676,000. Assuming then that Plaintiffs will seek statutory double damages under the North Carolina unpaid wages statute, NVR estimated total recovery on the statutory claim at $5,352,000. Using similar calculations, NVR estimated damages under Plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim at an additional $963,855. Claiming that attorneys\u2019 fees were recoverable on top of these calculations, NVR argued that it easily cleared the $5,000,000 jurisdictional hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The district court, unconvinced by NVR\u2019s estimates, granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand on June 19, 2008, 2008 WL 2512839. The court found that NVR\u2019s calculations were too speculative and that the record was too bare to allow for a reasonable estimate of the amount in controversy. As such, the court noted, \u201cthe propriety of federal jurisdiction remains doubtful.\u201d (J.A. 158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">NVR filed a petition for leave to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1453(c) (West 2008) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 5 on June 30, 2008. We grant that petition as timely filed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and review de novo the district court\u2019s order granting Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand this action to state court. <em>See Lontz v. Tharp, </em>413 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">NVR claims that removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) (2000) is proper because, under CAFA\u2019s amendments to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (2000), the district court has original jurisdiction over this action. CAFA amended Title 28\u2019s requirements for diversity jurisdiction and removal in the case of class actions. Section 1332(d)(2) of Title 28 now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is a class action in which ... any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant... ,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF5-\">To determine whether the jurisdictional minimum is satisfied, the district court looks to the aggregated value of class members\u2019 claims. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(d)(6) (West 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Defendants seeking removal bear the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is proper. <em>See Strawn v. AT &amp; T Mobility LLC, </em>530 F.3d 293, 296-97 (4th Cir.2008). This is true even in the context of removals pursuant to CAFA. In <em>Strami, </em>this Court found that, while CAFA was intended to open the doors of the federal courts to class action litigants, its statutory language did nothing to reverse the long-settled principle that a defendant seeking to invoke a federal court\u2019s removal jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction would be proper. <em>Id. </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The question then becomes how that burden is to be satisfied. Generally, the amount specified in the complaint will determine whether the jurisdictional amount is satisfied for purposes of removal. <em>See Wiggins v. North Am. Equitable Life </em>As<em>surance Co., </em>644 F.2d 1014, 1016 (4th Cir.1981). Determining the amount in controversy becomes more difficult, however, where, as here, Plaintiffs have left damages unspecified in their complaint. In this case, both parties agree that the defendant\u2019s burden in these circumstances is to establish the jurisdictional amount by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We review the evidence as to the amount in controversy with that standard in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">In considering Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for remand, the district court seemed to find virtually all of NVR\u2019s calculations too speculative and unsupported to satisfy its burden. We do not agree fully. A number of NVR\u2019s assumptions and calculations are reasonable and supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">For example, NVR assumes that the base amount of overtime compensation allegedly due under North Carolina\u2019s unpaid wages statute \u2014 $2,676,000, according to NVR\u2019s calculations \u2014 can be doubled to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>termine the amount in controversy because the North Carolina statute authorizes double damages. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not make any specific claim for liquidated damages but it does ask for \u201call relief available under North Carolina law.\u201d (J.A. 13.) Section 95-25.22(al) of the North Carolina General Statutes authorizes an award of liquidated damages \u201cin an amount equal to the amount found to be due\u201d in unpaid wages cases, subject only to a good faith defense. Given that the complaint alleges that NVR <em>\u201cloillfully </em>violated its obligations under North Carolina Law\u201d (J.A. 13 (emphasis added)), it appears likely that liquidated damages will be sought. <em>Cf. Morgan v. Gay, </em>471 F.3d 469, 475 (3d Cir.2006) (finding punitive damages not properly includable in amount-in-controversy calculation where defendants eonclusorily alleged that millions of dollars in punitive damages would be sought and where plaintiffs had specifically claimed that damages would not exceed $5 million). Statutory liquidated damages are properly includable in the calculation of the jurisdictional amount here, and we do not consider them too speculative in this case to be factored into that calculation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) (West 2008) (excluding only \u201cinterest and costs\u201d from calculation of aggregate amount in controversy); <em>see also Wall v. Fruehauf Trailer Servs., Inc., </em>123 Fed.Appx. 572, 577 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">NVR also argues that the \u201caverage annual compensation\u201d and average number of \u201cperson-months\u201d worked, as provided in the Littell declaration, are adequate measures from which the amount in controversy can fairly be calculated. Plaintiffs themselves have proffered no information about them expected damages, nor have they explained why accepting the declaration of NVR\u2019s Payroll Director as to average annual SMR compensation would be speculative or an improper means of estimating SMRs\u2019 average hourly wage and expected hourly overtime rate. We have no difficulty accepting these figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The use of the \u201cperson-months\u201d statistic is more troublesome since NVR left the term undefined in its brief before the district court. However, NVR has made clear in its brief to this Court that a \u201cperson-month\u201d is the monthly equivalent of a \u201cman-hour,\u201d meaning a unit of one month\u2019s work by one person. According to the Littell declaration, SMRs in North Carolina collectively worked a total of 1174 person months during the statutory period of two years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Multiplying this number of months by the expected monthly amount of overtime pay due to employees (if this number was discernible) would yield a reasonable estimate of the amount of unpaid wages at stake under the statutory claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">NVR\u2019s ultimate estimate of the amount in controversy, however, is fatally undermined by the wholly unsupported assumption on which its calculations ultimately rest \u2014 that Plaintiffs and class members will each claim to have worked an average of five hours of overtime per week. NVR concedes that it has kept no records of the number of overtime hours worked by class members,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the Plaintiffs themselves have offered no evidence on the issue either. The only evidence in the record to which NVR can point for support is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>affirmation from Patrick Tracy, the named plaintiff in the FLSA action being litigated in district court in New York.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Tracy, a New York-based SMR, made vague references in his affirmation to working 55-hour weeks. According to NVR, this shows that its assumption of five hours of overtime is, if anything, a conservative estimate, since Tracy, who is supposed to be representative of a nationwide class of SMRS including Plaintiffs, suggests that he works fifteen hours of overtime per week. There are two significant problems with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">First, Tracy is located in New York. While it is true that Plaintiffs are members of the <em>Tracy </em>class, <em>Tracy </em>is a completely separate action. Tracy\u2019s \u201crepresentativeness\u201d of the nationwide class in the federal FLSA action does not make him, a New York-based SMR, representative of a class of North Carolina-based SMRs bringing state law claims. Second, even if Tracy could be considered representative of the class in this case, his affirmation does not actually state that he worked an average of 55 hours per work week. Instead, it states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">Thus, visiting two lots, in one month, equates to 40 minutes a month. <em>If </em>working four 55-hour weeks in a month (or 220 hours = 13,200 minutes in a month) my lot visits outside the model took less than 1% of the time. Even if I had worked only 40 hours a week (equating to 160 hours per month = 9600 minutes), such visits still took less than 1% of my time in a month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">(J.A. 96 (emphasis added).) The statement was made in the context of explaining what percentage of time Tracy spent on lot visits away from the model home in a given month. Tracy was not giving an estimate of the number of overtime hours he worked per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Tracy\u2019s affirmation is the only piece of evidence NVR offers to anchor its assumption that plaintiff class members worked an average of five overtime hours per week, making the assumption highly speculative. Cf<em>. Brill v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>427 F.3d 446, 449 (7th Cir.2005) (\u201cThus part of the removing party\u2019s burden is to show not only what the stakes of the litigation <em>could be, </em>but also what they <em>are </em>given the plaintiffs actual demands.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">On top of Plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claims, they have also raised a breach of contract claim for their unpaid overtime. According to NVR, the statute of limitations on Plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim is three years, giving them one additional year for which they can recover. Using a similar calculation to that used for the statutory claim, NVR estimates that the contract claim puts an additional $963,855 at stake.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But this estimate relies on the same unsupported \u201cfive hours of overtime per week\u201d assumption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The \u201cfive hours of overtime\u201d assumption is in fact quite crucial to NVR\u2019s calculations of the amount in controversy. If the actual amount of overtime claimed was only one to three hours per week, NVR, using its own calculation methods, could not satisfy the jurisdictional minimum.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At four hours, NVR would clear the jurisdictional hurdle only by a hair.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Given the centrality of the \u201cfive hours\u201d number to NVR\u2019s claims, we cannot simply take NVR\u2019s word that this is really a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate (Appellant\u2019s Br. 12) of the overtime hours that will be claimed by Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The dissent contends that NVR has carried its burden of proof by presenting credible evidence on the \u201cfive hours\u201d issue, and that therefore the burden of production should shift to Plaintiffs to show that the jurisdictional amount has not been satisfied. But NVR has put forth no evidence of its own to support the number; rather, it has presented only a conjectural argument. Plaintiffs have no burden in these circumstances and are under no obligation to put forth any evidence. <em>See Birkenbuel v. M.C.C. Constr. Corp., </em>962 F.Supp. 1305, 1306 (D.Mont.1997) (\u201cMCC complains that \u2018Birkenbuel offers no evidence regarding the amount of his interim earnings, or indeed any evidence that he has or ever will earn interim income.\u2019 However, it is MCC, not Birkenbuel, which has the burden of proof.\u201d). Even if, as NVR contends, Plaintiffs are the \u201csole custodians\u201d of information about the amount of overtime they worked (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 13), this does not give NVR license to pull numbers from thin air in determining the amount in controversy. <em>See Morgan, </em>471 F.3d at 474 (\u201cCAFA does not change the proposition that the plaintiff is the master of her own claim\u201d); <em>Brill, </em>427 F.3d at 449 (noting that \u201ca removing defendant can\u2019t make the plaintiffs claim for him\u201d). Because NVR has presented no credible evidence to support the \u201cfive hours\u201d assumption, NVR simply cannot satisfy its burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction would be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>We note that this case is readily distinguishable from that of <em>Strawn, </em>530 F.3d 293, where this Court reversed the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to remand. Indeed, this case is much more reminiscent of the facts of the Eleventh Circuit case <em>Miedema v. Maytag Corp., </em>450 F.3d 1322 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In <em>Straum, </em>the plaintiffs claimed that AT &amp; T had illegally used an opt-out policy for its \u201cRoadside Assistance\u201d program, under which it charged its West Virginia cellular customers $2.99 per month automatically unless they affirmatively asked to be removed from the program after an initial free-trial period. 530 F.3d at 294. In its notice of removal, AT &amp; T included an affidavit stating the following to show the jurisdictional amount had been satisfied: (1) that approximately 58,800 consumers in West Virginia were automatically enrolled in the Roadside Assistance program after the trial period, and (2) that under the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act, the minimum statutory damages per person were $200. <em>Id. </em>at 295. Because plaintiffs offered no evidence to suggest that the 58,800-customer figure was inaccurate, this Court found that AT <em>&amp; </em>T had met its burden. <em>Id. </em>at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Likewise, we can accept NVR\u2019s evidence on average annual compensation and the number of person-months worked by SMRs during the statutory period because Plaintiffs have offered no contradictory evidence. But its \u201cfive hours of overtime per. week\u201d estimate is not evidence; it is an assumption. It is nothing like the affidavit produced by AT &amp; T showing that 58,800 customers had been automatically enrolled in the roadside assistance program. Nor is it even an assumption that finds some support in the record; at this point, it seems the \u201cfive hours of overtime per week\u201d was nothing more than the result of some strategic guesswork on NVR\u2019s part, and Plaintiffs are under no obligation to rebut this bare assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">NVR\u2019s calculations are more like the ones rejected as being too speculative in <em>Miedema. </em>In that case, the named plaintiff filed a class action involving negligence, breach of express warranty, and state statutory claims against Maytag for a defect found in the motorized door latch of its ranges/ovens sold in Florida. <em>Miedema, </em>450 F.3d at 1324-25. Maytag then removed to federal court. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Affirming the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to remand, the Eleventh Circuit found that Maytag had failed to establish the amount in controversy required under CAFA by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1331. Maytag\u2019s notice of removal had included an affidavit of one of its information analysts that stated that a total of 6,279 ranges/ovens had been sold in Florida, with a total value of $5,931,971. <em>Id. </em>at 1325. However the 6,279 figure was not based on actual sales data, but was merely a guess extrapolated from the fact that Maytag had received a total of 2,493 product registrations from Florida consumers. <em>Id. </em>at 1332. The court found that \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d remained about the amount in controversy and that such uncertainty needed to be resolved in favor of remand. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">NVR\u2019s \u201cfive hours of overtime a week\u201d assumption is even more speculative than Maytag\u2019s extrapolations in <em>Miedema. </em>In <em>Miedema, </em>Maytag at least had data on the number of product registrations in Florida and an estimate of nationwide registration rates to anchor its estimate of the number of units sold. Here, by contrast, NVR\u2019s estimate of overtime hours is pure guesswork, and leaves significant uncertainty about the actual amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">While NVR suggests that CAFA mandates that we resolve any such uncertainties in favor of federal jurisdiction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>longstanding tradition of strictly construing removal jurisdiction suggests otherwise. <em>See, e.g., Stratum, </em>530 F.3d at 297 (rejecting the argument that CAFA\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that the statute intended to flip the presumption that doubts about jurisdiction are resolved in favor of remand to state court); <em>Miedema, </em>450 F.3d at 1328-29 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We reach our decision to affirm the district court not unmindful of the difficulty that CAFA defendants face in demonstrating that the amount in controversy is met when plaintiffs have left them damages unspecified. Plaintiffs may well use their pleadings in state court tactically, leaving damages unspecified to block removal without foreclosing an ultimate recovery of more than the federal jurisdictional minimum. <em>See Lowdermilk v. U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Assoc., </em>479 F.3d 994, 1002 (9th Cir.2007). We are reassured, however, by the fact that a CAFA defendant who cannot meet his burden for removal at the early stages of litigation may still have recourse to the federal courts later, as Congress has eliminated the one-year time limit on CAFA removal actions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1453(b) (West 2008); <em>Lowdermilk, </em>479 F.3d at 1002-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">NVR argues that it is contrary to the purpose of CAFA to subject defendants to this kind of \u201cwait and see\u201d approach in state court. But CAFA is quite explicit about how it relaxes the jurisdictional requirements for bringing a class action in federal court. To the extent that Congress sought to relax a CAFA defendant\u2019s burden for removal, it has done so explicitly. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 453(b) (West 2008). Where Congress has not spoken directly to the issue, we must fall back on our longstanding view that, because federal courts are courts of limited subject matter jurisdiction, our removal jurisdiction must be strictly construed. <em>See Md. Stadium Auth. v. Ellerbe Becket Inc., </em>407 F.3d 255, 260 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe are obliged to construe removal jurisdiction strictly because of the significant federalism concerns implicated.\u201d) (internal citation and quotations omitted). Where federal jurisdiction is doubtful, a remand to state court has traditionally been considered the proper course of action. <em>Mulcahey v. Columbia Organic Chems. Co., Inc., </em>29 F.3d 148, 151 (4th Cir.1994). This is no less true in the context of CAFA than in other removal actions. <em>See Strawn, </em>530 F.3d at 297; <em>Miedema, </em>450 F.3d at 1328-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">On the record as it stands, we find that NVR has not satisfied its burden of showing that the amount in controversy is sufficient to meet CAFA\u2019s jurisdictional requirements.

While NVR has also separately suggested that Plaintiffs may seek to recover for a longer period of unpaid overtime (because their complaint suggests that their claims have been tolled since being dismissed by the district court for the Western District of New York), we consider this assertion speculative and decline to consider a recovery period beyond two years in assessing the amount in controversy since NVR has offered no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>dence of overtime rates or hours worked during the suggested extended statutory period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">. $105.21 per hour x 5 hours per week = $526.05 per person-week. $526.05 x 4.333 weeks per month = $2,279.37 per person-month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">.

Most circuit courts that have interpreted this statutory provision have concluded that the phrase \"not less than 7 days\u201d was a typographical error and that the provision should be read as \"not more than 7 days.\u201d <em>See Estate of Pew v.

A number of our sister circuits have explicitly adopted a preponderance of tire evidence standard as the appropriate burden to which removing defendants should be held in proving the amount in controversy where plaintiffs leave damages unspecified. <em>See, e.g., Smith v.

This case does not require us to decide whether a more stringent standard would be appropriate since we find that NVR has failed to meet even a preponderance of the evidence burden. <em>See Martin v.

The district court correctly points out that dividing 1174 by 24 months gives us approximately 49 as the average number of SMRs working per month during the statutory period, which is far short of the class-size minimum of 100 persons. <em>See supra </em>note 6. But, neither party contests that the 100-member class requirement has been met. Moreover, a turnover rate of about two SMRs per month would suffice to double the class.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b757-12\">.

The affirmation was only filed with the district court for the Western District of New York on December 12, and NVR then submitted a motion for leave to submit it as \u201cadditional\u201d evidentiary support on December 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">. The average annual compensation for SMRs in North Carolina from August 2004 to July 2005 was $127,742, yielding a regularly hourly rate of $61.41 and an overtime rate of $92.11. Assuming class members averaged five hours of overtime per week, NVR estimates that Plaintiffs\u2019 damages would be $1,995.56 per month. SMRs worked 483 person-months during the relevant time period, thus total damages available under the contract claim would be $963,855.48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b758-13\">. NVR also suggests that attorneys' fees are properly includable in the calculation of the amount in controversy since North Carolina's unpaid wages statute authorizes their award. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 95-25.22(d) (2007). CAFA specifies that the amount in controversy should be calculated \"exclusive of interests and costs.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) (West 2008). However, since the North Carolina statute provides for the recovery of attorneys' fees as a substantive right, they are properly includable in the amount in controversy estimate. <em>See Mo. State Life Ins. Co. v. Jones, </em>290 U.S. 199, 202, 54 S.Ct. 133, 78 L.Ed. 267 (1933). At this stage of litigation, however, an estimate of attorneys\u2019 fees is pure speculation, and thus, on this record, cannot be used to augment the amount-in-controversy calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\">Similarly, NVR suggests in passing that since \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint includes a demand for injunctive relief, the value of that injunction is included in the calculation of the relief.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9 n. 11.) Neither party has attempted to give us any estimate of the value of the injunctive relief sought, and thus we will not consider it in assessing the amount in controversy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">. Assuming the class averaged only one hour of overtime per week, the amount in controversy on the statutory claims would be $105.21 per hour x 1 hours per week X 4.333 weeks per month x 1,174 person-months x 2 = $1,070,394.34. The amount in controversy on the contract claim would be $92.11 per hour x 1 hour per week x 4.333 weeks per month x 483 person-months = $192,771.40.

In response, respondent offered nothing to rebut petitioner\u2019s claims; it merely charged that the claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>are too speculative. In accepting this argument, the majority conflates burdens of proof with burdens of production. Moreover, the majority\u2019s holding \u2014 that petitioner has failed to meet its burden of proof despite presenting a prima facie case that respondent has not contradicted \u2014 is in some tension with circuit precedent in <em>Strawn v. AT &amp; T Mobility LLC, </em>580 F.3d 293 (4th Cir.2008). I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The party seeking removal in a CAFA case has the burden of alleging federal jurisdiction and establishing it if challenged. <em>Strawn, </em>530 F.3d at 298. But once petitioner has set forth a prima facie case establishing jurisdiction, the onus is on respondent to offer something of its own. <em>See id. </em>at 298-99. <em>Strawn </em>held that the petitioner in that case had met its burden by identifying the number of class members (based on the terms of the respondent\u2019s complaint) and by calculating the minimum statutory damages due each member of the class, where the respondent \u201coffered nothing to suggest that the [figure put forth by the petitioner] is not an accurate number.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court thus held for the petitioner based on the petitioner\u2019s calculations and the facts presented in the complaint, even though respondent\u2019s counsel even went so far as to stipulate that they would not accept an award over $5 million. <em>See id. </em>at 295, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The case before us is strikingly similar. NVR, the petitioner here, met its initial burden by offering a prima facie case based on the terms of respondents\u2019 complaint and petitioner\u2019s own calculations of overtime pay. In the complaint, the class action plaintiffs (respondents here) raised a statutory claim for overtime pay that had a statute of limitations period of two years. They also asserted a breach of contract claim that reached back three years. Both claims sought overtime pay of one-and-a-half times the regular rate of pay; further, the statutory claim asserts that petitioner acted willfully, which under North Carolina law would allow a court to award double damages. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2) (excluding only \u201cinterest and costs\u201d from the amount in controversy under the CAFA); N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 95-25.22(al) (providing for the award of liquidated damages in an amount equal to the damages due). Finally, respondents claim attorneys\u2019 fees, which are recoverable under North Carolina wage and hour laws. <em>See </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 95 \u2014 25.22(d); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2). Based on these claims, petitioner estimates that respondents will seek damages of $5,352,000 on the statutory claim alone, and that the total amount of damages could exceed $6 million even without attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">To support its calculations, petitioner submitted a declaration from its payroll director, Dennis Littell. Mr. Littell reviewed the payroll records of the relevant category of employees, Sales and Marketing Representatives, for two time periods: August 2004 to July 2005 (for the breach of contract claim), and August 2005 to July 2007 (for the statutory claim). Based on this review, Mr. Littell computed the average annual compensation paid to the employees and the number of person-months worked during each time period. NVR then looked at respondents\u2019 claims in this and other proceedings and estimated that respondents would claim they had worked an average of five overtime hours per week. This figure yielded petitioner\u2019s estimates of respondents\u2019 total damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The majority does not suggest that someone other than the payroll director would be better fit to put forth this information. It does not suggest what information petitioner could offer that would meet its burden under the CAFA. Although petitioner bears the ultimate burden of prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ing by a preponderance of the evidence that the jurisdictional amount is in controversy, it need not produce reams of personnel records simply to present a prima facie case. To require more would lead to voluminous discovery requests and document production at the preliminary stages of what is itself a preliminary jurisdictional issue. Encouraging this sort of deluge adds more litigiousness to already litigious class action undertakings.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Moreover, the five-hour estimate is not so speculative as to not even require a response from respondents. The affirmation of Patrick Tracy, the named plaintiff in a parallel proceeding in the Western District of New York, states that \u201cin many weeks [Tracy] worked beyond the model home open hours on [his] scheduled days\u201d and that he also came to work on his days off. (JA 99.) He not only refers to working four 55-hour weeks in a month (JA 96), but states that he \u201cfrequently worked over forty hours in a week\u201d because of his extra hours during the week and \u201cthe extra hours\u201d on his days off. (JA 100) Therefore, Tracy\u2019s statements buttress the petitioner\u2019s argument that an estimate of five hours per week is not only a credible estimate, but a very conservative one. And there is no reason to believe that Tracy\u2019s experience in New York differs from that of SMRs in North Carolina: the named plaintiffs in the North Carolina action are part of the class that Tracy represents, and respondents have stated that NVR kept \u201cvery regimented policies\u201d and followed the same sales model \u201cat all of its locations.\u201d Pi\u2019s Mem. of Law in Support of Mot. for Class Certification, <em>Tracy v. NVR, Inc., </em>No. 04-CV-06541 (W.D.N.Y. filed on Jan. 11, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, the majority acknowledges that respondents would reach the jurisdictional amount if they claimed just four hours per week of overtime. Maj. Op. at 737. Four hours overtime per week is precious little to seek in a class action suit brought to recover overtime pay. And petitioners can reach this jurisdictional threshold without counting attorneys\u2019 fees and the value of injunctive relief, which the majority notes constitute part of the amount in controversy. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 736-37, n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">These calculations, along with the Littell Declaration, make up petitioner\u2019s prima facie case and put a burden on the respondents to offer something in response. <em>See Strawn, </em>530 F.3d at 299. If the five-hour estimate was indeed too speculative or inaccurate, it would make the response even easier to tender. The respondents, who are in possession of all information regarding their pay claims, could shoot down an inaccurate estimate without breaking a sweat. But then respondents have never claimed that they are requesting less than $5 million in damages. In fact, respondents have been litigating class action overtime pay cases against petitioner since 2004, but have passed on every opportunity to submit an affidavit or even make a declaration as to the likely amount of damages they will claim. <em>See, e.g., Tracy v. NVR, Inc., </em>No. 6:04-06541, 2004 WL 3213031 (W.D.N.Y. filed on Oct. 29, 2004). To be sure, respondents may be under no obligation to do so, but the court is likewise under no obligation to relieve them of the consequences of inaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Requiring some sort of minimal response in no way shifts the ultimate burden of proof to respondents, but recognizes that respondents have some modest role to play in making the adversary process function. In ruling otherwise, the majority confuses the burden of proof with the burden of production when it states that respondents \u201care under no obligation to put forth any evidence.\u201d Maj. Op. at 737. Our cases in the Title VII context are instructive. As we noted when discussing the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework in <em>Burns v. AAF-McQuay, Inc., </em>96 F.3d 728, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>731 (4th Cir.1996), the burden of proof throughout a Title VII proceeding remains with the plaintiff. But once the plaintiff puts forth a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to show a nondiscriminatory motive for its actions. <em>Burns, </em>96 F.3d at 731-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Similarly, in the CAFA context, the burden of proof remains with the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction \u2014 typically, the class action defendant (petitioner here). <em>See Strawn, </em>530 F.3d at 297-98. But once petitioner has put forth credible evidence on the jurisdictional question, the burden of production shifts to the respondent to offer something in response. <em>E.g., Strawn, </em>530 F.3d at 298-99. Thus, the burden of production may switch without diminishing or reallocating in any way the burden of proof. The majority seems to recognize this burden-shifting when it notes that it \u201caccept[s] NVR\u2019s evidence on average annual compensation and the number of person-months worked ... because [respondents] have offered no contradictory evidence.\u201d Maj. Op. at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Finally, not requiring any response from respondents lets them have their cake and eat it too \u2014 avoiding federal jurisdiction without being bound by any declaration of damages that might haunt them in state court. <em>See, e.g., Morgan v. Gay, </em>471 F.3d 469, 477 (3d Cir.2006) (\u201c[P]laintiffs in state court should not be permitted to ostensibly limit their damages to avoid federal court only to receive an award in excess of the federal amount in controversy requirement.\u201d). Further, not requiring even so much as a response invites a game of judicial ping-pong. At this point, the case will proceed with discovery in state court, but petitioner will surely renew its notice of removal if respondents later claim, as no doubt they will, over $5 million in damages. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b) (stating that the defendant may remove a case from state court by filing a notice of removal within 30 days of receiving an amended pleading or other document indicating that federal jurisdiction is proper); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(b) (noting that the one-year limitation on removals under \u00a7 1446 does not apply to class actions). The parties will then be litigating this case once again in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">I recognize that CAFA cases may turn on questions of state law and there is a policy argument, with which I have some sympathy, for having these cases resolved at the state level. But we are not at liberty to assign cases to forums where we, not Congress, think they belong. Congress has enacted CAFA and no one is claiming that CAFA is beyond the congressional power to establish the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Here, petitioner offered a prima facie case for federal jurisdiction and respondents offered absolutely nothing in response. <em>Straum </em>does not permit this very situation, and it gives rise to gaming the system. I would reverse the judgment and let the case proceed in district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
