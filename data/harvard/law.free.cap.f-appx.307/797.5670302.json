Diaz-Sanchez asserts that the Government failed to show that his prior convictions were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d for enhancement purposes. He specifically contends that the district court erred by relying exclusively on the presentence report\u2019s characterization of his prior convictions to conclude that a 16-level enhancement was warranted pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The government concedes error and agrees that the correct disposition is to vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-24\">Diaz-Sanchez did not object to the district court\u2019s characterization of his convictions as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Accordingly, we apply the plain error standard of review, which requires (1) an error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affected Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005). If those conditions are met, this court will reverse only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The district court adopted the presentence report (PSR) and found that Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s prior convictions for aggravated battery and false imprisonment constituted \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d warranting a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). However, the record does not contain a citation to the specific Florida statutes under which Diaz-Sanehez was convicted, nor does it include any documentary evidence related to his convictions. The only information in the record concerning Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s prior convictions is the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Although the \u201cPSR is presumed to be sufficiently reliable such that a district court may properly rely on it during sentencing\u201d, <em>see United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 291 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006), a district court may not rely on \u201ca PSR\u2019s characterization of a defendant\u2019s prior offense for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.2005). In the instant case, the district court did not disclose the basis for its finding that Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s prior offenses constituted \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d and nothing in the record indicates that the coiu\u2019t relied on something other than the PSR in reaching its conclusion. As the PSR\u2019s unsupported conclusion that Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s prior offenses were \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d was the exclusive basis for the district court\u2019s ruling, the district court committed plain error in applying an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 296-99 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, because this error likely increased Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s sentence, as the government concedes, the error affected his substantial rights and the fairness of the proceedings. <em>See Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In light of the foregoing, we vacate and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court should permit the government to supplement the record with appropriate documents that may establish the applicable elements of Diaz-Sanchez\u2019s pri- or offenses. <em>United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">VACATE AND REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b819-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
