Aguilar-Rocha argues that the district court improperly enhanced his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on its erroneous determination that his prior Texas conviction of burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines. Aguilar-Rocha specifically contends that the district court erred because its conclusion that his prior state conviction was a crime of violence relied exclusively upon the characterization of his offense in the presentence report (PSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Aguilar-Rocha failed to object to the district court\u2019s characterization of his prior conviction as a crime of violence and did not challenge the imposition of the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Accordingly, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005). To obtain relief under the plain error standard, Aguilar Rocha must establish that (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). If these conditions are met, this court may exercise its discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">The record does not indicate that the Government produced a judgment of conviction or other adjudicative records at sentencing to establish that Aguilar-Rocha\u2019s prior state court conviction warranted a 16-level enhancement. Moreover, there is no evidence that the district court reviewed evidence other than the PSR in determining that Aguilar-Rocha\u2019s prior offense was a crime of violence. Thus, the record suggests that the district court relied solely upon the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offense to justify its imposition of an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2. The court\u2019s exclusive dependence on the PSR constitutes an error that was clear and obvious. <em>See U.S. v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">However, Aguilar-Rocha has failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights. When determining whether a state conviction constitutes a specifically enumerated offense for purpose an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2, we use a \u201ccommon sense approach.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 274-75 (5th Cir.2005). Under this approach, we determine whether a violation of the underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>state statute constitutes an enumerated offense based upon how the enumerated offense is understood in its \u201c\u2018ordinary, contemporary, [and] common\u2019 meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275. If it is determined that the statute of conviction provides for various means of commission, the court may \u201cexamine certain adjudicative records to determine whether the prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339-40 (5th Cir.2006). These records include the charging document, the plea agreement, the plea colloquy transcript, and any explicit findings made by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. <em>Id. </em>at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In the instant case, the parties agree that Aguilar-Rocha was convicted of burglary of a habitation under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a). This statute states that a person commits the offense of burglary of a habitation if, without the effective consent of the owner, the person \u201centers a habitation, or a building (or any portion of a building) not then open to the public, with intent to commit a felony, theft, or an assault.\u201d Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). The statute alternatively provides that a person commits burglary of a habitation if he \u201centers a building or habitation and commits or attempts to commit a felony, theft, or an assault\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 30.02(a)(3). This court has determined that a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) is equivalent to the enumerated offense \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). However, this court has held that a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) is not the equivalent of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d because the provision does not require entry with an intent to commit a crime. <em>See United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The Government on appeal has provided copies of the indictment and judgment of conviction related to Aguilar-Rocha\u2019s prior state conviction. We construe the Government\u2019s submission of these adjudicative records as a motion to supplement the appellate record with these documents. Aguilar-Rocha has not objected to the inclusion of the documents, nor is there any dispute about the documents\u2019 authenticity. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record with copies of the indictment and judgment of conviction from Aguilar-Rocha\u2019s prior Texas state conviction of burglary of a habitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The indictment specifically tracks the language of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), and the judgment confirms that Aguilar-Rocha pleaded guilty to the offense as it was alleged in the indictment. Thus, the record establishes that Aguilar-Rocha pleaded guilty to the offense of burglary of a habitation, which is the equivalent of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d at 456-57. Aguilar-Rocha therefore has failed to demonstrate that but for the district court\u2019s error in relying solely on the PSR, the district court would not have imposed an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Accordingly, he has not demonstrated reversible plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b817-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
