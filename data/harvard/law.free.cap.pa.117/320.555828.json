Hill and John H. Townsend, and on the same day the cause was put at issue by the entry of the plea of nil debet, sec. reg. The record showed that on December 8, 1887, the death of John H. Townsend was suggested and that N. E. Townsend and Frank Townsend, his administrators, were substituted as defendants. It did not appear by whose authority or direction this suggestion and substitution were made. On March 9, 1885, the cause was reached for trial, but was continued, \u201c because substitution of defendants erroneously made.\u201d No further order appears respecting the suggestion and substitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-14\">At the trial on December 9, 1885, before James B. Neale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>P. J., the plaintiff proved, a note made by John W. Hill and John H. Townsend, dated August 11, 1883, payable April 1, 1884, for $125, given as the result of an amicable arbitration between Hill and Truby. Townsend was a surety on the note. The defendants then introduced evidence to show that on June 2, 1883, the farm of John W. Hill was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale and purchased by Simon Truby, and on July 16, 1883, the latter served a notice upon the former to surrender possession. Soon afterwards it was agreed that Mr. Hill should remain upon the. premises as the tenant of Mr. Truby until April 1, 1884. Differences arising, they were submitted to arbitrators who made an award on August 11, 1883, by which Mr. Hill was to pay to Mr. Truby $125 on or before April 1, 1884, to be secured by approved security; and was to deliver up full possession of all the fields except the house, barn and out-buildings, on or before August 15,1883, reserving the right of taking off the then existing crop, as to which Mr. Truby released all his interest. There was no provision with reference to taxes, either in the submission or in the award. The note in suit was given in compliance with this award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">John W.

Townsend, whose administrators are parties defendant in this suit, was but bail on the note, and had no connection with the contract or dealings between Simon Truby and John W. Hill. The offer is objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">By the court: We will admit the evidence for the present, and give you an exception. We do it with some reluctance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">Q. Had you any conversation with Mr. Truby concerning the payment of taxes?

But when it is shown, as now proposed, that this was in pursuance of another arrangement hot with the plaintiff and this witness, but between another party not shown to be the agent of the plaintiff, we think that the proposition is not covered by the provisions of the act of 1878, and that as the plaintiff himself would be excluded as a witness because of the death of a co-defendant, there is such an inequality now presented by the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that we think it would be improper to admit the testimony under the proposition and therefore the objection is sustained.3'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">After the charge of the court there was a verdict for the plaintiff for \u00a7137.87, and judgment being entered thereon, the-defendants took this writ to No. 56, specifying that the court erred: 1, 2, 3. In sustaining the objections to plaintiff\u2019s offers.1 8 3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The administrators of Townsend took an appeal and certiorari to No. 225, assigning as error their substitution as defendants without notice or process.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-7\"><em>Mr. David Barclay </em>(with him <em>Mr. M. F. Leason), </em>for the plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-8\">1. The defendant Hill was a competent witness to prove by way of payment and sehoff, that, as the tenant of the plaintiff, he had been compelled to pay taxes which the plaintiff ought to have paid: \u00a7 1, act of May 25, 1878, P. L. 153; Ash v. Guie, 97 Pa. 501; Jackson v. Payne, 18 W. N. 385. Truby was alive to contradict Hill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-9\">2. The record must show notice to the administrators before a proper substitution can be made, and the cause proceeded in to trial against them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-10\"><em>Mr. Joseph Buffington </em>(with him <em>Mr. John F. </em>Whitworth), for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-11\">1. Prior to the act of 1878, it is clear that Hill would not have been competent to prove the offer, and not even a face to face transaction with Truby. That act does not remove his incompetency, even though the administrators had not been substituted: Brady v. Reed, 87 Pa. 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-12\">2. At all events, the offer was irrelevant. The taxes had been assessed and were due prior to the sheriff\u2019s sale; Truby did not buy the land charged with them; Hill owed and was bound to pay them: Smeich v. York County, 68 Pa. 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-13\">3. If there was any irregularity in the substitution, by whomsoever made, it was such as to prejudice no one. One of the administrators appeared hi person on the trial. The appearance by attorneys was general. The jury was sworn generally. The case is not unlike Dingman v. Amsink, 77 Pa. 114, where the administrators were substituted on mere motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"A-N\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>HILL V. TRULY.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Ag1\">Mr. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We think it was error to reject the offer to prove by Hill what occurred between Mm and the tax collector, on the ground of incompetency of the witness. We held in Ash v. Guie, 97 Pa. 493, that the spirit of the act of 1878 embraced the survivor of two or more who jointly contracted, and therefore the plaintiff could testify as to matters occurring between Mmself and the survivmg defendants. But we did not mean to decide that he could not testify as to relevant matters wMch occurred between Mmself and strangers. There would be no propriety \u2022\u25a0and no necessity for such a decision. Such matters were not \u2022excluded by any interpretation of the act of 1869, except that which declared the general incompetency of the witness. 'That incompetency was removed by the act of 1878 in the ease of the survivor of joint obligors. It is true the act in terms qualified the witness to testify to matters having occurred between the surviving party and the adverse party on the record, but that was because it was that class of matters which were specially excluded by the construction wMch had been .-.given to the act of 1869, and that was the evil intended to be more particularly remedied by the act of 1878. But there \u25a0could be no good reason for excluding other matters occurring between the witness and other persons who were not parties. Such exclusion had been, previously to the act of 1878, merely the result of a personal incompetency to testify at all; but when that general incompetency was removed, matters which were otherwise unobjectionable could not be excluded on that account. We are clearly of opinion, therefore, that other and Mdifferent matters between the witness and a stranger, might be proved as well by a surviving obligor or his adversary, providing only that they were relevant to the issue trying.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">But wMle it was -error to reject the proffered testimony on the ground of the incompetency of the witness, we are of opinion that it should have been rejected on the ground of irrelevancy. The offer does not disclose facts enough to make the testimony admissible. Hill was the owner of the farm up to the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale which was June 2, 1883. He remained on the farm by agreement with Truby made on August 11,1883. The offer was to prove payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of taxes assessed upon the farm, upon the theory that they were taxes which Truby was legally bound to pay. But that very essential fact does not appear in the offer and we cannot infer it. It is not possible to infer that taxes had been assessed against the farm as Truby\u2019s property after June and before August, 1883. Naturally, if the question must be determined by inference we would be obliged to infer that the taxes had been assessed against Hill as owner, and therefore that he and not Truby was legally liable for their payment. But it is not necessary to put the matter upon that ground. The offer must itself disclose all the facts which are necessary to establish its admissibility and this is not done by the offer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">There was therefore no error in excluding the testimony and hence there is nothing to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">TOWNSEND\u2019S APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AqF\">Mr. Justice Gbeen :</author>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The record shows a substitution of administrators, but it. does not show that it was done at their instance or by their authority, or by any one acting for them. They claim that it was done without their knowledge or consent and without any notice to them, and that in consequence thereof they were ignorant of the trial and the cause was tried and verdict rendered against them in their absence. Of course this is contrary to the plainest legal principles and the error must-be corrected. When the record does not show that the substitution was done at the instance of the administrators or their counsel, it should show that they were brought on the record by some sort of notice or process. A scire facias or a rule to show cause with proper proof of service would be suitable and are the usual methods employed. In the present case the record does not inform us how the representatives of the deceased party were brought in, nor that they were brought in at all, and in that respect it is fatally defective and cannot sustain the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Judgment reversed as to Townsend\u2019s administrators and order of substitution stricken off.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
