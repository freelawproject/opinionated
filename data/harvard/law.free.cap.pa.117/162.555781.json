Garber was tenant of the farm of his-father, Andrew Garber, the defendant, and became indebted, to his father and to others, among whom were Philip Doersom and Philip Rudy. In October, 1884, Andrew Garber issued an attachment under the act of March 16,1869, against Jonas-B. Garber, and soon afterwards a second and like attachment. On November 11, 1884, Philip Doersom and Philip Rudy, to whom Jonas B. Garber had that day confessed judgments, issued executions upon which a levy was made upon the property described in the declaration in this case. Then Andrew Garber presented his petition (sufficiently set out in the opinion) praying that the sheriff be restrained from selling said property on said writs of execution, the same being bound by the lien of his attachments. The averments of this petition were supported by a deposition of the petitioner; but, on hearing, the court having found that the property under execution had not been included in the inventories made in the service of said attachments and, therefore, not being bound by the lien thereof, were liable to sale upon said executions, decreed that said petition be dismissed. At the sheriff\u2019s sale which followed, Doersom and Rudy became the joint purchasers of the property claimed. Subsequently, Jonas B. Garber having gone, Andrew Garber took possession of the farm and on demand refused to deliver to Doersom and Rudy the property in dispute, and this suit was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">In the plaintiffs\u2019 case in clfief, Philip Doersom having testified to the joint purchase of the property, value, etc., the defendant asked on cross-examination :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">Q.

Where half the crop is reserved simply by way of rent, the landlord is entitled to half the straw.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">The way going crop to which a tenant is entitled where the-rent is a money rent, upon his leaving demised premises, includes the straw as well as the grain, which he may remove- and dispose of as he pleases, being subject only to the terms-of his contract, and not to any supposed custom of the country on that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">[If you find from the evidence that Jonas Garber was farming this farm on the shares or halves simply, and to get half of' all the crops, hay, straw and fodder, and was not restricted from removing his share, then the sheriff would have a right to levy on his share thereof, and to sell it, and the purchaser would have a right to remove them and maintain this action;] 7 unless you find that Jonas Garber fraudulently withheld the share of the crops from Andrew Garber to which he was legally entitled; if he did so fraudulently withhold the landlord\u2019s share of crops, the landlord, Andrew Garber, may recover in this action the value of such crops so withheld. If the value of the crops withheld is greater than the value of the crops here claimed, the verdict should be for the defendant. If the crops so fraudulently retained were not worth as much as the amount of the crops here claimed, your verdict should be for the plaintiffs for the difference between the value of the crops so fraudulently retained and the value of the crops here claimed with interest from the time of conversion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for 1551.58; and, judgment being entered, the defendant took this writ assigning for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">1-4.

Both Doersom and Rudy testified that they were jointly interested in the property. The question of interest was material, and it was essential to know just what the arrangement or agreement was that created the interest or interests of plaintiffs, and of this defendant was entitled to inquire on \u25a0cross-examination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-5\">2. The plaintiffs bought Jonas B. Garber\u2019s interest, and \u25a0claimed under him; his declarations, made while in possession of the farm and in control of the property in dispute, were self-disserving, went to show the character of his possession and property in the articles, and, being of the res gestae, were admissible, not as hearsay, but as original evidence: 1 Greenl. Ev. 18 ed. 228, 141, \u00a7\u00a7 141, 143; Sheaffer v. Eakman, 56 Pa. 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">3. The offer of the plaintiffs, which was allowed, as complained of in the fifth assignment, was the judgment and the whole record of the former proceeding; and under this offer the opinion of the court was read, which was gross error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">4. In the narr. the plaintiffs claimed simply the one half interest in the corn and fodder. Defendant claimed as sole owner thereof, so that there was no denial on part of the plaintiffs but that the defendant was a tenant in common as to the corn and fodder, and as to these articles the action did not lie: 1 Chit. Pl. 155*; Walworth v. Abel, 52 Pa. 370; Trout v. Kennedy, 47 Pa. 387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">5. Moreover, Jonas having abandoned the farm, which is undisputed, the defendant was justified in taking possession of the farm and crops, and there could be no recovery from him: McKinney v.

It was immaterial what arrangements the plaintiffs had as to the ownership of the property, and no plea in abatement was filed questioning the capacity in which they sued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-11\">2. The defendant had himself alleged title in Jonas B. Garber, and attempted to sell the property as his under legal process. He is estopped from impeaching that title: Callander v. Robinson, 96 Pa. 454.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-12\">3. Even if Jonas B. Garber was not farming for a money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>rent, but for a share of the crops raised, the title to the crops until divided was in him, and the purchasers, standing in his shoes, had his rights: Rinehart v. Olwine, 5 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 157; Ream v. Harnish, 45 Pa. 376.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A-c\">Me. Chief Justice Goedon :</author>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">A brief statement of the facts of this case will, we apprehend, very clearly demonstrate that the plaintiff in error has no good reason to complain of the rulings and judgment in the court below. The plaintiffs below had two several judgments against Jonas B. Garber; on these judgments executions were issued, and levies made on the property in controversy as the property of the said Jonas B. Garber, November 11, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Preceding these executions, October 23, 1884, Andrew Garber issued an attachment under the act of 1869, against this same defendant, who is his son, and also a second writ of the same land on the 8th of November following. Neither of these attachments were successful, for the reason that the sheriff failed to make a lawful levy on the property intended to be attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Then, after the plaintiffs\u2019 levy, November 20, 1884, the defendant, having discovered the mistake by which his writs were rendered nugatory, made application to the court below to restrain the sheriff from selling the property under the plaintiffs\u2019 executions. On this application of Garber, accompanied by his affidavit, the court granted a rule to show cause, which was, after hearing, January 17,1885, finally discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The petition and affidavit set forth, inter alia, as follows: \u201c That since said writs of attachment came into the hands of the said sheriff and he attached all the goods and chattels of the said defendant, but failed to make an inventory which contained all the goods, chattels, etc., of said defendant, by reason of the said defendant refusing to give said sheriff any items or names of articles of personal property belonging to him, though requested so to do by the said sheriff, the said defendant confessed two judgments, one in favor 'of Philip Doersom, and the other in favor of Philip Rudy. Executions -were duly issued, Nov. 11,1884, on said two judgments against J onas B. Garber, and the said sheriff of said county, by virtue of said executions or fi. fas., on November 11, 1884, levied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the following of the defendant\u2019s personal property, viz.: 3 iron hog-troughs, 1 fat hog, about 30 tons of hay, about 18 tons of straw, a lot of lumber, planks, boards, scantlings and bill stuff, 9 bundles of No. 2 shingles, 2 sets of tobacco ladders, one half interest in 14 acres of corn and fodder, also rope and 3 pulleys, one chopping machine and scalding trough; and advertised by hand-bills to sell said last mentioned personal property levied on under said fi. fas., at public sale, on Wednesday, November 29, 1884. Your petitioner further represents that all of said property levied on under said fi. fas. was defendant\u2019s personal property, and in said county at the time of issuing said writs of attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">It thus appears that this attempted interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 writs was founded on the fact that the goods seized belonged exclusively to Jonas B. Garber, and with what conscience the defendant now sets up the contrary in order to defeat the execution of these same writs, ought to be to an honest man inconceivable. At all events, justice will permit nothing of the kind; one cannot be permitted to play fast and loose with the efforts of creditors to secure their just dues: Strouse\u2019s Exr. v. Becker, 38 Pa. 190; Huey\u2019s App., 29 Pa. 219. Therefore, for all purposes of this case, the goods in question belonged, until sold on the plaintiffs\u2019 writs, to Jonas B. Garber, and; as against the sheriff\u2019s vendees, the defendant unlawfully detained them; hence the action of trover was well brought to recover their value. It is true, were we to-assume the defendant\u2019s hypothesis, that Garber and his son were joint owners of the goods, the former being in the lawful possession thereof, trespass or trover would not lie for the son\u2019s share unless it were proved that there had been an actual destruction of them by Garber : Trout v. Kennedy, 47 Pa. 387. But as the hypothesis assumed is not admissible, neither does the doctrine founded on it apply. As it was not of the least-consequence by what arrangement the plaintiffs, as between themselves, claimed to hold the property in suit, so the court properly 'disallowed the questions covered by the first and second assignments. \u2022 It was enough for all purposes of the case that the goods were sold on their writs, and bid in by one of them for both.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The declarations of Jonas B. Garber were not admissible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>establish a parol lease between, himself and his father, or to prove its contents. Such declarations, made when he was in possession of the farm, might have been introduced to prove <em>how </em>he held, whether us tenant or proprietor: Sheaffer v. Eakman, 56 Pa. 144; but as the fact of his tenancy was not in dispute, the proposed evidence was admissible for no pui- . pose. That the records in the case of Doersom v. Garber were properly admitted is not doubtful, and if there were papers among them which ought not to have gone to the jury, they ought to have them specially objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
