On April 19,1882, a scire facias was issued upon said judgment and on June 10, 1882, judgment of revival was entered for $2,033.72. On May 24,1882, when there were no judgment or mortgage liens against her, Mrs. Holcomb joined her husband in the execution of a mortgage upon the land devised in said will to Frank R. Fleek for $1,140, which mortgage was recorded on May 25, 1882, and subsequently assigned to Helen M. Fleek, the use plaintiff herein.

We have that opinion and now instruct you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">The law is that a mortgage, if it be the first lien against particular real estate, is not disturbed by any sheriff\u2019s sale that may take place upon subsequently entered judgments, but the lien is preserved against the property in the hands of a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale; and if that was all there was in this case, then it might be that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">[But there was a judgment entered against Charles T. Holcomb prior to the execution and recording of this mortgage to Fleek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">The devisees under the will of Bailey Fullerton, being Mary Holcomb and C. T. Holcomb, her husband, C. T. Holcomb took a joint estate, and if Mary Holcomb had lived, and was now living, I should be inclined, and would certainly charge you that the mortgagee under that mortgage would be entitled to recover her mortgage against Mary Holcomb. But Mary Holcomb having died prior to the entry of this judgment of revival, the whole property descended to and became vested in her surviving husband; and hence, on the 8th of June, 1882, there was a judgment against Charles T. Holcomb, which was a prior lien to the mortgage, although Charles T. Holcomb, the mortgagor, executed this mortgage. Although owning an undivided one half by virtue of his tenancy as a joint tenant, upon the death of his wife the whole property became vested in him and he was the mortgagor, but there being an open judgment entered against him prior to that time, the title he acquired by the death of his wife inured to the benefit of his judgment creditors. The sheriff\u2019s sale divested the lien of the mortgage given in 1882; hence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover against Fred. Zillhaver, the vendee of the sheriff\u2019s vendee of this real estate, and your verdict will he for the defendant.] 4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel requests the court to charge the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyJ\">1.

That the mortgage executed by Mary Holcomb and Charles T.

L. </em>Blackmarr, for the plaintiff in error: '</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-14\">1. The husband and wife under the will of Bailey Fullerton took by entireties and not by moieties, as held in McCurdy v. Canning, 64 Pa. 40, and Holcomb v. Savings Bank, 92 Pa. 343, the latter case construing the same clause in this will. Therefore on May 24, 1882, Mary Holcomb was seized of the whole of the tract described in the mortgage. Having this estate she had the right to make and the mortgagee the right to take', her mortgage: Hagenbuch v. Phillips, 112 Pa. 289; Cridge v. Hare, 98 Pa. 564; Jamison v. Jamison, 3 Wh. 471; and the' mortgage passed' to the mortgagee the title and the right of possession of Mrs. Holcomb, to hold till payment should be made: Tryon v. Munson, 77 Pa. 262.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-15\">2. When Mrs. Holcomb executed this mortgage there were' no other mortgages or judgment liens against her estate.. Then this Mortgage became a first mortgage, and would not be divested by a sale on any prior judgment or lien. After the execution of that mortgage all that remained to Mrs. Hoi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>comb was tbe equity of redemption; and at her death the only estate that Charles T. Holcomb had, as her survivor, was that equity of redemption, and that equity is all that is vested in the defendant through the sheriff\u2019s deed and the deed from the church. Any different construction would be a denial of the wife\u2019s power to convey her own estate in the mode pointed out in the statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\"><em>Mr. H. J. Humes (Mr. JR. Q. </em>Frey, <em>Mr. Myron Parlz Davis </em>and <em>Mr. Thomas Hocldy </em>with him), for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-6\">1. The lien of judgments in Pennsylvania has been extended beyond the limits of the common law. A judgment is held to be a lien on every kind of equitable interest in land\u2014 even an inchoate interest \u2014 and on every right vested in the debtor at the time of the judgment: Carneghan v. Brewster, 2 Pa. 41; Carkhuff v. Anderson, 3 Binn. 5; Morrow v. Brenizer, 2 R. 185; Thomas v. Simpson, 3 Pa. 60; De Haas v. Bunn, 2 Pa. 335.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-7\">2. When the judgment of the People\u2019s Savings Bank was entered against Charles T. Holcomb, he was seized of an entirety in the land subject to but one contingency which never happened, to wit, the survival of his wife. Though there were two natural persons, there was but one person in law, and on the death of his wife the husband took no new estate, but had the estate as before, not under or through his wife, but by virtue of the original devise: French v. Mehan, 56 Pa. 286; Diver v. Diver, 56 Pa. 106; McCurdy v. Canning, 64 Pa. 39; Stuckey v. Keefe, 26 Pa. 397; Martin v. Jackson, 27 Pa. 504.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-8\">3. Prior to the act of April 11, 1848, the husband could convey or mortgage such an estate during his life: Fairchild v. Chastelleux, 1 Pa. 181; Barber v. Harris, 15 Wend. 615; Jackson v. McConnell, 19 Wend. 175; McCurdy v. Canning, 64 Pa. 39; and that act simply protected the wife\u2019s right to the separate enjoyment and use of her property during her life.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AAgV\">Mr. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The estate of Mary Holcomb in the premises in question was not different from the estate of her husband Charles T. Holcomb in the same premises. They were husband and wife; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the devise was to them jointly and they held the land devised by entireties, and not by moieties. The estate of each is exceptional and peculiar. It dies with the owner, and only the survivor has the absolute and unqualified fee simple title in the whole. The estate of the other, though extending to the whole during life, absolutely ceases at death. It was that kind of estate which was bound by the lien of the mortgage given by Mary Holcomb; and it was the same kind of estate which was bound by the lien of' the judgment against her husband. As against the wife, the mortgage was undoubtedly the first and indeed only lien. As against the husband, the judgment was the first lien and the mortgage the second, simply because the judgment was obtained before the mortgage was given. Had the wife survived, the mortgage would certainly have had precedence to the exclusion of the judgment, . because the estate bound by the lien of the judgment was defeasible by the death of the husband before the wife. For the same reason if the husband survived the wife, the estate of the latter was divested, and the mortgage only became operative against the husband because he had joined in its execution. But as to him it was not the first lien, he having become subject to a judgment at a time anterior to the giving of the mortgage. These views determine the case, and</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
