W. Pattebson, J., charged the jury, inter alia: That the plaintiff was entitled to recover possession of the property in dispute as tenant by the curtesy unless he was affected by the provisions of \u00a7 5 of the act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430; and, as it was not shown that the husband had not maintained his wife, but it was claimed that he had deserted her for more than one year prior to her death, the burden of proof was on the defendant that the desertion was wilful and malicious; and proceeded: \u2014 That should be made, however, to appear clearly by the proof. You cannot find it from mere supposition; you must find it from the evidence in the case. The court can see little or no proof of a wilful and malicious desertion. And that question, we think, we must leave to you. It lies on the defendant to make that clearly appear by evidence. If it does not so appear to your satisfaction, then you must find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the husband. The whole case turns on that question. It is not contended that the plaintiff did not provide for his wife; and on that ground the defendant has no defence to this action. Did he wilfully and maliciously desert her? Has the defendant made that out to your satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of the court? We have said that it appears to the court that the testimony does not come up to the requirements of the law. [And hence, we feel justified in instructing you to find your verdict in favor of the plaintiff, with six cents damages and six cents cost.] 5 \u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">The verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff, and judgment being entered, the defendant then took this writ, assigning for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">1-3.

Trust Co., 108 Pa. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-4\">1. The record of the desertion case was admissible: Bauder\u2019s App., 115 Pa. 480; Bunnell v. Smith, 8 W.

The rejection of the offer to show the acts and declarations of the wife at the time her husband left her, deprived us of the most natural and satisfactory proof, possible, of the absence of any consent on the part of the wife to her husband\u2019s departure \u2014 the natural expression of her emotion at the very time. The admission of such evidence is justified on the ground of necessity and as part of the res gestss: Lichtenwallner v. Laubach, 105 Pa. 366; Cattison v. Cattison, 22 Pa. 275; Gilchrist v. Bale, 8 W. 355; Thompkins v. Saltmarsh, 14 S. &amp; R. 275; 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 102; Elkins v. McKean, 79 Pa. 493.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">3. Under the act of 1855, a forfeiture results from either of' two acts; a wilful neglect or refusal for one year or upwards,, previous to her death, to provide for his wife, or, a wilful and malicious desertion of his wife for the same period: Little\u2019s.

Nothing less will justify a husband\u2019s separation from his wife without her consent, than that which would be for him a sufficient ground of divorce: Eshbach v.

There is nothing in the record offered to indicate why the court ordered Mr. Hahn to pay his wife $7 per week; and, as the desertion must be affirmatively proven in this case, it cannot be inferred from the record in another proceeding which does not show it to have been established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>2.

The burden of proving that the husband\u2019s desertion was without cause, wilful and malicious, was upon the party-charging it; the law presumes innocence: Little\u2019s Est., <em>7 </em>Phila. 495; Charleton\u2019s Est., 3 W. N. 305.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AHU\">Mr. Cheep Justice Gordon:</author>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">This is an action brought by a husband to enforce his right of curtesy in the estate of his deceased wife. The defence was that he had forfeited this right in consequence pf a violation of the conditions of the act of May 5, 1855, by his wilful and malicious desertion of his wife for the period of one year or more previous to her death. That there was such a desertion seems, from the evidence, very clear. The court however ruled that proof of wilful desertion was not enough, but that on the defence lay the burden of establishing that it was also in fact malicious, and, conceiving that there was a failure in this part of the defendant\u2019s case, directed a verdict for the plaintiff. That this was a mistake we have no doubt. If malice is not to be inferred from the commission of an unlawful act, its proof would often be difficult, and sometimes impossible. It would certainly be an astounding proposition that, where one man had unlawfully and deliberately killed another, malice was not to be presumed from the act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">But, as to the question in hand, we are not without authority in point. In Ingersoll v. Ingersoll, 49 Pa. 249, in defining wilful and malicious desertion in cases of divorce, we held that \u201c the guilty intent is manifested when, without cause or consent, either party withdraws from the residence of the other.\u201d The same doctrine was also held in McGlurg\u2019s App., 66 Pa. 366. It follows, that the case should have been given to the jury with instruction that if they found there was a wilful desertion by the plaintiff of his wife, Rebecca, for the period of one year or more immediately preceding her death, malice must be presumed; and that the burden of proof was thereby thrown on him to show that he had reasonable and lawful cause for such desertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>So, it was also error not to admit the proceedings in the Quarter Sessions which resulted in an order on him for her maintenance. They were pertinent to show, not only the fact of desertion but that he had failed to voluntarily provide for her support. The order was the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in a case between the same parties, and embracing the same subject of complaint; hence, was relevant to the controversy in hand. Nor can we see why the offer covered by the third assignment was not admissible. jGlearly, her declarations and manifestations of sorrow, immediately after his abandonment of her, were properly introduced as part of the res gestae; and if authority is wanting, on a point so obvious, it may be found in Cattison v. Cattison, 22 Pa. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The judgment is reversed and a new venire ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
