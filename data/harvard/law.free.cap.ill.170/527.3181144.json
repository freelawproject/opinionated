Same\u2014when instruction in murder trial is erroneous and prejudicial. An instruction in a murder trial that if the defendant went where the deceased was and provoked a difficulty, into which he voluntarily entered and in which he killed the deceased, then the act could not be justified as being in self-defense, is erroneous and prejudicial, where the defendant was a village marshal called to the scene to quell a disturbance made by the deceased.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b527-13\" pgmap=\"527\">5. Same\u2014officer, when resisted, is not required to decline combat to justify slaying his assailant. An officer whose duty it is to preserve the peace is not required to decline combat, when resisted in his duties, and to put himself out of danger, before he will be justified in slaying his assailant, as an officer so acting will be protected, though a different rule would prevail as to private individuals.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b527-14\" pgmap=\"527\">6.

A. K. Vickers, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-4\" pgmap=\"528\">At the November term, 1896, of the circuit court of Massac county plaintiff in error was convicted of the crime of murder and sentenced to the penitentiary for sixteen years. From this conviction he has sued out this writ of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\" pgmap=\"528(326) 529(211)\">It appears from the record that plaintiff in error was marshal of the village of Brooklyn, in Massac county. On the second day of May, the day the shooting took place, plaintiff in error borrowed a gun, and had been shooting unmuzzled dogs by order of the mayor. Milas Bradshaw, known among his companions as \u201cLightning Bug,\u201d was a negro, unmarried, but who lived with a woman called Jennie Williams. In the afternoon of said second day of May, Bradshaw and four others, colored persons, two or three being women, were engaged in playing cards in the room of one Ora Shaw, which was back of a restaurant. An alley led from the street, on the east side of the restaurant, to the rear. A saloon adjoined the restaurant on the west, and in the rear of the two buildings was a yard, in which the shooting took place. About five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, while the plaintiff in error was in the vicinity of the saloon, a disturbance occurred between Bradshaw and his mistress, Jennie Williams, and \u201ca woman came screaming in the alley,\u201d as Solomon Grace, one of the People\u2019s witnesses, swears, \u201cand told him (defendant) that Lightning Bug was whipping his wife, and Lynn (defendant) went back there.\u201d This testimony is undisputed. It further appears that when the plaintiff in error reached the rear of the buildings Bradshaw and the other negroes were in the yard. Ora Shaw, another of the People\u2019s witnesses, swears: \u201cJennie and Bug were in a kind of a dispute, and Mr. Lynn (the marshal) walks up and demands peace; says: \u2018Bug, that is a good woman; you ought not to beat her in that way, and be all the time fussing and fighting and whipping her; if you, don\u2019t quit I will run you in,\u2019\u2014says, \u2018If you do it any more I will run you in,\u201d\u2019 The woman, Jennie Williams, was there. Her eyes were blackened from a blow, but it is denied that Bradshaw did it that day. It appears that Bradshaw became angry, got up and commenced cursing the marshal, and started into the saloon, saying, as Solomon Grace swears, \u201cNo God damn white son of a bitch\u201d could do anything with him; that he would go home and get his gun. He passed out of the front door of the saloon. In a few minutes he returned to the back.yard where the marshal was and again\"commenced swearing at him. Grace says Bradshaw was standing in front of Ora Shaw\u2019s door,-about five or six feet from the building, when he got there; that Lynn was standing in the middle of the yard, about thirty feet from Bradshaw; that he had his gun up to his shoulder and was kind of backing- and going sideways, and told Bradshaw not to make a step towards him or he would kill him; that he had the gun up to his shoulder when witness first saw him, then brought it down in his hand and then raised it up again; that Lightning Bug said, \u201cYou damn white son of a bitch, you are afraid to shoot;\u201d that Lynn then brought up the gun and shot him.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\" pgmap=\"529(194) 530(50)\">The defendant\u2019s testimony as to what occurred at this time was as follows: \u201cThe next I saw of him was when he turned the corner of the alley on me there\u2014the alley I had gone up. I commenced backing back around this way and he come up the little walk, and against I got back as far as midway of the house he was- midways too, and commenced from there coming on to me, straight towards me, and I kept backing and begging him not to come on to me,\u2014telling him to stay off\u2014I did not want to hurt him. He comes very slow, like he wanted to slip on me. I raised and lowered my gun three times to take aim. The last time I took aim and he' got out and was standing between them beer kegs. I told him, I says, \u2018Bug, I don\u2019t want to kill you, but if you come any closer to me I will have to do it.\u2019 He just took his left hand and pulled his bosom open. He had on a jumper. They carry ties in them. He jerked his jumper open. He says, \u2018You God damn white-livered son-of-a-bitch, I will make you do it!\u2019 and he made another step right at me and I shot him. I certainly was afraid he would hurt me. I knew if he got much closer to me he would be able to make a leap for my gun.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">Defendant\u2019s brother, Boyd Lynn, testified: \u201cI heard Phil halloo, \u2018Stand back; don\u2019t come on me,\u2019 and then I went out there. He was going onto Phil. Phil was back against the fence. This Jennie was grabbing at the gun and Lightning Bug was going'\u201eonto him. There was about eight feet between them. I stepped past and touched Jennie on the shoulder. I says, \u2018Here, Jennie, stop this; get away; he will not hurt him,\u2019 and she turned around to talk to Lightning Bug. I says, \u2018He will not shoot him if he stays off of him.\u2019 He told her he did not want to hurt him. He says, \u2018If he will stay off of me I will not hurt him.\u2019 Phil stepped out to this path. The weeds were high\u2014 almost waist high. There is a path that leads across the yard. He backed into that and was making\" for this door, and Lightning Bug comes along this walk, walking sideways and bemeaning Phil all the time. He called him as hard names as he could. Phil was holding him off, telling him to stop; stay off of him; he did not want to hurt him. Just before tlie shooting Bug was walking\u2014just keeping even with him. Phil was in this path, and says, \u2018Stay off and I will not shoot you.\u2019 He kept on telling\" him, so when he got to this door, in front of Ora Shaw\u2019s room, there was an open space there between some beer kegs in the path that led to the privy, and there is where he made at him the last time, and Phil says, \u2018Don\u2019t come on me, \u2019 and he throwed his bosom back that way and run his right hand back behind him and says, \u2018God damn whitelivered son of a bitch, I will make you shoot; you have not got nerve enough to shoot,\u2019 and he made, I guess, two steps towards Phil. Then the shooting took place. Lightning Bug\" was considered a dangerous man.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\" pgmap=\"531\">Several witnesses were called, among them two policemen from Paducah, who testified that the deceased was a dangerous man. /r</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">Under the assignments of error plaintiff in error urges five grounds for reversal: First, the court erred in refusing to admit proper evidence on the part of the defendant; second, in giving improper instructions on the part of the People and also in refusing proper instructions on the part of defendant; third, in overruling motion for a new trial; fourth, in rendering judgment on the verdict; fifth, the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">James C.

The statute expressly defines the duties of a marshal, and, being the law of the State, it was unnecessary to prove his duties. But he had the right to have the jury properly instructed on the question. Twenty-two instructions were given on the part of the People, and four are particularly objected to as erroneous and misleading. The t\u00e9nth instruction is in the following language:</p> <p id=\"b534-7\" pgmap=\"534(89) 535(35)\">\u201cAnd in this case, if you find, from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant went into the back yard behind the saloon of John Workman, of Brooklyn, to where the deceased was, and provoked and brought on a difficulty with the said Milas Bradshaw, in which he, the defendant, voluntarily entered, and in which he used a deadly weapon and killed the said Milas Bradshaw, then you are instructed that the defendant could not excuse said killing on the ground that it was necessary for Mm to do said killing in order to prevent the said Milas Bradshaw from committing a great bodily injury upon him or taking his life, and you should find the defendant guilty.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b535-5\" pgmap=\"535\">The defendant was an officer whose duty it was to preserve the peace. The official character of the officer is pertinent in determining the legal relations and duties of the person killed and the person killing, with respect to each other, and thus characterizing their acts at the time of the killing. In this instruction the jury are told that if the defendant went where the deceased was and provoked and brought on a difficulty with him, into which he voluntarily entered,\u2014regardless of the fact that he was an officer called to preserve the peace and that the difficulty was broug'ht on by his attempt to keep the peace,\u2014they must find defendant guilty. This instruction was erroneous and misleading in view of the testimony in the case. He did not go there voluntarily, but was called to quell a disturbance between the deceased and the woman, Jennie Williams. He was a peace officer, and under the law could arrest without warrant for a criminal offense committed in his presence, or if a criminal offense had in fact been committed and he had reasonable ground for believing that the person to be arrested had committed it. In the case of Shanley v. Wells, 71 Ill. 78, which was an action of trespass for assault and battery and false imprisonment by the defendant, a policeman of the city of Chicago, this court said (p. 82): \u201cIn Main v. McCarty, 15 Ill. 441, it was held that the power to arrest without warrant for breaches of the peace or threats to break it, exists in cases where the act was not done or threat uttered in the presence of the officer, when the charg'e is freshly made and the officer was required to make the arrest.\u201d See, also, Cahill v. People, 106 Ill. 621.</p> <p id=\"b535-6\" pgmap=\"535\">The fifteenth instruction given on behalf of the People is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b536-4\" pgmap=\"536\">\u201cA person when assailed is required to decline the combat in good faith, if by so doing he could put himself out of danger, and use all means that would be adopted by reasonable men to procure their safety under similar circumstances; and he has no right to take the life of another unless it is actually or apx&gt;arently necessary, and the necessity, real or apparent, must be so pressing as to exclude all other reasonable means of safety before he will be justified in slaying his assailant.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b536-5\" pgmap=\"536(287) 537(75)\">Here the jury are told that \u201ca person when assailed is required to decline the combat in good faith, if by so doing\" he could put himself out of danger, and use all means\u201d to procure his safety. Is it true that an officer whose duty it is to preserve the peace is required to decline a combat when resisted, and should put himself out of danger? Clearly not. The court should give the law as applicable to the facts in evidence in the case. An officer lawfully in the discharge of his duty would be protected where a different rule would prevail as to private individuals. In 1 Russell on Crimes (sec. 3, p. 447, Sharswood\u2019s 4th Am. ed.) the author says: \u201cMinisters of justice, as baliffs, constables, watchmen, etc., while in the execution of their offices are under the peculiar protection of the law,\u2014a protection founded in wisdom and equity and every principle of justice, for without it the public tranquillity can not possibly be maintained or private property secured, nor, in the ordinary course of things, will offenders be amenable to justice. For these reasons the killing\" of officers so employed has been deemed murder of malice prepense, as being\" an outrage willfullyLcommitted iu defiance of the justice of the kingdom.\u201d The same author, on page 547, says: \u201cAmongst the acts done by permission of the law, for the advancement of public justice, may be reckoned those of the officer who, in the execution of his office, either in a civil or criminal case, kills a person who assaults or resists him. The resistance will justify the officer in proceeding to the last extremity. So that, in all cases, whether civil or criminal, where persons have a right to arrest and imprison, and, using the proper means for that purpose, are resisted, in so doing they may repel force with force and need not give back, and if the party making resistance is unavoidably killed in the struggle this homicide is justifiable.\u201d The instruction was clearly erroneous in view of all the facts in the case, and was prejudicial to the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b537-5\" pgmap=\"537\">The sixth instruction on the part of the People is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b537-6\" pgmap=\"537\">\u201cAnd although the jury may believe, from the evidence, that the opprobrious epithets were used by the deceased to the defendant, yet if the jury further believe, from the evidence, that the defendant immediately revenged himself by the use of a dangerous and deadly weapon in a manner likely to cause the death of the said Milas Bradshaw, and did thereby cause his death as charged, then the defendant is guilty of murder, and the jury should so find by their verdict.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b537-7\" pgmap=\"537\">The last clause of this instruction was condemned in Panton v. People, 114 Ill. 505, where this court said (p. 509): \u201cThe last clause of the second above instruction was wrong in saying, \u2018and you should find him guilty of murder.\u2019 Under the indictment for murder a defendant may be found guilty of manslaughter, and the jury here should have been left free to find in that respect, without being directed by the court how they should find. The court should have said no more in such respect in the instruction than that the jury should find the defendant guilty.\u201d The direction by the court in the case at bar was erroneous for the same reason.</p> <p id=\"b537-8\" pgmap=\"537\">.For error in giving the tenth, fifteenth and sixteenth instructions on the part of the People the judgment of the circuit court will be reversed and the cause remanded for another trial.</p> <p id=\"b537-9\" pgmap=\"537\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
