Mortgages\u2014statute does not prescribe form for affidavit extending lien of chattel mortgage. Section 4 of the Mortgage act, as amended in 1891, (Laws of 1891, p. 172,) which provides for the extension of the lien of a chattel mortgage by an affidavit reciting certain facts, does not prescribe the manner of authenticating the affidavit.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-11\" pgmap=\"442\">2.

Same\u2014effect where recorder fails to copy inscription on notary\u2019s seal. Where the venue of an affidavit can be ascertained only by an inspection of the notary\u2019s seal attached thereto, the fact that the recorder does not copy the inscription but merely makes a scrawl, writing in the word \u201cseal,\u201d does not vitiate the affidavit, as the recorder should copy the inscription.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b443-4\" pgmap=\"443\">j.

Appellee claims under a chattel mortgage executed by the Schoenfields to him, which mortgage was sought to be extended, under the statute, by filing an affidavit for record in the recorder\u2019s office of Morgan county. The circuit court gave judgment for appellee that he have the property, and for costs. Appellant appealed to the Appellate Court, where the judgment was affirmed, and he has further appealed to this court.</p> <p id=\"b444-2\" pgmap=\"444\">The only point discussed by appellant before the Appellate Court, and the only one made in this court, is, that the alleged affidavit was insufficient to extend the mortgage ; that it really was no affidavit, and that it was error to admit the same in evidence, and error also to admit parol evidence to aid and supplement the said affidavit.</p> <p id=\"b444-3\" pgmap=\"444\">The venue and commencement of the affidavit are as follows:</p> <p id=\"b444-4\" pgmap=\"444\">\u201cState of Illinois, )</p> <p id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444\">County of Illinois, j ss\"</p> <p id=\"b444-6\" pgmap=\"444\">\u201cWe, Henry L.

Such chattel mortgage is hereby extended by agreement of Henry Schoenfield and Bessie Schoenfield, mortgagors, and Henry L. Williams, attorney for the said Ferdinand Stern, mortgagee, to the twenty-third day of March, A. D. 1897.</p> <p id=\"b444-11\" pgmap=\"444\">Henry L.

Anthony, Notary Public, Cook county, Illinois.\u201d On the back of the affidavit was a duly executed certificate of acknowledgment of the justice of the peace in Morgan county that the Schoenfields appeared before him and acknowledged that they signed said affidavit; but, of course, such an acknowledgment cannot take the place of the required oath.</p> <p id=\"b445-3\" pgmap=\"445\">Objections are made that the instrument in question is not an affidavit, but only a statement; that after admitting the parol evidence it is, at most, only a sworn statement; that it has no venue, and that there is no signature or date to the jurat referring to the Schoenfields; that the statute requires an affidavit in order to extend a chattel mortgage; that the affidavit must be perfect and complete, and must so appear of record, to be valid against creditors, and that parol evidence is inadmissible to aid or sustain the same.</p> <p id=\"b445-4\" pgmap=\"445\">The statute allowing the lien of a chattel mortgage to be extended requires the filing for record of an affidavit setting forth particularly certain facts enumerated in the statute. (See Rev. Stat. chap. 95, sec. 4, as amended in 1891.) It nowhere directs or specifies anything in regard to the formal parts or authentication of the affidavit. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary defines an affidavit to be \u201ca statement or declaration reduced to writing, and sworn or affirmed to before some officer who has authority to administer an oath.\u201d And in 1 Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice (309) it is said: \u201cAn affidavit is a voluntary ex parte statement, formally reduced to writing and sworn to or affirmed before some officer authorized by law to take it.\u201d This court said in Harris v. Lester, 80 Ill. 307: \u201cAn affidavit is simply a declaration on. oath, in writing, sworn to by a party before some person who has authority under the law to administer oaths.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b445-7\" pgmap=\"445(103) 446(117)\">As to the venue, we held in Hertig v. People, 159 Ill. 237, that a notary public \u201cbeing a public officer, it will be presumed he administered the oath in the county within which he was authorized to administer oaths, for the presumption is that he has done his duty.\u201d The venue of this instrument is: \u201cState of Illinois, County of Illinois,\u2014ss.\u201d As there is no such county in this State, we must look at the seal of the notary to ascertain for which county he was authorized to administer oaths. The seal bears the following inscription: \u201cCharles E. Anthony, Notary Pub-lie, Cook County, Illinois.\u201d The statute (chap. 99, sec. 7,) provides that \u201ceach notary public shall * * * provide himself with a proper official seal, * * * upon which shall be engraved words descriptive of his office, and the name of the place or county in which he resides.\u201d It will be presumed that the notary has complied with the statute, and that the inscription on his seal speaks the truth. We think the venue sufficiently appears. Indeed, if the instrument had been filed in Cook county it would have been good without a seal, as the courts will take judicial notice of the notaries in their county. Schaefer v. Kienzel, 123 Ill. 430.</p> <p id=\"b446-6\" pgmap=\"446\">Appellant insists that the inscriptions on notaries\u2019 seals never appear of record, but that the recorder simply makes a scrawl, and writes in it the word \u201cSeal.\u201d There is no merit in this contention. The recorder should copy such inscriptions on the seals.</p> <p id=\"b446-7\" pgmap=\"446\">It is next contended that the instrument is inoperative as an affidavit because the jurat as to the oaths of the Schoenfields is not signed, or authenticated in any way. But the jurat of the officer is not the affidavit, nor, strictly speaking, any part of it. It is simply evidence of the fact that the affidavit was properly sworn to by the affiant. (Williams v. Stevenson, 103 Ind. 243; 1 Ency. of PI. &amp; Pr. 316, and notes.) It has been frequently held, both in this State and elsewhere, that affidavits for attachment are not void because the clerk or officer failed to affix his signature to the jurat. Kruse v. Wilson, 79 Ill. 233.</p> <p id=\"b446-11\" pgmap=\"446(97) 447(131)\">But it is contended that there is a difference between attachment cases and the case at bar, because in attachment cases the affidavit is merely the initial proceeding of the cause and may be amended at the trial, while in this case the statute requires that the record should disclose all the facts, and no parol evidence can add to that record, for creditors are not bound to look beyond the record. We are referred to Coleman v. Goodnow, 36 Minn. 9, Stetson &amp; Post Hill Co. v. McDonald, 5 Wash. 496, and Hill v. Alliance Building Co. 6 S. Dak. 160, as supporting appellant\u2019s contention. In the first two cases the court held the affidavit defective for want of a seal to the jurat, and the third case was based on the other two, in that case one jurat having the seal of the notary but no signature, and the other being by a foreign notary, with no seal or certificate of authority attached. We have held that a seal is not required by the statute to be affixed to a jurat to be used within the county of the officer. The statute provides nothing as to the jurat or mode of authenticating the affidavit. (Schaefer v. Kienzel, supra.) The decisions referred to, therefore, can hardly be regarded as authority on this point.</p> <p id=\"b447-3\" pgmap=\"447\">We are also referred to McDermaid v. Russell, 41 Ill. 489, where the court said: \u201cThe affidavit of non-residence does not appear to have been sworn to before any officer. For that omission it was no affidavit, and gave no authority to the court to enter an order for publication.\u201d No copy of the affidavit is given, and nothing appears to show how it appeared that no oath was administered. See, also, Bickerdike v. Allen, 157 Ill. 95.</p> <p id=\"b447-4\" pgmap=\"447(159) 448(125)\">The affidavit in this case begins with the names of the parties, and then follows, \u201cbeing duly sworn, each for himself and herself, says.\u201d They are referred to as \u201caffiants\u201d in the body of the instrument a number of times, and the same concludes, \u201cand affiants make this affidavit,\u201d and their names are signed. The oath of the attorney, Williams, is properly authenticated, but not so the oaths of the Schoenfields. The record in the recorder\u2019s office then disclosed, or at least contained the statement, that all the parties were sworn, but failed to show the evidence of the officer who administered the oaths to two of them. Is this such an affidavit as the statute contemplates, or is it void as to creditors because the evidence that the oath was actually and duly administered was not preserved by a proper certificate of the officer attached? We have carefully examined all the cases in this court on the subject of defective affidavits to which we have been referred, and find that, as a general rule, they were held insufficient on account of defects in matters of substance, which could not be aided by parol. In McDermaid v. Russell, supra, it does not appear that there was any evidence that the affidavit was sworn to. But the case is different here. We think enough appears in the record, no objection being made to the substance of the affidavit, to show a substantial compliance with the statute, upon proof being made of the truth of the statement in the affidavit that the affiants were duly sworn,\u2014that is, that the statements contained in the instrument were made on their respective oaths.</p> <p id=\"b448-3\" pgmap=\"448\">We are of the opinion that the jurat or certificate of the officer administering the oath is not a necessary part of the affidavit, but that it may be shown aliunde that the statements contained in the instrument were in truth and in fact made as they purported to be,\u2014on oath duly administered by an officer duly authorized. The statute prescribes no form for the affidavit, and makes no provision as to the form in which the evidence of the oath shall be preserved or made to ajjpear, but only requires that an affidavit shall be filed, etc. Of course, common prudence would dictate that a properly executed jurat, or certificate of the officer showing the oath, should be attached; but when attached it is not conclusive, but may be shown to be false, and if shown to be false, and that no oath was in fact administered, the instrument would not be an affidavit.</p> <p id=\"b448-4\" pgmap=\"448\">We are of the opinion that the record was sufficient to give notice to third persons that the alleged affidavit was made on oath, and that parol evidence was admissible on the trial to prove that the oath was actually taken. The judgment of the Appellate Court will therefore be affix med. Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b448-6\" pgmap=\"448\">Wilkin and Cartwright, JJ., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
