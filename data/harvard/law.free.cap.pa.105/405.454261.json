It also appeared that the said Stockberger bought malt, 'gave notes and checks, and made deposits in banks, on account of-the business, in his own name. ; \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">\u25a0\u25a0 The plaintiff asked the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">(3.)

The plaintiff having testified that she transferred the saloon license to her husband, and permitted him to carry on that business and the brewery business in his name, because it looked better in his name than hers, and it being shown that malt was purchased in his name, shipped to him, and used in a.business carried on in his name, all with the knowledge and acquiescence of the plaintiff, that, as a matter of law the beer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>levied on is the property of the husband, and the verdict so far as it is concerned must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">Answer. \u2014 Negatived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">(5.)

The point is well worthy of consideration, but I say to you that she could not thus lose the title of those. articles. ...... The fact that</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-9\">the husband had the license in his own name, had his name on the sign, gave notes and checks, and bought malt in his own name, is some evidence tending to show, if it was with her consent and knowledge,, that it was his business and not hers. But it does not follow for .that reason only that it ceased to be her business. She might be the owner of the business and yet he might do all this in his own name with the understanding that the same was so done simply as a matter of convenience, and if so done such fact .alone would not, destroy her right to the proceeds of the business.\u201d . , ...........</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\">Verdict for the, plaintiff and judgment thereon; whereupon the defendant took this writ, assigning for error the answers to his points and that part of the general charge above set out.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-11\"><em>Edward </em>Harvey, (with whom was <em>W.

The purpose of the Act of 1848 is to protect a married woman in the enjoyment of her separate property. It is not necessary that her property be exclusively in her own possession. It may be in the concurrent possession of herself and her husband, without causing a forfeiture of her right, of property.
