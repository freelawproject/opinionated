Martinez, in fee, who immediately went into possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\">Two days after the date of said deed to Martinez, Catharine Johnson, then 72 years of age, married the said Martinez, who was 28 years of age. They lived together until her death in August, 1863, after which Martinez continued in possession of the premises in question, by his tenants, until his death on March 16; 1881. By his will, dated February 6, 1877, proved March 25, 1881, he devised his residuary real estate, including the premises in question, to the plaintiffs. This constituted the plaintiff's title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-6\">Soon after the death of said Martinez, Mrs. Anne E. Bowl-by notified the tenants of the property in dispute to pay rent to her, claiming as owner and devisee for life under the will of her father, Charles Johnson, which they did, and \u2022 she admitted possession at the date the writ issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-7\">The defendants presented the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-8\">1. The three testamentary papers left by Charles Johnson, are to be read together, and they create and vest: (a.) A life estate in the. property in issue in Catharine Johnson, the testator\u2019s widow, <em>(b.) </em>After her death, a further life estate in their daughter Anne. (c.) And after Anne\u2019s death an absolute estate in the children of Anne. Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-11\">2. There is no contingency provided for in the said testamentary writings, to lawfully authorize the said Catharine Johnson to convey more than her life estate in the property, or to dispose of the property in a testamentary manner to any one not an heir of the said Charles Johnson; and the plaintiffs failing to show title in themselves, the verdict should be for the defendants. Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-12\">The judge directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs, subject to the question of law reserved, \u201cwhether the testamentary papers of Charles Johnson vested a fee in Catharine Johnson in the premises which are the subject of this action.\u201d Verdict accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-13\">The court afterwards, in an opinion filed, entered judgment for plaintiffs on the verdict and reserved question, whereupon the defendants took this writ of error, assigning for error the refusal of their points, as above, and the said judgment for plaintiffs on the reserved question.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-14\"><em>Amos Briggs </em>\u00edind <em>F. F. </em>Brightly, for the plaintiffs in error:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqD\">Having regard to the whole scheme of Charles Johnson\u2019s will, as' disclosed by the three testamentary papers, can it be doubted, that the testator intended that his estate should be ultimately distributed as specified in his third and last testamentary paper ? He commences the second paper with these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>words: \u201c That in willing all my estate, real and personal, in favor of my wife Catharine, I do it, with the fullest confidence, that she will carry <em>my </em>intentions as to <em>ultimate distribution, </em>into effect.\u201d In the third paper he provides: \u201c The house I reside in and the two frame houses north-east corner of Lombard and Tenth streets, to the children of my daughter Anhe; being for her own rise for life, in trust so as not to be subject to the debts, contracts, or engagements of her husband.\u201d How can we reconcile this devise with the theory that Mrs. Johnson was seised as of the fee? How could the jiremises be for the use of the testator\u2019s daughter Anne for life, remainder to her children, if the fee had already been devised to Mrs. Johnson ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-8\">The language is such as to create a trust.

St., 386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-9\">It is argued that the conveyance to Martinez was a good execution of the power of sale vested in her by the will.

Loughlin </em>and <em>Samuel liobb,~) </em>for the defendants in error: \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0A\">We submit, that the will of Charles Johnson is wholly contained in what he styles his \u201c last will and testament,\u201d and the second and third papers were not intended by him as codicils to his will, but (like letters often found in wills) as mere explanations to his family and suggestions to his wife. But if, for any reason, they should be held to be codicils, then the judgment was right, because the will of Charles Johnson gave a fee simple in the realty to his devisee, and the precatory words in what is called the first codicil, and the mere suggestions in what is called the second codicil, but which the testator called a \u201cmemorandum (for her),\u201d did not convert the devisee into a trustee; and because, if the devisee was a trustee, she was a trustee with full authority to sell the whole or any part of the estate, should she deem it necessary so to do, and which power she afterwards duly exercised, and after the lapse of so long a time, the exercise of this discretion cannot even be inquired into, much less impeached; and there is no evidence here on the subject.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b195-11\">Chief Justice Mercur,</author>\n<p id=\"AFM\">delivered the opinion of the court, February 18th, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The writing executed first is a full and complete will. It was signed, sealed and declared by the testator as and for his last will and testament, in the presence of two persons who subscribed their names as witnesses thereto. He therein gave and bequeathed unto his wife all his estate, real, personal and mixed, for her sole use and benefit, with full authority to sell and dispose of the whole, or any portion thereof, should she at any time deem it necessary to do so. This authority to sell was mere surplusage. It did not enlarge the power which the previous devise in fee simple gave her, nor did it indicate any intention to restrict her in the exercise of that power. Neither of the subsequent writings professes to be either a part of his will or a codicil thereto. The first of them is addressed \u201cto whom it may concern.\u201d Its purpose appears to have been to inform all persons who might feel in-, terested in the disposition he had made of his property, why he had devised his whole estate to his wife. It was by reason of his great confidence in her, who had toiled and labored with him through life, that he deemed it prudent to give her the management and disposition of their joint savings.</p>\n<p id=\"A5O\">While he does therein express his confidence that she will carry out his intentions in the ultimate distribution of the estate so fat as in her opinion his children and grandchildren respectively, may prove worthy of her attention, yet he makes no disposition of any part of his estate, nor does he intimate any intention to restrain her free will. It is \u201c her opinion,\u201d not his, which is to guide and control her disposal of the property. He does not even indicate which children or grandchildren he thinks worthy of his consideration. That thought is not suggested. On the contrary, the suggestion relates to those only that, in her opinion, \u201cmay prove worthy of her attention.\u201d After thus stating some of his reasons for having devised his property to his wife, he proceeds in another writing to address her. It is styled \u201cmemorandum (for her).\u201d He does not therein profess to make any devise himself. It contains recommendations and advice to her as to what he would be pleased to have her do, and as to the land in question his recommendation is more specific than in the previous writing. Not a word therein, however, indicates an intention to qualify or change the absolute devise which he had made to her, nor to take from her the right to use, enjoy and dispose of the property as her own. The fact that the will does not contain W'ords of inheritance did not prevent the whole estate of the testator in the property devised from passing to his wife, under section 9 of the Act of 8th April, 1833, as it does not appear, by devise over or by words of limitation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>otherwise, in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">It is contended, howevei-, that these two writings should be considered a part of the will, and that the language therein is sufficient to create a trust. Conceding that at one time such language in a will would have been held sufficient in England to create a trust, yet the rule in Pennsylvania is now clearly settled otherwise. Words in a will merely expressive of desire, recommendation and confidence, are not sufficient to convert a devise or bequest into a trust. Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 Harris, 268; Jauretche <em>v. </em>Proctor, 12 Wright, 466; Second Reformed Presbyterian Church <em>v. </em>Disbrow, 2 P. F. Smith, 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Standing by themselves alone, expressions of a desire or wish of the testator as to a direct disposition of his property may constitute a valid devise or bequest thereof; yet the rule is different when such expressions are used after an absolute disposition has been made. Having made an unqualified devise of his property, no precatory words to his devisee can defeat the estate previously devised. Burt <em>v. </em>Herron, 16 P. F. Smith, 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">While the language contained in these -two writings must control the effect to be given to them, yet there is another fact significant of the intent of the testator. Hence, notwithstanding all the writings bear the same date, and are on one sheet of paper, yet a blank page intervenes between the first, or will, and the two subsequent writings. In thus separating them the testator manifestly further intended to indicate that they constituted no portion of his will. Still further, the first he executed with the usual formalities of a will, under seal, and in the presence of subscribing witnesses, while neither of the subsequent writings has any seal nor any witness. The fact that all the writings were probated at the same time cannot change the character previously stamped upon them. Probating does not create a will. It cannot make a will out of a writing which was not a will before. Therefore, notwithstanding the able argument of the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, we think the learned Judge committed no error in directing the jury to render a verdict for the plaintiffs below, nor in entering judgment thereon in their favor on the point of law reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
